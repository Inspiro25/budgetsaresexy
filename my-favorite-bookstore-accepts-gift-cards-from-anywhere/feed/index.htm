					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome that your favorite local bookstore will do this.  The only thing that I have done that is similar to this is using a restaurant gift card at a different restaurant, but its under the same parent company.  

If your bookstore does a $1 for $1 exchange, then it really is a great way to get rid of those unwanted gift cards you&#039;ll never use!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a doctor in a rural area and treat many patients without insurance or they have crappy Obama Care with a high deductible and have difficulty paying their bills.  We often barter with them to wipe out their bill.  I barter for cleaning services, food out of their gardens, etc.  The gift card payment option is one I never considered and will definitely start to use.  Thanks for the great idea which will help me to help my patients.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I assume he means it&#039;s potentially dangerous to the merchant. Potential risks at every level really.

You could give the physical gift card to the store but still use the numbers yourself. There are apps that even allow for you to enter the numbers in your phone and make an egift card.]]></description>

Ahh you mean the *employee* can steal it? But how would that be much different than accepting cash and doing the same thing?]]></description>

The owner just uses &#039;em they told me! And will also sometimes give them to their employees as nice gifts, which is cool :)]]></description>

You think they&#039;d take things outside of gift cards? I guess if you&#039;re a web designer or offer other services you can exchange I can see that, but like if you brought in a loaf of fresh bread or something circa 1800&#039;s? :)]]></description>
