					<description><![CDATA[I knew about the forms of dandelions since I was a kid. The confusing thing for me was that in my mother language we have a handful of different names for it and different people called the same thing differently. Looked it up and there are even more names for them than I know. Some of them (word to word translation warning): sheepheadgrass, friendgrass, frogflower, childchaingrass, liontooth, chickenflower, blindinghen, mudflower, dogmilk. As a kid this was pretty confusing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading a book that collected stories about the Great Depression from people who lived through it, and some talked about gathering dandelions to subsist on when there was no other food. So much we take for granted! (Also, I believe I was an adult as well when I figured out that those two were the same plant, ha ha! It also sadly took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out that the man in the &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; song was the kids&#039; dad...ha ha!)]]></description>
