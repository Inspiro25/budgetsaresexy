I&#039;m currently living out of a leased car I never returned.(nor os up to date with registration) Now I&#039;m trying to figure this all out while dealing with anxiety. Any bit of money I get goes to gas, food and the occasional roof for ahowers and decent sleep (if I sleep at all). I&#039;m trying to build a tea business but like any business it takes money to make money. Today&#039;s economy is even harder because there are way more people on the poverty spectrum than before. Any book advice or advice on getting out of a vehicle that no longer in compliance?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just came across your appearance on George Gammon &#039;s web site and decided to look up your bio. Your life as a young person struck me because of the hardships you experienced and how much that paralleled my childhood.  I grew up on the west side of Chicago in what was essentially a white ghetto during World War 2...mice in the house and rats trying to get inside.  Single mother lucky to have a job during the WW2.  We were poor, dirt poor.  But that existence and memory gave me the drive to never  be in that financial position again.  Fast forward... spent time in the military(4 years), one year of collage and married the love of my life.  Got a job as as computer programmer during the 1960&#039;s; that was back when programming was done at almost internal machine level.  Learned to save money and invest in the stock market.  Now am a retired multi-millionaire.  Both of my children now are also &quot;MM&#039;s&quot;.   It was interesting to read your story as it brought back so many of my childhood memories.  Thanks and hope you have a happy life.   Denny
BTW,  saw on your web site you have an article on covered call options.  Think I may look into options to have some fun.]]></description>

No lie, I logged into Discover today and I saw my FICO score touched a perfect 850 this month, up sharply from 841 last month and generally in the 830s before that.

O.o

I somehow remembered this comment about whether it&#039;s possible lol. Apparently yeah. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll dip back down in a month or two tho. 

My Vantage score actually dropped from 825 to 823 in the same month too, so who knows what the algorithms are up to. I didn&#039;t change anything notable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you lyn for taking the time out to share your story. I&#039;ve been going through a rather large awakening I guess you could say and it&#039;s motivating to see that someone can pull it off. Thank you]]></description>

Holy crap man, that is hustling! Were you able to meet people and friends to later crash at their places at times? Or at least take showers and stuff? (Or did you use campus stuff for all that?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this and can relate to it on a level. I lived in my car during my freshman year of university. I didn&#039;t have much financial aid, didn&#039;t want to take out more loans than necessary, and my parents didn&#039;t help out with my education costs. 

Thinking back to the experience, it really was the uncertainty of things that caused me stress rather than the lack of comforts. I was determined to get through it. I studied and did good in my classes and worked at a job and saved. Things are better (and clearer) now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Inspiring post.  Much wisdom.  Thanks.
I grew up dirt poor.  Now I&#039;m doing very well.  This is a great country for those who are willing to learn and work hard.  I hope to impart some wisdom to my children without spoiling them.  I&#039;m not sure how well I&#039;m doing that.  But my daughter did dress as Warren Buffett for Halloween, so maybe I&#039;m doing something right!]]></description>
