Even more so now with the pandemic, delivery services for all types of goods are on the rise. Tipping etiquette is very important to make sure gig workers are making enough money in their jobs.  Thanks Chris! Have a great week!]]></description>

I&#039;ve had people tip me five dollars for a huge order over 100 dollars on cost, and then received a ten dollar tip for one pizza. Guess which one gets priority on my delivery route the next time? ;-)]]></description>

Yeah, that seems to be what the anti-tippers are saying. Hope they all choke to death on their pizza and get impoverished to the point where they too have to live the lives they look down upon to make ends meet.]]></description>

At the place I work at, drivers make minimum wage in store and much less when routed on delivery. Newer drivers only make about 5.35 per hour when routed, so yes...those tips are very important for making up for that. Drivers are also basically the grunts of the pizza business. We wash all the dishes, we do half the prep, we even help make and cut the pizzas. We get no meal breaks and just taking a second to use the bathroom between deliveries is a hassle. Delivering food all day long while starving on a full bladder and sweating under a hat forced by regulation is really kind of like torture. Add to the fact that we have to drive under some pretty horrid traffic and weather conditions at times, customers can&#039;t be bothered to have the common decency to put porch lights on at night and some of us get jumped and robbed while trying to bring your pie to you, damned straight, you should TIP. Not to mention we use our personal vehicles and gas, and have to pay twice as much for maintenance as the average commuter. 

I would also like to point out that we drivers are NOT your personal banks. We don&#039;t (and never should) carry more than twenty dollars in bills on us. Don&#039;t hand me a fifty or hundred dollar bill for a twenty dollar order and then act surprised that I don&#039;t have the money on me to break it. I drive MY car, not a freaking armored bank. I&#039;m not going to carry hundreds of dollars on me at any given time. Deposit your big bills or break them down at banks. Stop treating drivers like your freaking change machines and then getting offended that we don&#039;t have a freaking safe in our cars. Idiots.]]></description>

Clean your stinking house when your driver is standing in the door!
 Have your money ready. 
Hang up the phone.
Stop being a selfish low life cheapskate

Again, We are NOT the ones who take the address down..the person that answers the phone is the one who writes the address down. If you live in a private home DON&#039;t put Business . It&#039;s not as easy as you think, people are human and not perfect. if your house is hard to find (which i assume it is or the driver would find it) then the driver should call you OH Wait:  you have a phone to order the pizza but you dont answer it if called back, that happens on every delivery where a house is out in the boondocks with about 20 mail boxes together and NO HOUSE NUMBER.]]></description>
