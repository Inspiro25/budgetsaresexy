					<description><![CDATA[Glad you all liked!  It&#039;s something I continuously need to work on a lot too - sometimes I&#039;m better than others, but I def. have to remind myself a lot to just DO IT like Nike ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - I agree when we&#039;re talking about stuff that affects the general public. Products and services are a whooooole different ballgame in my eyes - esp when it comes to customer service. But for personal finances, done is usually better ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this post! I can definitely relate to people needing to just get things started than sitting there and having a need to get everything perfect. I get the same, &quot;which card should I pay off first?&quot; question and I give a similar answer as you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this post, J.  I just saved it in my favorites and printed it for reference.  I&#039;m very guilty of this.  Sometimes the task is just so overwhelming that I can sit around all day and think and analyze how to attack it....but don&#039;t actually attack it.....ugh.  I&#039;m a real perfectionist and it does genuinely slow me down.  I&#039;m going to be repeating the words &quot;Done is better than perfect&quot; over and over again!  (And in my head, I need to also remind myself that my &quot;done&quot; is still really freakin good, so I shouldn&#039;t be worried anyways!)  I need to work on this big time and I just really appreciate this post about it!  Good timing, too, as I just got a huge &quot;side job&quot; thrown at me that&#039;s very overwhelming but also going to be very good $ for our little family.  Thanks, J$!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more!  I&#039;ve been running into this problem with group projects and club projects at school....everyone wants everything to be so perfect that we never end up getting anything done.  We&#039;re getting better at just pushing forward, but it&#039;s been a rough road.  SO  if the only thing that&#039;s holding you back is your own perfectionism...JUST DO IT.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great in theory, except with Facebook it&#039;s &quot;Done is better than perfect, and you better just deal with it.&quot; Whereas, with Google, it&#039;s &quot;Done is better than perfect, and we can always fix it based on user input and beta tests.&quot;

It really stresses the importance of a beta test/&quot;market research&quot; of some kind. Facebook likes to roll things out to the general population when they&#039;re still very broken—things that could have been fixed by a beta test. Having used Facebook since it was open to universities only, I definitely recall plenty of times that I was unable to upload pictures, unable to update my profile, unable to navigate the site, had chat stop working in the middle of a conversation, had my privacy settings reverted during an upgrade, etc. Google, 9 times out of 10, is going to offer users the option to try a new interface or product before it&#039;s rolled out to the general population. And have the option of reverting back if it doesn&#039;t work. Meanwhile, Google gets feedback from users and bloggers (as well as the new products/features getting hyped by actual users), and are able to fix the most GLARING issues before the general population ever sees it. It&#039;s a win-win. Power users, who can tolerate bugginess, get the bleeding edge—the general population gets a product that&#039;s more refined when it&#039;s ready for them.

I don&#039;t think anyone disagrees with the &quot;done is better than perfect&quot; mantra—it&#039;s a question of how that translates into attitude toward the customer. In my experience, companies whose &quot;done&quot; product results in a beta of some sort, produce much better products (Google and Blizzard are the two that pop to mind most readily). QA before the official launch is so important. There&#039;s a huge backlash every time Facebook pushes a buggy update, but it survives because people are addicted to it, and it&#039;s big enough to take the punches. If a startup were to behave like that...

What made Facebook big (simplicity, exclusivity, social connectivity) is wholly different from what keeps it big (pervasiveness, brand recognition, addiction). Yes, it&#039;s foolish to wait for perfection, since it will never come—but it&#039;s equally foolish to model a startup after the MO of an established company.

I guess what I&#039;m saying is, let someone, anyone, look at it before you unleash it on the general population—if they have considerable issues with the current iteration, fix them before anyone else sees it. Real usability problems are going to lead to bad reviews, and nothing more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@DebtnTaxes 

Unless it is a cash flow thing then you should absolutely invest in a self hosted solution.  It is SUPER easy and the sooner you do it the better.  The longer you wait the harder and more costly (in terms of opportunity cost) it will be.  

@John

Where do you work? What type of business?  

@Brent
100% Correct!

@Crystal
Well it is time to get on top of it!  As you start it just think about Evan...it will motivate you lol 

@Kris 
What are you currently working on? 

@Marianne
That&#039;s FANTASTIC! How are you starting your investment road?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;John &#124; Married (with Debt)&lt;/b&gt; - Yuck... maybe it&#039;s worth thinking about becoming competition for them? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - I like the &quot;naked for all to see&quot; part ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - You mean you&#039;re actually working hard on self-employment? Imagine that! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ Debt-Tips&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  You got that right.
@&lt;b&gt;Marianne&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  At least you&#039;re now officially an investor! Well done! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We put off investing for a long time because of a lack of understanding. Finally we decided it would be better to just jump in and learn from our mistakes than put it off any longer. Obviously, we have started with a small amount though... Don&#039;t want to screw up with a big amount! :)]]></description>
