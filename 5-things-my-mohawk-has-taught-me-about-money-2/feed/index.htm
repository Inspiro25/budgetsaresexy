					<description><![CDATA[You should put that article in your About section.  It really says quite a bit about your personality.  After reading your blog for so long I forget you have a mohawk, which is pretty rad and scary at the same time.

I guess it is a bad sign that I have decided that it is too much effort in the morning to use anything more than water and my hands to do my hair, all of about 5 seconds.]]></description>
