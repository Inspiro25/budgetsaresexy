Oh man, totally!!!

Do you have an end game in mind for the gig or even your own financial goals? Or just grinding it out and going with the flow until something diverts you?]]></description>

Ugh, that&#039;s never good...

If you want to shoot me a note on the side, I&#039;d be willing to offer some help/$$ to your friends if you think it would help??! We used to do it all the time with #DebtDrop and sometimes just the thought/little cash could make all the difference in their moods/motivation... for what it&#039;s worth! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Need more time. Work at a hedge fund and spend ~12 hours a day during the week and work a half day every Sunday. Have been doing this for a long time now. 

I really enjoy my work so the hours do not bother me at all. But I do wish I had more time to relax and maintain my relationships with family and old friends.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would gratefully say yes to any of the three, I&#039;m not picky! ;) I promise to make good use of whatever it is. 

We&#039;re probably doing pretty well all things considered. We are grateful for our family, we&#039;ve found good compromises on how to spend our time mostly, we&#039;re working hard to earn and save. I&#039;d like to have more time to earn more and then to stop earning but objectively we&#039;re doing well at the rate we&#039;re doing. I would love more time and money to help out friends trying to get out of serious (abusive) situations better, though. That&#039;s probably my biggest worry right now.]]></description>

That&#039;s always my argument too, would I actually be earning more over those 2 hours...]]></description>

You&#039;re very right about that! Any day can bring a whirlwind of change - for the better or the worse! Though I feel like you&#039;ve gotten way more than your fair share of the &quot;worse&quot; over your lifetime, so here&#039;s hoping things only get better for you :) I want that cup overflowing, baby!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need more time to make more money. I am currently working full time, momming, and taking two classes. That being said, I&#039;ll be done with the classes my Thanksgiving and it will qualify me for a little raise. (I&#039;m reading this after putting my son to bed and doing homework). I need to keep on keepin&#039; on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love that quote about money. Well I remember this poll going round &#038; I think I answered time. While I’d like more time, I want to swap that answer for love. I am not sure there is ever too much love!! Of course with any of these when your cup is full, give some away!

Life is so dynamic and subject to our interpretation in the moment, that I imagine the 1 in 5 who said they were good, probably were at that moment. But some guarantees about life are change &#038; seasons.]]></description>

Hahaha... I hear that brother..

But if there&#039;s one thing I know about you, it&#039;s that you never stop grinding!! 

Every year we talk and every year you&#039;re still at it chipping away that debt, man..

Super super proud of you, even though I know sometimes it doesn&#039;t feel like the needle&#039;s moving much...]]></description>
