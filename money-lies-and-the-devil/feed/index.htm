					<description><![CDATA[I disagree respectfully..you gotta think about the mind control money has on ppl.. money separates ppl , we shouldn’t look down on someone just because they don’t have wealth like you.. it’s causes jealousy, hate because everybody doesn’t have the talent like everybody else so they get treated differently that’s not what God sees as Love .. some people get money so that can have power over you.. you dnt need money to be happy just need it to pay bills that’s it.. a lot of homeless ppl because why ? MONEY !  It shouldn’t be like that .. some people die because they have no money to pay for health insurance smh.. of course you can do a lot of good with money but you gotta think about all the people it affect that don’t have it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woo! Look at all those agreeing with me! That&#039;s a nice feeling to have every now and then ;) Especially as I tend to be up to some borderline stuff lately, haha...

A few comments... Okay, a LOT of comments:

@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a good point actually, hadn&#039;t thought about their history with money - it very well could be influencing their thoughts w/ it all!

@&lt;b&gt;Miss Britt&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed :) Along with *appreciating* what we have vs. what we want too. Always good to stay away from the extremes.

@&lt;b&gt;Elle&lt;/b&gt; - Funny you should say that, actually, I just got a guest post sent to me on the &quot;Whys&quot; about money and it being a tool! Haha... greta minds :) I&#039;ll probably post it up within the next few weeks so stay tuned!

@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - I like that :)

@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah. Same with alcohol too! The more you get the more your personality/trueness shines ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Serena @ Get Your Life Straight&lt;/b&gt; - Thank YOU for the inspiration!! Not only with this post, but also with our recent talks behind the scenes :) It&#039;s always nice to reconnect with people you like and get motivated to keep rocking things out. You&#039;re a special one.

@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I dunno... maybe we need to be old to finally find that line? Haha... It seems to me most of those who are quite content all around have a few years on them :) But I say we keep on trying to figure it out sooner than later! And at least we know it&#039;s possible :)

@&lt;b&gt;Grayson @ Debt Roundup&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! That&#039;s true actually - the world DOES reward us with money! Never thought of it that way before.

@&lt;b&gt;Manette @ Barbara Friedberg Personal Finance&lt;/b&gt; - Good refresher :) And reminds me again to not love money TOO much as I tend to get carried away on tha path too, haha... all in moderation!

@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, indeed good sir. Indeed.

@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;Except I always saw discrimination, and felt like the people that had money always wanted to keep the people without money down. :(&quot; Yup! Same here... And I&#039;m also raised Catholic and still attend religiously (no pun intended). Though it seems that some perishes are better at this kinda of stuff than others. The one I was raised in always seemed to look down on others and make you feel like crap, while the one I&#039;m at now still preaches good morals/etc/etc, but they do so in a more positive tone. Which helps us WANT to be better people :) Either way though, there&#039;s nothing wrong with wanting more money, haha...

@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed. It&#039;s always important to be happy with what you&#039;ve got, whether you want more or not :)

@&lt;b&gt;becca&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! Though some compitition/goal-striving is always good of course :) Just gotta keep things from getting out of hand!

@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - Funny you should mention that. I literally had a line about how it&#039;s similar to gun stuff but didn&#039;t want to get politics involved here, especially as I&#039;m not sure which side I strongly believe in anyways, haha... but there&#039;s def. a correlation there! :) And cool about Atlas Shrugged - I didn&#039;t know that.

@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice... And I like that mentality too (and saying it out loud even!) during job reviews - that&#039;s awesome. And really helps set the tone of the convo too I&#039;m sure. Good one.

@&lt;b&gt;Skint inthe City&lt;/b&gt; -  YES!!!! And you better get better about it! ;) I return 95% of my stuff (a trick is throwing it into your trunk w/ receipt so you&#039;ll always have it with you the next time you happen to get to the store and/or remember), with the other 5% being those I still want to try and use later on the off chance it becomes a &quot;favorite&quot; of mine... Especially with styles I&#039;d normally not wear but trying to expand my horizons more... You&#039;ll find a nice middle ground soon, I&#039;m sure :)

@&lt;b&gt;Jon B&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you for saying so!

@&lt;b&gt;The Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - There you go!! That&#039;s important too! No shame in working your little patukis off to reap the rewards, go you!

@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Yuck!! It seems someone is riding on a real high horse there enjoying taking someone down... Not a very nice place to be - sucks for them! ;)

@&lt;b&gt;John S @ Frugal Rules&lt;/b&gt; - In two words: THANK YOU! :)

@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - True true, good point my friend... our brains DO tend to put things into a certain box once they hear that phrase, even if there&#039;s more too it that they choose not to listen to :)

@&lt;b&gt;K&lt;/b&gt; - Yep! And I don&#039;t think that constantly wanting more is necessarily that bad either - you have to have dreams/goals to always accomplish or you get complacent which leads to a mess of other problems as well. Both professinally and personally.

@&lt;b&gt;Leah&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yep! Like people bashing Mitt Romney just because of his success and wealth - it&#039;s not like he just woke up and had it all out of nowhere, he worked his a$$ off and is brilliant at business! Regardless of his politics or other traits he may or may not have. It&#039;s a lot easier to get jealour or write someone off to feel good about yourself than to admit it&#039;s okay or do-able. That changes the whole game.

@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - I liked the first part of your sentence, but not sure about the second part yet, haha... I guess it just depends on where that money&#039;s going and the intentions/etc - not that it&#039;s any of my business what other people do or don&#039;t do :)

@&lt;b&gt;KK @ Student Debt Survivor &lt;/b&gt; - Yup! You got it.

@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah!! Ain&#039;t that the truth!

@&lt;b&gt;Brian Fourman&lt;/b&gt; - Nice use of amoral - hadn&#039;t heard that one in a while :)

@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Yayyyy! No problem! It feels good for MYSELF to put this out there too, believe me... Like I&#039;m standing up for what I believe in after all this time of people trying to take others down. I&#039;m glad this resonated with you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, this is such a helpful article; well done. It took me close to 20 years to figure out what you just told us - that money is not evil and that it gives us opportunities to do so much good on this planet dominated by neo-liberalism (withdrawal of the state from the support of people who really need it). This realisation made me focus with such determination on becoming wealthy (which includes a very strong moral element to it) rather than simply being rich. Thanks for reminding us all that money is to sustain life and not only ours at that.]]></description>
