					<description><![CDATA[After years of being a 100% committed YNABer I really do see now that a dollar is a dollar is a dollar. The only money I treat differently now is that $1K I have at the end of the year from using the Money Saving Chart. And even then, I buy a treat up to £1K then the rest gets pumped back into the money pool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have this uncanny ability to stuff whatever I earn, regardless of how I earn it back into something that will benefit me in the long run, whether it be my TFSA, my mortgages, RRSPs. I&#039;ve even been told I suck the enjoyment out of things sometimes when me and my buddies grab a win at the casino and they want to go out but all I want to do is hoard the cash and call it a night haha.

Oh well, I&#039;ll thank myself for it in my 50&#039;s!]]></description>

Fun! I totally bet you could sell it well, so long as it&#039;s okay to have &quot;Nike&quot; in the domain like that (not sure what the rules are of branded names...).

For this domain I was just directly reached out to by a buyer who wanted it, but I know there&#039;s sites like Flippa.com and others that specifically focus on domains and websites... In fact, most hosting companies where you buy the domains from usually offer some sort of auction listings too - so I&#039;d probably look into that first.

As for the pricing, I&#039;m not sure how that&#039;s done domain-wise (I just did my best to get something that *excited me!*), however with full websites at least in our $$$ world here they tend to go for 2x-3x yearly profit. Sometimes more depending on the strength of the site, how old it is, how it&#039;s monetized, branding, potential, etc etc.

I bet you could dig up a lot of tips/info with a quick Google search :)]]></description>

Good one - forgot about those! 

I think I just have them auto. deposited back into my savings over here... Which is quite different than the other *extra* money I received, I wonder why?]]></description>

At least you got that tax hit out of the way! And better when you break even like that than having to pony it up which feels much worse :)]]></description>
