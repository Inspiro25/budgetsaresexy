					<description><![CDATA[In my opinion, the mall can be a money death trap! As soon as I walk in their (especially if I don&#039;t have a specific item in mind I need to buy), all of my money instantly leaves my wallet! This is the same as going to nice restaurants! It is nice to treat yourself to a fancy meal everyone in a while but doing it every weekend wastes a lot of money!

If you don&#039;t mind me sharing, there is an article that relates very well to your article about how to curb your enthusiasm to spend! I would love for you to check out about and share your opinions on it!

					<description><![CDATA[The auto lot is killing me right now!  My truck works but there is a shiny new one I fond online for 25% off the MSRP. Lots of bells and whistles .  I feel like Gollum - &#039;I wants it, I needs it&#039; but in reality I don&#039;t need it.  I may need a more dependable ride soon due to work issues, but not at the cost of that truck.  I go about my day working, then find myself looking at the website again.  It&#039;s like some evil villain is sending death rays to my budget through the web site.   Two things are helping me resist the power of advertising. One is I calculated it would take more than two years longer to pay off my house if I get that truck. The power of compounded interest on those extra payments really adds up.  The second is I know this is how I got into a bind before. Remembering my history ( 850k + in debt then to 183k in debt now) is a sobering thought  It wasn&#039;t all car purchases, but when you refinance a house to reduce monthly payments and roll that auto loan in to the total,  the trap is sprung.  The wife and I survived it once, and now keep a tighter leash on our dollars.  Time to distract myself with hard labor outside! Cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post mate. As you said Malls and restaurants are the real reason why I spend most of my money going there with family. I should consider taking my kids to new areas and should make them stay at places which are cheaper and at least it will make them realize the difference between home and other places. Nice way to save money as well as to understand the experience all aspects of life i must say. Keep writing more articles,

Have a good day!]]></description>
