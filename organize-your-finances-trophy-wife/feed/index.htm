					<description><![CDATA[Paula, I&#039;m in a similar situation...time to reassess division of labor!  :D

In all seriousness though, getting the financial docs/duckies in a row is a fabulous suggestion.  Every now and again, I pull hubby into the office &#038; make him look at spreadsheets &#038; account balances, but if I were to get hit by the proverbial (or literal) bus, dear hubby would be in a world of hurt in trying to figure things out.  Putting this doc/info gathering on the to-do list, thanks for the great suggestion!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kevin:  your comment made me LOL till diet coke came out my nose!  

Paula:  I&#039;m no relationship counselor,but your division of labor sounds dangerously out of whack.  I&#039;d be guilt-tripping him into big jewelry or piles of chocolate over this.

Danielle:  Thanks for the kind words.  I look forward to another post too.

Maria:  I think it must  be a triumph of the women&#039;s movement--we not only bring home the bacon and fry it up, we can now buy trophy wives to help eat it.  Way to go sister!

Jen:  you hit on a good point--getting organized helps us and our loved ones.  Now that I&#039;ve seen my words in print, I realized I should be just as prepared to get the trophy HUSBAND.  Kevin, if your girlfriend doesn&#039;t get on board with the program, I might be available in 30-40 years. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To answer you question Babs - not much. We have piles of stuff that even I can&#039;t find my way around. Big organising session is in order. I do remember though, having an operation about fifteen years ago and realising (two days before the event) that according to the legislation here if I were to die my part of the estate was not to go automatically to my husband. Had to phone my family and make them promise that in such a case they will keep certain amount and give back the rest - it is not a conversation to have with your mother, really.

I survived and we made a will immediately. Now I have term insurance and a lot of it - my love could have a trophy wife if something happens to me. I just have to organise the documents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not prepared at all. I only have a life insurance plan and that&#039;s as far as I&#039;ve gone with being prepared. Since I&#039;m not married, my parents would take ownership of everything I own. No one likes to think about mortality. I wish you all the best and I&#039;m looking forward to another post from you when you&#039;re all better.]]></description>
