					<description><![CDATA[Ha I know this is an older article, but just tonight I got that email from Ben &#038; Jerry&#039;s partnered with MoveOn.org requesting donations to back their &quot;stamp $ out of politics&quot; and for some reason the email grabbed my attention to open it instead of just hitting the trashcan. Any who, I like you were like &quot;huh? I thought this was illegal.&quot;  So off to Google I went and found your article- (thanks for writing it!). I really don&#039;t have anything to add other than say - your article intrigued my thinking further. My husband used to be a banking branch manager and he&#039;s told me that it is not legal to graffiti money- but it&#039;s a very grey area. He said they&#039;d accept doodled on bills, but if someone came in with a huge stack of stamped bills they most likely would need to make some phone calls to higher ups on policy - he never encountered it on a large scale which leads me to believe it&#039;s not done on a massive level. After reflecting, I will admit I want to go find all the cash in the house and add my own &quot;flair&quot; to each one . Will go check out your website when I&#039;m done here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just got a bill stamped &quot;Trump 2020&quot; coming out of George&#039;s mouth. I didn&#039;t want to accept it, but didn&#039;t want to complain either. But since the lady shorted me in change, I decided I wasn&#039;t going to let that bit go. I kept the bill and thank God, forgot about it, meaning no embarrassment whilst spending it. I don&#039;t think people should be allowed to deface bills, but political stamps are especially annoying. I probably drew a moustache on George in my youth, or maybe just saw that on a bill and had a laugh. But really, I think cashiers should be able to decline accepting them, but then we&#039;d all have to study the bills handed to us, and who wants that? I remember in MI, Canadian coins were routinely used without the bat of an eye, but I never accepted them myself; I&#039;m a rule follower I guess.]]></description>
