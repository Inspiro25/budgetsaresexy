Hi Cassi!

I love your planning!  You may be aware of this, but there may be federal loans available that don&#039;t accrue interest while you&#039;re in school.  While debt is no fun, you could take on modest interest-free debt for the first 2 bills and factor paying these off before they&#039;re due into your plan.  I say these loans &quot;may&quot; be available because I&#039;m not 100% savvy on how the federal student loans changed recently.  The ones I have from years ago were interest free until I graduated.  I&#039;d say look into the federal loans so you know how to go about getting them if you have to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started college a week ago! Right now I&#039;m freaking out about how I am going to pay off the $4000 bill my college wants from me by November, and then again in the spring. I have a plan for every year after that, I just need to get over this bump in the road first. Reading all the comments is amazing! I will figure out how to get past this. I&#039;m determined to!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reader is on point, which is really refreshing. For college students, I&#039;d recommend:

1. Mastering YOLO / FOMO syndrome. Not every outing or quintessential experience has to be expensive. Spending an afternoon on the lawn/quad or even a house party can be just as awesome as heading out to a bar.
2. Live with roommates before AND after college. Just because you&#039;re able to afford a place on your own doesn&#039;t meant that&#039;s the best use of your money. If you&#039;re rdnting, it&#039;s paramount to a  lost investment.
3.  Buy a used car instead of a new car...and don&#039;t finance above your means.  You&#039;ll easily save thousands of dollars by buying used, but know your budget and safe monthly payments before you even start looking. Also, if you live in a city with decent public transportation, nix the car entirely because you&#039;ll likely pay more to park and maintain it than you would on gas every month. Search for services like ZipCar that will let you affordably rent and drop off vehicles when you need it.]]></description>

I&#039;d imagine #1 would be hard to do though while IN college ;) Unless you hustle your ass off outside of classes and all the activities/clubs/networking/parties which I wouldn&#039;t personally suggest. A side job to help w/ money is def. good, but might be a lot maxing out hours to graduate w/ no debt.]]></description>
