					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m an American, living in Australia.  It&#039;s a law here that every price (whether it&#039;s for milk or a plane ticket) must include all taxes and fees.  Honestly, I love knowing exactly how much everything is, and I&#039;ve found that it helps me to stick to my budget.

In the news today, the government is fining an airline for not fully disclosing all fees in the final price.  &quot;The ACCC requires businesses that advertise a part of the price of a product or service to also specify a single total price which must be prominently shown in the advertisement.&quot;  Article: http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/287131/20120125/accc-seeks-injunction-against-air-asia-over.htm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;David Damron&lt;/b&gt; - I think your thoughts are right on the money bro - I&#039;d LOVE it if everything was more straightforward like that.  From the looks of some of these comments today, it seems many countries DO operate like that! Very interesting...
@&lt;b&gt;Elle&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, cable companies are the worst.  I feel bad saying it, but it&#039;s so true. ESP with customer service, bleh.
@&lt;b&gt;MoneySmartGuides&lt;/b&gt; - That would actually be a good project!  Tracking how much you pay in taxes &amp; fees for like a whole month?  You should do it!  And then tell us all about it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Alexa&lt;/b&gt; - Well that blows.  I&#039;m def. cool with sucking it up every now and then, but it def. comes to a point whereit&#039;s absurd for sure.  At least sometimes they&#039;re avoidable though (whereas others they&#039;re tacked on no matter what).
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That would be something ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, exactly.  The odds are a lot higher that you&#039;d spend $99 to buy something than $117 for example. And once you&#039;re in the store or on that plane or wherever, you&#039;re not changing your mind and going elsewhere - so they pretty much nab ya.
@&lt;b&gt;Weirdo&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... so no more porn then?
@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, do it!  We should all start tracking how much taxes and fees we pay and see what happens ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeremy Streich&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yup.  Or you&#039;re too lazy/frustrated to end the deal and then go start it all over again during the next 30-40 days ;)  That&#039;s the whole thing with it really - once you&#039;re THERE, it&#039;s much harder for you to turn something down cuz you&#039;re so aggravated about it all.  It works out really REALLY well for the sellers of these products.
@&lt;b&gt;Rachael&lt;/b&gt; - Enjoy it!!!  You&#039;ll be quite surprised by the time you stay 24 hours here ;) (but you should for real visit anyways, you&#039;ll love it!)
@&lt;b&gt;mints&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I like the pennies!  You can make fun art projects with them ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kristin&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww, that&#039;s pretty crazy... I agree, the whole thing is rather frustrating :(
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Amen brother.  We can complain all we want, but if we don&#039;t act on DOING something about it we&#039;ll just be a bunch of whiners ;)  Great reminder, man.
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ve gotten 1 or 2 things off too, but on my cable bill instead of phone bill.  Things that were automatically on there from the start - crazy.
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, Yelp helps sometimes with that. Though if it&#039;s a city-city it&#039;s def. hard to find spots still.  That you at least know are safe ;)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Is that all? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Corey @ Passive Income to Retire&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, whatever works.
@&lt;b&gt;Jayson&lt;/b&gt; - Man, that blows - sorry to hear!  At least you got some nice upgrades, yeah? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brad&lt;/b&gt; - Hmm... yeah, you do have a point there.  Actually a pretty damn good one, it&#039;s hard for me to debate thta! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Craig&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah for sure.  Esp if you have AAA and other kinds of memberships - it&#039;s amazing the discounts you can get sometimes just by asking.  Even though you feel like a turd sometimes.
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Well you can keep your money instead, you just won&#039;t get any of those sexy products ;) haha...	
@&lt;b&gt;Meg&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhh, that would be something!  Even more reason to come visit there one day! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Too Funny&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll be paying more too if a certain politic party has its way ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So many businesses are having to charge such high taxes because they are paying high taxes themselves. If our country could get out of debt and the system could be reset, maybe we wouldn&#039;t have to pay such high taxes. 

Here is my &quot;what would I do if I were you&quot; response:

Try getting some type of discount to offset those taxes or asking for a lower rate? A lot of times, there is some discount out there that will offset the taxes. I don&#039;t care how cheap it looks but if it saves ya an extra 10% on taxes? HELL YEAH!]]></description>
