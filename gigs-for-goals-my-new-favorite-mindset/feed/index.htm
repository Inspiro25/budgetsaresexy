					<description><![CDATA[I help small businesses set up websites and start their online marketing process. I have three clients right now, and they&#039;re all paying my intro rate, but I&#039;m learning as I go. It&#039;s been really fun so far!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was going to do that, but instead I upped my monthly student loan payment to $600, a place where I&#039;m not 100% comfortable without the side income. So it kicks me to work on the side job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you read &quot;The Four Hour Work Week&quot; by Tim Ferriss? This post reminds me the of one of the earlier chapters in the book where the author talks about the concept of dreamlining, you think about the goals and aspirations you want to achieve in life, then you eventually work down to how much each goal would cost per month to make it happen. After this the rest of the book is mostly about how to free up time and gain the income you need i.e. different &quot;gigs&quot; to make your dream a financial reality. 

Very good book and if you haven&#039;t read it I highly recommend it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dont take it to the extreme you discuss in this post.  However, we did a similar exercise earlier this year.   My wife quit her full time gig after our son was born.  So, we were used to living off of one income.   Earlier this year we decided to purchases a vacation home. At the same time, my wife decided she was going to go back to work on a part time basis at the animal shelter where she was volunteering.  We determined that the the money she was now making would basically cover all of the costs/expenses associated with vacation home.  So, we essentially picked up a vacation home that we really enjoy without noticing any impact in our checking account.   So, wife work at shelter = vacation home expenses]]></description>
