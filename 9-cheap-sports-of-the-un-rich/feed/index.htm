					<description><![CDATA[Ok I have to admit that I read this wrong the first time because I skimmed the first little set of information there.  (oops!) and I was like.. there is no freaking way dressage is cheap!

Lol.  But seriously, coming from a former horse enthusiast (who has no money) and polo and race horse exerciser, I can support the data that it is expensive!!!

After I stopped riding horses, I started running.  Doesn&#039;t cost a cent, except for the occasional running shoe, and the iTunes songs I purchase.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s kind of hard in Colorado not to do Mountain Sports (I snowboard) but, there are ways to make it cheaper...after you own your equipment! I have $75 pass for four days of snowboarding. What about Ultimate Frisbee?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bet they do that kind of stuff too, but all their friends/family participates in these upper level things so ofcourse it makes sense that they do too. If I grew up or was surrounded by it I&#039;d probably play them all as well, but just make sure it was all budgeted in :) Who knows, maybe this blog would have been called &quot;YachtingIsSexy.com!&quot; Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really wondering why some people spend so much on expensive sports when they can have those that are not with equally the same fun you may experience.  Some doesn&#039;t even cost a single cent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have this friend who plays almost all of those &quot;rich&quot; sports. He&#039;s always broke and wonders why he can&#039;t save money even though he lives with his parents. He goes golfing every weekend! I think anyone can enjoy these sports every once in awhile, but go for the cheaper option or opt out the majority of the time.]]></description>
