					<description><![CDATA[Invest 40K give 10K to my favorite charity.... ok, ok, I&#039;ll play the game!

$20K on a trip to Antartica for my husband and me (yes it can actually cost that much and more)
$2K a new wardrobe for husband and me. To be honest we haven&#039;t bought non-used clothes in years. I really have no idea how much this would cost
$5K on lifetime memberships to blogging tools (not sure it would cost that much, throw in enrollment in a few classes if I need to)
$2k on eating out, this includes really large tips
$21K left....dang this is hard!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love these games, I play them in my head all the time with amounts like $10m (what I&#039;d do recklessly before settling into the rest of my FI life, where I&#039;d draw the line among friends and family for paying off their mortgages, etc.)


With five stacks of high society (I&#039;ve been looking for an opportunity to use that phrase for a week or so now, thanks J.) and was forced to do nothing personally financially responsible:

I think I&#039;d take $20k and get a new (used) luxury sedan, as they&#039;re the one frivolous vice I consider myself to have (but I&#039;m not trying to use up the whole $50k on a car)….I found a loaded 2014 Lincoln MKZ on autotrader with ~50k miles for about $17k

I&#039;d give $15k to my best friend of 25 years that recently got married...After some thought, I had to draw a line here; my parents are in a reasonable financial situation, and $15k wouldn&#039;t really swing the needle for them, and I&#039;d want to be able to give enough to be able to do so (so I nixed giving 10 friends $1k, for instance), so it has to go to my main man (he can also be trusted to be responsible with it ^_^)

Then I&#039;d take the last $15k and take the girlfriend on a sweet two-ish week European vacation, destination(s) pending]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To just &quot;blow&quot;?  Easy.  Eithad The Residence NY to Sydney $21,747 each way.  

That leaves enough budget for a wild 4 hours in Sydney before flying back (takes 22 hours to fly there).  Or not...I think I still need to pay tax and other stuff on the base ticket...fortunately you get very nice ground service and a great private lounge if the tickets alone are more than $50K...

https://youtu.be/1R2sOr6vZqo

Insanity.  Now on my bucket list...at least the $3K (one way) version...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm I COULD just spend the whole thing on a new/slightly used crossover SUV (a newer Volvo XC60 or maybe even a used Porsche or Mercedes or Cadillac...).  Or I could spend the whole thing on a new roof, which we&#039;ll need sometime in the next few years (includes removing and then rebuilding the rooftop deck that covers our flat townhome roof).  But barring that I think I would:

Friday
$500 dinner out with my husband and drinks at a fancy bar with great view afterward.
$1000 splurge on a local hotel suite for the night

Saturday 
$100 personal training session or private yoga lesson
$1500 spa half day at the Ritz plus Botox
$5000 - head to the mall for designer boots, a designer handbag, a dress or two
$250 - get my hair and makeup done on the way out
$500 - another amazing dinner/night out

Sunday
$15,000 - Prepay contractor for new windows
$10,000 - Book a long weekend trip for my 5 year anniversary in April and a January ski trip.
$500 - have one of those maid services do a one time deep clean of my whole house
$500 - load up at Whole Foods for a night of grilling the nicest steaks, an amazing meat/cheese board, great wine, delicious sides and staples for the week too.
$500 - hit up Barnes and Noble for a year worth of books to read, plus fun journals and planners

$14,650 still left...guess I&#039;d book another trip and head back to the mall.  Maybe some nice jewelry for myself (which I never buy) and some nice work clothes and designer pumps.  

Yeesh, I do feel kinda dirty.  Fun exercise though!  Now off to do a much smaller version of the above list this weekend. ;)]]></description>
