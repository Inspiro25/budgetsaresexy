I&#039;m not sure #1 is that accurate anymore. I think before 2008-2009 that this was true. I spent a lot of time getting education, but when the economy tanked my education became an anchor that weighed down my job prospects. Employers knew they would have to pay me more. Until I started my own business my education never helped me make more money. So I think it&#039;s a two-edged sword. During good economic times, it helps you stand out, but during bad ones it hurts your case.]]></description>

Personally, I have an advanced degree and all that but at the end of the day, regardless of what you do, I think it is important do whatever you can to be the best in your field. 

If you are a welder, or a hairdresser of a handyman, or doc or attorney - strive to be in the top 5% of your field and you will likely rep the financial benefits!!]]></description>

I LOVE Mike Rowe!  His work on promoting the trades is the best I&#039;ve seen  The man is on to something, for sure.

Congrats on getting to hang with J$.  Too cool.  Great post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post.  I loved your tip about who you marry.  It is true, and sadly something many people don&#039;t think about too much before it is too late.  Paying off debt frees up not only cash flow, but so much brain power and peace that for once YOU are the one in control here, not your creditors.]]></description>

Yeah, you rarely think about all this stuff when you&#039;re younger and falling in love. Who talks about budgeting on their dates?? haha... (I would totally now if I were back in the market, but this &quot;adult&quot; stuff usually doesn&#039;t click until we&#039;re older in life - womp womp)]]></description>
