					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - haha, nice work.
@&lt;b&gt;DCPrincess&lt;/b&gt; - Oh dang, yeah I mad a similar mistake a few years ago....cost me like $300 extra cuz it jacked up all my numbers.  Great that you had it done so fast though!  (btw, I&#039;ll be responding to your email in a few :) )
@&lt;b&gt;Peter&lt;/b&gt; - It def. doesn&#039;t feel good, that&#039;s for sure ;)  But it seems to be a nice problem to have, eh?  Must have brought in a pretty penny from the ol&#039; weblog (haha....that always sounds funny to me - &quot;weblog&quot;)
@&lt;b&gt;corrin&lt;/b&gt; - $1 is better than -$1 :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brandi&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats on paying $23k of interest ONLY? haha...it&#039;s not by choice even if it means we get more back at the end of the year ;)  LOVE that you&#039;re going to spend money on yourself w/ your refund though, well done.  We can&#039;t just save it all the time, so spend away my friend!!
@&lt;b&gt;David Damron&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it kinda drives me crazy too to be honest with you.  Not saying one way is better than the other, but it&#039;s like come on - if it works for  us let it be :)  Thanks for dropping by bro.
@&lt;b&gt;LenciB&lt;/b&gt; - Wonderful!  Rome will be a blast too, I gotta get back there sometime...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you got that right sister.  And once you&#039;ve got that Emergency Fund topped you&#039;re golden!
@&lt;b&gt;Anthony&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, you got it.  I&#039;d gladly give up $60 to get $2,000 at the end of the year and it be a surprise.  It&#039;s hard to account for every single dollar and situation out there, at least for me.  I need a little wondering every now and then.
@&lt;b&gt;Stella&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s def. a reason to hold off for a bit :)  As long as you don&#039;t forget and file too late!
@&lt;b&gt;Kimmoy&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, GREAT post!  Totally forgot about that one....should have included here ;)  Congrats on getting all that debt paid off!!!  I&#039;ll drink a beer for you tonight! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;ctreit&lt;/b&gt; - What does &quot;general&quot; mean?  To be used for whatever you want later? Is there a max limit you keep in there, or is it all go with the flow? Just curious :)
@&lt;b&gt;RainyDaySaver&lt;/b&gt; - Awww yeahhh....I&#039;m sexcited for you friend.  All good things!
@&lt;b&gt;Tim&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s great, isn&#039;t it?
@&lt;b&gt;Keith Morris&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that&#039;s a great idea...my laptop is at *least* 8 years old and who knows when it&#039;ll break.  Crazy that you saved MORE than you needed though, that&#039;s great! 
@&lt;b&gt;Shelley&lt;/b&gt; - I know, you guys are all right...i just have to set aside the time to give it a shot.  It just means not working on my online empire for a bit, which I&#039;m all hardcore about right now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I ended up owing about as much as you had refunded, but I expected that and had money put away for it. In fact, I ended up saving more than I needed to pay, so Meghan and I bought new computers with the leftover funds. ;)

Our taxes have been done for months now. TurboTax is super easy. If you decide to give it a try, you can go through the entire process without having to pay anything. You only pay when you e-file.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We got a sizable refund -- but only because we bought a home last year. That means we qualified for the first-time homebuyer tax credit AND could itemize to deduct our mortgage interest and property taxes. We&#039;ll see what happens next year and perhaps adjust our W-4 withholding so more of our money is in our paychecks, rather than getting a large refund. 

Anyway, we&#039;re finishing off our CC debt with our refund -- I broke it into two payments and made the first one the other day. By the end of April, we&#039;ll have no interest-bearing debt except the mortgage.... so &quot;sexcited&quot;!]]></description>
