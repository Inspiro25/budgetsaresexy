I think you have to submit a form to really get the details. Or at least hit up the state&#039;s site on it to see whether it&#039;s really yours, and what for (the links to them all should be on that main site there). 

I&#039;m actually going to go through it all myself as a company emailed me telling me I was owed money they sent to the state! Apparently I was avoiding their other emails by accident before it got to that point :(

But hey - &quot;free&quot; money is free money :)]]></description>
