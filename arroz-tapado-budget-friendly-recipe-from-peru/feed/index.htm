					<description><![CDATA[Use a regular ramekin, daveM, or any other container. There is no standard portion size for this dish. Make it as small or as big as you want. And let us know how it works out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The way you have laid out this recipe.... I am pretty sure that I can prepare this... and that will be the most fancy dish I have prepared. lol
I have looked at the details and I am positive that I can do this one, the only hesitation I have is not knowing the right size of pan. lol
Thanks for this recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Edward, this plating is the easiest thing ever as it is described in the recipe. Even the most humble of dishes benefits with a good plating, do you agree?
KK, using ground turkey instead of beef for the filling is a great option too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This looks pretty interesting. I&#039;ll admit I don&#039;t spend much time plating. As a food blogger, I probably should get better at that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pauline, one of our most popular dishes is Arroz a la Cubana (Cuban-style rice): white fluffy rice, a fried egg on top, and fried sweet plantains by the side. We serve it with salsa criolla (onions, chili peppers, and lime juice), and it´s not only low-cost but delicious and fulfilling!]]></description>
