					<description><![CDATA[Aloha! 

After COVIDit is very important to take care of our self especially our mind. Great trip and I would say worth the fight costs of $11.20 to Hawaii.

I hope I can travel very soon after I got my second vaccine :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After COVID.. this trip looks like it was worth every penny! Seems like you and the wife needed a few nights to splurge and a few nights to just hang with awesome friends! Also great you were able to manage free dog dog sitting and no need for souvenirs (though, I hear some kids in your area are obsessed with Maui&#039;s Fish Hook!). The fact that you only had to pay $20 for the full flight is reason enough to make everything else work in your favor!]]></description>

I heard that also! When we picked up our car the rental guy dropped his jaw at our rate.  Honestly we found it by accident. I google on Kayak.com for a rental car in Honolulu for 10 days, and that&#039;s what came up first. It was a promo offer, had to book within 10 minutes of the listing.

One trick we found... We scheduled the pick up and drop off at the Waikiki rental car location instead of the Honolulu Airport location. So it cost us an extra few bucks in Uber/Lyft to get from the airport to Waikiki to get the car, but the difference in price to pick up the car at the airport rental place was enormous.  Even when we dropped the car back off I asked if I could drop it at the airport instead of waikiki... They said it would be a $200 added charge or something ridiculous.]]></description>

Also, did you try Hula Pie at Duke&#039;s or Kimo&#039;s?  It&#039;s the best dessert in the history of mankind ;-)]]></description>

Hey IF! Actually I think you can change your SW companion up to 3 times per year. So you could technically impress 3 lucky first dates!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Southwest Companion pass is really remarkable. I&#039;ve considered working toward it myself--and I don&#039;t even have a current companion. Unfortunately it does have to be the same person for the duration of the pass, so I can&#039;t keep trying to impress different first dates with cross country flights.]]></description>

Oh my goodness, that sounds so delicious!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe :) When I read that your breakfast cost less than $5... AND it looked healthy, I knew I had to ask lol :)

I appreciate it and have a lovely weekend!]]></description>

Woohoo!  We&#039;re not familiar with Maui, but Oahu eats we can recommend a few places :)

If you&#039;re driving around the island, there&#039;s a local hawaiian food place called Keneke&#039;s. They have 2 locations, both in the middle of nowhere (and kinda ghetto, so PLEASE be careful and mind your belongings and park your car in sight!). Little do most people know, Keneke&#039;s also does event catering and they catered for our wedding! All our guests were raving bout the food and got to try all the local dishes.

For Ramen - my wife&#039;s fav is a place called Tenkaippin on Kapahulu. It&#039;s probably 1-2 miles out of Waikiki so a little schlep if you&#039;re on foot. Also on Kapahulu is the Rainbow Drive in which is one of the oldest restaurants and has a cool vibe and story. https://rainbowdrivein.com/story/

For Japanese food there&#039;s a sneaky place called Shirokiya. It&#039;s closed now but might be open when you go there in June!!  It&#039;s actually a market/food court that&#039;s located inside Ala Moana shopping center. Really fun vibe there, here&#039;s the latest on that.. https://www.khon2.com/local-news/shirokiya-japan-village-walk-to-remain-closed-until-april/.

For Poke, honestly I think Foodland makes the best poke that is available almost anywhere. But the hole in the wall place that we love is on the North Shore, inside the Kahuku Superette. From the outside it looks like a plain ol&#039; convenience or liquor store. But if you venture inside at the back you&#039;ll see a seafood stand with what we think is the best Poke on the island. It&#039;s expensive, like $17 a lb, but kind of fun and whatnot. I wouldn&#039;t travel to the north shore just for that, but if you&#039;re up there it could be cool.   Ooooh actually Tamura&#039;s has awesome poke too, and looks like they have locations on Maui and Oahu... https://www.tamurasmarket.com/locations/

Enjoy!]]></description>
