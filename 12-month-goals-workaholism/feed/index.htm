Thanks Ben, good luck to you too :) The nice thing about turning your side hustles into your main gig is you get to work on the company of YOU all day going forward and it&#039;s pretty fun, however your brain then works in overtime even when you don&#039;t want it too. Though, probably a better problem to have than the opposite! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really liked your post J. Money.  I can totally relate to the the workaholic mentality.  What really resonated with me was when you talked about trying to turn off the &quot;business/internet mind&quot; when you&#039;re spending time with your family.  That is a struggle for me a lot of the time.  I&#039;m currently in the full-time job / side hustle stage of life.  Maybe one day I&#039;ll be drop the 9-5.  But until then I&#039;ll be trying to work &quot;smarter not harder&quot;  to achieve a better work/life balance.  Keep up the good work and the good posts!]]></description>

Well, down to two main projects yeah but going the opposite of you in the side hustles, haha... I still do blog coaching (and now money coaching too), as well as helping people buy/sell their blogs and other miscellaneous things. All fun stuff for sure, just adds up in the end. Especially when you keep producing little humans :)]]></description>

It would be fine without a week&#039;s worth of luggage and kids stuff :) We had a family member sit in the back between two car seats too so it was much cozier for her than us up front, haha... solid car though. It had bluetooth for hands free calling through the speakers and a back up cam which was pretty cool!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We talked about this a little bit last month, I think, but I&#039;ve also been cutting back on all my side projects. It feels so good to finally focus on just a few things! I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re down to TWO - that&#039;s inspiring, friend. All the ways you plan on cutting back on hours sound great. Hope your wife is feeling better now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I heard somewhere once if its not tracked, how the heck can you improve on it? Time, Budget, Networth, they all need to be tracked asap. Now if I can only track my sexiness - do I smell a good business idea partner. HA]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You thought a RAV4 was &quot;tiny&quot;!?!  That&#039;s our main &quot;family&quot; car - and I think it&#039;s quite roomy...  At least compared to the civic it replaced....   I hope Ms J$ feels better!]]></description>
