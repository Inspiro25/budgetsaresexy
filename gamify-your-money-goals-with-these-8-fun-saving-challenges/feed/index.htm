Funny you should say that. One of the reasons my phone usage is so high is because I use voice to text sometimes when blogging and writing. So I can get outside for a 1 hour walk to exercise but &quot;work&quot; during that time by typing on the phone.  I&#039;m trying to use my computer less and less, but it&#039;s really just being replaced with the phone. Bad trade actually!]]></description>

That&#039;s really cool! There&#039;s an app that does this also - called Acorns.  All that tiny stuff adds up!  I think all banks should make this a standard practice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting challenges. I especially like the money envelope saving challenge because I haven&#039;t heard of that one yet. 

I actually do wonder if we&#039;ll spend the vast majority of our time glued to our phones.. Maybe computers will start going away and work will be done on a tablet or a smartphone. You never know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My old credit union used to allow to round up your purchases and put them into a saving account. So if your grocery is 127.75, then you can round up to 128 and they will put 25 cents into savings. I loved that until I had to change the credit union due to moving.]]></description>

Whoa! I might need an app or something to figure this all out for me. I love leaving it up to chance though - sometimes saving small bits and sometimes larger amounts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A digital save your fives and fifties challenge:
Any time what you buy ends in the tens cents (x.10, x.30, etc) put ten times that amount in your extra account 

Example: I spent USD35.10, I place USD1 in my extra account and if it evens out, then that is a doozie of USD10!! 

That can change to all criticals (place ten times the amount for anything ending in cents divisible by 20, like a bill of 5.40 places four dollars and a bill of 5.50 places nothing), all ending in 5 (place five dollars for anything in the 25cent, 35cent 15cent etc.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love these fun game ideas! I&#039;m not going to lie, I think I&#039;m going to try out some of these in the upcoming months :) I really like the receipt challenge - and actually saving everything in a separate account that you &#039;saved&#039; by going shopping anyway. It makes complete sense - so thank you for sharing! As you wrote, it&#039;s important to not bite off more than you can chew... that&#039;s something I have to keep reminding myself too when it comes to savings games. Awesome tips Joel!

Cheers,

Fiona]]></description>
