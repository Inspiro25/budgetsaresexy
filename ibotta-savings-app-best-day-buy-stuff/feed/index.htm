Nice! I think it just takes some good strategizing to really milk it for some cash.. None of these apps/tools out there are going to be perfect, so well done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started using iBotta about two months ago. Yeah they get you to buy the more expesive stuff at the name brands but I leverage it by shopping at Aldi(not supported) and Kroger(which is much closer to my house). I like it for the generic stuff and occasional name brand snacks. Good for the bread and milk as well. Made about $30 bucks so far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have Ibotta, checkout 51, and Saving star. With Ibotta alone I cashed out $25 last month.  With Ibotta if you use so many rebates it gives you an extra dollar, and when you hit the next level it gives you $2 extra just as bonus. I have been using Ibotta may be for about a year now and I am very happy with it. Definitely worth having it.]]></description>

Yeah, I think that&#039;s the sweet spot - nabbing them for the generic stuff you buy every week even if they&#039;re already on sale or not.]]></description>

Just out of curiosity Michael, how much are you spending on groceries each month over that 8 month period? I&#039;d like to be able to put into perspective the percentage that it is saving you on groceries. Does this represent 10% or 0.1% of what you spent on groceries? How much would I have to expect to spend in order to make save $75.]]></description>
