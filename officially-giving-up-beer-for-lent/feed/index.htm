					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t up anything for Lent this year - rather I vowed to get something since I had been out of work for seven months. My Lenten thing was during the 40 days I vowed to find a job that I love. And I did! Temp hire during March and starting permanently on April 1!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m giving up watching tv alone. I can lose a day getting sucked into a new series on netflix or hulu, or jumping down the rabbit hole of youtube. But I&#039;m still keeping it social and watching tv with other people. It may be a crutch, but I&#039;m taking it. I think it will free up more time to finish homework and some of those &quot;to-do&quot; items I&#039;ve been procrastinating about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not Catholic, but I went to a Catholic university.  Seeing a lot of my friends do it, I started my freshman year, and I&#039;ve been going ever since.  
I use it as a time to examine my life and see what I&#039;ve gotten a little too dependent on for comfort and then cut it out of my life to show that I&#039;m stronger than my mind&#039;s cravings!  Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t been able to banish the behavior year round.  
This year it&#039;s popcorn and tortilla chips.  Love my salty snacks, but I definitely don&#039;t NEED them.]]></description>
