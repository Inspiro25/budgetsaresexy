Nice follow up - thx for doing so. And smart of their CEO to personally reach out! Sucks it has to come to that, but good to know the power of social media is growing stronger by the day ;)]]></description>

I&#039;ll have to take a look at that site, thanks for the link.

I thought I&#039;d update again, the CEO of MyGallons contacted me after I complained on a couple social media outlets (however before I posted anywhere I contacted their customer service directly and they gave me a worthless canned response).

The CEO of MyGallons explained that Nevada is a bit of an outlier at the moment in that wholesale gas prices in Nevada (which is what MyGallons works off) have stayed relatively steady while retail prices have climbed quite a bit. He offered up a variety of reasons but mostly it boiled down to, if the retail outlets can get it, they will.

His explanations seemed sincere. He offered to make things right if I was unsatisfied. I am going to stick with it a bit longer and see how things play out.

Using the MyGallons service I guess you have to be aware that your pump price may not always correlate well to the price you can buy or sell from on MyGallons.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing!!! This is good stuff to know...

I recently got a message from another gas place too who saw this article and wanted me to check them out: www.lovemygasprice.com -- &quot;As opposed to prepaying for gas, which would not benefit you if prices dropped, we offer fuel price protection.  If gas prices stay low, you benefit from lower fillups costs.  If gas prices go up we pay you cashback automatically to help reduce higher fillups costs.  You don’t have to return to our website to “redeem” your fuel or be restricted to any particular gas station.   Let me know if you have any questions.&quot;

Could be an alternative?]]></description>

I thought I&#039;d chime in and let you know my experience using My Gallons. 

I bought two lots of &quot;gallons&quot; using their service both at the end of Feb, 2015. The prices I paid to My Gallons were $2.64/gallon and $2.47 respectively. The price at the pump around that time was $2.70&#039;ish.

The price at the pump today is around $3.25/gallon. I logged into My Gallons and the price they are reporting (which I can cash out at) is $2.50/gallon. I checked the retail gas price chart at http://www.nevadagasprices.com/retail_price_chart.aspx and prices should have gone up around 20% since my purchase.

Bottom line there are two ways to scam people in this type of arrangement:
1) Take money and don&#039;t give it back/go out of business.
2) Just report fake prices when the market moves against you.

Seems like #2 is in play here. I&#039;m calling scam. I wouldn&#039;t recommend the service, you make your own call.]]></description>

I can see that :) I think the biggest problem is that I rarely take the time to test out new $$$ products that come by me unless I&#039;m really REALLY drawn to them. And in which case I miss out on stuff that&#039;s probably kick-ass and super helpful to people just &#039;cuz I didn&#039;t take the time, ya know? (This is also due to getting literally 5-10 pitches a day on $$ stuff out there). 

So I&#039;ll still do those reviews as I come across the sites I fall in love with, but figured giving mini-shouts to those that have potential would be a good middle ground. So anyone who liked what they saw could investigate further and decide whether it&#039;s worth trying out or not. 

Not sure if this helps or hurts, but your comment is duly noted :) Appreciate you stopping by to tell me so.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think I&#039;m a fan of the Friday product round-up; at least, not with regards to products you haven&#039;t tried yet. I lean towards &quot;less is more&quot; with product recommendations from bloggers. That usually makes me feel more like you only are broadcasting information you really feel strongly about. 

Think you could help me feel better about you putting all those names out there?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is a little late in the blogging world (3 days after a post? What gives??), but we have the same service as the Prism App using our PNC account. I&#039;m not a big proponent of big banks but this works really well for us. They don&#039;t charge for it you can set the dates yourself.
