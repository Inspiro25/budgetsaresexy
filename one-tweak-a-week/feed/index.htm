Actually, it&#039;s more like we are all our own dream encyclopedias! I just help you figure out what your symbols mean in any given dream. And the same symbol can mean different things in each of your different dreams. Like a snake in one dream could mean something evil to you, or represent someone sneaky and mean (but not necessarily to me), but in the next dream you have, a snake could be about shedding your old skin (ie taking on a new job, new chapter of your life). I got into it seriously when I met a bunch of people who also do this stuff and teach each other. It is really cool! And it can pay very well. People just are very curious about their dreams (especially big powerful wonderful ones or recurring nightmares). And not many people do this dreamworking in a careful, serious manner... in our Western society, anyway. I would love to do a guest post. Ask as many questions as you want, J!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First read that title quickly as &quot;One twerk a week&quot; and thought what is this new side hustle? Hahaha!

I love that idea of breaking &quot;will&quot; into a bunch of mini-steps. That makes each one more do-able and hopefully we&#039;ll actually get the darn thing done at long last! I was thinking after my first comment about how none of these things on my list actively &quot;save&quot; money but are really about overall &quot;financial health&quot;--and that is exactly what I&#039;m aiming for in my life! Early retirement probably isn&#039;t in my future, but financial health is something we&#039;ve been working on our whole marriage and are still striving for, and it&#039;s a nice frame for me to use when approaching tasks and decisions!]]></description>
