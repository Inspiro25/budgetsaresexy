					<description><![CDATA[Cool!! I think we actually stopped by there on our way out - or at least a similar beach. It was the first one our baby has seen in his life! Hehe... I&#039;m hitting you up if we do indeed make it out there :) First beer/coffee is on me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in Carolina Beach just outside of Wilmington. We moved here from Alaska 6 years ago. It IS a small town!  And the job market is terrible, if a conventional job is your sort of thing. But I love this place. Mostly for the beach and the close vicinity to everything else. We looked at the RTP area as well.  But ultimately chose here because beach was a priority. We can get anywhere else within a few hours if we&#039;re bored. It&#039;s really the best of everything. Good luck with your decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WOW way to work it man! That is incredible! I def. don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be able to rock it like you are there, but if we save even just a couple of hundred each month it would be worth it for us just to get some new scenery... Shoot, even if the numbers broke even it would still be worth it! Can you tell we really want to move? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you still think you will get a good return on your money to be worth while renting out the place?  To also ensure that there is enough money coming in incase of a major repair..

Our current place is a 2 family and the rent from the upper portion of the house pays our mortgage and part of our escrow so we are essentially paying close to 150 a month to live...not a bad gig considering we bought when my wife was out on maternity leave...as it was much cheaper than renting and it worked out in our favor...it also gave me a taste of rental income and now I want to purchase more properties...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I know - that&#039;s the trouble with this stuff :( And it&#039;s not like we&#039;re just next door or anything where we can hang out and visit a ton before making the switch. But it&#039;s all good, makes life interesting, right?

@&lt;b&gt;Christopher @ This that and the MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Mainly want to move for a change of pace and to have a place more walkable to cafes/bars/etc. Unless we move to either NYC or LA or similar, it&#039;ll always be cheaper for us in rent ;) I guess the only pro to having such high costs of living in DC eh? And we&#039;d use a brokerage or whatever they&#039;re called to manage our property here while gone - it will be money well spent to keep our sanity levels down.

@&lt;b&gt;RichUncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - From what I hear both places are pretty well-known for their food too! So at least that&#039;s good :) Yeah, Durham seemed much bigger than downtown Wilmington, but then again we only went to the more touristy parts... Hard to fit in a lot on short time-tables.

@&lt;b&gt;daveM&lt;/b&gt; - Great! Glad to hear it :) Let me know where you&#039;re exploring too and maybe we&#039;ll also take a trip?

@&lt;b&gt;Johnny @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool! I haven&#039;t been to our local flea market in weeks - I don&#039;t know what to do with myself! ;) I think the next time we go back to visit, we&#039;ll also be stopping by the other areas too like Raliegh and so forth. I&#039;m sure we could both agree on one of those areas ya know? I&#039;d even give Durham a shot just to get out of my current house for a year or two - I bet it&#039;s much better once you have the inside scoop...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think your assessment (sorry Mrs. $) of Durham is pretty spot on. It&#039;s quickly becoming a city that might fit me, but I think it&#039;s still a few years off. But the Triangle as a whole seems like a solid place to relocate.

We were actually in Raleigh for the weekend and hit up the flea market. It&#039;s pretty big and there were some cool vintage items to be had. I quickly remembered why I only carry a $20 in my wallet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bet  there is some future lengthy discussion and a return trip, possibly with another city to be included as a comparison. Great timing at the car rental.!! I am considering a move to another city, your insights are helpful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing how you felt about the NC trip, I like the fact that you guys can&#039;t agree on where to set roots. I am assuming that downtown Durham is bigger than Wilmington? Also great sneak at the end of the post with the food recomendations plug. I like visiting off the wall places with good food.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Browse craigslist for weekly rentals in the area.  Most you can find pretty cheaply. I agree with lance it is hard to experience the area in a weekend...Maybe I missed it but why are you considering leaving the DC area for another large suburban area?  Wont renting the house in DC be difficult if you are over 1k miles away?

Get any moonshine when you traveled further down south...]]></description>
