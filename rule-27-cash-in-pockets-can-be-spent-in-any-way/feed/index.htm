When i withdraw it will be  20$ and  out of that 5 $ will be morrocan chicken rice  and maybe  6 $ for something silly from the  99c shop and the 100th hands free for my phone (MY  hands free work for only max 2 week) and may be 3 $ for  a pen fro the store

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - No shame in that!  I need some of your environmental love to rub off on me... (boy that sounded bad, haha...)... I&#039;m getting better about thinking of it, but still far from where I want to be.  I think I just need to hang out with you guys for like 1 solid weekend :)  Maybe we can build a fully sustainable house or something?  That&#039;s actually on my list to do one year - build one from scratch.  I just don&#039;t have the slightest clue as to how to do it, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh well that&#039;s a good idea!  Keeps you motivated to do more of it knowing you can use it towards whatever you want too :)  I like it.
@&lt;b&gt;DebtnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I think it changes a bit if you have debt you&#039;re trying to pay off.  The luxury we have is that we&#039;re just left w/ the mortgages (*just*, haha...) so we tend to be more relaxed now.
@&lt;b&gt;Leah&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  I totally get what you mean ;)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, if you ALWAYS spend less than you make for the rest of your life, you will be on a great path!  It&#039;s the most simplist concept to understand in this finance world, but the hardst to follow ;)  So keep up the great work, my friend!
@&lt;b&gt;Beating Broke&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... guess you&#039;re a fan of plastic, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - RIGHT???  It sounds like the opposite would be true, but it&#039;s not :)  Glad you figured it out too!
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Love it!  2 of my favorite things in life :)
@&lt;b&gt;Eric J. Nisall - DollarVersity&lt;/b&gt; -  Fine by me ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Seems to be the case with a lot of people, actually. At least you know yourself well enough! :)
@&lt;b&gt;KimmyQ&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re like the third person to mention library fines today - how come no one&#039;s returning their book in on time? Haha... 
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - WOOHOO!!!! We&#039;re like cash soul-mates! :)
@&lt;b&gt;BE @ BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  I used to blow it all in weekly poker nights, but sadly that was disbanded ;)  At least my wallet is happier now...
@&lt;b&gt;TeacHer&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  Exactly.  We all work differently so it&#039;s just a matter of figuring ourselves (and our habits) out.  See you soon, friend!
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... there you go :)  Sometimes it takes a while to come up with the perfect plan.  Testing a few out will help you get there a lot faster.
@&lt;b&gt;Money Infant&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  I like that you said &quot;baht&quot; too.  For a second I thought you said dollars and I was about to e-shake your hand for being a pimp!
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - PERFECT!! I love it - glad it works out for you all too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Andrea&lt;/b&gt; - There&#039;s definitely something to be said about freeing up your time. Especially if you use it to make more money or do something fun w/ your family or loved ones... I&#039;d gladly even PAY money if it saved me hours and hours a week, whatever &quot;it&quot; was :)
@&lt;b&gt;BrokeElizabeth&lt;/b&gt; - Whatever works!  It&#039;s a good thing you don&#039;t live near me, or else we&#039;d be at the pub all the time talking shop ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I spend way way way too much time looking at my budget and counting my dollars, used to roughly track cash too but I&#039;ve stopped... I don&#039;t really withdraw a certain amount regularly, but when I do it&#039;s something like $80 or even up to $200 and as of the last few months I decided that I&#039;m not going to track that AT ALL! I&#039;m a little bummed that it means I won&#039;t know how much exactly I&#039;ve spent on coffee in a year (cause I&#039;m a nerd like that) but it&#039;s wonderfully freeing because cash is impossible to track and it used to be the one snag in my budget. Now it takes me maybe a half hour a week to enter my bills, transactions, balances etc for all my &#039;plastic&#039; use and budgetpurposes and the rest is just daydreaming... Hehe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We do pretty much the same thing.  It goes on the budget spreadsheet as &quot;spending money,&quot; and we take it out as cash.  My husband and I each get a personal allowance, plus money for joint entertainment expenses (dinner, movies, concerts, etc.).  When it&#039;s gone, it&#039;s gone, and we don&#039;t have to track where the personal spending money goes.  It works out pretty well, because the money is technically accounted for, but we don&#039;t have to track where it goes in detail.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is exactly what we do.  9000 baht each every month.  We use it for whatever strikes our fancy.  It might be a nice lunch or dinner, gifts for the each other or the baby, books, toys, whatever.  It works out pretty well and takes the stress out of managing that miscellaneous category in the budget.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We decided to set up a similar system this year when we got married. We are definitely going to reevaluate it come June. Right now hubby is using his debit card which I have access to, but what I have seen is that he doesn&#039;t check his account...not good when keeping track of your expenses. So I think we might switch to a cash system. That way I won&#039;t know what he spends it on. Which would help my money freakiness.]]></description>
