Yeah, it&#039;s all really an experiment as there is no official &quot;how to raise kids&quot; handbook, lol... But considering how successful they&#039;ve been in keeping it all up now afterwards (2 of the three have turned it into a HABIT - which is what we were going for!) I&#039;m going to call it a success ;) Worse thing I figured they just milk us for the prize and go back to their old ways, but even then we&#039;d get some nice reprieve! And since this was the first go at it in their 10, 8 and 4 years living on earth I figured it was worth trying it out...  But if I find later it all backfired and we&#039;ve now raised brats I&#039;ll be the first to come back and share it as I&#039;m def. known to be wrong some times :) Time will tell!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On the fence on this one. What are you teaching your kids? That if they do things they should be doing anyway for a set period time, they get rewarded. This is not how life works. What happens when that behaviour stops?  Are you going to up the bribe or just let it go? On the other side, we all reward ourselves for hitting a goal, whether it&#039;s a nice meal, a new jacket or some other trinket, so are you bribing or rewarding?

You don&#039;t get rewarded at work for showing up on time for a month or paying your rent on time. You don&#039;t get rewarded for being an adult and acting as adults should. I am not sure how you teach the intrinsic value of a job well done.

I am happy this is working for your kids at this stage, just wondering about the consequences down the road. there is no one right way to raise kids!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s funny this hit my inbox this morning. Just last night I bribed my son to practice his trumpet. We’re starting low. Every day he has to practice at least 10 minutes - with a witness as he’s unfortunately discovered an ease with lying to get his way. If he has at least a 90% completion rate after one month, I will take him to the Science Center and pay for time on the VR simulator. We also discussed little weekly rewards like Sour Patch Kids. Fingers crossed!]]></description>
