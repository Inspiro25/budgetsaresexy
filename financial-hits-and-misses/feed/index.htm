					<description><![CDATA[Oh, really?  Hmmm... well technically I&#039;m not the primary caregiver on ALL days, but I will be on two of the days each week? Does that excuse me from only half of them? Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So not sure if it&#039;s too late or not, but in my state (Florida), you are excused from jury duty if you are the primary care giver for a child 2 or under. Might be worth a try! Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;G. Jones&lt;/b&gt; - Haha awesome! I get the $hit taxed out of me too on things like that - it&#039;s not fun, but also usually not avoidable ;) Hope happy hour was fun! Thanks for stopping by!
@&lt;b&gt;MB @ 12 Year Career&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! No news = nice and on track :) As long as you&#039;re following a game plan, which I know you yourself are.
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - You may be right on that one - I&#039;ve never had to deal with it yet, and hopefully I won&#039;t!
@&lt;b&gt;Josh D.&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s true. Only problem is that it&#039;s a problem EVERY week, haha... at least until after the sememester is over. I think we&#039;re gonna start looking into babysitting options for a day and see what happens with me getting called back or not... should be interesting!
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow! I haven&#039;t been on duty for more than 3-4 hours by myself yet, so I can&#039;t even imagine what that&#039;s gonna mean, haha... I may need to call you up! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Dunn&lt;/b&gt; - Tricky one! I&#039;d maybe try and talk to a manager and see if you can give it one last shot, but after that just let it be. The most important thing there is getting everything in YOUR name and info/etc so it has nothing to do w/ the older residends anymore. As long as that&#039;s done well, I&#039;d be pretty happy. Give it one last shot though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mikayla&lt;/b&gt; - If you DO get a notice, that would be crazy! Haha... I&#039;ll be sure to let y&#039;all know how it goes though :) Really really hoping it works out!
@&lt;b&gt;Pauline&lt;/b&gt; - I know right? That would be ideal.
@&lt;b&gt;Dena&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!!! Well, not with that poison ivy, but a tiny price to pay for all that awesomeness :) Can you come to my place next? I have lots of beers and no ivy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hit: Hubby and I worked six long hours last Saturday,cleaning up our front and back yards at our new house.
Miss: We both have poison ivy.
Hit: We tore down and rebuilt a new porch and painted it this weekend.
Hit: It didn&#039;t cost us anything other than time.We reused the decking from our old house and the paint we used was in the basement from the previous owner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Kevin I&#039;m 32, have always been registered to vote, and have never been called for jury duty either! Weird!

I had a miss this week and I wonder if anybody has any ideas! I&#039;m moving (into my first house-that-I-own -yay!) and was calling to switch over all my utilities. The current home owner uses Georgia Natural Gas &#038; I also use Georgia Natural Gas. Ideally, there would be no need for anyone to come out to the house to switch the gas off and back on, right? 

So I got myself transferred to some different department to get them to waive the $60 transfer fee since no one would be coming out. They came back and said the transfer fee was because I&#039;m a new customer. But wait, I&#039;m NOT a new customer - I already have Georgia Natural Gas. My rep disappeared again and came back saying basically the $60 fee is just the way it is.

Has anybody had any success getting a company to waive this ridiculous fee? Georgia Power only charged me $30, which I find a little more doable. (After all, there is a small admin cost to moving my info, giving me a new account #, etc.) Or maybe I&#039;m just haggling over something that can&#039;t be haggled. :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m being a single dad this week and it&#039;s nuts. Baby RB40 is throwing tantrums like there is no tomorrow. Our internet went down this morning and he screamed his head off while I was on the phone with Comcast. He wanted to play with my cell phone.... 
Mrs. RB40 is coming home in a few hours. Thanks goodness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For Jury Duty, if it is a problem to go next month, call the jury clerk and ask if you can come in next WEEK instead.  Then your wife can watch the little one, and you can get your service in at a time that is convenient for you.  

Your court may be different, but everytime I have been summoned for jury duty the clerks were helpful in scheduling a replacement day if I was busy on my assigned day.  As long as you aren&#039;t trying to avoid going altogether they might be willing to work with you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I served Jury duty in Los Angeles, but didn&#039;t get assigned for a case. In cases expected to go longer than a week, you COULD ask to not be assigned to those based on self-employment. I guess its a state by state kind of rule.]]></description>
