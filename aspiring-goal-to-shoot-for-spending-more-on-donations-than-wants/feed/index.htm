I also have heard that numbers of donations can matter at least in some circumstances. No idea! I personally like to choose a charity/organization or two in each of a few key issues important to me. I do love the feeling That my money is going to make a difference.]]></description>

Awesome!! That makes me so happy to hear!!

And yes - I tend to agree with you on the *smaller* places... 90% of the orgs we donate to are tiny local places compared to the more mainstream ones - which makes it all that much more enjoyable to me personally :)]]></description>

I think it depends on what goal you&#039;re trying to accomplish :)

If you&#039;re trying to have the biggest impact with your giving (&quot;effective altruism&quot;), then going with fewer places but larger $$$ might better do the trick (and making sure to pick the *most effective* orgs as well). But if you&#039;re just trying to support the places you love and let them know they&#039;re appreciated, then spreading it around more might accomplish the goal like how I&#039;m doing it. (And don&#039;t forget that while the amounts are low ($20), they recur *monthly* so eventually they will be similar to larger one-time amounts!)

I also think it depends on how you derive *joy* from it too. For me giving one place more money doesn&#039;t excite me nearly as much as giving 10 places less money, so that has to be a factor in it all too so you have a better chance of continuing it.

Def. no right or wrong answers to it though. All giving counts in my books!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;with an ultimate mission to get to 100 one day!!&quot;

I have read that giving more to a few charities can be better than giving a little to a bunch of them. What&#039;s your thoughts on that? I&#039;m mixed on it, except for being on all the mailing lists.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I thought of it as a goal but I&#039;ve been doing this for almost ten years now. PiC and I used to give ourselves an allowance in our early years of marriage and I always ended up spending my allowance on giving instead of buying for myself. It just happened to generally be more important/satisfying to support causes than to pick up stuff for myself. This was very much aided by the fact that I had no time and no physical ability to enjoy the expensive stuff I would have liked to spend that money on 

It would have been much harder for me to do as a healthy person who could enjoy a wide array of hobbies. I&#039;d like to think about pushing that trend upward so we are donating multiples of what we spend on ourselves in future years.]]></description>

Thanks for the update, friend!!

And for INSPIRING this post - and new seed - inside me!

It really has changed my view on giving, and now I want to keep seeing what *other* categories I can beat out too! :) Such a cool mindset!]]></description>
