					<description><![CDATA[I am a middle school science teacher and I have always focused on preparing my students for their futures, not just learning the science. I passionately encourage kids to develop skills in the areas of their interest and I help them find resources to do that so they can turn the things the enjoy into careers (you&#039;re never too young to start). Last year, I was giving a speech about this to parents at a back to school night and a parent came up to me afterward and thanked me for my speech. She asked me if I taught a class on the subject (turning interests and hobbies into successful career) and said if I did she would pay to join it. This year another parent on back to school night told me a similar thing. Each time, I felt so rewarded. I would love to inspire people to dream big and reach for those dreams and get paid for it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Catching the attention of a crowd is, in my opinion, the easiest part of how to begin my journey toward being paid to speak. I&#039;m dynamic, a people person and certainly confident in whatever pursuit of passion I strive to become a resource for. I&#039;d love to be paid to speak about the things I do the best. I can see myself being paid to speak about my exciting career as a professional dominatrix. I&#039;d also feel confident sharing my life-long experience in moving from place to place and how to get by just about anywhere. If I had to pick just one thing to be paid to speak for it would be the most important passionate interest I have; my education and ambition on regard to  the subject of sociology and cultural taboos.]]></description>

hah - love it!

I have the opposite problem - I hate speaking but get offers all the time. Maybe we need to band together and find a way for it to look like I&#039;m the one doing all the talking but you&#039;re behind me hidden doing it :)

On a more serious note though, everyone - including guys - search for stuff/help online. I see you have a page for you and the course/book/etc, but have you thought about adding a blog portion to it? so you can get your name/brand out there more? might help with getting gigs down the road.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Public speaking has always come easy. Its getting paid at conferences or corporations to speak that has been difficult. 

I wrote a book to help husbands understand their wife but realized my target audience was off since men  do not typically search for relationship advice. This seems counter productive since most husbands we coach say they can&#039;t get the amount or quality of sexual fulfillment they want. 

How about these titles: - 
Get the amazing quality sex you long for, more often, by  learning 7 simple activities your wife craves from you!  

 Have the best sex life imaginable, by investing just five hours a week in the right non-sexual activities. (Pssst, these ideas will surprise you as to how easy they are!) 

Husband to Hero in 10 easy steps   (I have this course in a downloadable PDF)

That&#039;s a great idea, Lisa. My mother-in-law suffers from the same and it&#039;s caused some serious problems in her life here as she&#039;s getting older. Super scary :( I&#039;m sorry you have to deal with it too!]]></description>
