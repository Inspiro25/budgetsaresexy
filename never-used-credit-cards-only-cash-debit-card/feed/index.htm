					<description><![CDATA[Well....I must say that I never and hope will never use a credit card in my life and that for the reason....I hate someone out there would know what I do, on what I spend, I prefer to by anonymous. I must say that we&#039;ll all be slaves someday if we&#039;ll stop using cash. Cash is king no matter what. With cash you can do anything you want without anyone know how you live your life, you can Launder money easily. Imagine a cashless society and ... you and your friends ( let&#039;s say 10 friends) are in a club having fun...how in the world you would pay for that....for each other??? I really cannot imagine that. So...I suggest get rid of the CC&#039;s and start using cash. Probably you fear of theft but....what do you prefer??? to lose money once or....be slave for a lifetime????

I live in Eastern Europe where ....cash is king but most of americans...with chicken brain...would think I&#039;m an old fashioned guy but...you will end up slaves and the big brother will watch your ass every where you go and what you do....this is modern slavery. Just imagine you do a bad thing and someone out there just erase your credit score on your credit card.... and from a millionaire....you end up being a begger but if you have cash....hidden somewhere...they cannot take...what they don&#039;t know you have so.... wake up guys.... PAY CASH!!!

P.S. IMAGINE HOW RAP MUSIC WILL CHANGE  :)))
Do you imagine Lil Wayne or 50 Cent throwing plastics in the air...like they don&#039;t care :))) ???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel like I should add my record to this Global Census :) Cash is not king here in Russia, it&#039;s the emperor of all kings. And yes, I never paid with a credit card, and used my debit maybe ten times over the years. Even condos are often bought here with big, nice bricks of cash.]]></description>

Nice! I know what&#039;s his name from Twitter created that &quot;Square&quot; thing too which attaches to iPhones where you can swipe credit cards on now. The future is bright! :)]]></description>

I suspect that with small businesses and private B&#038;Bs it&#039;s a combination of avoiding the expense of getting set up to accept credit card payments, and also cash means they have the option of whether or not to report the income....]]></description>

My teenaged son has had a pizza delivery job for the past 18mths. When someone orders and want to pay by CC he takes the pizza and that handheld device with him to their house so they can swipe and pay while he stands at their door.  They are a small family owned store, not a big chain. I have no idea what it costs to use that system but I suspect the ability to let people have a pizza delivered even if they didn&#039;t stop at the ATM on the way home means more orders.

Last summer we spent a week in New Orleans and the taxi drivers had handheld devices for credit card payments, so it&#039;s availble in the US, not just here in Canada.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Plastic is so convenient that I don&#039;t think I can stop using it! I am however absolutely certain that I DO spend more using plastic because of the convenience. In fact, I am just about to go out grocery shopping where I will probably pay with my Amex. I accrue points with that card and use them for nice meals and other bonuses. When I travel to Mexico and South America though, cash is king. When you visit another country it&#039;s interesting to see how their cultural habits are different from the U.S.]]></description>
