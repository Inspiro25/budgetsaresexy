Hey Angie!  I guess now that the (BITO) bitcoin strategy ETF is launched, people could potentially buy into that in their IRA&#039;s without having to self-direct anything. Not my personal cup of tea, but could allow for some exposure within retirement accounts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, it&#039;s pretty interesting how these different financial products are optimized for different folks in different stages of their lives.

Personally, the IRA one looks super interesting - I&#039;ve also made the same mistake of investing a hefty sum in real estate syndications with non-tax sheltered money, and will need to pay taxes on any gains.

I think crypto has extremely high volatility (i.e. risk), but may or may not have high returns as a result. Hard to say without enough long term data to pinpoint a Sharpe ratio to say &quot;yep, this is definitely profitable in the long-term.&quot; But I think for those with a bigger risk appetite, they might find it beneficial to allocate a small portion of their portfolio to crypto.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very cool about those LifeGoal ETFs. I&#039;ve always figured that with near-term goal (life down payment on a house) you should allocate that to cash because you pretty much want to take 0% chance of having less money, yet if you&#039;re talking 6 years a lot of people might be conflicted on how to invest it so it&#039;s conservative. Vanguard and others have &quot;Conservative Growth&quot; funds, but I think it&#039;s interesting how the align HOM with housing related stocks. 

Hope Austin was fun Joel! Got to spend a few weeks there earlier this year, such an upbeat place.]]></description>

As a blogger, there are a ton of benefits going to FinCon...

- It helps dampen imposter syndrome... because you realize after meeting other bloggers that &quot;nobody else knows what they&#039;re doing either&quot;
- You connect and become friends with strong/smart/profitable people in the space you can learn from
- Meet brands and companies you can potentially partner with
- You notice trending discussions and get new ideas of things to write about. Also there are many podcasting or guest posting opportunities if you meet the right people.
- It solidifies your reason for writing in the first place (To help others)

I think next year is in Long Beach, but not confirmed yet :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What?! Rocketdollar?! BITCOIN TO THE MOON *insert 10x rocket emojis&quot;. 

Just kidding. These companies sound like innovative companies. I&#039;m especially interested in Rocketdollar because I&#039;ve been neglecting my Roth IRA when I know I shouldn&#039;t be. Thanks for highlighting, Joel!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Never heard of Rocket Dollar for self-directed IRA investments, I will have to look into them! I agree with your warning statement regarding whether you should invest in crypto, as crypto is not an investment in my opinion. Instead, it (potentially) is an alternative asset for diversification, similar to precious metals. Fidelity&#039; Jurrian Trimmer makes a good argument as such in a public video posted to their site.

Do you find FinCon to be a beneficial event? If so, what is the biggest benefit for attending as a blogger?]]></description>
