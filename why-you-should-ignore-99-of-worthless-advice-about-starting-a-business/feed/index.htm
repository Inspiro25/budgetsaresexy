					<description><![CDATA[i started reading down the post and thought, this really sounds like Ramit...and scrolled back up and realized i missed the guest post by-line :) so true though. it&#039;s all about paying your dues and honing your craft. so many clients will pay top $$$ for quality so just focus on being a great asset and worry about the perfect logo later]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;the Dad, Climbing Out&lt;/b&gt; - Great! I think you&#039;ll really like his stuff.  I know it lights a fire under my a$$ each time :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin@InvestItWisely&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly - content is king!  If no one wants to read your stuff they surely won&#039;t stick around for the graphics or sharp template.  I will say, however, that Twitter can really get you out there and networking incredibly fast though.  You just have to pump out smart tweets and use it as a networking tool in order to get anythint out of it.
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel211&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, FB &amp; twitter can work better in some businesses than others for sure.  Guess the key is to know what to really focus on and what to hold off on when starting out.  But if you&#039;ve found something that goes against any advice or theories or anything like that, then by all  means keep it up!
@&lt;b&gt;Juscelino M. Acevedo&lt;/b&gt; - Yessir - money is important when making a business :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carolee&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed 100%, well said.  5 substantial tweets a day can get you MUCH farther in business than 100 randoms, and you can even get future clients/contacts through them!
@&lt;b&gt;Greg&lt;/b&gt; - DO IT!! DO IT!!!!  And then report back to us and tell everyone how easy/hard/fruitful it&#039;s been so far :)  We love real-life stories!
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  And here&#039;s to Wyclef Jean making a difference too if he wins ;)  (btw, do you buy into his stuff? or think he&#039;s out of his mind?)
@&lt;b&gt;ronika&lt;/b&gt; - It really does depend on how you&#039;re trying to garget new clients.  If you&#039;re solely web-based then yeah it makes total sense to have somewhat of a site up (and no business cards), but if you&#039;re a physical storefront then maybe the opposite is true - at least starting out.  If you&#039;re successful though at some point of this venture, a decent website &amp; social media acumen is HIGHLY important! And yes, I just used an S.A.T. word ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a great post! Especially for me because I started a side business (financial advising) that has really spilled over into the web (blogging). I work full-time and I serve as Treasurer for an orphanage that&#039;s located in Haiti, so I need to be very efficient with my time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think also that some people don&#039;t use Facebook and Twitter properly.

When I see 10 tweets in a row saying, &quot;Making a cup of hot chocolate&quot;, &quot;Time to go grocery shopping&quot;, etc.....I cringe. And usually unfollow them- who has time to read (or write) useless dribble?

I recently dropped a business associate- they were so busy playing farmville on FB that they didn&#039;t see my email- I actually had a paying client for them- they lost that job, and any future jobs from me.

FB &#038; twitter are useful tools- at the right time and used correctly.]]></description>
