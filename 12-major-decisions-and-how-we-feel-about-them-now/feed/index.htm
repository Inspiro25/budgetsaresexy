So glad you got something out of this post, Leila :) you&#039;ve been working at your $$ long before I started at 28 so you will beat me to it by the time you&#039;re old and almost 40 like I am now!! **But be sure to enjoy your youth along the way -- we&#039;d all rather have that back!**]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to check out Rockstarfinance every single day for the last 5 years, the previous owner increased the articles from 3 to 5 and was still pretty good. They still have the same articles from about a month ago right now. Campfirefinance.com is another alternative but not as good as what rockstarfinance was]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These anniversaries are wonderful celebrations, J.
I am sure at least some of these were hard decisions to make at the time.
I’d like to use this idea for my blog though I have just a few  years on you and yours.

Although I have been reading your blog for longer, I will celebrate my first year as subscriber along with my first year as a blogger!
3 years anniversary as tenured professor teaching finance, law, marketing.
3 years as professor, third career.
12 years since graduating law school and practicing law.
15 years having my two kids who are eating up personal finance topics. (They love your blog!)
16 years since I left Wall Street as equity analyst/MD...very difficult move!
That’s the gist though I forgot to mention my 37th wedding anniversary to Craig. Whew!]]></description>
