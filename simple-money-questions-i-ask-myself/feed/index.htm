					<description><![CDATA[I think you nailed it when you talked about finding purpose. 

These are really great questions to answer but the more philosophical ones like am giving enough, helping others, and being a good example to my children can be solved when one is living their purpose!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great!
My goal is to give 20+ percent of my income away to charity this year.  My long term goal is to give 90% away and live off 10 percent.

The more you give away...the wealthier you become.]]></description>

Oh yeah!! But luckily kids call you out on things and the most simplest of questions can snap you back to reality :) I remember my son once asking me why I&#039;m always on the computer and it killed me :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great questions! And I think $5000/month would be the sweet spot for us too, though we&#039;re not there yet! I think it&#039;s good to ponder these &quot;big&quot; questions every so often--otherwise it&#039;s far too easy to forget why we&#039;re doing what we&#039;re doing and get sidetracked or unfocused. (I have to make sure to ask these kinds of questions regularly as a parent too, otherwise I&#039;ll get totally bogged down in the daily grind and forget about what it&#039;s all about!)]]></description>

Heyyy - that&#039;s cool!!! Love that it means recurring gift giving!

I hear lots of great stuff with the donor advised funds, and most people in our community go though Vanguard as well. The only thing I wish is that you could give it to anyone you want whether they&#039;re a 501(c)3 company or not :( I get much more impacted by those I meet in real life I want to help vs organizations, although of course they do amazing work as well.]]></description>

Excellent idea!

Are you going to answer them separately and then compare, or try to do at the same time?

I vote for separately so you get better chance of true answers as well as a good laugh ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/simple-money-questions-i-ask-myself/#comment-270462&quot;&gt;Cherie&lt;/a&gt;.

YES TO ALL OF THIS!!!

Particularly --&gt; &quot;The key to donating money and time is to think about what what issues you really care about and what issues affect you and then finding organizations you are excited about.&quot;

100% agree. Anytime I used to think about &quot;charity&quot; I&#039;d naturally not feel one way or the other, and thus why I always sucked at it. But as soon as I found organizations and PEOPLE with real life faces and problems that tugged at me, it was a game changer. I just had to be *open* and pay attention more in order to realize it was the same &quot;charity&quot; as other people talk about! You don&#039;t care until you care!

Also this --&gt; &quot;Every time I go to the pet store, there is a screen that pops up about donating to their foundation. You could feel guilty every time or make a decision to donate that isn’t well thought out&quot;

That&#039;s one of my latest rules! Forcing myself to say &quot;yes&quot; to donate anytime asked no matter what now, like at those screens/etc. I hated always feeling bad so I started giving $1.00 everywhere, and just this morning upped it to $2.00 when paying our water bill :) Felt great! (And one less decision to have to make too, haha... I do the same with tipping, I decided &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/tipping-rule-flat-20-percent/&quot;&gt;to give 20%&lt;/a&gt; no matter what so I never have to think about it again :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;helping those less fortunate&quot; really resonates with me. We didn&#039;t do any of it till we were almost FIRE, and just established a 25k donor advised fund at Vanguard. If the math works out we&#039;ll be able to donate 1k per year from that fund for a very, very long time.]]></description>
