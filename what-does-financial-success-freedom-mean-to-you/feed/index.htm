					<description><![CDATA[My idea of financial success is having enough money and resources that you feel you need, be it 100 in the bank or 100,000. When you have enough, you will know and when you go above your &quot;enough&quot; all the more power to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My idea of financial success is having enough that I don&#039;t have to worry about what might happen with a job or the economy or other outside factor.  I don&#039;t need a ton of things, just the ability to control my life!  That is so true that the feeling of happiness and accomplishment are the absolute best part.  Every time that I put more money in savings, I feel so great!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good for you! After racking up close to $15K in credit card debt over 3 cards, I&#039;m down to $1399 and have a plan in place to be rid of it by next spring. I am working my way toward financial success - the elimination of debt - with new gusto. Having less bills to worry about will be the best feeling ever. When I paid off the two ccs, I hung the first statement that said &quot;zero balance&quot; on the wall above the computer for inspiration. 

I want to be down to paying utilities, phone, insurance and the HOA as recurring payments. No more student loans, car or mortgage!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks you guys for all your supportive comments! Its nice to know that others are going through something similar and kicking butt with their own savings goals.

@LB, I probably should have clarified this in the article, but I no longer live with my parents. I live in an apartment on my own (well, with my boyfriend) and it is wonderful. I think its interesting that you think living with your parents means you are a failure. I have known tons of people who lived with their families not out of necessity, but as a way to build up savings until they were able to buy a home or build a healthy emergency fund. They are now just as productive in society as anyone else. I think theres different paths for different people, and I don&#039;t consider it a failing move that I lived with my parents for that time. Without that, I would not have been able to pay off as much debt as I am doing now. Just wanted to add my two cents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I woke up to a text from my friend (who was drunk and in Vegas) that said, &quot;Bro, we are going to be millionaires&quot;.  This single statement defines who I am.  I have a 100% committed goal to make as much money as I possibly can.  Some people say it&#039;s foolish and that money is the root of all evil.  I simply refer them to the book &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; by Ayn Rand.  The “So you think that money is the root of all evil?&quot; quote changed my entire life.  I realized that I don&#039;t want to be middle-class.  I don&#039;t want to be &quot;doing fine&quot;.  I am going to make it even if I fail 100 times in the process.  That is what financial success is to me.  Reaching my goals and higher.]]></description>
