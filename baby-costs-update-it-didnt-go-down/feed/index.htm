					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;amanda&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... I should, huh??  But even better would be the total cost on the pack of condoms or something ;)  Everyone gets in trouble in the heat of the moment!! Haha... tell your larger than life nephew Mr. J. Money says hi.

@&lt;b&gt;Judson&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! I like that - totally true :)  We are thinking about having our 2nd child, but I&#039;ve been told not until at least a year from now, so we have some time... I bet as soon as my wife forgets how hard life without sleep is though, we&#039;ll jump right back into it ;)  Congrats on your 2nd child being on his/her way!  I hope you&#039;re right about the 2nd not costing that much - keep us updated!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you any intentions of having a second child?  I have my 2nd on the way and as I look back on our first child, I am shocked at how little we are spending this time around.  Economies of scale really do apply.  Our attic has enough boxes labeled &quot;NEXT BABY&quot; for us to start our own consignment store.   There is a TV commercial that captures the phenomenon perfectly: in it, a young mother is loading her precious little one into a decked-out stroller with every imaginable baby device and accessory before they go out for a walk.  The scene is captioned &quot;FIRST CHILD.&quot;  A second scene, captioned &quot;SECOND CHILD&quot; follows in which the same mother - dressed more practically with a baby in a Baby Bjorn, a small purse, and none of the surplus junk she had in the first scene - grabs her firstborn toddler by the hand and briskly walks out the door.  I hope that you are blessed with another child, otherwise you&#039;ll never get the joy of fully realizing how much you&#039;re saving on the second (and third, etc) one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should offer your findings to schools for their sex ed classes-let teens see the actual costs of raising a child.

My nephew is 9 months and he&#039;s in 12 month clothes.  At his last check up, the dr. said he is the height of the average 12 month old and has as many teeth as the average 22 month old!  But he&#039;s the sweetest happiest baby ever!  Just enjoy him while he can&#039;t move, once he starts crawling there&#039;s NO relaxing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Debt an the Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks so much, we love him to death! :) I think people change over the years too (our priorities, wants, etc), so you never know - maybe one day you&#039;ll wake up and have an epiphany!
@&lt;b&gt;Elena @ First Aid Myths&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! That&#039;s the awesomest/scariest part of it all too, haha... You&#039;re totally 100% responsible for their well being! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - I know right?? Those diapers keep on disappearing! Congrats on your precious little one too!!  We&#039;re so lucky :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aw, our expensive little miracles arrived right around the same time. My baby is now 2.5 months old --where&#039;d the time go?! -- and she sure is an expensive monster. Darn diapers, hospital bills, diapers, onesies, diapers, and oh, yeah, did I mention diapers ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, you never realize how expensive kids are until you have them, but they are such precious things! You can not stop thinking about them and protecting them even for a second since they are born. Thanks for sharing your experiences with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He is so cute!!  My son was always well ahead in sizes too.  He seemed to need a size double his age, so when he was 1 he was in size 2.  Eventually he started fitting in the right size at about age 5.  :)]]></description>
