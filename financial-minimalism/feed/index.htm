NICE!! I def. want to retire wayyyy earlier than 65 too - at least *be able* to retire. I&#039;ll still work all the time anyways cuz I&#039;d just get bored, but you know what I&#039;m saying... At that point I&#039;ll be able to work on whatever the heck I want!]]></description>

We were in the same boat. We were saving 15% because that&#039;s what we always read we were supposed to do. Great. If you want to retire at 65. I don&#039;t know what your current savings goals are, but if you&#039;re doing the standard 15% and have excess left to play with, give serious consideration to whether you early want to work until you&#039;re 65. We don&#039;t, so we use the ~40% of our income that is unallocated to bump up the retirement savings and pay off the mortgage as fast as possible. Net effect, we&#039;ll be retiring a decade earlier than originally planned.  There are lots of places to spend the excess (we do an major trip every year, so we aren&#039;t socking away every available extra dollar), but just because you are meeting the savings goal you set doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t reassess the goal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like this article! My boyfriend and I try to minimize the amount of money we have to spend in order to be able to spend our money on what we want to spend it on. I also write about it on my blog. I find that it keeps me more accountable. I recently wrote about how we were able to use our money to pay cash for a cruise! Some of my frugal tips have worked better than others. Making homemade coffee creamer actually cost us MORE money, but doubling our milk saves a lot. If anyone is curious this is where I wrote about our cruise http://shopaholicsavers.com/?page_id=796 :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s smart to look at both sides of the equation--saving more and making more. We&#039;re biased, but a great way to do both is to install a clean energy system. They save a lot in energy costs and deliver fabulous ROI. In some cases, if you generate more energy than you need, they can also produce revenue. Not bad!
