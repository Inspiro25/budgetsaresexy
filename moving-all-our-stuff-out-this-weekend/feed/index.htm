NEVER? I don&#039;t even think I could comprehend that, haha... I&#039;m on move #25ish or something crazy like that, and don&#039;t think I could stay in one spot forever ESP if someone told me that :) Now, if it happened to work out that way for some reason that&#039;s totally cool, but knowing it&#039;s permanent from the get go would just freak me out way too much.]]></description>

Oh, believe me - we&#039;re accounting for that one in our *renovations* we&#039;re about to do this week ;) The moving stuff is fine as it just sets me back a little while with work and what not, but the floors/kitchen/painting is a whole other thing... Will be blogging about there here real soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/moving-all-our-stuff-out-this-weekend/#comment-121248&quot;&gt;Free Money Minute&lt;/a&gt;.

We&#039;ll be updating all our floors in our entire house, plus our kitchen (and some painting), so we figured it would be a lot easier to be out completely while it&#039;s all being done than trying to work around it with both a baby in the house, and me physically working from home.

As for moving, we mainly just needed a change of pace and an area where I can walk to places from my home. We were all getting pretty antsy here, so just made the most sense to jump on it NOW than wait more years and keep complaining about it ;)]]></description>

Why not just wait it ou in your current home?  Do you need to move to a new location for a specific reason, need more room?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really great news! Preparing for this new step in your life is clearly exciting and for some reason I feel the joy and excitement you are feeling. Maybe it&#039;s time for us to move somewhere new too, it&#039;s also been 5 years now since we&#039;ve been in the same place and we are starting to get itchy feet.

But again, congrats on finally doing this and on the great savings!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So great that you&#039;re living your dream. And great that you&#039;ll be living in a fun neighborhood. I live in a really friendly and fun nabe, and am grateful for it every day. I hope you can walk to most places, running into neighbors along the way, and can forget the pain of driving and parking. Anyways, now that you&#039;ve bought a new place, DON&#039;T pay off your mortgage early. http://giddingsplaza.com/2013/05/13/part-2-get-rid-of-your-debt-today-and-buy-back-your-soul-except-for-your-mortgage/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We moved everything ourselves last time too and it took forever. I don&#039;t know what we would do next time. The missus said we&#039;re not moving anymore though so maybe there won&#039;t be a next time. 
Hope you get through it ok.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, you guys move quickly! I&#039;m impressed! I never, ever pay movers. Both my partner and I are big DIY movers. We&#039;ve had to move a few times in the past few years and while it&#039;s a lot of work to haul stuff back and forth, it&#039;s worth it. You can save a ton of cash.]]></description>
