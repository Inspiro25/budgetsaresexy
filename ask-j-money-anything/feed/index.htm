I don&#039;t think any niche is &quot;dead,&quot; but I do think it&#039;s important to figure out why you want to start a blog. If it&#039;s for fun and to learn/grow/meet a ton of cool people, then I say start a blog on wherever your passions lie! You can never have too many people talking and sharing tips about money.

But if you&#039;re doing it strictly for the money, well, finance blog or not there are a million and one other ways to make money, and much faster ;) Unless you happen to be incredibly talented and super lucky at the same time. I make enough money now to support my family, but you have to factor in 12 hour days for almost 7 years too - it&#039;s not as easy as it may look. All that being said, of course it is possible. Even if you start right now. I start project/sites all the time from scratch in the personal finance world (as do other bloggers/entreprneurs) and there&#039;s no way we would if we knew it was going to fail ;)

So I say you blog about whatever you want to blog about if you&#039;re interested in it, and then see what  happens from that point. Just don&#039;t go into it thinking you&#039;ll be quitting your 9-5 anytime soon regardless of the niche you jump into.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money: 

I would LOVE to start my own financial blog but I&#039;ve heard a few online marketers say its a dead niche. Do you think newcomers can still find success in this area, or is the market too saturated at this point?]]></description>

hmm... tricky one indeed.. I&#039;m usually not one that risks getting in trouble with stuff like that, so if it were me I prob wouldn&#039;t do it. I&#039;d just stress myself out all the time and it wouldn&#039;t be worth it ;) then i&#039;d try and find a friend or family member who could host my frozen goodies! reminds me of that &quot;no grill on balcony&quot; type rule too a lot of complexes have, but people still use those small ones out back anyways. I was too much of a goody goody to do that as well - so perhaps I&#039;m not the best person to ask, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s your view on frugal tactics that are somewhat iffy? for example, having a freezer chest in an apartment where the lease forbids having one? This is assuming the landlord looks the other way on this sort of thing unless it causes water damage or whatnot.]]></description>
