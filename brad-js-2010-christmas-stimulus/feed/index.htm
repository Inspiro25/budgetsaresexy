					<description><![CDATA[I am incredibly grateful that I&#039;m finally learning to listen to my inner voice and am figuring out what my &quot;calling&quot; is in life. I&#039;m about to make a massive terrifying and exhilarating career change which involves going back to med school and I&#039;m grateful for support of friends and family who are cheering me on. 

No looking back! 2012 here I come!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am truly thankful for Raam of Raamdev.com

He was the spark which led me to believe in myself and ability to change the world. 
I am giving up all possessions to go help those who need it most. 
I&#039;m terrified and deeply joyous at the same time. : D 

To Freedom from limits and the power of Yes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so thankful for my boyfriend (Greg) and best friends (Brian, Steph, Nick, Jay) this year - it&#039;s been an emotional year for me, both personally and professionally, and I never would have made it through without these people to lean on.  It&#039;s true what they say, that you make your own family, and I couldn&#039;t have possibly lucked out into a better one.  Even at the worst it&#039;s been this year (and there&#039;s been a lot that&#039;s sucked) I&#039;ve felt that it was going to work out okay, because at the end of the day, these folks would still love me, no matter what happened.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mom and Dad,

I am truly thankful that you supported me so steadfastly this year as I spread my wings and tried to become fully independent. You supported me when I thought I had found my dream job, and then supported me when I found out that what I had been told I would be doing and what the job actually would be were two different things. When I, the daughter who NEVER QUITS, asked for your blessing to quit the job that was (almost literally) killing me after two weeks, you gave it whole-heartedly. And when I found the next job, the one I have now, you believed my enthusiasm about it, instead of being skeptical because of what happened the last time. Thank you so much for believing me when I swear I can do it, and for loving me anyway when I sometimes find out that I can&#039;t. Seven months after graduating college, I&#039;m finally starting to be independent, but I&#039;m happier than I can put into words that you&#039;re by my side as I do it.

With lots of love,
Your Daughter]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am thankful for the friends and family i have this year.  I have really had a year of change and growth.  On the top of that list, I would like to show appreciation for my mom.  She has had a difficult year.  She has been sick now 2 years and her dad has fallen seriously ill as well.  Even through her turmoil, she has been so supportive of me through my tough times and adventures.  She supported my skydiving, my job camp event that helped 1200 job seekers with resumes and interview help and many got jobs after attending!  When my husband left me for someone else, she was supportive of me and was really there for me when i just needed an ear from someone.  She offers to help, works hard and all around is a genuinely great person.  Money has been tight for her this year with all her medical bills, i&#039;d love to be able to give her the $50 gift certificate so she can share something special with her Dad before he goes.  A book, a hersey bar, etc.  Thanks for listening!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To my wonderful Aaron!

Words cannot express how thankful I am to have you in my life. Two years and I *still* get butterflies whenever I see you. :)) You make me so excited about life! I&#039;ve not had anyone who fit me as perfectly as you do. I love you and look forward to creating an amazing 2011 with you. 

Love, 
your Kimbits xx

(thanks for this j and brad!)]]></description>

Hun, Thank you for all you do to keep our family safe. Thank you for working so hard every day to provide for the boys and I. I am so proud of you and all you accomplish in your career and as a father. I love you more than I could ever share!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Erin,

Thanks for being there for me and telling me what you were seeing.  I was lying to myself but I apparently couldn&#039;t lie to you.  You made me realize how close to the edge I was skating and you helped me realize that I needed to pay attention to me before trying to fix anyone (or anything) else.  I truly appreciate all that you said and did.]]></description>
