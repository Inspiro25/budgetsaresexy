Love that you included wine as a necessity! I&#039;m in the same boat  - we have a hefty alcohol budget for our family. :)]]></description>

Cheers Steve. Yeah, whenever I feel lost or uncertain it&#039;s helpful to go back to the beginning. For me, it starts with a black and white budget.

I hope your family and friends are all OK and staying sane. Be safe!

					<description><![CDATA[Budgets are definitely not sexy, but agree that it&#039;s necessary. That&#039;s why I let my husband do it. Ha. As long as I only spend on necessary items like food, gas, and wine, then he is able to make the budget work for us. It is amazing how sticking to a budget helps us feel more secure about not only our financial future but that of our two kids, who hopefully will go to college one day. Thanks for the reminder Joel.]]></description>

That&#039;s the sweet spot right there - when it&#039;s ingrained in your *habits* like that! Good job! (And for treating yourself now too - that&#039;s also important to do when you&#039;re able! :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I no longer closely watch my budget like I did when I first started learning about personal finance and budgeting.  It has become second nature for me not to squander money, but I have also learnt to spoil myself a bit.  A few years ago I was developing my farm in my home country and did not allow myself or visit home any fun for four straight years. It was brutal, but I met my goals and have now loosened the budgeting strings.  However, I still save a sizable amount every month.  I am grateful that I have a secure job a well and pension.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re mourning the loss of the high water mark in net worth, that&#039;s all. 
 I didn&#039;t sell a thing, so I still have all the shares waiting for my future self to do something interesting.  We&#039;ve never waivered from tracking our spending.  Cutting things that we no longer value and spending on the things that we do has been the ongoing plan.]]></description>

You definitely can balance a tight budget + happiness. There are 1000&#039;s of examples of people doing this... Living frugally and happily. You can do it!

The thing I love about building home equity is it&#039;s kind of &#039;out-of-sight, out of mind&#039;. A slow process over many years, but the day you move/sell, it&#039;s nice to realize your savings in full fruition.

Awesome you can&#039;t be fired. I&#039;d love a job like that ;)]]></description>
