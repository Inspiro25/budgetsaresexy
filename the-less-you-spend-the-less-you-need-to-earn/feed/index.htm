					<description><![CDATA[We try to go over our expenses every now and then to see where savings can be had. In general, I prefer to increase income if possible rather than trying to cut expenses even further. That said, dumping my personal phone 4 years ago  and working out an arrangement where I can use my work phone for personal use as well (within reasonable limit) has saved us about $4000 over the last few years and I still get the benefit of a new phone every 2 years or so. So, yes, cutting expenses definitely goes a long way towards reaching FIRE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man, I&#039;ve been getting ripped off. My phone plan is $109 per month ($80 phone plan, $30 phone payment). I&#039;ve been reading this idea on your website for a little while, but knew i was on a contract for my phone so hadn&#039;t actioned anything yet. I have 4x months left, so i&#039;d have to pay out my plan before and i didn&#039;t think the cost would work out (and it stings to pay for something i wouldn&#039;t use). Looked into it and realised even paying out out the last 4 months of my plans (required to pay 50% of remaining phone plan, plus remaining phone contract) would save me $6 per month for the next four months, and after that a massive $50 per month, or $80 per month as i wont upgrade my phone at the end of the contract (which i&#039;d usually do). 

So essentially just saved myself $664 over the next year with only half an hours work.... If only my regular hourly wage was equivalent to that :)]]></description>

Dang - Republic Wireless won&#039;t help in this case because it primarily uses wifi to keep costs low :( Can you pay to get internet installed so you can save in a ton of other areas (tv, phone, dish, etc), or is it not even an option for you? Def. a tricky one, I&#039;m sorry :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugggg.  The freaking cell phone.  The hubs and I have had so many arguments about that ONE bill.  We have three kids, they are on our plan.  Its an expletive car payment.  We&#039;ve fought about it for years.  I review the bill and continue to try to find ways to save money on it.  I&#039;m ready to go back to a basic phone.  HOWEVER, we live in the sticks and can&#039;t get internet service.  

I&#039;m definitely going to check out Republic Wireless, if only for myself.  I&#039;m determined to get this bill down to something reasonable.  I&#039;d also cut off the dish, but my husband would have a cow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice! Yes, I think that&#039;s a great point, that those permanent/recurring expenses often take just one time to fix. It&#039;s easy to convince ourselves that it&#039;s a lot of trouble to deal with, but then once you&#039;ve done it, you&#039;re done! And you&#039;re spending less from then on out, so it&#039;s totally worth it.]]></description>

Haha... That&#039;s like a lot of car commercials too :) You never know what people are hawking until the last three seconds of them sometimes... Could be for some cologne, a car, or a new bag of Doritos! All that sells is lifestyle!]]></description>
