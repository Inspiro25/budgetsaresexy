<p>Just had a randomly refreshing chat with a fellow coffee shop goer, and as things tend to go we ventured into finances and the words that came out of his mouth were outstanding, lol&#8230; So much so I had to stop him mid-sentence a couple of times to make sure I got his phrases right! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here were some of the highlights from our convo, in *his own words* as best as I can remember&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h3>&#8220;I would rather play chicken with my bills than with my savings&#8221;</h3>
<p>Instead of spending on &#8220;wants&#8221; first like I&#8217;ve done all my life, I flipped it around and now SAVE first and pay bills second. Then if there happens to be anything left over, I use that to buy any &#8220;extras&#8221; I might want.</p>
<p>I went from not being able to save $1,000 and a credit score of 580, to having over $13,000 in the bank and a score of 730 within one year!</p>
<p>There were a handful of things that led to this, but it was mainly <em>re-ordering my priorities</em> and paying myself first that got me going in the right direction.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system of managing my cash flow&#8221;</h3>
<p>Another reason I was able to save so much this year was because I drastically changed my management system. Instead of having everything in 1-2 accounts, I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is I spread my accounts across multiple banks that all serve a specific purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have one account for my short-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my long-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my bills</li>
<li>And then one account for my spending/wants.</li>
</ol>
<p>My business banking looks similar: one account for savings, one account for bills, and another account for taxes (I pay quarterly). It&#8217;s a lot to manage, but it&#8217;s brought so much peace and savings.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I threw away my debit cards&#8221;</h3>
<p>The first thing I did when I started re-arranging everything was to move all my savings into a brick and mortar bank that had no online access. This way the only way I could access my money was by going there in person. I did get debit cards, but I immediately cut them up and threw them away.</p>
<p>This has immensely strengthened my discipline, and partly why I was able to go from $1,000 to $13,000 so fast. It took me over 30 years to save my first $10,000 and now the hardest part is over!</p>
<h3>&#8220;I spend a lot of money looking for women&#8221;</h3>
<p>Over the course of 3-4 years I&#8217;ve spent $40,000+ looking for love, or about $1,200/mo.</p>
<p>Part of that goes to dating apps like eHarmony (which I initially balked at as it cost me $300!), but most of it comes from just doing my best to be &#8220;visible.&#8221; So lots of eating out and hanging with friends, visiting bars/community events/etc. You have to put yourself out there if you truly want to meet people.</p>
<p>I initially felt bad about spending all this money with no savings in the bank, but later I realized I was prioritizing what I wanted and I became okay with it. Now I could have been more *efficient* with the way I went about it, but I am proud to say it worked out in the end and I will be getting married at the end of this month! Ironically, to a woman I found on eHarmony!!</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This was the most interesting part of the whole conversation, haha&#8230; As someone who met their partner years before online dating and apps came around, I&#8217;m always fascinated by the mixture of tech and love. And really how much dating seems to cost in general??! And I&#8217;ve surely never met anyone who has TRACKED IT ALL, lol&#8230; Probably exactly what I would do if ever back in that situation <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-68221 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/serial-killer-dating-gif.gif" alt="dating gif" width="328" height="328" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>So basically, yeah &#8211; most stuff we&#8217;ve heard before, but in much more entertaining ways ;)</p>
<p><strong>1) Save first, spend later</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Build a system that works for you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Make yourself more &#8220;visible&#8221; when you want something. </strong>Whether it be love, business, career, you name it. If you&#8217;re not putting yourself into the position to *receive,* you&#8217;re limiting yourself! Nothing great has happened sitting on your couch &#8211; you have to put yourself out there and tell the world what you are looking for!</p>
<p>(This is exactly, btw, why I choose to do my projects out of coffee shops. I never know who I&#8217;ll run into or what type of magic might happen! And surely this blog post would have never been created, so who knows what you would be reading right now??! Lolol&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>At any rate, all good things to think about as we head into the new year here :) </strong> Will you consciously place yourself in situations which allow you to get closer to your goals or farther away from them? Are your management systems still serving you okay, or is it time to blow them up and start from scratch? Where will you be putting that first dollar from your next paycheck? If it isn&#8217;t to YOU, you need to re-read this whole blog post! ;)</p>
<p>Your F.G.A. (Financial Guardian Angel),</p>

<p><strong>You know those people who quit their jobs and jump right into retirement, only to find out it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world and now they&#8217;re stuck and freaking out and don&#8217;t know what to do with themselves?!</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be like those people :)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a better way! And the <em>Wealth of Geeks</em> just interviewed an <del>expert</del> on this very same topic which can help steer you into a better future: ME.</p>
<p>The original article has now been taken down, but it was a really well written and concise piece, and really couldn&#8217;t say more about how smart &#8211; and good looking &#8211; the interviewee seemed, lol&#8230; Sources say, however, it was only a fraction of the brilliance captured from the interview, so I had my team dig up the entire 4 page Q&amp;A email for you because that&#8217;s the kind of thoughtful person I am.</p>
<p>May it help you retire faster, and even happier! You&#8217;re welcome!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<h3>How old were you when you retired? What year was that??</h3>
<p>J$: I don’t know if I ever made it “official”, but I mentally started pretending I was retired in <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January of 2023</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I honestly don’t think I’ll ever be retired-retired as I’ll always be working or thinking about *some* project out there, but financially-speaking I don’t need to make any more money to survive.</p>
<h3>What was your net worth when you retired?</h3>
<p>J$: $2 Mil+</p>
<h3>How old were you when you opened your first savings account?</h3>
<p>J$: Oh wow &#8211; never been asked that question before! I’m sure my parents at some point opened one up for me when I was a kid to teach me about banking stuff, but the first one I personally remember opening was in the start of college, so probably like around 17?</p>
<h3>Did you always plan on retiring early, or did it &#8220;just happen?&#8221;</h3>
<p>J$: Nope &#8211; never even thought about it or KNEW it was an option really. Even when I was blogging! It wasn&#8217;t until the blogs <a href="http://earlyretirementextreme.com/">Early Retirement Extreme</a> and <a href="https://mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> came onto the scene that something stirred in me. I of course knew that saving more would give me more freedom in general, but never put the two together or strategized it out until reading them. Then I was hooked!</p>
<h3>What keeps you busy these days?</h3>
<p>Lots of yoga! (5-7x a week)</p>
<p>Lots of <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working out</a> (3x a week)</p>
<p>Lots of volunteering/helping out friends (2-3x a week)</p>
<p>Lots of wrangling my 3 boys (24-7!!!)</p>
<p>Since I stopped working an official “job” I became the defacto Parent-In-Charge as my wife still very happily works :) So lots of taking kids back and forth from school or soccer practice or doctor appointments or the pool when we&#8217;re in the heat of Summer.</p>
<p>I’ve also started <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-magic-of-habit-stacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing the laundry</a> every day and taken over <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/new-queen-of-grocery-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grocery shopping</a> as well as anything else that makes me look good to my wife for a better chance of continuing this Good Life, lol…</p>
<h3>What is your favorite money quote?</h3>
<p>I don’t know where I heard this or if it’s even the right words, but this mindset really hit home the first time I heard it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Millionaires don’t become millionaires by spending money, they become millionaires by saving money.</p></blockquote>
<p>You always assume people with fancy cars or mansions are rich, but to get those fancy things you actually have to SPEND YOUR RICHES! Lol&#8230; Becoming a millionaire is much more boring.</p>
<h3>What are the top 3 things one should *never do* in early retirement? Did you learn these from experience or by observing other early retirees?</h3>
<p><strong>#1. Never go cold turkey into retirement without testing it first!</strong></p>
<p>You know those horror stories of people retiring and then being bored out of their mind and either wasting away a few short years later or going back to work just because they don’t know what else to do with themselves?! Don’t let that be you!!</p>
<p>Test it out by taking weeks-long, or months-long, sabbaticals and pretending you’re retired. Then what do you do with your time? How does it make you feel? Are you lonely? Do you have hobbies you can get into?! Are all your friends working and can’t come play with you because they still have jobs?? (more than likely, esp if you’re retiring EARLY!).</p>
<p>These are all things you can test a little and figure out *before* pulling the chord as you want to KNOW what you’re getting into and not leaving it up to fate. And if you can’t take weeks or months off at a time, practice on the nights and weekends! Start joining clubs and going on adventures with friends/family/church members. Start building a life NOW that’s exciting to ease into and not a scary unknown one for later &#8211; even if you don’t think it’ll be scary.</p>
<p>(And btw, if you DO end up going back to work? So what! Retirement is not for everyone &#8211; a better thing to measure is <b><i>whether you’re happy or not</i></b> in the stage. If you enjoy working, don&#8217;t stop working! The trick is staying as true to yourself as possible, and by practicing &#8220;retirement&#8221; early you&#8217;ll get a sense of this much sooner before entering Freak Out Mode.)</p>
<p><strong>I naturally started doing this the second I learned you could blog for a living ;)</strong> I started building my ideal life and then eventually over the years I started <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-triad-of-hustling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working less and less</a> (and less) until eventually I was accidentally “retired” haha… And even then I still struggled a bit! Then I came across this quote and it <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/">got me back on the path</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you’re stuck, just sit down with a notepad and start writing… your brain has things it wants to say even if you don’t know what they are.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#2: Don’t assume all your friends and family will be available at all times!</strong></p>
<p>You’re the one retiring, not them, so more often than not you will have to figure out what to do with yourself from 9-5 each day :) And it’ll take some getting used to!</p>
<p>But here’s the awesome part: since everyone’s working you get all the grocery stores and other shops/places/parks/etc ALL TO YOURSELF! Which makes it a perfect time to do boring errands or housework or anything else you still need to do in life whether you have lots of money or not.</p>
<p>It also makes for a great time to do anything purely selfish for yourself too, like writing or fishing or yoga’ing or working out, etc. Then by the time the afternoon rolls by you’ll be freed up to play and hang out with everyone and feel equally as productive!</p>
<p><strong>Another hint: people still do have to eat lunch every day, so on days you’re super lonely or just missing friends, offer to come to their work and eat with them!</strong></p>
<p>One of the first things I did in retirement was to make a list of every single friend of mine I haven’t caught up with in months and drove out to have lunch with them. Some were local so I knocked those out pretty easily, and then others I had to plan ahead of time as they lived 1-3 hours out. But every single person was thrilled to meet up, and they truly appreciated that I made the effort to visit THEM vs the opposite since I&#8217;ve got all the time in the world, they don&#8217;t!</p>
<p><strong>#3. Don’t over-schedule your days. Leave time for “flow”!</strong></p>
<p>One of the first things I came to realize in early retirement is that even when you free up 40 hours of work you still can’t manage to get everything done you had planned to <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And if you ask any retiree they’ll all say the same &#8211; there’s still not enough time in the day!</p>
<p>So rather than scheduling out every free hour you have, build in some <em><strong>“flow” time</strong> </em>that allows you to more calmly go about your day and allowing for whatever life throws at you.  Appointments running late, traffic jams holding you up, kids getting hurt or needing to be picked up from school early, etc. Even though you’re retired, LIFE still happens.</p>
<p>On the plus side, it also happens for the better ;) Running into an old friend on the street and having the time to grab an impromptu coffee, getting into a rhythm with a project you’re working on and not wanting to stop since you’re on a roll!, getting a phone call from someone important and being able to take it right then and there (hi mom!).</p>
<p>The more time you leave “open” the more opportunities you have to adapt to life’s whims. Still plan and do your best to feel fulfilled of course, but those built in times of &#8220;nothing&#8221; can end up becoming some of the best <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64c.png" alt="🙌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Anything else you&#8217;d like people to know about you, your situation, or anything else?</h3>
<p>Yes &#8211; getting into <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/category/minimalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimalism</a> was a game changer for me/my finances! I was doing fine before it, but when I realized having less “stuff” freed up not only more time but also $$$ it was like pouring gasoline on my FIRE plans!</p>
<p>I ruthlessly started decluttering my entire household, and then moved to digital clutter and responsibility clutter and then even (toxic) friends clutter! You can apply minimalism to ALL areas in life! And the less and less stuff I “needed”, the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-less-you-spend-the-less-you-need-to-earn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less and less money I needed</a> which meant opening up more and more freedom.</p>
<p>One of my favorite mantras is below which still holds true today:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Freedom &gt; Money &gt; Stuff</strong></p>
<p>Print it out and put it on your fridge! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="😁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>// END</p>
<p>******</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Before I hit publish on this post, I randomly got this note from a friend (hi Anthony!): &#8220;I&#8217;ve been starting to think about what retirement will look like for me in three years. I&#8217;ve started working with a coach to keep me focused and accountable. We meet once a month, and she&#8217;s a good thought partner as I explore my desires and options. I come away from each meeting with &#8220;homework&#8221; for the next meeting, so it&#8217;s not just a bunch of navel-gazing.&#8221; &#8211; YESS!! There are a ton of places and experts out there that could help direct you better if you don&#8217;t trust yourself enough to set aside the time for it!</p>
<p>In fact, I just caught this from Apex Money as well: <a href="https://www.boldin.com/retirement/retirement-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Start a Retirement Planning Group or Club: Plan for a Happier Wealthier Future, Together</a> via Boldin.com. Fritz from Retirement Manifesto has started one with his friends, and you can find his thoughts on it so far here: <a href="https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/what-ive-learned-from-my-retirement-mastermind-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What I’ve Learned From My Retirement Mastermind Group</a></p>

<p>I went <strong>123 days</strong> without a sip of coffee <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f631.png" alt="😱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f631.png" alt="😱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And also&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>101 days</strong> without a glass of whisky (or any alcohol for that matter)</p>
<p><strong>70 days</strong> without applying ChapStick to my lips</p>
<p>and <strong>43 days</strong> of not using the internet or any apps on my phone (!!!)</p>
<p>Challenge Mode activated, baby!! And it feels great! Also &#8211; kinda boring, lol, but super proud of myself for pulling it off so far and honestly can&#8217;t believe I even have. Who gives up all this stuff at the same time??!</p>
<p>But more on that in a bit&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>Hello!!! It&#8217;s been a while! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="😁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s completely my fault.</p>
<p><strong>I made it my mission this year to swap out &#8220;screen time&#8221; with more &#8220;real life&#8221; time, and I&#8217;ve gotten so good at it that I almost forgot the internet still exists, haha&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve missed you and I&#8217;m back now! And I hope your $$$ is still going strong! Anything juicy happen since I&#8217;ve been away?? Still saving and budgeting your hearts out? I just checked and it&#8217;s been exactly 6 months since my last post to y&#8217;all (!!!) which is way too long&#8230;</p>
<p>As for us, life continues to be good and our health and wealth are trucking along nicely. Definitely lower on the income side of things since that&#8217;s what happens when you unofficially retire, lol, but thankfully the decisions of younger J$ hooked us up to be just fine ;) Even without adding anything extra our net worth continues to grow! The power of <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/penny-compounding-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compounding</a> at its finest!</p>
<p><strong>But while I haven&#8217;t been &#8220;working&#8221; much, I<em> have</em> been channeling all that time and energy into somewhere else: myself.</strong></p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project of Me</a>&#8221; continues in full force, and now on top of the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ive-turned-into-a-juicing-freak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">juicing</a> and working out and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volunteering</a> and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yoga&#8217;ing</a> every day, I&#8217;ve added a few more life improvements to the mix. Or rather, improved *habits*. Not that any of these were all too terrible really, but it&#8217;s always good to hit &#8220;reset&#8221; every now and then to see what you truly <em>need</em> in life, you know?</p>
<p>And I decided to hit the hardest, most trickiest, habit first: <strong>COFFEE!!</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-67971 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coffee-gif.gif" alt="coffee gif" width="352" height="361" /></p>
<p>Something I love and devour every single day, but something I&#8217;m sure my body doesn&#8217;t exactly appreciate. I had been slowly trimming it down over the years, going from 3-4 cups/day to 2-3 cups and then most recently just 1 cup/day, but never in my 25 years of drinking it have I dared to go cold turkey. I mean, why would you do that to yourself??! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>But once the seed gets planted I can&#8217;t leave things alone until I go ALL IN, and one day I just woke up and thought, &#8220;Today is the day &#8211; no more coffee!&#8221; and that was that.</strong></p>
<p>The first week was a bitch, not gonna lie (those headaches are real! Especially when your life is full of rowdy little boys!) but eventually I stopped thinking about it and learned to live my life as I had the first 20 years of it :)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s had a <em>super</em> big impact on me, other than chilling me out more and maybe lessening some anxiety (I feel more &#8220;even&#8221; these days, like, no more huge HIGHS or LOWS, but just kinda sorta floating in the MIDDLE, if that makes sense?) but it is amazing how fast our bodies can adapt when given the chance. Life without coffee seems just as normal now as life was with it! And in the process I learned that I really enjoy decaf teas, such as lemon-ginger which I&#8217;m currently drinking as I type this, as well as the turmeric based, &#8220;Golden Latte&#8221; &#8211; a real treat if you&#8217;ve never tried!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been a great reminder of how powerful a force *momentum* can be. The beginning stages are always the hardest, but as time goes on you get better and better with less effort until the point of not even really paying attention anymore. Not unlike saving or investing really!</p>
<p><strong>Even more importantly &#8211; doing these little challenges helps prime you up for even MORE challenges in life.</strong> Momentum breeds momentum, and similar to what happened last year when I joined that soccer league, which then got me to start eating and drinking better, which then got me to start exercising more, <a href="https://jmoney.biz/cascading-actions-and-watching-for-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one positive act propels you to another</a> until you&#8217;re left with a string of better habits stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>30 days into the Coffee Challenge I then took on a 31 day Meditation Challenge, which then led to a 21-day Inversion Challenge, and then a random No ChapStick Challenge (??) and then finally a No Internet on Your Phone Challenge which is my present dare I&#8217;ve taken on&#8230; A dare, of course, I dared myself with ;)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more on each for those curious:</p>
<p><strong>31 Day Meditation Challenge &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve always wanted to try meditation but didn&#8217;t know how, this is an easy way to get started. You just set the timer for 5 minutes and then sit there and do nothing except try and focus on your breath. Which you can never do all the way, of course, but you still try and eventually get better at it. When the 5 mins are up you&#8217;re done and hopefully feel a bit more peaceful! Then you repeat for the next 30 days <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you crave a little harder challenge, which I was, you do the same 5 mins every day BUT you add 1 more minute on top of it with each passing day. So, day 1 is 5 mins, day 2 is 6 mins, day 3 is 7 etc etc until you realize you&#8217;re at 35 mins/day and feel like a monk! It&#8217;s a fabulous challenge if you&#8217;re into such things, and of course the hope is that you continue with it until it becomes a daily habit &#8211; even if not for long. (I&#8217;ve found the sweet spot for me is 7 minutes, which I can easily slip in any time of the day!)</p>

<p><strong>21 Day Inversion Challenge</strong> &#8211;This is a yoga challenge a friend of mine and I did together, but even if you&#8217;re not into yoga you could try it (just be careful!). With this challenge all you have to do is get *upside down* once a day which is supposedly really good for you (something about the blood rushing down and then back up to improve flow?). But &#8211; it&#8217;s also just plain FUN :)</p>
<p>You can do a hand stand up against the wall, or a head stand in the middle of the beach or even just have a friend dangle you at your ankles for a few seconds! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> As long as you get upside down every day you&#8217;ve accomplished the mission.</p>
<p><strong>No ChapStick Challenge</strong> &#8212; This is going to sound weird, but next to coffee this was probably the hardest challenge I&#8217;ve ever taken on, haha&#8230; I&#8217;d never realized how engrained of a habit this was until learning that my brother has only used it like once or twice in his entire life??! I was shocked! I told him I probably apply it at least 5-6x day automatically without even thinking about it, and that it&#8217;s one of the three things I *always* carry in my pocket:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Money clip</li>
<li>Chapstick (or a variation of &#8211; this isn&#8217;t to shame Chapstick the brand, I don&#8217;t have anything against them, lol&#8230; unless the rumors are true that they put *addictive* substances in it which would 100% explain my obsessive behavior with it!!!)</li>
</ol>
<p>He then told me I needed to take it on as my next challenge, and 70 days later I have still yet to apply a single swipe! :) Though I did early on have to apply some Vaseline as WOW were my lips not happy as they were adjusting!! And I couldn&#8217;t count the number of times I reached into my pockets to get the Chapstick only to remember it wasn&#8217;t there anymore, lol&#8230; So it&#8217;s kind of a minimalism and savings win too! One less thing to carry around, and one less thing to purchase too &#8211; woo!</p>
<p><strong>No Internet on Your Phone Challenge</strong> &#8212; This one came about after just being tired of being on my phone one day and seeing everyone else on theirs too. Which this challenge doesn&#8217;t exactly solve (if anything it gets you to realize how MUCH everyone else is on their phone!) but it is a good start to breaking your own scrolling habits.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, you just stop opening up any apps outside of those made for communication (like text, calling, etc) and then see if you can survive ;)</p>
<p>I started it on vacation which is probably the <em>worst time</em> to start since you usually have so much downtime!, but it did help re-focus my attention on real life and nature and has been great for my mental health too. I have since sneaked in the maps app and allowed for the camera and one or two other more *productive* apps too, but so far it looks like I&#8217;ve broken the habit of haphazard scrolling and getting lost to time. I&#8217;d bet I use the phone at least 50% less now!</p>
<p>(Another trick to not picking it up as much? <a href="https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/beware-the-dopamine-cartel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wearing a watch!</a> It can&#8217;t suck you in like when you go to your phone to check what time it is!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>And that&#8217;s where we are today :) Looking for the next good challenge!! lol&#8230; You have any for me? </strong></p>
<p>But while it may look like I&#8217;m trying to devoid myself of all the best things in life, the point as mentioned earlier is more to break myself out of my daily habits that have essentially been on auto-pilot for years and then reinstitute better ones. Some things like the coffee and alcohol I&#8217;ve slowly introduced back in again &#8211; having my first glass of whisky last week, and my first cup of coffee the week prior (it all tastes so much better in moderation!) &#8211; while the ChapStick and phone scrolling ban still remains fully in tact.</p>
<p><strong>And of course, you can do all this with your finances too!</strong> In fact, that&#8217;s where my love of pushing myself all started from &#8211; when I took on a &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lent-time-to-give-something-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Spending Challenge</a>&#8221; back in 2008 and tried to get a handle on where all my money was going! The first week was the hardest (I kept forgetting and finding myself in stores!) but eventually the new habit kicked in long enough where I trusted myself to start spending again without overdoing it.</p>
<p>A few years later, I decided to up my game even further and go through *every last expense* I had and either nix them completely or lower them enough without affecting my quality of life. I dubbed this the &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Challenge Everything</a>&#8221; experiment, and at the end of 12 months I had saved <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5,484.07</a> and forever cut out $200/mo going forward! Half of it coming from swapping cell phone carriers alone which netted me $100+/mo (I swapped Verizon for Republic Wireless which no longer exists, and eventually landed at <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/mint-mobile">Mint Mobile</a> which I LOVE. Only $25/mo!*)</p>
<p><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45618 " src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/challenge-savings-chart.gif" alt="challenge everything savings chart" width="548" height="714" /></a></p>
<p><strong>And then of course there&#8217;s getting into the habit of investing more and paying off debts and all other kinds of challenges you could take on to better improve your future.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the ones we&#8217;ve featured over the years if you&#8217;re pumped and ready to take some on!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/two-dollar-bills-savings-trick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The $2 Bill Challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/spavings-savings-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Spavings Challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/bingo-savings-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The $1,000 Savings Challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/gamify-your-money-goals-with-these-8-fun-saving-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamify Your Money Goals with These 8 Fun Saving Challenges!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/30-mini-challenges-for-september-to-improve-your-life-and-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 Mini-Challenges for September to Improve Your Life and Money!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is just starting with one area and then letting the momentum (and confidence!) keep building and propelling you further into others. And remember &#8211; it gets easier the more you flex that muscle!</p>
<p><strong>Anyways, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to these past 6 months :)</strong> Hope you&#8217;ve been learning and getting into some fun stuff too! I really thought this was going to be a steady normal year over here and then BAM &#8211; the fire was lit and the sparks started flying! Haha&#8230; But I love it&#8230; You gotta be constantly changing in order to grow and I welcome every last bit of it.</p>
<p>See you back here again soon! Thanks for reading :)</p>

<p>Such pros and cons either way!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Would you rather&#8230;</h2>
<p><strong><em>Have unlimited money to buy things online but you can never buy anything in person (can&#8217;t go to restaurants, shops, movies, games)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Or have unlimited money to buy things in person but you can never buy anything online (can&#8217;t get anything delivered, but could walk onto a car lot and buy a car with cash)</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>I immediately shot back &#8220;<strong>In person 100%!&#8221;</strong> and then had to marinate on it to make sure it was the best answer?!</p>
<p>He quickly reminded me this means &#8220;No Amazon! No buying things from around the world and no deliveries or Ebay!!&#8221; and I&#8217;ll admit that last one would be hard as it is where I find all my old rare books and coins I collect! However, with *unlimited money* I can just FLY TO ALL THE PLACES and look for them in person, lol&#8230; Or do anything else I wanted in person for that matter!</p>
<p>I could eat anytime I want in person. Buy anything I want in person. Buy things for other people or donate lots of $$$ in person. With UNLIMITED MONEY you can live as rich a life as Bill Gates or Warren Buffett once did just 30 years ago before Amazon or the internet was even a *thing*! Lol&#8230; It was normal life to buy everything in person!! :)</p>
<p><strong>If you were tied to *online* purchases you&#8217;d also find yourself in a pickle more often than not&#8230;</strong> When you&#8217;re out and about and you get hungry? Sorry &#8211; no food for you! If you see something for sale (or even worse &#8211; your kids find something for sale &#8211; like <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon cards</a>!) or you just want to grab a coffee on the go &#8211; nope! And if you&#8217;re traveling the world to far exotic places which you probably will be with that much money, good luck!! I hope you&#8217;re a master planner and organizer &#8216;cuz I sure as hell am not, lol&#8230;</p>
<p>And God forbid the internet goes down or you lose your phone&#8230; You better have back ups for your back ups! Also hope that you can pay your rent or mortgage or anything else you need/want in life online, though I suppose these days you&#8217;re 80% in the clear already with probably another 5-10 years until there wouldn&#8217;t be <em>anything</em> you couldn&#8217;t buy online?</p>
<p>So really the question comes down to what you prefer to have more of in life &#8211; <em><strong>in person interactions, or online interactions?</strong></em> There&#8217;s massive pros and cons to both, and with unlimited money you&#8217;ll be just fine either way, haha, but I know at least for me I&#8217;d much prefer going back to human life than digital if I can help it. Which is probably why I answered &#8220;in person 100%!&#8221; right away. I don&#8217;t want to lose myself more online!! I want to be in the real and flesh!!</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s what my gut is telling me at the moment anyways :) How about you?</strong> Which would you prefer if you had to make a choice: unlimited money to spend online only, or unlimited money to spend in person only? Or do you prefer to opt out of the whole silly option and just keep everything the way it is with your current money and all the freedoms in the world??</p>
<p>Fortunately for those who choose the latter you already got your wish, but a fun question to ponder regardless ;) Never know when you&#8217;ll have to for real decide!! Lol&#8230; Leave your thoughts in the comments below or hit &#8220;reply&#8221; if you&#8217;re reading this in email and let&#8217;s keep the discussion going!</p>
<p>Your friend both online, and especially in-person,</p>

<p>Stealing this idea from <a href="https://www.thefrugalgirl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Frugal Girl</a> who free flows new things in her life every week, and thought I&#8217;d do the same as I&#8217;ve immersed myself into a LOT of things lately and kinda just want to blurt it out rather than neatly craft up individual posts&#8230; Unless you want a whole article on Pokemon?! Which I can certainly do for you!! ;)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been brewing lately&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) I joined a soccer league for the first time in 10 years!</strong> Except my friend who convinced me to join it didn&#8217;t tell me the games were at 10pm at night!! AT NIGHT! Can you imagine?! I didn&#8217;t think I could do it, but surprisingly once I hit the field I didn&#8217;t even notice and all my muscle memory came back and it WAS ON. We even played one game in the middle of a rain storm in the freezing cold! Haha&#8230; Of course, I&#8217;m one of the oldest ones out there at 43, but hey &#8211; It makes me feel younger just being surrounded by everyone ;)</p>
<p><strong>2) I&#8217;m a yoga addict now!</strong> A <a href="https://imetyoutoday.com/namaste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chance encounter</a> at a coffee shop led me to finally go for it after years of thinking about it, and now &#8211; four weeks in &#8211; I&#8217;ve already done around 25 classes! No joke.  I knew I would like it, but man &#8211; had no idea I would enjoy it THIS much, haha&#8230; I didn&#8217;t realize how powerful it would be for both my body AND my mind?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short video I did on it after hitting 3 weeks if you&#8217;d rather watch that than read ;)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy3pmWFO143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67730" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video.png" alt="yoga video" width="645" height="574" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video.png 700w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video-300x267.png 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video-550x490.png 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video-562x500.png 562w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I just love the culture around it, and all the people, and *especially* all the words that are used throughout.</strong> Like &#8220;gratitude&#8221;, &#8220;mindfulness&#8221;, &#8220;kindness&#8221;, &#8220;energy&#8221;. One of the teachers even ends each session with &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t been told lately that you&#8217;re loved, I love you.&#8221; That hit me hard the first time I heard it!! Everyone&#8217;s so welcoming there&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been experimenting with the different <em>types</em> of yoga too, like Restorative Yoga, Yin Yoga, Vinyasa Yoga, and most recently &#8211; Hot Yoga! Which is really something!! Haha&#8230; I almost passed out the first time I walked into the room, but my body has finally acclimated and it&#8217;s now one of my favorite ways to wake up in the morning. It&#8217;s so hard, and refreshing, at the same time!</p>
<p>(Also fun fact: my Wordle scores have been<em> off the chain</em> lately which I 100% attribute to yoga <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And now I can actually KEEP UP with all those young whippersnappers at my soccer games too! Lol&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>3) If all that exercise wasn&#8217;t enough, I also joined a Gym! </strong>Which was NOT something I ever would have guessed as I hate gyms, but as I mentioned in <a href="https://jmoney.biz/cascading-actions-and-watching-for-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my personal newsletter</a> last week when the world keeps hinting at stuff you have to listen&#8230; And for whatever reason, this voice keeps telling me to MOVE MY BODY more so for now at least I&#8217;m listening ;)</p>
<p>And it turns out gyms have other things than just weights too &#8211; like classes! So I&#8217;ve been very much enjoying their early morning Boot Camps which I alternate with the early morning Hot Yogas&#8230;. Apparently I thrive more in group sessions than being left to my own devices, lol&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>Quick aside:</p>
<p><strong>I was trying to explain all these recent events to a friend the other day, and it dawned on me that I&#8217;ve basically replaced spending time on &#8220;online projects&#8221; with spending more time on &#8220;the project of ME&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of hitting the laptop at 5 am I&#8217;m now hitting the gym and yoga studio, and instead of watching clicks and traffic every day I&#8217;m now watching my body and general mood! It&#8217;s quite a shift for someone who&#8217;s so used to being stationary and looking at screens all the time&#8230;.</p>
<p>And maybe something to consider yourself as well? When was the last time you worked on the <strong>Project of YOU?</strong>? Could you carve a little time away this week to build it out again?</p>
<p>It may not be soccer or yoga, but anything that improves your quality of life is worth spending time on. And I&#8217;ll tell you this much &#8211; <a href="https://jmoney.biz/cascading-actions-and-watching-for-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just starting somewhere</a>, *anywhere*, is enough to get the ball moving. As I recently read somewhere, &#8220;you must begin from where you are.&#8221; And I promise you it gets easier from there <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f5a4.png" alt="🖤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><strong>4) And lastly, the other new thing in my life lately is that I caved and I now collect Pokémon cards <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>Which I blame on my boys who insist on me taking them to the card store every other day (!!), eventually wearing me down as I was so tired of waiting around doing nothing while they peruse! Which, incidentally, is also what led me to skateboarding the other year after taking them to skate parks and waiting around, haha&#8230; So I guess I can&#8217;t hate on them too much ;) And now I actually know what they&#8217;re talking about whenever they discuss Pokemon which of course they love! So dad FTW!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <em><strong>Mimikyu</strong></em> btw, my favorite who&#8217;s as cute as he is scary (and the one main card I&#8217;ve chosen to collect so far):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67731" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mimikyu.png" alt="mimikyu" width="342" height="401" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mimikyu.png 342w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mimikyu-256x300.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[He&#8217;s shy and hides underneath an old rag pretending to be Pikachu, lol..]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>And then here are some updates on things that are OLD!</p>
<p><strong>Veggie Juicing</strong> &#8211; Still going strong!! Though my family has dropped off from joining me so now I only need to make it every <em>other</em> day as it makes enough for two glasses which cuts back on a LOT of time&#8230; All that cleaning and prepping gets old fast, not gonna lie, but man are <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ive-turned-into-a-juicing-freak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the benefits</a> still worth it! My weight loss has stagnated, and actually started going back UP (I&#8217;m thinking maybe because of all the working out/yoga and building up more muscle?!) but the blood pressure is still low and I&#8217;m still avoiding most sugars and junk food too. So a great habit I plan on continuing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Volunteering</strong> &#8211; Dropped off a little since taking all those yoga classes, but just recently jumped back into it again and helping clean up/maintain our homeless shelter&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-worse-job-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothing closet</a>. My fave! I haven&#8217;t seen <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/operation-give-back-in-real-life-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lizzy</a> in a while, but hopefully that&#8217;ll change now that I&#8217;m back, and meeting a ton of other new friends in the process. You always tend to focus on the job at hand and the &#8220;why&#8221; behind volunteering, but really the best part of it is just *being there* with people and talking with them! At the end of the day we&#8217;re all the same and very much need connection.</p>
<p><strong>Underwear Skipping</strong> &#8211; Remember when I tried going without underwear earlier this year???! Well, I&#8217;m happy/embarrassed to say that it&#8217;s stuck, haha&#8230; And usually only wear it now when I&#8217;m working out/yoga&#8217;ing because it&#8217;s just so much MORE comfortable without! I wish I&#8217;d done it my whole life! (And I KNOW some of you are doing it too because you&#8217;ve told me so, so don&#8217;t you give me that look ;))</p>
<p><strong>Jigsaw Puzzles</strong> &#8211; While I was hooked there for <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hot minute</a> over the holidays, I actually can&#8217;t even tell you the last time I broke one out&#8230; Probably January?! It was fun while it lasted, but then I got tired of feeling so lazy and had to join Real Life again, haha&#8230; And I&#8217;m glad I did. Else none of those new things up there would have come to pass! Cuz puzzles take so dang long!!! I&#8217;ll probably whip one out again this upcoming holiday season (why do puzzles feel so good at Xmas??!), but my obsession there has come to an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>So there you have it! I&#8217;ve turned from a coffee shop reader/lazy puzzle person earlier in the year, to a gym/yoga/soccer ACTIVE person now here towards the end of it! Wouldn&#8217;t have ever predicted that, but as the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year of The Flow</a> continues, I&#8217;m constantly being surprised at what life puts in front of me, and even more excited to see what&#8217;s coming next&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>Now tell me what you&#8217;ve been up to! Any new and fun habits of your own forming? Has anything completely surprised you lately, for the better or the worse!? How are those finances going????</strong> </em></p>
<p>Probably good to at least talk about money for a second here since it&#8217;s still somewhat of a finance blog ;) As for me, the growth continues to climb with having <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so much invested in the stock market</a> these days, but recently we stopped contributing to the pot with me being out of work and not wanting to siphon away too much from our savings. So that&#8217;s the *bad* news.</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that we more or less break even every month which means I can continue with this <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/wifefi-status-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WifeFI</a> adventure for however long we like without tapping into investments! And right now, &#8220;we&#8221; most certainly like ;) I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll stumble into some money making venture at some point, but for now &#8211; Namaste! <em><strong><em>T</em>he Project of ME continues!</strong></em></p>
<p>Your friend in money and body (and soul),</p>

<p><strong>Just got this book in the mail from blogger/hustler/entrepreneur extraordinaire, Chris Guillebeau, and if it&#8217;s any indication of his past best-sellers this should be a good one too. </strong>You might remember Chris from the Art of Non-Conformity blog back in the day or his popular book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3E0t83M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The $100 Startup</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip about it from <a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his website</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;A fascinating tour of this brave new world where novelty and creativity are currency, and the creators are in control. From the community of gamers getting paid to play, to the armchair pundits beating the bookies in online prediction markets, to TikTok “Sleepfluencers,” AI artists, and the band of renegade investors upending the rules of finance, in the world of Gonzo Capitalism, anything goes.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>This one my best friend SWEARS BY, which is saying something since he *hates* money books, but in a way it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;business/hustling&#8221; book than it is money&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>I tried reading it after he gave me his copy, but my mind is no longer in the &#8220;get rich and powerful!&#8221; mentality so perhaps it&#8217;s better suited for someone else :) It <em>was</em> super interesting though which kept my attention for the first few chapters, so if you&#8217;re looking for some tough love motivation or just want something *different* to read (it really is different!) you&#8217;ll want to check it out&#8230;</p>

<p>PS: For those of you who don&#8217;t know who Felix Dennis is (I didn&#8217;t), he was the founder of Maxim Magazine and a bunch of other super popular computer mags back in the day&#8230; He also randomly loves poetry which he made sure to scatter all throughout it which makes for an interesting juxtaposition (I told you it was different!)</p>

<p><strong>Now this one was brought to my attention by Hal Hershfield himself looking to get the word out and just recently dropped this summer.</strong> I haven&#8217;t had the chance to skim it yet, but he does seem to be a legit dude and the topic very much applies to what we&#8217;re about here.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip from <a href="https://www.halhershfield.com/yourfutureself" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his website</a> to see if you like it:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all had the desire to travel through time and see what our lives will be like later in life. While we want the best possible future for ourselves, we often fail to make decisions that would truly make that a reality. Why do we choose steak over vegetables at dinner, waving off concerns about high cholesterol? Why do we splurge on luxury cars rather than save for retirement? Why can’t we stick to our exercise programs? Why are so many of us so disconnected from our future selves?</p>
<p>Based on over a decade of groundbreaking research, Your Future Self explains that, in our minds, our future selves often look like strangers. Many of us view the future as incredibly distant, making us more likely to opt for immediate gratification that disregards the health and wellbeing of ourselves in the years to come. People who are able to connect with their future selves, however, are better able to balance living for today and planning for tomorrow. Your Future Self presents the science, describes the mental mistakes we make in thinking about the future, and gives us practical advice for imagining our best future so that we can make that a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s another new book that just dropped in June, and similarly Bill Hines reached out to offer up a free copy.</strong> It&#8217;s already hit the top lists of Personal Money Management, Investing Basics, College Financing, and Home Buying/Selling so seems to be resonating with people!</p>
<p>More from <a href="https://amzn.to/47KTp3L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;This book is the way to financial peace, to relieving the number one stressor in our lives and relationships. It’s the guide to living every day on your own terms, and never having to go to a job you no longer love, of never having to miss those important life events. I’ll keep it simple—just the way your personal finances should be! The first word of the title is no coincidence. KISS means Keep It Simple Silly! Maybe I’ll even make you laugh. Your household should measure success in ‘happy’, not some corporate financial metric.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why some things just click and others don&#8217;t (I&#8217;ve never been a veggie man in my life!) but here we are going into our 5th straight week now and I have yet to miss a single day without my new favorite green cocktail.</p>
<p>IT FEELS SO GOOD!!! And I blame you, <em>Madiha</em>, for introducing me to it!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>She wrote me this note last month and it&#8217;s completely transformed my eating habits:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Hey! Please watch the documentary, <a href="https://youtu.be/q3I8hK3OqwY?si=nAsbynYStbc7K5i-&amp;t=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fat Sick and Nearly Dead</a>. Part 1 and 2 on youtube. The director, joe cross, did 40 days of green juicing exclusively to lose weight and cure himself of autoimmune skin diseases. It really works, God Willing. I hope and pray for your good health.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/q3I8hK3OqwY?si=nAsbynYStbc7K5i-&amp;t=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-67644 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster.jpg" alt="fat sick and nearly dead" width="361" height="558" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster.jpg 660w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster-194x300.jpg 194w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster-550x850.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster-324x500.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Of course at first I rolled my eyes and was skeptic as hell, because come on &#8211; it screams scam!!</strong> And MLM! And any other &#8220;fast fixes&#8221; out there! But I also know that sometimes things <em>are</em> legit (like FIRE, Britney Spears), and if someone took the time to recommend something to me I&#8217;m at least going to check it out for a minute and not be a dick&#8230;.</p>
<p>So I loaded it up on YouTube and a few seconds turned into a few minutes, and a few minutes turned into 30 minutes, and before I knew it I had consumed the entire thing &#8211; and its counterpart, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDeTKomY4P8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fat Sick and Nearly Dead 2</a>! &#8211; and immediately knew it was for me. It just clicked. As if Jesus himself came down to me and proclaimed &#8220;The time has come!! Drink your veggies!!&#8221; Lol&#8230;</p>
<p>I figured there were no downsides in trying either. Worst case I eat a lot of vegetables (*gasp*), but best case I get healthier and happier and just better feeling all around! Which is really saying something since I&#8217;m<em> already</em> a pretty happy guy, but hey &#8211; you can always strive to be *better* right?</p>
<p><strong>Well, it&#8217;s now been over a whole month and I can confidently tell you this freakin&#8217; juice works :)</strong> And before you roll your eyes too, let me just show you what&#8217;s in it so you know it&#8217;s literally just veggies! No magic pills or powder or herbs or whatever else people are hawking these days. It&#8217;s as natural as it gets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-67654 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables.jpg" alt="mean green juice veggies" width="616" height="439" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables.jpg 700w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables-300x214.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables-550x392.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Kale, green apples, cucumber, lemon, celery, ginger root]</em></p>
<p>I just throw all this into the juicer &#8211; and voila &#8211; I&#8217;m sucking down more nutrients in this one helping that I normally would have in a month! And much more efficient than TRYING TO EAT ALL OF THIS too as a) there&#8217;s no way &#8211; bleh, and b) it hits your bloodstream much faster in juice form than chewing! (At least per the scientists in the doc).</p>
<p><strong>And that&#8217;s all there is to it. No magic sauce, no powders, nothing.</strong></p>
<p>I drink 1 of these every single afternoon, and then supplement it with a fruit/veggie/oats smoothie in the mornings and it&#8217;s completely revitalized me. I&#8217;m sleeping better. I&#8217;m feeling better. I haven&#8217;t had a headache in weeks (not that I got them too often, but usually after a coffee binge I would!! Lol) and so far not a single outbreak of my skin disease either (*knock on wood*).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe for it if you&#8217;re already sold  ;)</p>
<h2>&#8220;Mean Green Juice&#8221; Recipe:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cucumber</li>
<li>2 green apples</li>
<li>4 celery stalks</li>
<li>1 bunch of kale (if you can get it with stalks, get it! 8 stalks)</li>
<li>1 Lemon (or 1/2 a lemon, depending on your taste)</li>
<li>Ginger root (only one inch worth!! Do not burn your face off by putting an *entire* root in like I did at first and almost spraying it across my kitchen cabinets! Ginger is no joke!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The single best effect this has had so far though is that it&#8217;s completely infiltrated my *entire* habits around eating now.</strong></p>
<p>Similar to waking up about your personal finances or relationships/etc, you start to see the bigger picture and realize how all these little habits you&#8217;ve formed over your lifetime has been holding you back. Like the bagel I used to have every single morning, or all the late afternoon snacks I&#8217;d need to keep me energized and filled up on the daily.</p>
<p>The last time I had a bagel has now been over a month (!!) and the last time I had a bag of chips or cookie was&#8230;. well, yesterday! I&#8217;m not a masochist!! LOL&#8230; <em>But</em> it was only the 2nd time I allowed myself to indulge in such a treat since this &#8220;juice awakening&#8221; and let me tell you &#8211; it tastes soooo much better when it&#8217;s not a &#8220;habit treat!&#8221; And if you can believe it, I&#8217;ve even turned down big juicy pieces of Pizza too&#8230; PIZZA!!! Somebody stop me!!</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s like my eyes have finally been opened for the first time in 40 years, and I now realize how poorly I&#8217;ve been treating my body.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a handful of other interesting effects too:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I don&#8217;t eat as many helpings during dinner anymore</strong> (instead of 2-3 per usual, it&#8217;s down to 1-2)</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m accidentally losing a little weight!</strong> (Down 10 pounds and back to my usual &#8220;norm&#8221; before getting sick last year)</li>
<li><strong>My blood pressure has dropped significantly</strong> (I was hovering around &#8220;hypertension&#8221; at 140-something over 70-80, and the past two weeks now averaging 115-125ish over 60-70! A pretty big drop!)</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m finally using all those things in the kitchen I never use.</strong> (Minimalism win!! Lol) Like the blender and peelers and all those extra sets of drinking glasses we&#8217;ve gotten as gifts but had never really needed until now! We go through soooo many glasses now with all these extra drinks added on!</li>
<li><strong>That nagging thought of &#8220;needing to be healthier&#8221; is slowly fading&#8230;</strong> (I no longer have those pangs of regret/wishful thinking about eating better, very much like my new <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volunteering efforts</a> because I&#8217;m finally DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT!)</li>
<li><strong>But probably the best side effect is how excited my kids are too :)</strong> Not only do most of them drink my concoctions every single day (even my 5 y/o!!) but one likes it so much that I told him he never has to eat veggies again if he continues it up, haha&#8230; Which is hilarious because a) there are SO MANY MORE VEGGIES in these drinks than the few we put on his table each day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, but also b) he cannot STAND spinach to the point he has to crumple it up and down it with a large glass of milk every night *while plugging his nose*, and yet he doesn&#8217;t even notice it at all in these cocktails&#8230; It&#8217;s the perfect kid hack!</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah. Super wild and random this whole juicing phenomenon in my household right now, but again, like other things in life when something just feels right and clicks you gotta run with it as far as you can!</p>
<p><strong>And if you&#8217;re wondering about the costs, yes &#8211; it <em>does</em> get pretty pricey as you&#8217;re just loading in sooooooo much food with every single drink.</strong> AND you constantly need to be buying more of it because only so much fits in your fridge and you want it to be as fresh as possible!! But &#8211; it also leads to less snacking and over-gorging yourself with food in general (at least if you have the same effects as I do), so that certainly defrays the costs. I may be spending loads more on vegetables every week, but I&#8217;ve also cut out 90% of the garbage!</p>
<p>The other pricey part can be getting your hands on the juicer itself. But until you&#8217;ve tried it and KNOW it will stick, just borrow one from your friends and family instead! I guarantee one of them has one stashed away in the back corner of their cabinets somewhere from failed attempts of their own, lol&#8230; Maybe even you too? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I borrowed one from my sister (pictured below) and will be forever grateful for it&#8230; Because unlike <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/money-experiments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other experiments</a>, you DO unfortunately need one of these guys to fully give it a go. A blender will get you partially the way there, but the juicer is where the magic lies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67626" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use.jpg" alt="bella juicier i use" width="400" height="531" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use.jpg 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use-226x300.jpg 226w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use-377x500.jpg 377w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><strong>I should also note that that&#8217;s exactly what this is here for me &#8211; an experiment.</strong> Something I&#8217;m trying out and hoping to do *more* of as time goes on, but for now just building up slowly and taking note of how it&#8217;s affecting me.</p>
<p>In the documentary the main subject (<a href="https://www.rebootwithjoe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Cross</a>) takes it to an extreme level because he found himself in a pretty extreme situation: fat, sick, and nearly dead as he puts it ;) So he decided to try out a 60 day &#8220;juice fast&#8221; drinking nothing but this Mean Green juice and that&#8217;s it. No snacks, no meals, no dinners &#8211; nothing! Which of course makes it a compelling documentary to watch, if only to see if he survives in the end, lol&#8230;</p>
<p>But for me it was more of a wake up call realizing just how little veggies (or thought, really) I put into my diet on a daily basis. So as the inspiration struck I decided to just go for it and start juicing as a &#8220;supplement&#8221; to see how it goes rather than any &#8220;meal replacements.&#8221; And as you can see it&#8217;s already had some quite profound effects! (If you are interested in going the &#8220;meal replacement&#8221;/fasting route fyi, then beware you need to float it by your doctor first to make sure it&#8217;s safe!)</p>
<p><strong>Oh, and the taste?! You would assume it&#8217;s gag worthy and anything but enticing, but it&#8217;s actually not that bad! </strong>It&#8217;s weird and *different* tasting, for sure, but it&#8217;s also oddly refreshing. And the bit of ginger you put in there gives it a nice little kick that you often don&#8217;t get with this &#8220;healthy&#8221; stuff. It literally feels like a shower for my insides every time I take a sip, haha&#8230; It cleans out all the dirt and bad stuff in there and makes it all clean and pretty again! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve started incorporating other juices in our household as well to spice things up. Namely a beet one, and you can probably guess why it&#8217;s now one of the kids&#8217; favorites ;)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67614" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face.jpg" alt="beet red lips" width="502" height="318" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face-300x190.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face-550x348.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[Recipe: 3 beets + 4 carrots + 2 oranges!]</p>
<p>All this to say that if any of this juicing stuff interests you here in the *slightest*, please please please AT LEAST watch <a href="https://youtu.be/x9SGWcZwk7c?si=BvCfVHIdDrvtEK4K" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the trailer</a> of the doc and see if it inspires you! If it&#8217;s boring and lame then of course go on your merry way, but if it sparks something like it did for me, then keep going and see where it takes you!</p>
<p><strong>Just adding one glass of green juice to your diet can be enough to improve your life!! You can never have too many veggies!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Big thanks again to Madiha who accidentally turned me into this freak, and big thanks to you all for reading as well ;)</strong></p>
<p>If any of you decide to give this a shot &#8211; please tell me how it all goes!! Friends who juice together, stay together!!</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I really liked this clip from someone who started juicing in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDeTKomY4P8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2nd documentary</a> &#8230; It really is the best part of it all:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize how bad I felt for so long, until I felt this good&#8230; And, in fact, losing weight is probably an important but small portion of the whole equation. Just the introduction to juice into our household has significantly increased the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables that the entire family eats. And I think that&#8217;s really the main benefit of all this.&#8221;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-worse-job-loss/" title="What&#8217;s Worse?" rel="nofollow"><img width="650" height="384" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/neon-question-mark.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/neon-question-mark.jpg 650w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/neon-question-mark-300x177.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/neon-question-mark-550x325.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p><strong>I recently found out that two acquaintances of mine both recently lost their jobs.</strong></p>
<p>One was making OK money and lives close to paycheck-to-paycheck, while the other was making BANK and enjoys all the luxuries that come with that.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re both pretty stressed out about it, but one recently made an off-hand comment that the other will be having a much harder time dealing with it and feels his situation is much better. (They both know each other)</p>
<p><strong>Wanna take a stab at which person said it? :) Friend A with less money but smaller expenses, or Friend B with a bigger income and inflated expenses?</strong></p>
<p>You can probably guess having read this blog for a while, but it was Friend A &#8211; the one with less money! Which of course at first glance wouldn&#8217;t make sense &#8211; why would someone living paycheck-to-paycheck have an easier time with a job loss than someone making much more? &#8211; but as we all know, your *expected lifestyle* tends to play a much larger role emotionally than your state of finances.</p>
<p>Friend A is used to skimping by and has thus learned to craft a decent life around it (his actual words to me were &#8220;I&#8217;m used to living poor&#8221;), while Friend B, aka Mr. MoneyBags, is now used to a more high-flying life and will  have to figure out how to reign it all in now to sustain this lifestyle of his.</p>
<p>Of course, Friend B in theory should have much more stashed away and plenty of areas he could downsize in a pinch (the house, the cars, the &#8220;toys&#8221;), but again the emotional toll on it might be harder to swallow than the financial side &#8211; even if just temporarily. I&#8217;d also have to imagine it&#8217;s much harder to replace a high-paying job of that caliber than an entry-level one too?  So the strain could last quite longer for him than Friend A as well. So long, at least, as Friend A can still keep the lights on and food in the fridge!</p>
<p><strong>Now, it&#8217;s entirely possible that we&#8217;re ALL wrong here, and Friend A just made the comment to make himself feel better because in either situation it blows!</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And now here we&#8217;ve got this blog post being published to thousands of people around the world dissecting a dilemma that none of us knows anything about, lol&#8230; (Which doesn&#8217;t stop it from still being fun, of course ;))</p>
<p>In either case, it&#8217;s interesting to ponder, and regardless of what side you find yourself on it&#8217;s good to KNOW YOURSELF first before one day maybe finding yourself in a similar position scrambling&#8230; As we all know, there is more to wealth than income, and the expenses side is a VERY large part of that. <em>The lower expenses you have, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-less-you-spend-the-less-you-need-to-earn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the less you need to make</a> and the quicker you get to FIRE! </em>It&#8217;s not just about the income, gotta keep ALL the bases in check!</p>

<p>In other news&#8230;. *awkward transition*</p>
<p><b>Happy summer!! I hope y&#8217;all are living your Best Lives and enjoying some good time w/ your kiddos if you have any! (Sanity, that is, hah!).</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing here lately, and thus my absence over the past few months&#8230;</p>
<p>I think last we connected I was starting my journey <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/new-queen-of-grocery-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/new-queen-of-grocery-shopping/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1687553503473000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gADNvAlpsCG9VkzKvPGZH">taking over grocery shopping</a>, and while I&#8217;m still far from being a pro yet, I am proud to say it&#8217;s still going strong and everyone has food to eat every night <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="😁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Though I&#8217;ll admit I still pick up more things than I&#8217;d like based on *convenience* rather than *price*. But maybe that&#8217;s OK now that I don&#8217;t have to watch every penny anymore? The perks of being good with your money for so many years?</p>
<p><b>Speaking of which, this blog turned 15 this year and I totally missed it!</b> 15 years &#8211; crazy!!! Is anyone still here from the start of it? Or even the bulk of it, like when I used to call myself J. Savings???! Hahaha&#8230;. It&#8217;s wild looking back at all the changes in both the blog and my life the past decade and a half, but it&#8217;s cool we&#8217;re still here and hopefully at least a tinee bit wiser :) I love that y&#8217;all still pop in and say hi so we stay connected over the years &#8211; I hope you continue to do that! Friends for life, please!!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/HS7U5ByC0ZkZTZ51oq0Fc0I0LqBQihh0C2NsfN72Q4dUUakdVHA7yKB8FifKLEOppjB6vKBUMRiOYjrtMnR0LIsQSCT-FkmmEya7=s0-d-e1-ft#https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/internet-high-five.jpg" alt="internet high five" width="500" height="463" /></p>
<p><b>I&#8217;ve also been very much enjoying my volunteer work and starting to see it as a 2nd calling.</b> After <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1687553503473000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3RSWcD0-uqJS5IpA0-Ug5R">months of experimenting</a> and figuring out &#8220;my place&#8221; with it all, I&#8217;ve finally carved out a nice position for myself at a local homeless shelter focusing on keeping everyone nice and <em>clothed</em>. Which in itself is pretty valuable, of course &#8211; clothes are important! &#8211; but I&#8217;m realizing more and more that it&#8217;s not just the *stuff* we help the unhoused with, but moreso it&#8217;s about letting them know they are respected and *SEEN*.</p>
<p>The other day I merely asked someone how they were doing, and their exact response back to me was, &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to hear voices.&#8221; That really hit me :( So many people are hidden away from society just trying to survive (and not get arrested!) so when they make the trek into our place they get to be &#8220;normal&#8221; again and surrounded by a community who values them. I think I genuinely now have about 7 new people I call a friend, and while some days are harder than others, it&#8217;s been an incredible journey so far.</p>
<p><strong>And in that same vein of &#8220;being seen,&#8221; people also want to look and FEEL good too!</strong> Sure they&#8217;ll take anything that&#8217;s dry and fits them well, but man do they love CHOICE when given the option. Just as we do. They each have their own fashion style and will clamour for items that fit that as soon as they come into the door :) Last week I brought in a pair of Vans and some skinny jeans and they were taken out of my hands before I even PUT THEM DOWN on the shelves! It actually makes me want to set up some sort of fashion show or something where they can all dress up and strut down the runway rocking their styles as some sort of charity event. But I still don&#8217;t know enough about what&#8217;s &#8220;appropriate&#8221; and what&#8217;s not there yet so for now I just save my ideas to myself&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve also learned how GENEROUS people are with their time and donations</strong> (some of the stuff people donate is nicer than anything I own!!) and also how everyone needs *belts* but they&#8217;re some of the hardest things to come by! So much so that the homeless end up just stripping the laces off the donated shoes and crafting their own makeshift belts right there on the spot&#8230; I see it at least twice a week, and that&#8217;s only on MY shifts! Such a simple &#8211; and cheap thing &#8211; a belt, but man can they be valuable&#8230;</p>
<p>(Speaking of shifts &#8211; my thesis on being able to come and go as you please once an organization knows you more def. stands true! I play nice and go through their system more or less each week, but I also just pop in and out when I feel like it too which as you know is <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/operation-give-back-in-real-life-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my ultimate preference</a>. Especially when you have kids in and out of camps all summer long!)</p>
<p>So needless to say, I&#8217;ve been getting more joy volunteering now than just sitting at the coffee shops or <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing puzzles all day long</a>, lol&#8230; so Phase I of being <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/wifefi-status-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WifeFI&#8217;d</a> is officially over, and now we enter a new one of more productiveness and purpose ;)</p>
<p><strong>Now tell me what you guys have been up to! Anyone else getting into life changing things over there? Or perhaps some fun projects or vacations this summer?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>My kids joined the swim team for the first time ever so we&#8217;ve basically been living at the pool when we&#8217;re all together ;) A whole other experience that I&#8217;ll save for another day, though I will say it&#8217;s finally nice to show off <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/sparrow-tattoos.png.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my tattoos</a> as the only time they see the light of day is when my shirt is off, haha&#8230; So that&#8217;s something.</p>
<p>Okay bye for now.</p>

<p>So when I last left you, I had an epiphany that I should be giving back more (time-wise) but instead of doing it online like I tend to do, I wanted to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test it out in Real Life</a> and make better use of my mornings. You know, now that I don&#8217;t have a job ;)</p>
<p>But the question was &#8211; would it work out in the same way? Simply walking into places and asking if I can help them out for an hour or so? Or would they look at me like a total weirdo and reject me right back into the coffee shop?</p>
<p>Well, I tested it out and learned a TON in the process. Below are the results&#8230; (I still can&#8217;t believe I actually went through with this, haha&#8230;)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Attempt #1: The Community Nonprofit</h2>
<p>As I left the coffee shop <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that morning</a>, completely nervous to the bone, I crossed the street and serendipitously found a nonprofit that&#8217;s literally set up to give back to the community &#8211; perfect!!</p>
<p>They were closed for the day (womp womp), but I saw people milling about inside so I knocked anyways until one of them opened the door to see what this &#8220;character&#8221; wanted (or should I say, they &#8220;cracked&#8221; the door as they were definitely dubious of me!). I then muttered out my first attempt of my spiel:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! Uhh&#8230;&#8230; Do you need help with anything? Like, umm&#8230; I have a free hour? And I think I want to give back?&#8221;</p>
<p>(Total fail of communication, haha&#8230;)</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sure exactly what you&#8217;re asking? How can I help you?&#8221; the gentleman responded, probably regretting he even came to the door <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sorry. I&#8217;d like to volunteer my time and wondering if your organization needs some extra help?&#8221; Much better!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, great. Hold on one moment, let me get you the card of our volunteer coordinator&#8221;. Minutes later he comes back with it and tells me to try again the next morning as maybe they will have something for me then.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure will!&#8221; I replied, and off I scurried before I made an even bigger fool of myself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Win for asking (I was so nervous!!) // Fail at helping&#8230; for now.</em><em><br />
</em></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Attempt #2: The Sporting Goods Store</h2>
<p>After striking out with my first try, I was determined to go again especially as the entire attempt above literally only lasted 4 minutes from start to finish. I walked down the street until I found a place that was open this time &#8211; a sporting goods store &#8211; and walked right in as fast as I could before changing my mind (it really is scary asking this!).</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; I happily greeted the two ladies at the register who were waiting for customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a strange question for you.&#8221; I led with, hoping to set the tone better this time, haha&#8230; &#8220;Would you happen to need any extra help at the moment? I&#8217;m trying to give back to the community more and I have a free hour on my hands.&#8221; #NailedIt</p>
<p>The two ladies were dumbfounded, and turned to each other hoping that the other might have a good answer for me :) Unfortunately they didn&#8217;t, and we stood in awkward silence for a bit until one of them recommended I visit the nearby churches instead as they&#8217;re always looking for extra help. They admitted they&#8217;d never been asked such a question before (and didn&#8217;t need any help either), but loved that I was going around asking which gave me an extra bump of courage I needed to continue on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oooh great idea, thank you!&#8221; I chimed back with. &#8220;And I love your store, btw.&#8221;</p>
<p>I realized I had just been in there weeks before buying a pair of sunglasses, and was glad to be offering my services to a place I actually liked! Not that it would stop me from volunteering there even if I didn&#8217;t, but it felt like I was on the right path even if I had now failed TWICE in a row, haha&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>Another Win for asking / Another Fail at DOING.</strong></em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Attempt #3: The Church!</h2>
<p>Three times a charm, right? I took the ladies&#8217; recommendation to heart, and walked further down the street until I came across a church. I walked in and found the business part of it and gave my more polished spiel again, throwing in a little flair and hoping to finally get a &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me get this straight&#8230;&#8221; the kind church lady replied with her beautiful &#8211; stunned &#8211; eyes. &#8220;You have a free hour from your kids, and rather than spend it at a coffee shop reading and relaxing all morning you&#8217;d rather spend it with us helping out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;d like to do!&#8221; I responded with, laughing a bit to myself realizing how different my goals are now from just a few months ago&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can think of 3 things we can use your help with&#8221; she came back with.</p>
<p>&#8220;1) You can help answer our phones (perfect &#8211; I used to be a customer service manager!), 2) you can help prepare and move all the food we give out every week to our less fortunate friends (also my speed! I can help while giving my muscles a work out at the same time!), and 3) if you&#8217;re willing to hop in your car, we always need help picking up the food that local restaurants donate to us (not a problem at all &#8211; I can listen to music while I drive!).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is any of this something you&#8217;d be interested in?&#8221; she wraps up with, still rather cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;YES!!! To all three! Let&#8217;s do it!&#8221; I excitedly shout back, can&#8217;t believing it&#8217;s working now!</p>
<p>&#8220;Great! Let me take down your info and will have a coordinator get back with you to get the ball rolling&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;oh&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>Another Win for asking, but another Fail yet again at the actual doing&#8230; at least for now.</strong></em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Takeaways So Far&#8230;</h2>
<p>Okay, so up to this point I&#8217;ve come to realize a few things:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s MUCH harder to do stuff *on the spot* than I originally hoped for. Looks like I&#8217;ll have to tone down my expectations a bit and account for some &#8220;intro/organization&#8221; time, at least for those organizations like churches that have their own systems in place.</p>
<p>2) While time will still tell, I think I was more successful with future volunteering because 2 of the 3 places I stopped by were charity-related where it&#8217;s more &#8220;normal&#8221; to volunteer at. It&#8217;s going to be a much bigger challenge if I want to help out at regular stores and such like the sporting goods one, just &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s so out of the ordinary. But I&#8217;m not giving up on it yet!</p>
<p><strong>3) You can always <em>guess</em> at what will happen with your projects/ideas, but you really don&#8217;t know how the world will respond until you actually put yourself out there.</strong> I could never have guessed those 3 things the church needs help with, nor that they&#8217;d all be up my alley!</p>
<p>4) It&#8217;s MUCH more exciting testing stuff in real life than in your mind :) You can do all the thinking you want, but none of it actually matters until you DO SOMETHING about it. This very much applies to your finances and career too.</p>
<p>5) Lastly, getting your money straight allows you to <em>have</em> such freedoms to experiment in this world! As soon as I came back from testing this, I immediately opened up my notepad app on my phone and furiously took notes. Here&#8217;s the first thing I wrote and probably the most impactful:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-67260 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/what-time-affords-you.jpg" alt="what time affords you" width="480" height="380" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/what-time-affords-you.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/what-time-affords-you-300x238.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/what-time-affords-you-550x435.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>This is the epitome of what money affords you &#8211; TIME. Time to spend time with your loved ones, time to work on your passions, time to work on yourself, or time to do whatever it is your heart is requesting of you in that moment.</p>
<p>This day it happened to be around giving back and experimenting, but other times it&#8217;s been all about the leisure or spending time with the fam or even <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being consumed by puzzles</a> ;) But it&#8217;s all a result of getting your MONEY down first!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>So all the above occurred during the *first* day of experimenting, and in the days since I have tried a number of more times with somewhat better results. If you&#8217;ll allow it, I&#8217;d like to highlight two more attempts that have both solidified my hope with this project :)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Attempt #4: Back to the Community Nonprofit!</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t really feeling it the next morning (the doubt started creeping in) but I pushed myself anyways and as always I was proud of doing so in the end. Again, because half the battle is just showing up!</p>
<p>I went right back to that original organization when they opened the next day per the gentleman&#8217;s advice, and was quickly immersed into such a new experience it was like an out of body experience&#8230; Below are my notes from it which I&#8217;ll just copy/paste here since it expresses it pretty well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>&#8211; Went back to [redacted] as previous day&#8217;s guy advised, and a gaggle of homeless(?) people were hanging around the front door, as well as a group who stopped by to drop off backpacks of goodies for them.</p>
<p>&#8211; Super nervous and eyes watering (worst timing ever &#8211; why does it only happen when I&#8217;m nervous?!), but mustered up the courage and waited in line in front of a makeshift booth to offer my services.</p>
<p>&#8211; Whole place smelled and looked funny, but also filled somehow with so much joy and love too? I immediately felt part of a community. Also had no idea how much they do there! Overheard conversations about taking showers and saw someone getting help with job-related stuff with a volunteer behind a computer. I get the sense they do FULL help all around and not just food or donations &#8211; so cool.</p>
<p>&#8211; A look of confusion as usual when I said I have an hour to assist, which is weird since its run by volunteers?, but the lady went back to talk with someone and said I could help fit all the incoming backpacks into storage if I&#8217;d like. Great!!! My first task!! And my first problem(s) too, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; There was a line of people blocking the hallway waiting to get into the storage, and when we walked in it was completely dark and none of us could find the light switch. Eventually the leader of the group did, who was a homeless volunteer I&#8217;d guess*, and then we were ready to stack. Only the said leader started doing it for everyone so I basically just stood there like a big idiot doing nothing waiting for everyone to be done. When the dust settled and everyone was out, I reorganized everything though which I thoroughly enjoyed!, but also knocked some stuff over in the midst of it all so had to re-organize that too, haha&#8230; But first mission complete no less!</p>
<p><em>(*The leader of the group asked if he could have one of the backpacks on his way out, and I told him I wasn&#8217;t sure as I&#8217;m a new volunteer, but he said he&#8217;s taking it anyways and I replied, &#8220;go for it dude&#8221; as it seemed he needed it!)</em></p>
<p>&#8211; Went back to ask what else I can do now that I beautifully arranged their storage cubby, haha, but that was all they had for me :( Said some days are overwhelming and need all the help they can get, and others not so much.</p>
<p>&#8211; Was in and out within 8 minutes- wild!</p>
<p>&#8211; I asked what &#8220;things&#8221; they need more of before I left, like food or clothing or something, and she rattled off a list: clothes, shoes, toiletries, razors, and especially underwear. Of all sizes and sexes. Particularly boxers for the men.</p>
<p>&#8211; A homeless(?) guy in the corner chimed in with &#8220;except for me! I prefer thongs!&#8221; and all of us erupted in laughter. Couldn&#8217;t tell if he was serious or not. I kinda feel like he was ;) Also found it ironic as I&#8217;m on day #7 of <a href="https://twitter.com/BudgetsAreSexy/status/1615363808553324547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wearing NO underwear</a> right now!! (an experiment for another day)</p>
<p>&#8211; I finished up chatting with the volunteers, and on the way out the jovial, round, toothless, thong guy yelled out, &#8220;don&#8217;t forget my thongs! I like them pink!&#8221; and I died laughing again.</p>
<p>&#8211; I think this experiment is going to do me a lot of good :)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">********</p>
<p><strong>So I finally DID something!!! YAY!!! </strong>It wasn&#8217;t at all what I was expecting (not that I was expecting anything in particular?), but it got the ball rolling and I&#8217;ve since been back a number of times donating whatever I can find for them.</p>
<p>Which turns out I&#8217;m really good at! I&#8217;m always finding deals on stuff and running into people with boxes of overflowing things from their overstuffed houses/etc. Now I just funnel it all to one main place there which distributes it to those who can most benefit from it! (And they are fast, sometimes they turn around and give the items out while I&#8217;m still standing there!)</p>
<p><strong>But the biggest takeaway of all this is that there are *opportunities* to help allllll around us if we&#8217;re brave enough to keep our eyes open for them.</strong> Not necessarily by just walking up to places and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomly asking them to help</a> like the dummy I am, haha, but by *noticing* the people around us too who might not be as blessed in life as we are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you one last experience I just had that completely made my day, and reminded me once again that I can do more if I just make more of an effort.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Opportunity #5: &#8220;Lizzy&#8221;</h2>
<p>I met Lizzy (not her real name) 4 days ago on the streets, with no home and nowhere to go. Rounding 60 years old she came up to me asking for a few bucks like many in her position do to keep surviving, and of course I obliged per my rules of &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/3-tricks-i-do-to-make-me-a-more-charitable-person/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always having to say yes</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/3-tricks-i-do-to-make-me-a-more-charitable-person/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give the biggest bill in your pocket so it stings!</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>I happily gave her a $20 and tears immediately started welling up in her eyes. &#8220;Gosh&#8221; I thought&#8230;&#8221;This $20 means nothing to me but is everything to her!!&#8221;</p>
<p>I then went about my day as normal&#8230;</p>
<p>Two days later I ran into her again, and it was just starting to rain/sleet and I had to consciously choose whether to stay put and chat with her or to run to my warm cozy car which I wanted to do SO BAD!!! But something forced me to stay right there and strike up a conversation as if it was something we both needed, but for different reasons.</p>
<p><strong>And then we chatted&#8230; and chatted&#8230;.. and chatted.</strong></p>
<p>We stood there in the rain for a good hour laughing and learning all about each other and it completely made my morning. I learned she had some kids of her own, once owned a nice house and car/etc, and just genuinely seemed like an overall beautiful person. Of course I WANTED to find out what happened to leave her in such a miserable position, but I didn&#8217;t pry and chose to listen instead.</p>
<p>The whole time I just stood there and did my best to let it all sink in and really &#8220;feel it&#8221; instead of blocking it out and moving on with life as many of us tend to do. I stopped thinking of my damn warm car and how wet I was getting and just sucked it up for an hour as this poor lady will be drenched the entire day so who the hell am I to complain?!</p>
<p>My heart went out to her so much. Maybe because it was her, maybe because I was in a time of my life where I could pay attention more, or maybe it was just something else totally unrelated. All I know is that it hit me hard and I felt like we were genuinely going to be friends from that point forward.</p>
<p>I also learned she had just had most of her stuff stolen and had been wearing 3-day old clothes as the remaining items of hers were completely soaked from past days of rain! She was literally down to her only pair of underwear and hasn&#8217;t taken a shower in almost a week!  SO DIFFERENT THAN THE LIVES WE LIVE!!!</p>
<p>But I think it hit me most when she said she just wanted to brush her hair but the same asshat stole that too, as well as her purse which held all her IDs (annoying enough to replace even when you have a home and money!). I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing, and all I thought was to just give her the biggest hug I could which I did. Twice.</p>
<p><strong>We then parted ways and I made it my mission that day to fill up a bag full of warm goodies specifically for her.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I jumped in my car and went straight to Walmart, Goodwill, and the grocery store and picked up everything I thought she could mostly use like new clothes, underwear, and of course a hairbrush.</p>
<p>And even going through these stores with my new knowledge was completely eye opening to me. There was so much superfluous stuff at these places – particularly at Walmart!! – with half the stuff being worthless on the streets. I love me some fashion, but damn – half the clothes were midriffs or super thin or had a million holes in it! And other amenities we’re so accustomed to having requires electricity which of course does you absolutely no good in their daily lives…</p>
<p>It was like I was in the twilight zone and I actually started feeling a bit nauseous thinking about it all. Eventually I snapped to, and continued on with my plan&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[I took the first picture, and then realized I had forgotten a few things so went back to collect some more&#8230; The fanny pack I thought was a brilliant idea from my wife so she can keep the most important stuff on her!]</em></p>
<p><strong>Then the next day I patrolled the streets, found where she was hanging out, and gave her the bag as well as another big hug.</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stay long enough this time to see how helpful they all were (I also included some snacks, a notebook and pens, and other little goodies) but I could tell she was touched. And so was I.</p>
<p>It was the first time in my life I ever did something like this and it felt amazing. And personal, and direct, and *took effort* rather than just opening up my wallet again! (Which of course is still helpful, but it was nice to have an *arsenal* of ways to help now going forward). She was the best thing to happen to me all week.</p>
<p><em><strong>Win for paying attention to the opportunity // Win for executing on the opportunity!!!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>So yeah, what a whirlwind! All within a week that would have otherwise just been so terribly normal!</p>
<p>And to think this all happened because I took out a pen and paper and just let my brain flow out&#8230; That quote was legit:</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;When you’re stuck, just sit down with a notepad and start writing… your brain has things it wants to say even if you don’t know what they are.&#8221;<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>Indeed it does&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope you found something helpful here, and remember &#8211; you can NEVER go wrong taking action on your ideas. You might not get the response you&#8217;re looking for, but it&#8217;s an automatic Win the second you stop thinking and start *doing*. It might change your life in more ways than you think.</p>
<p>XOXO,</p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;When you&#8217;re stuck, just sit down with a notepad and start writing&#8230; your brain has things it wants to say even if you don&#8217;t know what they are.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>If I had read it last week I probably would have laughed as it sounds so ridiculous, haha, but interestingly I experienced exactly this the other day and it completely changed my trajectory :)</p>
<p>I had arrived at the coffee shop as I always do in the morning, but rather than crack open another book or laptop or any other number of ways to occupy myself, this day I wasn&#8217;t feeling any of it. Instead, I sat there with coffee in my hands, bored, wondering what to do with myself. Then, randomly, something inside me said to just take out a pad of paper and start writing&#8230; anything at all. I opened up my bag to pull out an old pad of paper, and scrawled up at the top was:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;CHANGE IT UP.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I must have written it over a year ago based on the notes around it, but I immediately started nodding my head and giving my past self some mad credit&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!! You said it, J$!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I need to do right now: change it up! You are The Man!!&#8221; lol&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>I flipped to a fresh new page and began writing whatever flowed out of my head not knowing where it would lead&#8230; (remember that quote above??)</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I ended up with:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67238" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/ideas-notes.jpg" alt="ideas" width="527" height="421" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/ideas-notes.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/ideas-notes-300x240.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/ideas-notes-550x439.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<p>The first chunk of ideas my brain pushed out centers around &#8220;learning&#8221; more and jobs I&#8217;ve always thought were cool, then moves to more fun/hobbyesque/mission-centered ideas, and then eventually to the essence of what I believe my heart was *truly* telling me to do more of in that instant: put more GOOD into the world.</p>
<p>Interestingly I had just spent an hour helping people online the day before, and it seems my brain was trying to bring it back up yet again despite me not being smart enough to catch it on my own ;)</p>
<p><strong>I then tried to focus on my main <em>superpowers,</em> to help narrow it down more. This resulted in the following:<br />
</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67240" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/super-powers.jpg" alt="super powers" width="261" height="222" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/super-powers.jpg 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/super-powers-300x255.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" /></p>
<p><strong>Time. Curiosity. People.</strong> Wow&#8230; I had never described myself like that before! And the more I reflected on it, the more true it felt in this current season of my life. I <em>do</em> have a lot of free time on my hands right now for the first time in, well, ever. And I AM super curious no matter what we&#8217;re taking about! And then of course I just love people&#8230; even the haters, bless their hearts.</p>
<p>It also made more sense then as to why I like to tweet out when I have a free hour and <a href="https://twitter.com/BudgetsAreSexy/status/1615744458380673024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ask if anyone needs help with anything</a>. Something about the immediate impact of helping people, coupled with never knowing *exactly* what I&#8217;ll be working on is so oddly alluring. And let me tell you, randomly throwing out these questions brings out some fascinating requests, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>Here are a few of them from <a href="https://twitter.com/BudgetsAreSexy/status/1615744458380673024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Do I drive the old car or the new car for normal use? Old car is on its last legs but gas is cheaper for it (grade and mpg).&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a job interview in 10 years, but I have one today at 5:15 p.m. Any advice from experience on interviewing? Specifically, is there a weird question that you have been asked in an interview?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Any tips on connecting with other people who are enthusiastic on making money online/sidehustles? I&#8217;m in a group with bunch of entrepreneurs but the owner is always &#8220;too busy with my business&#8221; to post content for us and I don&#8217;t have anyone in real life who isn&#8217;t content with a 9-5.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Tips for my website? Still learning but having fun with it :)&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been asked to help cheer people up in the past, offer guidance with their investments, or even give movie recommendations (my two faves currently are &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObN4krVV20Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Swimmers</a>&#8221; on Netflix and &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZInOvqvygrk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pez Outlaw</a>&#8220;). Of course, I&#8217;m far from being an expert on any of these, but I do make it my mission to fulfill these requests the best I can and it&#8217;s always so fun and rewarding.</p>
<p>It also got me thinking&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What would happen if I did this in real life?? Like, what if I just rolled up into places and told them I have an hour to spare and would like to help them with whatever they need right now? Would it work? Would I be similarly fulfilled? Would they laugh and point and think I&#8217;m a psycho?</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>My online friends of course trust and know me well, but to the rest of the world I&#8217;m a total stranger&#8230; and one with a mohawk at that, which does me no favors at all here, lol&#8230;</p>
<p>But the second I got this in my head I became enthralled with it and came up with all the reasons I should try it. It looked like this (I&#8217;ll spare you the chicken scratch this time):</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy way to volunteer fast</li>
<li>No pressure for anyone!</li>
<li>No clue what I&#8217;ll be working on, which is exciting</li>
<li>Get to meet a ton of new people!</li>
<li>100% flexible (I can offer my free help anytime I want, 24/7 &#8211; or not!)</li>
<li>If it sucks, I&#8217;ve only committed one hour (and if I&#8217;m enjoying myself I can keep going!)</li>
<li>Great way to give back to my community I love so much</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s ever been done before? I can start something new?</li>
<li>I get to learn a lot!</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll give me more <em>courage</em> (I&#8217;m social, but also SUPER shy)</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll forever be a &#8220;story&#8221; I can tell</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a fun experiment!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then of course, it could very much fail:<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People probably won&#8217;t trust me or even believe me?</li>
<li>They&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m weird or up to something, haha&#8230;</li>
<li>They&#8217;ll probably give me $hit work to do! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Also maybe a liability issue on their side?</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll probably have to go through proper training or paperwork or something first?</li>
<li>Maybe an hour won&#8217;t be long enough to help&#8230;</li>
<li><del>They&#8217;ll just say no and it will be a huge waste of time&#8230;</del></li>
</ul>
<p>(I quickly crossed out that last one because I don&#8217;t think you can EVER go wrong acting out of love, even if you&#8217;re rejected&#8230; Just asking to help makes it a WIN right out the gate no matter what the answer is! Which is another reason to try it out!)</p>
<p><strong>I stared at these notes for around 20 seconds and immediately had two thoughts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>THIS is what I was called to do right now in my life&#8230; It all makes so much sense!!</li>
<li>No more *thinking* and writing down lists. Go out right now and TAKE ACTION.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was so moved that I packed up my bag, walked out the front door of the coffee shop, and headed straight to the first place I saw before I had a chance to change my mind&#8230; And holy $hit was I scared!!!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you all about what happened next&#8230;</p>
<p>Tomorrow ;)</p>
