<p>Half of them will be going to our local thrift store here, but wanted to see if some of them you guys would like as they&#8217;re pretty on target with what we talk about here&#8230; So if you&#8217;re interested in any of them (and they won&#8217;t clutter up YOUR life!), let me know via email or in the comments below and we&#8217;ll randomly select a winner for each after the weekend&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>Hope your 1/day giveaways are going well too if you&#8217;ve joined me! Even if you only lasted a few days, it&#8217;s still a few less things in your house! But try to keep on going! :)</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Giveaway #1: &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/2K9jWeK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictably Irrational</a>&#8221; by Dan Ariely</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2K9jWeK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-57059" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/predictably-irrational-book.jpg" alt="predictably irrational book" width="382" height="496" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/predictably-irrational-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/predictably-irrational-book-231x300.jpg 231w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /></a></p>
<p>Picked up this book on a beach vacation a couple of years ago, and it was super interesting&#8230; Might have seen me mention it in our post on <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/is-extreme-couponing-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme couponing</a> earlier this year too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet off <a href="https://amzn.to/2K9jWeK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we&#8217;re making smart, rational choices. But are we? &#8230; Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, we consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They&#8217;re systematic and predictable—making us predictably irrational.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Giveaway #2: &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ov3dpY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freakonomics</a>&#8221; by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ov3dpY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-57057" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/freakonomics-book.jpg" alt="freakonomics book" width="388" height="498" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/freakonomics-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/freakonomics-book-234x300.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /></a></p>
<p>Another fascinating (and popular) book! I already have a copy, but apparently forgot to give this out in last month&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/classic-finance-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book giveaways</a>. Here&#8217;s what <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ov3dpY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> has to say about this bad boy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In Freakonomics, they explore the hidden side of . . . well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan. What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a great deal of complexity and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Giveaway #3: &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/2KdIBPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Happiness Project</a>&#8221; by Gretchen Rubin</h2>

<p>Only got through the beginning pages of this one (I&#8217;m already a pretty happy guy! :)), but people seem to rave about it so maybe it&#8217;s worth checking out? She runs a pretty popular blog too: <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gretchenrubin.com/blog</a></p>
<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2KdIBPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Award-winning author Gretchen Rubin is back with a bang, with The Happiness Project. The author of the bestselling 4<em>0 Ways to Look at Winston Churchill</em> has produced a work that is “a cross between the Dalai Lama’s <em>The Art of Happiness</em> and Elizabeth Gilbert’s <em>Eat, Pray, Love.</em>&#8220;&#8230; In the vein of <em>Julie and Julia</em>, The Happiness Project describes one person’s year-long attempt to discover what leads to true contentment. Drawing at once on cutting-edge science, classical philosophy, and real-world applicability, Rubin has written an engaging, eminently relatable chronicle of transformation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;">*********</p>
<p><strong>I’m 36. I’m a government employee. And, I’m a self-made millionaire.</strong></p>
<p>There I said it.</p>
<p>I’ve never publicly shared that before, not even on my own blog, but since J. Money provided a mountaintop here I might as well shout something exciting from it!</p>
<p>Here is the obligatory screenshot from <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/personal-capital-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personal Capital</a> to prove it:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-55193" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/personal-capital-millionaire.png" alt="personal capital millionaire" width="608" height="231" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/personal-capital-millionaire.png 965w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/personal-capital-millionaire-300x115.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[I use Personal Capital to track all my money and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/personal-capital-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly recommend</a>. And for those wondering, yes, this figure does include my house&#8217;s value.]</em></p>
<h2>How Did I Do It?</h2>
<p>Well, the answer will blow your mind&#8230;</p>
<p>Are you ready? Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>I lived below my means</li>
<li>I was resourceful</li>
<li>I saved and invested</li>
<li>I was patient</li>
</ol>
<p>Incredibly sexy stuff, huh?</p>
<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>Let me give a little background on how I reached this point.</p>
<p>When I graduated from college, I was broke. Like, Ramen noodles for dinner on a regular basis, broke.</p>
<p>The summer before my senior year of college, I decided to stay at school and take as many summer courses as I could. Call me lazy, but I just didn’t want to hold a part-time job while also taking so many classes and studying all the time. So I ended up exhausting all my funds.</p>
<p>I was stupid. I should have gotten a job and worked, but I didn’t. It was a self-inflicted wound, and I had nobody to blame but myself. I even remember a time when I was telling my friend about the rough shape my bank account was in, and a Walmart employee decided to eavesdrop. I told my friend I couldn’t even get a credit card, and the Walmart employee interjected telling me that <em>everyone</em> could get a credit card. He proceeded with: “What is wrong with you?”</p>
<h2>My Awesome Parents</h2>
<p>So where does a guy go with no money to his name when he graduates from college?</p>
<p>He moves back home with his parents, of course! But there was a caveat. They wanted me to create a plan for the future so that I wouldn’t be <em>that guy</em> who lived in his parents’ basement forever. I planned to save as much money as I could while living with them in order to one day buy a home.</p>
<p>My parents were shockingly happy to help out with my plan. It might have had something to do with my younger sister leaving for college &#8211; I’m not sure they were ready to be empty nesters.</p>
<p>I was also fortunate that my parents didn’t charge me any rent. The biggest perk was probably my mom’s home-cooked meals though. Let’s just say I was living the life! I was able to save almost every dollar that I made. My future home down payment was growing rapidly.</p>
<h2>Helpful Advice From a Colleague</h2>
<p>For my first job, I worked as an insurance adjuster, so I was the guy you talked to if you were in a car accident. Admittedly, I was burned out from all the finance courses in college, so I embraced the world of interfacing with a variety of people. I actually think it really improved my communication skills.</p>
<p>Since I was a freshly-minted graduate, I received a ton of advice from some well-meaning people. At 23, I thought I already knew everything. But, some advice really did stick with me.</p>
<p>An older colleague pulled me aside one day and told me the most valuable piece of advice:<em> live below your means and don’t let peer pressure cause you to spend frivolously. </em>He also told me that if I ever received a raise, to save and not spend it. He assured me that I would reach retirement with no problem by following this advice.</p>
<p>At that point, I really didn’t have any expenses. I was fortunate to graduate from college without student loans. I drove a ten year old car that worked fine. Needless to say, I was able to save a boatload of money.</p>
<h2>Buying My First Home</h2>
<p>Over time, I was able to pinpoint where I wanted to live. I even lined up a few guys who wanted to be housemates. They really just didn’t want to live with their own parents anymore.</p>
<p>So after 18 months of saving and looking for a potential home, in June of 2004, at the ripe age of 23, I took the plunge and bought my first home. It was awesome and scary at the same time. Why a bank would lend me $400,000 when I wasn’t even making 10% of that is beyond me. But I wasn’t about to question them.</p>
<p>I charged my housemates the low-end of market rate, since they were all my buddies and I wanted to lock in rental income. I wasn’t really interested in having a bunch of random guys from Craigslist live with me in my house.</p>
<h2>Where My Money Was Going</h2>
<p>So at this point in my financial journey, I was contributing up to my 401(k) match at work, which was 6%, I was maxing out my Roth IRA each year in passive index funds (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPY</a> was my fund of choice back in the day), and I was applying my rental income, along with my paycheck, towards the mortgage.</p>
<p>Every single dollar of income was accounted for each month. I was living very lean, to the point of still driving over to my parents house for hot meals at times of desperation. (Thanks Mom and Dad!)</p>
<p>Did I mention that my house was sparsely furnished? There were rooms in the house that were completely empty. I simply couldn’t afford much more than the bare necessities. Visitors made fun of me, but I wasn&#8217;t bothered. I wasn&#8217;t trying to impress anybody. I owned a home and was proud of my accomplishment! I also wasn’t interested in accruing debt just to spruce up my place.</p>
<h2>Night Classes and Switching Jobs</h2>
<p>After a couple of years working in insurance, one of my roommates who worked for the Federal Government, told me they were hiring accountants. I figured it would be a good opportunity to utilize my four-year degree.</p>
<p>The only problem was that I needed more accounting credits in order to qualify for the position. I began taking night classes at the local community college. My already tight budget became even tighter in order to pay for these courses. I started really shopping for deals on groceries and making sure that I was being efficient with every penny.</p>
<p>Even when I would receive a raise, instead of loosening my belt, I took my coworker’s advice to heart. Instead of splurging, I simply increased my monthly payments to pay off my mortgage.</p>
<p>After I completed my night classes, I received an offer from the Federal Government. That’s when I took the plunge and became a government employee. I enjoyed the accounting work and was content with my situation. Once again, I contributed up to the 401(k) match, which was 5%.</p>
<h2>Tracking My Money</h2>
<p>I began tracking my investments two years after I started working for the government. As you can see below, my liquid assets were $32,500 in January of 2008. I did not include my home’s value as part of my liquid assets at the time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-54652" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rob-money-tracking-2008.jpg" alt="money tracking 2008" width="448" height="164" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rob-money-tracking-2008.jpg 737w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rob-money-tracking-2008-300x110.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p>As you can tell, ten years ago, I was nowhere close to being a millionaire.  So what has happened since then? Well, I put any and all excess money in to my mortgage until <a href="https://mustardseedmoney.com/pay-off-the-mortgage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I finally paid it off in 2012</a>.</p>
<h2>Redirecting All of My Mortgage Money</h2>
<p>After <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/is-it-a-mistake-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-early/">paying off my mortgage</a>, I redirected all my extra money right into my TSP (the government&#8217;s version of a 401(k) plan).</p>
<p>Below is a snapshot of where I was in 2012.  Again, I still did not include my home’s value in these figures at that time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-54648" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rob-money-tracking-2012.jpg" alt="money tracking 2012" width="343" height="169" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rob-money-tracking-2012.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rob-money-tracking-2012-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /></p>
<p>From 2008 to 2012, my investments quadrupled. But, I was still a long way off from being a millionaire.</p>
<h2>Then&#8230; I Got Married</h2>
<p>I had always expected my future wife and I to spend a few years practicing extreme saving. I assumed we would both be working full-time jobs and racking up our moolah, and then maybe when we had kids, she would have the flexibility to stay at home. Well, that was not exactly how it happened.</p>
<p>When I started dating my wife, she had recently graduated from college and was working a 9-5, trying to decide whether or not to enroll in law school. Soon after we got together, however, her mother tragically passed away from breast cancer, at the age of 52.</p>
<p>My wife decided that she needed to care for her special needs sister full-time. Her sister had been extremely dependent on their mother, and my wife knew she had to put her sister’s needs first. My wife put her future plans aside and assumed her mother’s role as best as she could. That meant no longer working a 9-5, and thus no 2nd income.</p>
<p>When we got married, my wife was really disappointed that she couldn’t financially contribute to the monthly expenses. Even though she was at peace with her role caring for her sister, she wanted to help in our goal of super saving and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaching FIRE</a>. That’s when she started to focus on really creative ways to slash our spending.</p>
<h2>Getting Our Savings Rate Up to 65%</h2>
<p>My wife started with our grocery bill. She quickly discovered Aldi (one of the best low cost grocery chains), and began spending more time searching for deals and coupons at regular grocery stores as well. Our meals became decided on whatever was on sale in the weekly circulars.</p>
<p>Up until that point, I had never really paid attention to cutting costs at the grocery store. However, my wife quickly reduced our monthly food bill from $500/mo to $400/mo, without scrimping on quality .</p>
<p>Amazing how spouses can help spur those types of changes! My wife has been so efficient with cutting costs that we have since saved 65% of our take-home pay every single year since 2013.</p>
<h2>Value Spending</h2>
<p>We decided to “value” spend very quickly in our marriage. That simply meant that we would spend money in areas that were really important to us, and try to save as much money as possible in all other areas.</p>
<p>Since 2012, my wife and I have cruised to Alaska and Europe. We’ve traveled to warm destinations in the Caribbean. We’ve had the time and discipline to spend money on things we value.</p>
<p>Amidst all of our saving, we eventually decided we were ready to grow our family. Admittedly, I was a bit worried. Adding members to a family isn’t very conducive to saving money.  I wasn’t sure how we would reach all of our financial goals while also raising children?</p>
<p>I figured that we would have to sacrifice our 65% savings rate. Little did I know how wrong I was.</p>
<h2><em>My wife is a hustler</em></h2>
<p>She started to kick it up a notch. She became more intense about couponing. Not only did she use the weekly circular, but she also started seeking out online printable coupons. That reduced our food bills even further. Then, we started seriously using Craigslist. We set alerts for specific baby items and picked up quite a bit at very low prices. Some stuff was even free.</p>
<p>I had no idea that there were so many people willing to get rid of their baby stuff free of charge? We picked up free kids clothes from yard sale leftovers and various curb alerts. Another nice thing is that it spurred our generosity too. We have given away quite a few of these items over the years, and so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>On top of that, we didn’t let our pride get in the way of accepting hand-me-downs. My wife and I love to go on walks, and one night we noticed that a neighbor was throwing out some awesome baby stuff. That included TWO double strollers and kids toys (with the toy box!). We couldn’t believe our eyes. We asked if they were really tossing the stuff, and they confirmed. It was like we hit the jackpot!</p>
<h2>Salary Increases and Government Benefits</h2>
<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the salary increases that I received along the way as well. When I first started with the government, I ranked at the lowest grade level among my peers. I was barely scraping by, especially living in an expensive area like DC.</p>
<p>Thankfully over the years, I was recognized for my hard work and have experienced recurring pay bumps. While my salary does not exceed the median income for my county, or even compared to the private industry, I’m living much more comfortably these days.</p>
<p>I have also earned 12 years worth of a federal pension since I first started working in the government, however, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/do-you-include-pensions-in-your-net-worth-how-about-art-insurance-homes-cats-baseball-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar to J. Money</a>, I exclude it because it feels almost like adding Social Security benefits to my net worth. Sure, I should receive benefits from my pension later in life, but there is no guarantee. Things are always subject to change, and I have no idea whether these benefits could be reduced down the road. I’ll just consider anything I receive later as gravy if it ends up coming through.</p>
<h2>Stock Market Returns</h2>
<p>And of course, I need to address the immense growth we’ve had with the bull market lately as well. Since March of 2009 when the S&amp;P 500 bottomed out at 676.53, we have had an incredible run. I continued to be diligent in maxing out both my TSP and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/5-ways-to-fund-your-sexy-roth-ira/">Roth IRA contributions</a> the entire time.</p>
<p>I remember being discouraged every time I put money into the market during those first days, just to watch it go down. But then, I had a friend pull me aside and say, &#8220;Just think, you’re getting to buy all these great companies at discount prices. They’ll go back up, and you’ll be happy that you bought when you did!&#8221;</p>
<p>While I was tempted at times to jump out of the market, I stayed put and watched as my net worth eventually grew and grew. At the end of September 2017, my wife and I officially became <a href="https://mustardseedmoney.com/paper-millionaire/">paper millionaires</a>, as our net worth exceeded $1,000,000.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I have to say that I thought the two comma mark would bring some relief, but honestly, not much changed. We still seek out great deals and save as much as possible so that we can enjoy retirement that much sooner.</p>
<p>I wish there was a more magical formula that I could share with you today. However, as boring as it sounds, all we did was live below our means and were consistent in investing our money.</p>
<p><em><strong>I am living proof that hard work, patience, and resourcefulness will get you where you want to go.</strong></em></p>

<p>A reader recently unloaded a whole bunch of (pretty hilarious) thoughts on it which we&#8217;ll get to in a bit, but a quick search of my own E.C. postings definitely points to the fad no longer being a fad anymore&#8230; (Though of course <em>regular</em> couponing will always be in, as it&#8217;s just plain smart!)<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Here are all the articles we&#8217;ve published on extreme couponing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jan, 2011: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/extreme-couponing-wow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extreme Couponing. WOW.</a></li>

</ul>
<p>It all came full circle, haha&#8230; And my friend Debbie here seems to be over it too.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some comments mashed together from her, which can pretty much be summed up with this line here &#8211; </strong><em><strong>&#8220;coupons were almost a narcotic to me.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>Sounds about right :)</p>
<blockquote><p>Extreme couponing was a real problem when we moved. Hauling 96 packages of toilet paper, 72 tubes of toothpaste, 66 sticks of deodorant, 84 rolls of paper towels, 69 bottles of body wash/shampoo, 57 bars of soap, 48 bottles of dish detergent was exhausting, not to mention countless cans of veggies, soups, tomato sauce, peanut butter, jelly, and boxes of everything from cookies to mac &amp; cheese. We have enough toothbrushes to last into the next century.</p>
<p>The list goes on &amp; on but the real killer was 46 heavy containers of laundry detergent. What a pain in the ankle (and every other bone it took to move all these treasures…cough cough).</p>
<p>And yes, I had already donated a ton of my stockpile! This is when I FINALLY realized this obsession had gone off the deep end. God forbid I missed a sale or a coupon expired at one of the 10 stores I shopped &#8211; I’d cry in my pillow all night, LOL. Okay it wasn’t quite that bad but man, this was a drain on my time &amp; emotions running from store to store &amp; hoping to get there before they ran out of stock on a good sale item (I always fell for the fine print in an ad “while supplies last” = run to store immediately).</p>
<p>I remember once a month Harris Teeter had &#8220;Super Double Coupons&#8221;. They doubled any coupon up to $2 (so a $2 coupon would double to $4). They were the only store in the area to do this. Lines of people added to my anxiety &#8220;forcing&#8221; me to get up at 4AM to arrive at the store at 4:20AM to beat the competition on the first day of Super Doubles. Store policy though? No check out before 7AM during Super Doubles.</p>
<p>Like an idiot, I shopped the store 2 hours &amp; stood on line over 1/2 hour until they opened the cash registers at 7AM. Some sale items were out of stock by 7AM on the first day! And they almost never restocked during the sale (I knew this as I’d go back to the store 2-3 times during Super Doubles after I printed out more coupons or if my mother snail mailed me more coupons) so this added to my frenzy.</p>
<p>Coupons were almost a narcotic to me. Today I’m proud to say I’ve attended Super Double coupons only twice since we moved &amp; it was purely by accident that I walked into the store for something else I needed. It’s nice living off this stockpile, but I now only clip coupons for things needed in the immediate future &amp; only go to 2 grocery stores within 2 miles of each other. I stock up on sale items we use, with or without a coupon &amp; no more big stockpiles.</p>
<p>I no longer HUNGER for this FEEDING frenzy, LOL. No more extreme anything for me except regret for letting myself get caught up in this crap. What good is having 50 jars of peanut butter if they all expire next week?</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>PS: I also used to wait in the parking lot for drug stores to open at 7AM, especially on Sundays, when traffic was low &amp; the sales started. Everyone knew me by my first name since I was a regular customer. Since we moved &amp; I broke the coupon addiction, no one knows me in any store now, LOL.</p>
<p>PPS: I found myself emailing companies often too, asking for <em>more</em> coupons and pretending to be a brand new customer wanting to try out their products. It worked every time. Presto, more coupons emailed or snail mailed to me. Lordy lordy, what a trap I allowed myself to fall into&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh Debbie :) But rest assured, I guarantee you&#8217;re not alone here.</strong> I bet if we polled everyone reading this right now, at least 10% would admit to extreme couponing in some fashion or another! I would have too if I weren&#8217;t so lazy! Haha&#8230;</p>
<p>But it really was such a craze&#8230; I remember reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2GclST5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Predictably Irrational</a> over the summer by Dan Ariely (a fantastic book, btw), and a big part of it was how everyone goes gaga for &#8220;FREE&#8221; anything as if it were in our genes and we couldn&#8217;t control it, haha&#8230; But then if the cost changed from $0.00 to $0.10 or even $0.01, the excitement dropped sharply! Even though we&#8217;re talking about literal pennies!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54783" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/its-for-free.gif" alt="it's for free" width="500" height="211" /></p>
<p>We are a crazy race, let me tell you&#8230; And I fully admit to falling for this &#8220;FREE&#8221; trick over the years too. (&#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/have-you-ever-signed-up-to-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Free t-shirt? And all I have to do is sign up for your $200/year credit card???</a> GIVE ME THREE PLEASE!!&#8221; Ugh&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>But it is what it is, and Debbie left us with a few helpful tips from her experiences. Which she aptly labeled as &#8220;The best advice in the world.&#8221;<br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/what-if-you-just-dont-spend-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stay out of stores!</a> See less, buy less, spend less!</li>
<li>Shop at only 1-2 grocery stores &amp; use their sale inserts</li>
<li>Clip a few coupons <em>only</em> for items you truly use/need</li>
<li>Put the rest in the recycle bin</li>
</ol>
<p>And then also added, &#8220;If you truly want to save $$, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/free-budget-templates-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up a budget</a>, say $75 a week. Then take this $75 CASH to the grocery store &amp; you won&#8217;t/can&#8217;t spend more. It worked for us years ago when we were saving for a house, long before the coupon crazies took over my sanity!&#8221; Hah!</p>
<p><strong>So what do you think? Is extreme couponing over, or is it just living underground more hiding from its rap? Did you ever get into it, or are currently into it? Tell us all your stories!!</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m pro saving money, but def. not into spending gobs of time and/or stressing about it&#8230; Although out of all the addictions to have, there could be worse things to snort! ;)</p>

</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>Many people think it’s impossible for a family to just live on one income nowadays.</strong> In fact, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/ft_dual-income-households-1960-2012-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60% of families are dual income</a>, with both mom and dad working outside the home, while back in 1960, 70% of families had only the dad working outside the home.</p>
<p>My family is different – we’re in the 6% of families where only the mom works outside the house. And we’re not just living on one income. No, we’re on FIRE in a big way, saving and investing more than half my income and working toward financial independence in my early 40’s.</p>
<p>We’re a “traditional” family, but in reverse. I’m the breadwinner who heads to work in corporate IT while my husband stays home caring for the kids, cooking, cleaning, and running errands :) I support my family of five humans – me, my husband, and three boys ages 13, 9, and 2 – the dog, and the cat.</p>
<p>How did we end up like this? How do you pursue <a href="http://rockstarfinance.com/history-of-financial-independence-early-retirement-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FIRE</a> on one mom’s income? Let me show you&#8230;</p>
<h2>How It Happened</h2>
<p>When my husband and I first got married over 15 years ago, we were both blissfully ignorant and naive.  I fully expected we would both work forever and earn roughly the same amount. I was 21 years old working full time in a call center, putting myself through <a href="http://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/04/17/debt-free-bachelors-degree-overcoming-overwhelming-odds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-time college debt free</a>, and my husband worked full time in a factory. We didn’t make a lot – roughly $25k each &#8211; but it was enough to get us by.</p>
<p>Our oldest son was born a few years later, and I had gotten a better job paying $35k per year in corporate IT. We originally shopped around for daycares, but had to look at different paths once we realized we couldn&#8217;t afford it on our salaries. At first, my husband switched to the third shift at the factory, but that took a huge physical toll on him (working overnight is rough!). I then got a decent raise at work, and we calculated that my husband could leave the factory job and take a well-paying part time night/weekend gig turning apartments into condos. So he did, but after a year and a half the work dried up and he went back to the factory to work the second shift (evenings instead of overnight).</p>
<p>I would work 6 AM until 3 PM, come home, then my husband would immediately go to work from 4 PM &#8211; 12:30 AM. We saved and invested for retirement and college, eventually selling our condo and buying a house.  Our middle son was then born in 2007, and we were getting by OK. The downside of this schedule, of course, is only seeing each other on the weekends. Life continued on this path for a few years until the Great Recession.</p>
<p>Then things became difficult. My husband’s factory closed down, and factory work where we live was impossible to find. We didn&#8217;t know it then, but my husband would never work another full time job again. Although the job loss wasn’t ideal, we were able to figure things out.  I was in an MBA program and could go to classes on nights and weekends while working full time, and we still managed to pay our bills while saving and investing. Though it was definitely a struggle, and at times we took on some debt.</p>
<p>Finding a job in the depths of the Great Recession that would (1) allow us to continue having someone at home all the time or (2) pay enough to cover daycare expenses proved impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Then, the unthinkable happened. When my husband was 37, five years ago, <a href="http://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/03/06/going-into-crisis-mode-when-it-all-goes-to-hell-a-story-of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he almost died of septic shock</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Overnight, his unemployment evaporated. Working became impossible. It took about four months for him to recover enough drive a car, let alone care for our boys again, so we pulled the youngest out of preschool and enrolled him into daycare full-time. We stopped all savings and investments, and had to get by on less income to free up more money to pay for the extra $1k/month in daycare costs, plus all the new medical expenses now.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51837" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chief-mom-officer-dad-son.jpg" alt="chief mom officer dad son" width="400" height="488" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chief-mom-officer-dad-son.jpg 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chief-mom-officer-dad-son-246x300.jpg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><strong>That event was our financial turning point.</strong> It was then that I realized we could live just fine on my income, and eventually <em>thrive</em> off it. We figured out how to cut all expenses to the bone, eventually getting used to &#8211; and enjoying! &#8211; our new normal.</p>
<p>Debt, even “good” debt or “small” debt, kills you when things go wrong. I had vowed to get rid of all our debt and achieve <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at/">financial freedom</a> once and for all. I got extremely aggressive about freeing up cash flow, and within 18 months we terminated the remaining $33k from our car and MBA loans.</p>
<p>That was three and a half years ago now, and ever since we’ve lived on only my income. We use more than half of it to save, invest, and pay down our mortgage. My financial goals now are <a href="http://chiefmomofficer.org/2016/11/07/why-i-want-to-be-free-of-my-2-75-mortgage-in-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to be mortgage free by the end of 2019</a>, fully fund my three boys <a href="http://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/02/20/creating-your-college-compact-in-five-easy-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">college compact</a>, and achieve financial independence in my early 40’s.</p>
<h2>How We Thrive On Mom&#8217;s Income</h2>
<p>In my real life, I don’t know any other moms that work full time supporting their family while their husband is a stay at home dad. And I don’t know anyone for that matter who&#8217;s pursuing FIRE, even on <em>two</em> incomes, and especially not people saving/investing over half their incomes.</p>
<p>Here are five keys on how we&#8217;re able to do it:</p>
<h3><strong>#1. Artificial Environment of Economic Scarcity</strong></h3>
<p>I don’t budget (gasp! Horror!) except when I was aggressively paying down debt. Instead, I automatically save and invest to reach my financial goals, and <em>then</em> I spend the rest on whatever’s needed for the month.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Stanley in <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/book-review-millionaire-next-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Millionaire Next Door</a> refers to it as creating an &#8220;artificial environment of economic scarcity.&#8221; Since I don’t have money in my checking account, it’s not there to spend. I took out a 15-year mortgage specifically to force myself into higher payments. I automatically save/invest for college, retirement, and mortgage freedom. And then I only spend what’s left over after I’ve put aside what I need for my goals.</p>
<h3><b>#2. Income Inflation, and Lifestyle Deflation</b></h3>
<p>Back in crisis mode, I deflated our lifestyle while increasing our income. As they say in the London Underground, “Mind the Gap” – I take that to be <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/have-money-left-over-each-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the gap between income and spending</a>.</p>
<p>During our financial turning point, I eliminated tons of expenses that have never returned to our life. We sold things, ended subscriptions, lowered our fixed costs, and have kept them low. I happily pay $4 for my <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ooma-review-free-home-phone-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ooma phone</a> instead of the $50 I was paying before, and then $25 for Netflix and HBO subscriptions instead of whatever ridiculous amount cable costs nowadays. I shop at warehouse clubs for all our groceries and household goods, and shop around for car and home insurance every year. We go on camping vacations and road trips and have a blast – no expensive day trips or vacations.  While my coworkers shop for second homes, we go to the park to play.</p>
<p>As for the income inflation side? Well, I finished that MBA about four years ago, and combined with my career strategy, my income has increased by over $40k since. Now over half of every dollar I earn goes straight to buying freedom. I’m no longer willing to work for “stuff” – I work for myself and my family.</p>
<h3><b>#3. Frugal Fun</b></h3>
<p>My co-workers on two incomes have new homes, second homes, new cars, expensive vacations, home remodels, expensive weekend trips, and so on. We live in the house we bought 11 years ago when we only had one kid (we&#8217;re now up to three).</p>
<p>We do fun things like <a href="http://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/02/10/a-fun-and-frugal-11-weekend-in-connecticut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spending $11 on day trips</a> (thanks to Groupon, used book stores, and free museums), go to <a href="http://chiefmomofficer.org/2016/10/28/five-frugal-family-festival-lessons-hot-air-balloons-muffins-and-coffee-oh-my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free hot air balloon festivals with homemade muffins</a>, and we even host “<a href="http://chiefmomofficer.org/2016/11/11/chopped-championship-5-tips-for-free-family-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chopped Championship</a>s” with food we have around the house. The library is our friend, giving us free books, movies, and even a 3D printer! Free and nearly free activities consume our spare time, and we have inexpensive hobbies. Think kids need to be expensive? They’re only as expensive as you let them be.</p>
<h3><b>#4. Not Caring What Others Think</b></h3>
<p>People may find our lifestyle weird, strange even. A married couple with three kids living on mom’s income while dad stays home? Pretty rare. On top of that, living well below your means results in living very differently than folks used to the lifestyle inflation that two incomes typically bring. I don’t really care what other people think of our family arrangement, though, nor our frugal life or pursuit of FIRE. We&#8217;re doing what works for us!</p>
<h3><strong>#5.</strong> <b>Crystal Clear Priorities</b></h3>
<p>There’s nothing like a near death experience to clarify the priorities in your life.  Buying stuff? Going into debt for a car? Using raises and bonuses to go on fancy vacations or second homes?</p>
<p>Hell no.</p>
<p>Using money to buy mortgage freedom, college funding, and financial independence?</p>
<p>Hell yes.</p>
<h2>Moms On FIRE</h2>
<p>I started <a href="http://www.chiefmomofficer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my site</a> specifically to cater to other moms like myself – interested in personal finance and investing, financial independence, family breadwinners, and/or high income earners.</p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to meet other amazing moms, virtually, who are also the breadwinners of their households in all kinds of different ways. Some are the higher income earners of a two-income family, others go to work while their spouse stays at home, women millionaires, moms working to support their family <em>and</em> their own parents at the same time, and women interested in all the fun details of personal finance and investing (and not so much in extreme couponing).</p>
<p>We may still be uncommon, but we’re a growing force in the world.</p>
<p><strong>To other women out there, I say this: whether you’re the breadwinner, earning a high income, a single mom, in debt, a millionaire, or anything else – you too can set yourself on FIRE!</strong></p>
<p>Whatever’s happened in your life, you can overcome it and achieve your wildest dreams. Get clear on your priorities, stop caring what others think, and live your life the way <em>you</em> want!</p>

<p><strong>I am not an extreme person. </strong>If given the choice between couch-lounging and base jumping, I will always pick my couch and sweatpants. Always.</p>
<p>Predictability is a good trait to have, especially since I’m dumping $225,000 of debt to the curb. And that includes credit cards, <a href="http://www.pickypinchers.com/student-loan-payoff-plan/" target="_blank">student loans</a>, and even my mortgage. It’s a lot to pay off and I’ll try just about anything to eliminate it.</p>
<p><strong>In my quest to vanquish debt, I became a Savings Extremist.</strong> A year ago you would have caught me lounging on my couch as usual, manically clipping coupons and reading sale papers.</p>
<p>Somewhere along my journey I became a crazy extreme couponer.  For the six months I couponed, every Sunday was like Christmas morning when the newspapers (plural) arrived with the next batch of coupons. I had accordion folders filled to the brim, bursting with meticulously-labeled <a href="http://www.redplum.com/" target="_blank">Red Plums</a> and <a href="http://www.smartsource.com/" target="_blank">Smart Source</a> coupons.</p>
<p>I was <em>this close</em> to digging through the trash looking for coupons.</p>
<h2>I was a little obsessive, but there were many upsides to extreme couponing.</h2>
<p><strong>It was fun</strong>: There was nothing like the thrill of scoring $60-worth of swag at CVS for a paltry $10! I salivated over my three-foot-long receipts with a $5 total. Math has never been my strong suit, but I really enjoyed planning my couponing hauls. I stuck it to The Man by swiping products off shelves for rock bottom prices. I did my fair share of happy dances.</p>
<p><strong>There were good deals</strong>: I once scored a giant jug of Dr. Bronner’s soap for $10 &#8211; which normally retailed at $20. I also bought $4 bottles of shampoo for a mere $1 apiece, and cold medicine for $1 per pack. I won’t lie: you can find great deals with couponing!</p>
<p><strong>I was always stocked up</strong>: Toothpaste? Check. Shampoo? Check. Hair gel? What brand do you want? I have 13. Extreme couponing is most effective when you stack coupons and buy multiple products at a time. Which meant I always had a treasure trove of household products and snacks at my disposal. It’s been over a year since I quit couponing and I <em>still</em> haven’t finished our stock of shampoo! It&#8217;s a great way to stock up on lots of items at once, and on the cheap.</p>
<p>Although extreme couponing was a blast in many ways, I decided it ultimately wasn’t for me. After saving over $300 by couponing, I called it quits.</p>
<h2>Here’s why I stopped extreme couponing.</h2>
<p>It was a time-sucker.</p>
<p>I spent an average of 15 hours a week couponing, and this was below the average (hardcore couponers spend upwards of 30 hours a week couponing!).</p>
<p>I spent hours scouring sales papers, company websites, and handfuls of coupon books to match deals. I carefully planned my weekly trips to CVS and Walgreens with precision math. I knew exactly how much money I needed to spend for each trip, taxes included. I memorized the rewards points balance on both mine and Mr. Picky Pincher’s store rewards cards.</p>
<p><strong>It took for-freakin’-ever.</strong> Extreme couponing required an insane amount of planning that didn’t fit into my schedule. I already worked a full-time job and barely had the time to plan the shopping trips, let alone complete the act of the actual shopping.</p>
<p>I grew weary of extreme couponing after realizing it was my main hobby. I had video games to play and cats to pet, after all. I didn’t want to spend half of my waking free time at a drug store!</p>
<h2>Bye-bye money</h2>
<p>I’ve always been a big fan of <a href="http://www.pickypinchers.com/what-we-pay-good-money-for/" target="_blank">spending more money on quality things</a>. Whether that means buying sheets with a higher thread count, dropping more cheddar for good shoes, or buying in bulk. Couponing seemed like a natural way to use today’s money to pay for tomorrow’s bills &#8211; I dug it.</p>
<p>As it turns out, extreme couponing still costs money, even if you do it with care. I justified my addiction with the old adage, “You gotta spend money to make money!” and felt that, even though a CVS run cost $15, I was saving money in the long run.</p>
<p>Mr. Picky Pincher mercifully pulled my head out of the clouds. I was spending at least $15 a week between my couponing runs to Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart which added up to an extra $60 a month that we <em>didn’t plan on spending</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I was spending more money on things we didn’t really need—which meant we put less money towards our debts.</strong></p>
<p>At first that didn’t sound so bad. “So what?” I thought, “Those costs will even themselves out in our budget.” But they didn’t. Our expenses increased. The sixteen bottles of $1 nail polish weren’t saving us money—they were costing us money.</p>
<p>I lost my sense of practicality with extreme couponing. I bought hair gel, brushes, and crates of toothpaste that I didn’t need at all. I would buy items just because they were on sale. I was overspending every week and it added up quickly.</p>
<h2>Finding cheaper alternatives</h2>
<p>Even after realizing how resource-intensive couponing was, I still couldn’t kick my obsession.</p>
<p>I stocked up on makeup remover wipes, fancy lotions, packages of pizza-flavored chips, and bronzer &#8211; which is ridiculous when you’re vampire-white like me.</p>
<p>I cluttered our extra cabinets with this extraneous stuff, confident I’d use it all eventually.</p>
<p>But after watching the bills stack up, I wondered if there was a cheaper way to enjoy the same items? After snooping around, I found several cheap and easy alternatives for things I already bought.</p>
<p><strong>Here are just a few items I make now to save money:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of buying Neutrogena makeup wipes, I started using coconut oil to remove my waterproof mascara. Works like a charm!</li>
<li>We fry our own chips instead of buying 3 for $1 Pringles at Walgreens. I’ve also started opting for healthier whole food snacks, like almonds.</li>
<li>I bought a safety razor handle and a pack of safety razors. It cost the same as a new pack of razor cartridges with a coupon. The upside is the safety razors cost pennies compared to disposable cartridges and I get a better shave.</li>
<li>I love sugar scrub, so I started making it myself out of coconut oil, sugar, spices, and essential oils.</li>
<li>I use <a href="http://www.pickypinchers.com/how-to-make-diy-dry-shampoo/" target="_blank">homemade dry shampoo</a> instead of store bought. I add essential oils to corn starch and run a small amount through any greasy parts of my head.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The result with these are <em>actual</em> savings.</strong> By opting for a DIY approach, I got the same (or even better) result as store bought products. Couponing encouraged consumption of products that I found out I could make cheaply at home.</p>
<p>I know people hear “DIY” and think “Oh man, it’s so much faster just to buy it at the store,” but this didn’t happen in our case. After factoring in the time it took to hunt for coupons, match deals, and do the actual shopping, DIY always came out ahead.</p>
<p>This was the nail in the coffin. I canceled my multiple newspaper subscriptions, recycled my coupon books, and gave up extreme couponing.</p>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>I still <a href="http://www.pickypinchers.com/how-to-coupon-the-right-way/" target="_blank">love to use coupons</a>, I just use them more judiciously now. By focusing on non-consumption and producing a few household items myself, I’m able to save more money than I ever saved with extreme couponing. I still think it&#8217;s great if you don&#8217;t get carried away, but in the end it just didn&#8217;t work out for me. This experience has made me realize that there isn’t a right way to save money, though. It’s all about doing what’s right for you!</p>
<p><em><strong>How about you? Have you tried extreme couponing before? How did it go?</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Welcome to part II of the Food Budget Battle!</strong></p>
<p>If you missed our last post, a reader of this site &#8211; Braden &#8211; called malarkey on our blogger friend, <a href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Miller</a>, that <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/03/how-do-you-spend-little-money-food-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there&#8217;s no way in God&#8217;s name you can eat meals for under a dollar</a> (175+ comments so far!). Being the gentlemanly guy that I am, of course, I had to allow Mr. Miller himself a chance to rebuttal and show once and for all if it&#8217;s indeed possible ;) So feast your eyes on how he and his wife feeds their family of 8 for $700/mo with tips (and scanned in receipts) to prove it!</p>
<p><em>(Then be sure to check out <a href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his travel rewards blog</a> and show him some love after &#8211; he&#8217;s spent a LOT of time over the past few weeks sharing his tips and tricks with us, and we truly appreciate that he has!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">**************************</p>
<p><strong>After reading our post about <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/02/family-budget-6-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the budget for our family of 8</a>,</strong> reader Braden can’t understand how we can possibly eat for under $1 / day. He calculated that number off of our estimated monthly grocery budget of $700, divided by 720 (3 meals * 8 people * 30 days). He makes some good points about why he thinks that is an impossible feat and one that can not be replicated.</p>
<p>I can’t speak for him or his family, but I’d like to offer 7 points on how this works for us, and how we really DO eat on less than $1 / meal.</p>
<p><strong>But first, some words on judging&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Before I start, let me talk a bit about judging. Any time you post a lot of information about yourself to a public forum, you’ll often get trolls and other commenters coming out of the woodwork with rather rude judgments about the limited information that they have. I try to let it roll off but it is a bit annoying.</p>
<p>**I firmly believe that the purpose of a budget is not to limit you<em>,</em> but instead to help you not spend money on things you don’t value, so that you have money left over to buy things that you DO value.**</p>
<p>So with that being said, let’s try to remain civil, shall we? :) Here&#8217;s how we eat so cheaply:</p>
<h2>1. No Eating Out</h2>
<p>It might go without saying, but we very, very, VERY rarely go out to eat at a restaurant. If and when we do, I probably would actually count that as “Entertainment” as opposed to “Grocery” but it happens so rarely I wouldn’t even count it. <em>(&lt;&#8212; J$: I like this idea!!!)</em></p>
<p>I go out to lunch with work folks maybe once or twice a month but I pay for that as the “Dan” envelope and if we were to go out to eat as a date, I’d also count that as “Entertainment”.</p>
<h2>2. No Meat</h2>
<p>My wife is a vegetarian, and although I am not, we rarely eat meat. Oh, we put pepperoni on one of our homemade pizzas (Pizza Thursday!!) and we’ll occasionally have bacon as part of a breakfast for dinner, and sometimes we’ll have hot dogs and hamburgers (and veggie burgers!) for dinner, but we almost never buy chicken or beef.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Regional Costs</strong></h3>
<p>Another thought I had as far as how we keep costs lower than many is varying regional costs. I live in Cincinnati, which has a below-average cost of living, food included. As an example, a gallon of milk here costs around $2 / gal.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of the actual weekly ad this week:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43469" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kroger-milk-costs.jpg" alt="kroger milk costs" width="600" height="368" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kroger-milk-costs.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kroger-milk-costs-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Isn’t this weekly ad the most amazing website you’ve ever seen?!?!?)</em></p>
<p>I know that other places I’ve been to (Colorado, Washington DC), milk is MUCH more expensive. I’d imagine that those types of costs go across the gamut of all food costs.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Being Accustomed to a Certain “Lifestyle” of Food</strong></h3>
<p>Another factor that I think drives up some people’s grocery budgets is being accustomed to certain things as MUST HAVES. Take a careful look and re-examine things with a fresh eye. One of my favorite budgeting “hacks” is instead of starting with your current expenses and trying to cut things out –<em><strong> instead start at $0 and add things in one by one</strong>.</em> You might be surprised at what you can do without.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories about this goes back to the “No Meat” part. Many people (including probably several who are reading this post) either are or know someone who just can’t have a dinner without meat being involved. I am here to tell you that it IS possible to have dinner without meat as the main course and it still be very satisfying! <em>(J$: I am very much one of these people :))</em></p>
<p>Anyways, several years ago, we were at a large week-long family reunion and as part of the reunion, each of the families took turns making dinner for the group in one week. The people making dinner all knew that my wife was a vegetarian, and wanted to make sure to make something that she could eat (which I appreciated!)</p>
<p>They were serving lasagna, and they just could not fathom the idea of a cheese (or vegetable) lasagna, so instead they took veggie burgers and mashed them up and put them in the lasagna as the “meat”. As you can imagine, it was kinda gross :)</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that you don’t HAVE to have meat (or certainly not with EVERY dinner), and if you’re looking for a way to cut food costs, that’s a great place to start.</p>
<h2>5. Buying in Bulk</h2>
<p>Now we don’t normally think of the fact that our family has 8 people as a money SAVER, but it’s definitely true that there exists a certain economy of scale. Making a meal for 8 people DOES cost more than making a meal for 4 people, but it usually doesn’t cost TWICE as much.</p>
<p>We buy giant 5 lb. bags of cheese from Sams Club, where it costs $10.73. Compare that to an 8 oz bag of cheese (1/10 as much!) which may run you $2.00 at a local grocery store, even on sale.</p>
<p>We’re able to make that work because <strong>we actually will eat all the cheese before it goes bad</strong>! Same goes for pasta sauce – we buy the 8.5 lb jar of Ragu for about $6, instead of a 28 oz jar (1/5 as much) for $1.89.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43470" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/sams-club-buying-bulk.jpg" alt="buying bulk - sams club" width="600" height="281" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/sams-club-buying-bulk.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/sams-club-buying-bulk-300x140.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><strong>I actually think that Sams Club is generally speaking a ripoff for most things.</strong> We buy cheese, some snacks (cheese crackers / goldfish / etc), pasta sauce, syrup, and pancake mix but that’s it, and even that only works because our family is so large. I don’t think that doing the majority of your shopping at club stores like Sams or Costco is a wise financial move – you’re either buying more product than you need, in which case you eat more than you need, or your 128oz jar of pickles goes bad well before you can eat them all :)</p>
<p>We also like to stock up on non-perishable items when they go on sale. You buy a lot this week, when they’re on sale, so that next week, you don’t have to buy it when it’s back to regular price.</p>
<p>I used to be one of <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2014/03/interview-chrystie-vachon-extreme-couponer-bachelorette-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“those” extreme couponers</a>, back before it was all cool and on TLC. 10 years ago I would regularly get all of our groceries essentially for free, using a combination of deals, coupons, rainchecks and a LOT. OF. TIME. It’s become a lot harder to do that than it used to be (though still not impossible) and we’ve decided to spend our time in other ways, so we very rarely use coupons.</p>
<h2>6. Meal Planning</h2>
<p>Meal planning is another good way that we keep costs down. This is another way that my stay-at-home wife, although she earns no income, makes a big positive contribution to our bottom line. There are lots of different ways to plan meals – how we do it is each month we plan a monthly calendar of meals. We have many of the same meals multiple times in a month (let’s give the shout out, once again to…. PIZZA THURSDAY! :-D), but we’ll usually have 1-3 new meals each month.</p>
<p>In addition to having an answer to the age-old question of “what’s for dinner” every night, a big money-saving advantage of meal planning is that you’re able to combine recipes that use some of the same ingredients, so that you don’t waste things that you have to buy just for one recipe (also, you can buy some things in bulk – see above)</p>
<p>You can take this even to the next level by doing your meal planning in conjunction with your store’s weekly ad so you are making meals (and stocking up!) on things that are on sale that week.</p>
<p>[<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:</strong></span> A friend of mine recently launched a meal plan service that helps with planning cheap meals if anyone is interested! It&#8217;s called <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/5-dollar-meal-plan">$5.00 Meal Plan</a> and emails you a weekly meal plan that contains ten recipes to make each week. The plans are easy to prepare, don&#8217;t use exotic ingredients, and through careful spending and couponing will only cost you less than $5 a meal. You can check it out here: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/5-dollar-meal-plan">5DollarMealPlan.com</a>]</p>
<h2>7. Cooking From Scratch Instead of Prepared Foods</h2>
<p>Most people know that eating at home is cheaper than eating meals at restaurants, but it’s also true that cooking meals from scratch is cheaper than buying prepared foods at the grocery store (even if you are eating those at home).</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/03/how-do-you-spend-little-money-food-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original example</a> that Braden shared, about the 50 cent per serving macaroni and cheese. While that may be true that a 50 cent serving of mac and cheese is the cheapest PREPARED meal you can buy, you can do meals a LOT cheaper than that if you’re making them from scratch.</p>
<p>One example I’ll use is spaghetti. A 16oz box of spaghetti noodles, 2 jars of pasta sauce (or the big bottle of Ragu pasta sauce that we buy), and a loaf of garlic bread might run you about $5, and would be enough for (at least) 2 meals for us. $5 / 16 meals is about 31 cents a meal, and there are other (similar) meals that can be made that cheap.</p>
<h3><strong>A Real Life Example</strong></h3>
<p>But what good is all this talk without a real life example to back it up? Here are our actual receipts from last week’s grocery shopping. You can see that we do shop (primarily) at 3 different grocery stores – Aldi, Sams Club and Kroger.</p>
<p>Yes, this does take additional time than it would if we just shopped at one place – my wife says that it takes her about an hour and a half to do the weekly shopping, including driving time to each store. Again, this is a non-income-producing benefit of having a stay-at-home spouse – families with both spouses working may value their free time a lot higher, since it’s more limited.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43471" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/aldi-receipt-groceries.jpg" alt="aldi receipt groceries" width="600" height="579" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/aldi-receipt-groceries.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/aldi-receipt-groceries-300x289.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43472" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kroger-sams-club-receipt.jpg" alt="kroger sams club receipt" width="600" height="556" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kroger-sams-club-receipt.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kroger-sams-club-receipt-300x278.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The gross total for the week is: <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$186.03</strong></span></p>
<h3><strong>Accounting “Tricks”?</strong></h3>
<p>Now, different people do <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2009/07/free-budget-templates-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgeting</a> differently, and there are a few things on these receipts that some people might not count in their “grocery” budget.</p>
<p>Looking through the receipts, I see that we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Household expenses – Garbage bags $4.99 + tax, Dryer sheets $1.19 + tax, Laundry Detergent $5.99 + tax, tape $1.19 + tax</li>
<li>School expenses – rubber bands 49 cents + tax (these were for a catapult my son built for a Boy Scout merit badge)</li>
<li>Snacks for our March Madness party that I would probably classify as “Entertainment” – $1.89 ranch dip, $1.05 Swiss rolls, $1.05 Swiss rolls, $0.99 Cheese curls, $1.99 Pita Chips, $0.79 Cheese Puffs, Potato Chips $1.49.</li>
<li>Allergy medicine – $5.99 + tax</li>
<li>You’ll also see that, contrary to what I said above, we did buy some chicken for $5.99 at Kroger :-D. Special meal for my parents coming to visit</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not trying to engage in “fuzzy” accounting tricks, but just trying to give an accurate portrayal of our actual grocery costs. If I were scoring at home, I would count the household and school expenses in, but not the medicine or the party snacks, for a weekly “Grocery” total of <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$170.39</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>This amount is in line with our weekly totals for the past few weeks, which are:</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43473" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/grocery-costs-6-weeks.gif" alt="grocery costs 6 weeks" width="388" height="240" /></p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that I did not make any “adjustments” to those weekly totals</strong> – they are the exact amounts as come off of our credit card / bank statements and as such are going to include some items that are probably not actually food / groceries. So I feel comfortable in saying that we are in the $700 range for our monthly grocery expenditures.</p>
<p>I hope that you have enjoyed this post and gotten some ideas on how <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/02/family-budget-6-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our family of 8</a> does food spending. I’d love to hear (constructive!) feedback and tips on how you make it work in your family?</p>

<p>The takeaways of the last two posts here are just examples of two <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/03/how-do-you-spend-little-money-food-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drastically different ways</a> of living and eating. It doesn&#8217;t mean one way is &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong,&#8221; but if you&#8217;re not happy with your current results it&#8217;s probably good to consider some of the alternatives.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can give up meat personally (mmmmmm) but we already eat out way less and can surely do better about mean planning and making food from scratch too. As Dan points out though, there&#8217;s always a trade off: <strong><em>time</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>So the real question is, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2014/11/how-bad-do-you-want-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how bad</a> do you really want a lower food budget?<br />

If that guy can do it WITH 6 KIDS we should all be able to do it!</em></p>
<h2>Sample Budget for Family of 8</h2>
<p><strong>Hey there everyone!</strong> My name is <span class="il">Dan</span> <span class="il">Miller</span> and I run the travel blog <a href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Points With a Crew</a>. J. Money asked me to spend a little bit of time talking about what a <span class="il">budget</span> for a family of 8 looks like, so I thought I would break it down on a monthly basis for you.</p>
<p>To set the story, our family of 8 is my wife and I and our 6 <span class="il">kids</span> &#8211; 3 boys and 3 girls (and yes &#8211; they ARE all mine!). It looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wife</li>
<li>Self</li>
<li>14 y/o</li>
<li>12 y/o</li>
<li>10 y/o</li>
<li>8 y/o</li>
<li>6 y/o</li>
<li>2 y/o</li>
</ul>
<p>We spend about <em><strong>$5,000 / month</strong></em> which includes everything except for taxes and savings.</p>
<h2>Our Bills</h2>
<p>Bills are bills, ya know?  I read once (and continue to perpetuate this saying to everyone I know, even though I can find no source to back me up) that no matter how many <span class="il">kids</span> you have, nor how much money you make, you will spend about 25-30% of your income on your <span class="il">kids</span>.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Mortgage</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost on a sample budget for family of 8 is the dreaded mortgage. My mortgage runs about $2,000 / month including taxes and interest, for a ~2,000 square foot house in a nice suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Cincinnati is a pretty cheap real estate market, and I&#8217;m sure if I had no <span class="il">kids</span> I could make do with a smaller house.  Of course, if I had no <span class="il">kids</span>, I&#8217;d probably be paying more for a swank loft in a hip urban area :-).</p>
<h3><strong>Our Utilities</strong></h3>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine my energy and water bills are higher than they would be if I had fewer <span class="il">kids</span>, but probably not by THAT much.  We&#8217;re at around ~$350-400 / month combined for those.  We don&#8217;t have cable (barely watch TV), though we do spend $8 / month on Netflix.  We gave up our regular landline phone in 2013, but do have an <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2014/08/ooma-review-free-home-phone-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ooma device</a> ($4 / month) mostly so that if my wife and I are out of the house that the <span class="il">kids</span> would have a way to contact us in emergencies.</p>
<p>For cell phones, we use <a href="http://www.selectelwireless.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selectel</a> (a reseller of Verizon).  We paid ~$100 each for our phones (I have an Android Moto G and my wife has a used iPhone 4).  We have a plan that costs $75 but is good for a year and has 2,000 minutes and 2,000 texts.  It took me 8 months to use that plan and my wife went the whole year without reaching that.  So that averages about $20 / month for the 2 of us.  We have an emergency data plan that we can use in scenarios like if we&#8217;re out driving and get lost and need to know where to go, but generally we keep the data off on our phones.  Realistically we spend at least 80-90% of our time in places that have free wi-fi (home, work, library, church, etc.)</p>
<h3><strong>Our Insurance</strong></h3>
<p>I get medical, dental and vision insurance through work which costs me about $200 / month.  I choose the high deductible plan and also contribute another $100 or so / month to a health savings account.  Because we&#8217;re a single income family, I think life insurance is even more important.  We have about $1.5 million on me and $750K on my wife, which costs us around $102 / month. We also have disability insurance, and an umbrella policy in addition to the standard home and auto insurance &#8211; that adds another $400-500/ month to the bill.</p>
<h2>The Food!</h2>
<p>This one is important on a sample budget for family of 8 because as you can imagine, food for a family of 8 can get pretty expensive.  This is probably the one area of our family <span class="il">budget</span> that I feel like we have the least control of.  Especially as our <span class="il">kids</span> are getting older and into teenager-hood, it&#8217;s been hard to put a real cap on our grocery <span class="il">budget</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WILL SOMEONE STOP THESE <span class="il">KIDS</span> FROM EATING SO MUCH?!?!!?</strong></p>
<p>About 10 years ago, I was one of those &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2011/12/mythbusters-extreme-couponing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme Couponers</a>&#8221; of the sort that you now see on TLC (back before it was cool!) and that was a lot of work but pretty lucrative. In 2004, I ended up with a yearly grocery bill that was negative, once you factored in coupons, rebates and reselling.  We don&#8217;t really do that as much now (too much time, and the rules have changed to make it a lot harder with no double coupons where I live), but we still try to keep things on the cheap &#8211; our monthly food <span class="il">budget</span> is about $600-700.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Here&#8217;s Dan&#8217;s follow up post on <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/03/dollar-meal-budgeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how his family eats on less than $1.00/meal</a>]</em></p>
<p>Now, I should probably point out that I WORK FOR A GROCERY STORE, so I get 10% off on store-brand products (talk about a timely employee perk!), though that doesn&#8217;t really add up to THAT much.  We do buy things in bulk (for example, we go through at least a 5lb bag of cheese every week), and stock up when things are on sale.  My wife is a vegetarian so we don&#8217;t buy much meat, which helps keep prices down.</p>
<h2>Travel / Vacations</h2>
<p>This is one area where we have started really doing a lot more, and is the focus of my travel blog.  3 years ago, when I realized that the 2014 version of our family reunion was going to be across the country at Lake Tahoe, I knew that 8 cross-country plane tickets were not going to be cheap.  I had had a little bit of exposure to the &#8220;travel hacking&#8221; game, which generally means signing up for lots of credit cards to get the signup bonuses.  It does take a bit of time to keep things straight and make sure you make all the payments (paying interest on credit cards is pretty dumb, right!?!), but it has been pretty lucrative for us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-43048 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/points-with-a-crew.jpg" alt="points with a crew" width="600" height="171" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/points-with-a-crew.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/points-with-a-crew-300x85.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>We used 170,000 Southwest Rapid Rewards points (that we got pretty much for free through signup bonuses) to buy <a href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/finally-putting-all-those-miles-and-points-to-good-use-2014-family-vacation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">those 8 plane tickets</a> from Cincinnati to Nevada for our 2014 family vacation.  We also used miles and points for my wife and I to <a href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/tbt-my-very-first-trip-paid-for-with-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go to Miami for a getaway weekend</a> back in November 2013, and we have another getaway trip planned for later this month.  I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ve traveled more as a family in the past year or two that we&#8217;ve been travel hacking than we did in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>We have also used airline miles to <a title="Bartering for Babysitting" href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/bartering-for-babysitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barter for babysitting </a>&#8211; we paid someone 25,000 miles to watch our <span class="il">kids</span> for a weekend, and we are bartering miles again for babysitting for this upcoming trip.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in how to get started on travel hacking, you can check out my <a title="Beginner’s Guide (Start HERE!)" href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Travel Hacking</a>, or follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pointswithacrew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to help folks in any way I can.</p>
<h3><strong>Auto</strong></h3>
<p>We have an 8 passenger minivan (Chevy Venture) and a Honda Civic.  Both are paid off and were purchased used without a car loan.  We bought our (8 passenger, natch) minivan a few years ago and paid cash (about $7,000).  As for my car, the story of how I wrecked my old 1998 Honda Civic and ended up getting a car that was 8 years newer and with 60,000 fewer miles for about $1,000 out of pocket is a great one, and worth telling, but I&#8217;ll have to save that for another time :-D</p>
<h2>Childcare</h2>
<p>Another big one on a sample budget for family of 8 is childcare. In fact, for families with <span class="il">kids</span> (especially younger <span class="il">kids</span>), <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/02/biggest-monthly-expense-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">childcare is one of the most expensive parts of the <span class="il">budget</span></a>, especially if both parents work outside the home. One nice thing working for us, is that the more <span class="il">kids</span> you have, the cheaper childcare becomes.  That&#8217;s because once you get into 3+ <span class="il">kids</span>, daycare becomes prohibitively expensive and the economics of having one parent stay at home becomes a lot more attractive.</p>
<p><em>[Note to editor: Have more kids!!]</em></p>
<p>The choice of whether both parents work or not is one that needs to be made at the individual family level, and the discussion is fraught with landmines, but it&#8217;s one that has really worked out for us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812929896/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812929896&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkId=T6BRAMZUX5Y6PRGE"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43052" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/two-incomes-still-broke.jpg" alt="two incomes still broke" width="231" height="346" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/two-incomes-still-broke.jpg 231w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/two-incomes-still-broke-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a></p>
<p>I read a book a few years ago called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812929896/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812929896&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkId=T6BRAMZUX5Y6PRGE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Incomes and Still Broke?: It&#8217;s Not How Much You Make, but How Much You Keep</a>. The book was (officially) neutral on the idea of whether or not both parents worked, but it was an interesting read on some of the hidden costs of having both parents work outside the home that people don&#8217;t often consider (like new work clothes, lunches, increased grocery bills, etc).</p>
<h2>Charitable giving / Taxes</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re Mormon (explains the 6 <span class="il">kids</span>, right? :-D), so we give 10% of our income as tithing to our church, as well as other giving.  I decided to lump that into the &#8220;taxes&#8221; section, since it&#8217;s another reason that we don&#8217;t pay much in the way of federal income taxes.</p>
<p>Up until this past year, when I took a new job that paid me a lot more than I used to be getting, we were one of &#8220;those&#8221; people that just &#8220;mooched&#8221; off the government.  Now in our particular case, I think that between the other kinds of taxes (state, local, sales, property, etc.) I&#8217;m sure we ended up paying some taxes, but as far as federal income taxes, between having 6 <span class="il">kids</span> (in addition to 8 exemptions, we get $6,000 in Child Tax Credit), paying 10%+ to charity, and a mortgage in the early stages of life (so lots of tax-deductible interest), our tax bill would generally be negative and thanks to what is called the &#8220;Additional Child Tax Credit&#8221;, we would get all the money that we put in back, plus some.  With my recent increased income, we do actually (gasp!) pay federal income taxes now, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a much lower percentage than many others.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t make the tax rules, and I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with all of them, but I just put the numbers in the boxes that they tell me, ya know? :-D</p>
<h2>Savings / College</h2>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How are you going to put 6 <span class="il">kids</span> through college?!?!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to say that&#8217;s up there in the list of things that people say to me, along with &#8220;You must have your hands full!&#8221; :-).  Frankly, I&#8217;m not that worried about college and we have prioritized savings for our retirement over savings for our <span class="il">kids</span>&#8216; college.</p>
<p>While I do think that for many professions, a college degree is a good thing if not mandatory, I do think that there is something &#8220;broken&#8221; about the current college system where <span class="il">kids</span> just go off to college at 18 without any clue as to what they want to do just because it&#8217;s &#8220;the thing to do&#8221;, which just leads to a sense of entitlement and/or a lack of purpose.  When someone else is paying your bills, you generally are less invested in making progress towards a degree (I think we&#8217;ve all heard those stories, right?) Also, having 6 <span class="il">kids</span> does mean that our &#8220;Expected Family Contribution&#8221; (a component of the FAFSA that determines how many grants/loans your children get) will be lower than for someone with fewer children.</p>
<p><strong>Another thing about being Mormon is that in addition to saving for college, many of our <span class="il">kids</span> will choose to take 2 years to serve as missionaries,</strong> which will be about $400-500 / month for 2 years.  On the flip side, admission to BYU (a fairly well-respected university owned by the Mormon church) is only $4,850 / year for Mormons.</p>
<p>To share my example (I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a degree in Computer Engineering in 2000) &#8211; due to doing well in high school, I earned a full-tuition scholarship, as well as enough Advanced Placement credits to test out of about a year&#8217;s worth of classes.  UC&#8217;s College of Engineering has a very successful <a href="http://www.uc.edu/propractice/uccoop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-op program</a> (they actually invented it back in 1906!), so you would go to school for a quarter, and then work for a quarter (I worked at Procter and Gamble for 3 quarters).  In addition to tons of meaningful work experience, I made enough money to be able to pay for my living expenses for that quarter and the upcoming school quarter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43049" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/sugar-mamas.jpg" alt="sugar mamas" width="300" height="229" /></p>
<p>Of course, another helpful thing about halfway through school I got myself a &#8220;Sugar Mama&#8221; (aka I got married :-D ), and my wife worked as a nanny to help pay the bills while I was finishing up school.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am not necessarily expecting all of my <span class="il">kids</span> to follow that exact path, but I share it as an example that you don&#8217;t just HAVE TO sock away $30K per <span class="il">kid</span>-year as your <span class="il">kid</span>&#8216;s God-given &#8220;college fund&#8221;.  For each of my <span class="il">kids</span> that wants to go to college and has a plan for how that&#8217;s going to help them in their life, we will make sure that it happens, but it&#8217;s also going to take work on their part.</p>
<h2>Retirement / Other Income</h2>
<p>Next on the sample budget for family of 8 is retirement. Like I said when talking about college, we have decided to prioritize our own retirement savings over college funds.  My wife and I both have IRAs, and we contribute up to the match on our 401k.  With my recent change in job, I have just now become eligible for my employer&#8217;s 401k match after being employed for a year &#8211; they match 100% of the first 3% contributed and 50% of the next 2%, so we contribute 5% to get that free money.</p>
<p>For most of my adult life, my effective tax rate (see Taxes section above) has been 0%, so it didn&#8217;t make sense to contribute more to 401ks &#8211; instead, we put money into a Roth IRA.  Pay the taxes now, at the 0% rate, and then withdraw it when I&#8217;m old and banking beaucoup bucks!</p>
<p><strong>A lot of our other savings income goes towards our real estate business. </strong> We have 3 rental houses that we rent out.  I would say that we are not currently making a ton of money on those (especially given the time we spend), but in &#8220;30 years&#8221; when the mortgages are all paid off, we&#8217;ll be swimming through our tower of gold coins like Scrooge McDuck!  Or&#8230; something like that :-D</p>
<p>We currently are paying down a business line of credit that we used to buy one of the houses, to the tune of about $2,000 / month.  Once that is paid down, we will probably look into buying another rental in the next year or two, as well as re-purposing some of that $2,000 / month into other avenues.</p>
<p>For purposes of diversification, we have also started converting some of our term life insurance into whole life insurance.</p>
<h2>Entertainment / <span class="il">Kids</span> activities</h2>
<p>We do these on the cheap as well.  We do have my oldest daughter take piano lessons ($90 / month) and my 2 older boys do Boy Scouts, but that&#8217;s about cost-neutral (via fundraising).  We <span class="il">budget</span> $40 / month for &#8220;Entertainment&#8221;, and we don&#8217;t even use that most months.  There are lots of things that you can do for family fun that is free or low cost.  We loaded up on gift cards during American Express Small Business Saturday when <a title="Small Business Saturday 2014 report – $180 in free gift cards" href="http://www.pointswithacrew.com/small-business-saturday-2014-report-180-free-gift-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they were offering business credits for buying things at local businesses</a>, and have been using those to go for ice cream or a trip to the local movie theater.</p>
<p>We also will just go to the mall and walk around, or hang out at the bookstore or library, or just spend time at the house.</p>
<h3><strong>Wrapping up this sample budget for family of 8</strong></h3>
<p>Finishing things up, I hope that this gives you guys an idea of what a sample <span class="il">budget</span> for family of 8 looks like.  We made the choice to have 6 <span class="il">kids</span>, and when we did, we knew that it would mean that some of our other choices in life might be limited.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t feel deprived in any way, and I don&#8217;t feel like any of our children feels that way either.  We have a lot of fun, but we do it in a cheap-o kind of way.  And one advantage of that is because they haven&#8217;t been &#8220;spoiled&#8221; to expect some of the things that their peers might have, they don&#8217;t feel deprived without them.</p>

I said &#8220;extreme couponer&#8221; and &#8220;bachelorette&#8221; in the same sentence :)</strong> Because any of you who watch either will recognize <a href="http://couponkarma.com/about-cc/" target="_blank">Chrystie</a> in a second with her trademark tattoos and feistiness. All stuff that made me reach out to her for this interview! (You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>
<p>But for those who may be out of this &#8220;cool&#8221; group who&#8217;s &#8220;in the know&#8221; (I freely admit I&#8217;m a Bachelorette fan &#8211; I won&#8217;t pretend to blame it on my wife!) , here are some quick tidbits before we get started&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>Chrystie Vachon (formerly Corns) made waves on <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelorette" target="_blank">The Bachelorette</a> Season #7 when she came on in the finale to help her sister, Ashley &#8211; the bachelorette &#8211; figure out who her best match was of the remaining guys. She pretty much told her sister she disapproved of J.P. because he was too old for her, and they got in a nice drama filled fight on national TV. Ashley chose J.P. in the end :)</li>
<li>Chrystie was also featured in <a href="http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/extreme-couponing" target="_blank">TLC&#8217;s Extreme Couponing</a> Season #1, episode #9 as &#8220;A woman who started couponing to save her family business [that] now has a stockpile worth more than $35,000.&#8221; Hot damn! I&#8217;d chime in with more here, but sadly I only watched a few of the shows when my A.D.D. took over&#8230; Of course now I have to go find her episode ;)</li>
<li>Chrystie blogs, and shares her passion of couponing, on her website, <a href="http://CouponKarma.com" target="_blank">CouponKarma.com</a>. Formerly ILoveToGossip.com, which some of you may know. Her main goal is to give people the tools, education and motivation to get their life back together by taking control of your finances (she was recently divorced). This is one of my favorite quotes of hers: &#8220;Your money is the one thing you can control during the times when your life seems to be spinning out of control.&#8221; Preach on, sista!</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, enough of the rambling&#8230; to the interview!</p>
<p>=================================================================</p>
<h2>#1. Let&#8217;s just get this one out of the way &#8211; are you and JP now cool? :)</h2>
<p>Ha! Of course! JP and I made up really quickly after I left Fiji. We skyped after he and Ashley got back from the TV show and we are totally cool now. I blame my initial negative reaction to Ashley &amp; JP&#8217;s relationship on the fact that it&#8217;s like a billion degrees in Fiji..I was hot and grumpy. Ashley &amp; JP were just at my house this weekend, we have really gotten close and of course…I have no problem admitting that I was wrong about him!</p>
<h2>#2. You&#8217;ve been famous for The Bachelorette, but now also for TLC&#8217;s Extreme Couponing. What are three of the most extreme things you&#8217;ve done to save money?</h2>
<p>Gosh&#8230; what haven&#8217;t I done to save money? ;)</p>
<p>1. The craziest thing I did to save money was get a tattoo to get a FREE trip to Affiliate Summit in Las Vegas this year. They had a promotion, where if you got the Affiliate Summit logo you would get a full expense paid trip to the conference in Vegas including airfare, hotel &amp; the ticket to the conference. I got the logo tattooed on my bicep and got the trip for free! :)</p>
<p>2. When I first started couponing, I learned quickly that you were only allowed to print 2 of each coupon from each computer in your house. So I went on a little buying spree and cruised Ebay and Craigslist for used computers used only for printing coupons. There was a time that I had 8 computers in my house. But the computers paid for themselves with the amount of coupons I was able to print.</p>
<p>3. In 2011, I tried to go clothes-free. No, not naked! I tried to go an entire year without buying any new clothes…which, let&#8217;s be honest…is hard to do for a woman! No..I did not make it an entire year, but I did pretty darn good and lasted 6 months before I made my first clothing purchase.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -5px;"><strong>#3. A little birdy once told me that you thought coupons were &#8220;for poor people.&#8221; How would you convince your old self differently if you could go back in time?</strong></h3>
<p>I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit that I really did believe coupons were for poor people before I got wise (and divorced). I don&#8217;t know..I think there was a stigma associated with coupons that made me feel uncomfortable with using them. In my younger days I was more focused on projecting a certain image, than being financially smart. It was only after my divorce, did I start to realize coupons weren&#8217;t for poor people, they were for smart people!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[Editor&#8217;s note: Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCPs2gkspY&amp;list=UUnr0kzOACl0-4WTEcSLrbug" target="_blank">hilarious video</a> of hers I found :) &#8220;Sh*t Couponers Say&#8221;]</p>
<p><center><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ahCPs2gkspY?list=UUnr0kzOACl0-4WTEcSLrbug" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center></p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -5px;"><strong>#4. Something that&#8217;s quite evident by looking at you is that you sure love yourself some tattoos (which are actually quite sexy, I must say). Have you figured out a way to save money on those too??</strong></h3>
<p>My philosophy when it comes to saving money is to &#8220;Save where you can to enjoy money how you want&#8221;. Tattoos are a luxury that I afford myself by saving in other areas in my life. Tattoos unfortunately, aren&#8217;t one of those items that I am willing to scrimp on or try find the best deal. These things are permanent, so I want to make sure I&#8217;m getting the best work possible. I&#8217;ve stuck with one tattoo artist and don&#8217;t even worry about the price.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -5px;"><strong>#5. Finish this sentence: The only thing better than coupons are _______.</strong></h3>
<p>Margaritas, Sex, Starbucks… I could go on….</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -5px;"><strong>#6. You&#8217;ve now been living the dream as a full time blogger going on 3 years (congrats!). What were some of the things you did to help you take the plunge?</strong></h3>
<p>As soon as I started <a href="http://couponkarma.com/" target="_blank">my blog</a>, I knew that I eventually wanted it to become my full time job. The first thing that I did to make that happen, was work my butt off and earn as much money as I could&#8230; I also cut back on my spending dramatically.  I taught coupon classes, I continued to consult on social marketing, and blogged at all hours of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://couponkarma.com"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38200" alt="coupon karma" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coupon-karma.jpg" width="434" height="94" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coupon-karma.jpg 434w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coupon-karma-300x64.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></a></p>
<p>I told myself that when my blog started making $100 a day, I would quit everything else and focus on the blog. That happened at just around the 1 year mark, and I made the transition and never looked back.</p>
<p>Now if you are doing the math (and I know you are)&#8230; that was only $36,500 a year. Not enough to raise myself and my two kids on, and less than I was making as a social marketing consultant.  But since I was couponing and had tucked away some money, I was able to get by until the blog started making more money..and now here we are 4 years later and I&#8217;m still doing what I love!</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -5px;"><strong>#7. What&#8217;s inside your purse right now?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.seabags.com/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38204" alt="chrystie vachon seabag" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chrystie-vachon-seabag.jpg" width="300" height="327" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chrystie-vachon-seabag.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chrystie-vachon-seabag-275x300.jpg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

(PS: never go window shopping at TJ Maxx). But despite that sounding like I&#8217;m a huge moron with my money, there&#8217;s actually some good reasons behind it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I needed new shirts!</strong> I can&#8217;t even remember the last time I bought one, and The Maxx seemed to be having a &#8220;J. Money Appreciation Day&#8221; because I pretty much wanted their entire inventory. (I wear a t-shirt and jeans every day to &#8220;work.&#8221; Along w/ my <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2012/11/no-clothes-shopping-for-year-challenge/">beloved hoodies</a>)</li>
<li><strong>They were almost all on sale!</strong> Which, as many of you know, is crazy already because TJ&#8217;s prices are *already* pretty much on sale, haha&#8230; And no this is not an ad for them though it might as well be ;)</li>
<li><strong>I had to max out on the deals.</strong> You know those people who do <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2011/01/extreme-couponing-wow/">extreme couponing</a> and get like 100 mustard bottles and 50 bars of soap because they hit the &#8220;deal jackpot?&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s how I feel about awesome t-shirts for sale &#8211; only I actually USE THEM (oooooooooh).</li>
<li><strong>I didn&#8217;t have time to try anything on.</strong> I was supposed to be in and out within minutes (ya know, the whole &#8220;window shopping&#8221; thing), but as soon as my eyes locked on I just knew I had to have these bad boys and walked them straight to the counter. With 100% intention of returning the duds that didn&#8217;t fit (which turned out to be 50% of them, ugh&#8230;)</li>
</ol>
<p>So that&#8217;s the &#8220;why&#8221; part of the story here. The &#8220;how&#8221;, on the other hand, is the more important takeaway here. And that is: When you know where your money is, you can make decisions on the fly.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>It sounds obvious, but a lot of people don&#8217;t think about that.</strong> They hear &#8220;budget&#8221; and scream for the hills as if they&#8217;re being chased by an axe murderer. When the reality is budgets tell us where all our money is coming and going, and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2009/12/do-you-have-money-left-over-each-month/">how much <em>extra</em> we have</a> after all our bills are paid attention to. If you knew you had, say, $500 every month to do as you please, doesn&#8217;t that sound like the opposite of boring? Knowing you had freedom to make choices easily and with less stress throughout the month?</p>
<p>Now of course you can&#8217;t go spending all your extra money all willy nilly like because you have things like savings and investments and all kinds of other places it&#8217;s probably going to, BUT, the point is you don&#8217;t have to get all worried every time you buy something and wondering if it&#8217;ll put you in financial ruin. It&#8217;s a nice feeling to have regardless of the amount of money in question.</p>
<p><strong>Another perfect example of this comes courtesy of my parents.</strong> Every time something major broke in our house, or we had to fix something expensive on the car, they never got *that* stressed out about it. I mean, it didn&#8217;t make them happy or anything of course, and I&#8217;m sure it upset them like crazy, but I remember very clearly how they pretty much just chalked it up to a &#8220;that&#8217;s what happens in life&#8221; type deal, and then used some &#8220;special account&#8221; they had to pay it off.</p>
<p>I never understood it as a kid (I mean, come on &#8211; anything over $100 and you were like a millionaire!), but looking back it always impressed me. And still does. They weren&#8217;t fazed because they knew where their money was. Not in the exact same sense as my t-shirt example above since here it&#8217;s more about the Emergency Fund, but it&#8217;s the same in that they could <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2009/01/could-you-comfortably-spend-extra-80/">make a quick decision</a> right on the spot &#8216;cuz they knew the deal with their finances. They didn&#8217;t have to pour over all the numbers scouring for a way to make it happen &#8211; it was already set up as part of their plan. I should actually tell them how much it influenced me one day, what a great lesson to learn through example, right?</p>
<p><strong>Anyways, just wanted to share all this with you today.</strong> The &#8220;<em>making quick decisions</em>&#8221; thing is one of my favorite perks over the past 5 years of getting my money in order, and I only hope you guys are &#8211; or will be soon &#8211; in the same boat :) It&#8217;s a good place to shoot for!</p>
<p>Happy weekend, y&#8217;all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/mythbusters-extreme-couponing/" title="Mythbusters: Extreme Couponing" rel="nofollow"></a><p><em>(Article by <a href="http://www.cordeliacallsitquits.com/">Kelly Gurnett</a> &#8211; an awesome blogger friend of mine who is all kinds of creative!  I&#8217;m out in Milwaukee for the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2011/12/the-end-of-love-drop-and-one-last-request/">last Love Drop</a> right now so treat her well! :))</em></p>
<p><strong>I’ll admit.  I’ve been sucked in by the show <a href="http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/extreme-couponing">Extreme Couponing</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I already consider myself a fairly accomplished couponer.  My top tips and strategies have netted me a nice little stockpile over the years.  We rarely ever run out of toothpaste and I&#8217;ve not had to pay for shampoo or razors in a long, long time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">But I want more.</h2>
<p>I want a basement of shelves lined with enough TP to build forts and enough tiny shower gels you can swim in them Scrooge-McDuck-style… I want rice packets and power drinks to outlast a zombie apocalypse… I want to walk away from a grocery store with $1,000 worth of merch and have them owe <em>me</em> $2.27 for taking it off their hands.</p>
<p>But, the people on this show are called “extreme” for a reason.  They climb into dumpsters to pull out coupon inserts (and bring their kids along with them).  They not only clear store shelves, but call ahead to have full pallets of shrink wrapped items waiting for them.  They go on marathon 10-hour shopping runs.  There’s no way the average person can accomplish that.</p>
<p>Ridiculous odds, however, have never stopped me before.  I was so enamored with the idea of a stockpile that could enable me to help quit my job, that <strong>I decided to embark on</strong> <strong>a quest to see just how feasible extreme couponing could be for the average person</strong>.</p>
<p>I knew I wouldn’t be able to pull off the feats they do on the show (you can find links to some of the many issues with “Extreme Couponing” at the end of this post).  But damn me if I couldn’t get awfully close!  I’m organized.  I’m stubborn.  I’m unrealistically ambitious.  And I have no problem whatsoever embarrassing myself in public to get a good deal.  If anyone is equipped to be an extreme couponer, I thought, I was that girl.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>The Experiment</strong></h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: -7px; padding-bottom: 10px;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1:  Get the Gear, Get Organized (eventually)</span></strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/big-bertha-coupon-binder.jpg"><img decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/big-bertha-coupon-binder.jpg" alt="big bertha coupon binder" width="332" height="246" border="0" /></a>The first thing any extreme couponer needs is one big-ass coupon binder.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meet: Big Bertha</strong></em> (pictured to your left).</p>
<p>Big Bertha is basically a glorified Trapper-Keeper (old skool, represent!) filled with sheets upon sheets of my husband’s old baseball card inserts for neatly organizing coupons by category.</p>
<p>She comes equipped with folders for weekly store circulars, a cute little scissors-holding pocket, and a mini paper cutter for more extreme clipping situations.  And she took me (I kid you not) two full months to set up.  (Fail #1:  J. Money was supposed to have this guest post by mid-summer.)</p>
<p><strong>I quickly learned that the first hurdle to being an extreme couponer is having a life.</strong>  I am not a stay at home mom who can devote 40 hours a week to clipping, comparing ads, and writing meticulous shopping spreadsheets.  I also have lots of non-coupony interests I enjoy doing in my off-work hours, such as blogging, seeing my friends, and occasionally getting some sleep.  I refused to neglect these things because, well, they’re kind of part of my life.  That was my first mistake.</p>
<p>Every time I <em>almost</em> got caught up organizing my coupons, another freakin’ week of inserts arrived.  This may not seem like much, but since I was dealing with several sets of inserts (see next section), things got out of hand fast.  Every surface in my living room became covered with stacks of coupons (neatly grouped by category, of course) that just kept multiplying like Gremlins in a rainstorm.  I began to loathe the sight of them.  I still haven’t quite gotten over it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">END RESULT:</span></strong>  Success, eventually, but a <em>huge</em> time-suck.  Plus now a lingering sense of resentment towards Bertha and her contents.  Not a good place to be in for a couponer.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -7px; padding-bottom: 10px;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2:  Clip Coupons (and More Coupons, and More Coupons)</span></strong></h3>
<p>While this was all going on, I also went to work setting up a regular coupon clipping routine.  (Perhaps getting Bertha organized <em>first</em> would have helped prevent the chaos, but I was trying to be extreme, baby.)  Already being a couponer, it wasn’t a matter of creating a system so much as pimping out my current system to the max.</p>
<p>Instead of just clipping coups on Sunday, I clipped four sets of coups—my own, my generous mother’s and mother-in-law’s, and my unknowing employer’s, who had inadvertently purchased a full week’s paper subscription although no one comes in the office on the weekends (not quite as B.A. as dumpster-diving, but still pretty sneaky, I thought).</p>
<p><strong>I also ventured into the world of online coupons</strong> (through sites like <a href="http://www.coupons.com/">Coupons.com</a> and <a href="http://www.smartsource.com/">Smart Source</a>) and took the extremists’ advice in checking the sites several times a week in case new coups came out.  (I did <em>not</em> buy two extra printers to get around the “prints per coupon” limits, however.  I’m sneaky, but I have principles.  Plus I just can’t afford 2 extra printers.)</p>
<p>Finally, I checked out my go-to site, Refund Cents, for its weekly store promo/coupon matchups and running list of available rebates.  Matching store sales + coupons + rebates can ultimately result in products for free or at profit.  But, it takes a hella (let me repeat, <em>hella</em>) lot of time and some basic math skills, neither of which I have in abundance.</p>
<p>But with all these bases covered, there was no way I <em>couldn’t</em> make out like a bandit the next time I went to the store.  Right?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">END RESULT:</span></strong>  What normally took me 10 minutes every Sunday became an ongoing project that took an extra 3-5 hours each week what with trolling the internet, printing and clipping coups, adding coups into Big Bertha, and reassessing potential promo/coup combinations.  Return on investment for all this time?  Read on…</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -7px; padding-bottom: 10px;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 3:  Reap Massive Savings (Right?&#8230;<em>Right…?</em>)</span></strong></h3>
<p>What I am about to share next is not something I am proud of, but journalistic integrity demands full disclosure.</p>
<p>The first week I finally had all my coups in order and all my information gathered, I sat down Christmas-morning-excited to figure out what incredible deals I would be netting for the week.  And do you know what I found?</p>
<p><strong>Pretty much the same deals I was netting before the whole experiment.  Plus one extra.</strong>  Additional savings?  About $3.  <em>No worries</em>, I told myself, <em>you’re just starting out.  You haven’t fully built up your coupon arsenal yet.</em></p>
<p>Week 2, I sat down telling myself the first week had been an unlucky fluke, and <em>now</em> sh** was gonna start getting <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>It didn’t.  A handful of deals, just like I’d always found, except this time I got to get a few extra sets of items thanks to my duplicate inserts.  Additional savings?  Around $7.</p>
<p>By the time weeks 3-5 rolled around, I’d pretty much thrown in the towel.  The stacks of coupons to be filed were getting unnervingly high again, causing me to avert my eyes and mumble crazily every time I walked into the living room.  I’d failed to make several of my tri-weekly online coupon checks and was starting to not feel bad about it.  And the more episodes of Extreme Couponing I watched for “motivation,” the more I realized what I still needed to do:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I should be scoping the store out ahead of time, noting sales that aren’t advertised and drawing maps of all the aisles.  I should be ordering extra sets of coupons from ebay.  I should have kids so I can conscript them into helping me clip.  I should find a camera crew to come with me so the cashiers can be pressured into letting me divide my order up across 7 aisles.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I had lost all control.  <strong>I’d been working my little frugal tail off, as much as I possibly thought I could, but no matter what I did, I was getting nowhere.  Mainly because life kept happening and getting in the way of things.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">END RESULT:</span></strong>  A big, epic, hashtag FAIL.  I really thought I could do it.  Maybe if I’d just put in a little more time, been a little more dedicated?  Maybe I just didn’t want it badly enough?</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: -7px; padding-bottom: 10px;" align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; margin-top: -10px;">Final Analysis:  Let’s Be Real, People</span></strong></h3>
<p>The truth is, you <em>can</em> score some pretty fantastic savings by being entirely devoted to couponing.  Not quite as much as on TV (see what’s wrong, if not downright fraudulent, about the show <a href="http://www.jillcataldo.com/node/16258">here</a> and <a href="http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/smart-shopper/2011-10-14/tlcs-extreme-couponing-no-stranger-controversy">here</a>).  But I’ve read plenty of success stories in magazines and online that testify to the fact that if you’re willing to put in enough time and energy, you really can game the system (legally).</p>
<p>That being said, <strong>you can also be a normal, reasonable couponer and still game the system a decent amount.  Plus then you get to have a life.</strong></p>
<p>It’s with regret that I’m going back to my old couponing ways.  I still, in the back of my mind, secretly wonder if <em>I could  have done it</em> if only I didn’t have a job (or hobbies, or a social life).  But you know what?  I do have those things, and I kinda wanna keep them.  So my dreams of extremes will have to be let go.  And the show probably will, as well.  It’s left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>At least I still have Big Bertha.</strong>  I have to say it’s quite nice having everything so neatly organized when I go shopping.  Plus, when you walk into a store with a five-pound binder perched precariously on the child seat of your shopping cart, you and everyone else around you knows that you mean serious biz-nass.  Aisles clear before you, and cashiers look on you with terror (Or at least I like to think they do).  It’s quite empowering.</p>
