					<description><![CDATA[I work at a downtown church in the Midwest and we get people coming for various kinds of help all the time. When I&#039;m sitting with the person asking for help, I try to find a reason to say &#039;yes&#039; to them instead of saying &#039;no.&#039; I try to see people as people and not problems. I also trust and verify. If someone wants a bus ticket to another city and is trying to get home, I ask who they are going to see in that next city and if I can call that person. Once a guy came asking for the bus ticket and I called his fiance and she told me that he was not welcome at her house and that she had the money to buy him a bus ticket, but wouldn&#039;t do it for a variety of very valid reasons. I told him that if his fiance wouldn&#039;t bring him home, I wasn&#039;t going to send him to her door. I gave him a sandwich and a bus token to get to the shelter.]]></description>

If he chooses to give money, it really shouldn&#039;t matter where he gives it &#038; actually of him giving it directly to the person who uses it creates many good things in the body that actually increase your health and wellness.  On a different not, the president of United Way made 400k. This is pretty common in theses organizations you speak of.  If my few bucks make a difference to an individual then I feel good and hope they pass it on one day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/give-money-homeless-panhandlers/#comment-190955&quot;&gt;Carla&lt;/a&gt;.

I think anytime you&#039;re trying to do good - and ESPECIALLY when your heart is screaming (I like that!) - you should follow it and see how far it goes :) That being said, I&#039;d probably have your daughter write up the letters or pass them around or whatever since she&#039;s the one super excited about it, and also that she can get away with a lot more than an adult, haha... Plus it&#039;s much more cuter and will get more donations just on the fact she&#039;s a young (I&#039;m guessing?) daughter!

The only thing I&#039;d be mainly concerned about is her safety while doing all of this. Homeless or not, there are some crazies in the world so do keep that at the top of the process as I&#039;m sure you&#039;re already gonna do. But other than that, set her loose and see how much good she can do in this world of ours!! Maybe you can match whatever she raises to help sweeten the pot/motivation?? Or have her reach out to local companies/restaurants to match?

Please keep me updated :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love this!!! What a great challenge! I have a question though. My daughter has a desire to take the homeless out to a meal. Like meet up at nearest fast food place. She&#039;s asked my permission to send out letters asking for donations to help in this endeavor. My heart is screaming yes. But is that a good idea to solicit money like that??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I worked for a beer distributor (not as awesome as it sounds) and unfortunately, I would see these folks who were &quot;down on their luck&quot; panhandling take their hard earned proceeds and buy 32 ounce cans of beer.

I would also see them get picked up and dropped off in the early morning/late hours. I have even gone as far as to give them some extra food and I was told &quot;money, ***hole, I want money!&quot; So call me cynical and jaded but I never give to panhandlers and advise others not to as well. I saw way too many people buying alcohol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets with them and I won&#039;t be helping support their lifestyle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No. I don&#039;t give money to panhandlers, ever. I used to. A few years ago I had a lady come up to me in the grocery store parking lot, looked well put-together, very humble and asked me if by any chance I had $10 for gas. She said she went to pay for groceries, realized she&#039;d mistakenly left her wallet at home, and when she got back to the car, she also saw that her gas tank was nearly empty. (I can&#039;t remember the exact story, but it was something along those lines). She seemed very apologetic and embarrassed that she had to ask for gas money. I believed her, and gave her $10 to help her get home. Hey, I&#039;ve gone out without my wallet before, too.

Two weeks later I was at dinner with friends on the same block, and parked in the grocery lot. My friend and I were walking back to our cars, and the Same lady comes up to us with the same story. My friend gave her a simple &quot;Sorry, No.&quot; and shook her head, saying that this lady is there pretty often. (Friend lives a few blocks away). I was both surprised and hurt. Like, super hurt. Apparently the lady is a junkie. I felt so taken advantage of that someone would prey on other people&#039;s kindness to get a fix. We had a new baby and crappy insurance at the time, too, so I could have totally done better things with that money than support her drug habit.

Anyway, since that day I won&#039;t give anything to panhandlers.]]></description>
