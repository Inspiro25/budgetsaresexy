					<description><![CDATA[At this point, when I get a new job I almost just assume eventually I&#039;ll get fired and it&#039;s only a matter of time.   Might be my natural course of how to move on.  Interviewing is hard when you&#039;re working full time.   Quitting is a bit scary as you are cutting off your income and you&#039;re force to be accountable since it&#039;s your decision.   Getting fired is the guilt free way to cut the cord and do it with the safety net of unemployment income.   My next job is my last I think.  In the mean time, I&#039;ve created a resource for people that get fired on a blog called Getting Canned.  (I guess that domain could be taken another way right?...Maybe someday I&#039;ll get an offer for the domain from someone catering to the fetish.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sad to say this is all too common in tech.  I went thru six of these shutdowns/downsizings in a 35 year career.  Folks at the top always take care of themselves first.  I especially remember a company where upper management routinely awarded themselves double digit bonuses and pay raises while worker bees endured repeated layoffs and wage freezes.

As for deferring paychecks for two months, well, you can&#039;t be serious.  But a little surprised there weren&#039;t signs of trouble before disaster struck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow that is an amazing story! It just goes to show that having a plan A, B, C ... is a great idea ... it also goes show that one saving an emergency after reducing debts is highly, and having an energetic positive outlook helps you to move to the next thing etc ... if your readers are interested in living overseas .... I mention some of the zillions of ops available in teaching and later other areas etc etc ... your blog is very encouraging and colourful - CPO, From the Far Side of the Planet]]></description>
