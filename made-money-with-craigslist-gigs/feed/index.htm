					<description><![CDATA[How did you get so many serious responses and actually begin to work?  I find so many gigs I answer are endless time wasters and then they end up going with someone else, sometimes AFTER basically committing and calling my references to make sure I am who I am.

At the end of it with all the other commitments like that I probably average the minimum wage of a 3rd world country.]]></description>

This was the first year we&#039;ve ever hired movers to help us, but it turned out to be a nightmare :( Double the expected costs and the movers were lazy!!! I swear I didn&#039;t have as much stuff (esp heavy stuff) though from the way they moved it seemed like it - hah. Next time totally doing it myself w/ friends again :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can sympathise with the moving gig. I once made that same mistake, God knows why when I have moved about so much myself and knew how stressful it was. I thought getting paid for it would take the stress away - WRONG! I honestly don;t know how people do it for a full time living, respect to those guys! It still shows that you are literally willing to anything to get money in for you and your family, so much respect for that my friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating.

I&#039;ve done all sorts of things on Craigslist, but I&#039;ve never looked at the gigs section.  I expect you have to be careful about screening to avoid the sketchy ones, but sounds like a great way to pick up some quick money when you have some free time.

Tough luck on that moving gig.  Moving is one of the few things I &quot;waste&quot; money on by hiring others to help.  Lifting furniture all day is no fun.]]></description>

Traveling was something I was always on the fence about.  On one hand, the time spent traveling is something dedicated towards the gig.  But on the other hand, I don&#039;t include the time traveling to my full time job into my work week.  So, I ultimately left out the travel time.  But, I wouldn&#039;t do any gig that was more than 45 minutes away.  My thought was that since I wouldn&#039;t commute for a permanent job more than 45 minutes away (unless I was desperate), I wouldn&#039;t travel for a gig that far either.]]></description>
