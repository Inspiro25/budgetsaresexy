					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m back guys!!!  SO. MUCH. FUN.  Hope you all behaved yourselves while I was away ;)  Though now I&#039;m tempted to MOVE there for real!  I freakin&#039; LOVE L.A. man, dang... might need to start working out ways to get out there.

@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww, that is way cool!  I want to go! :)
@&lt;b&gt;tom&lt;/b&gt; -  Haha, true that.  Though we did consider it as we had other friends out there... only lasted .3 seconds though ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kat Skull&lt;/b&gt; - It was fun exploring that place!  Had never gone my entire life until January of this year, and since then visited Milwaukee at LEAST 5 times. Haha... pretty crazy.
@&lt;b&gt;Mysti&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, that whole coast got battered up :(  Right after I left it too! Hope you didn&#039;t get too much nonsense out there.
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; -  COOOL!!! I WANT TO GO!!!!  I&#039;ll actually be in San Antonio around then though :(  Man... that would be a first, huh? :)  You know I&#039;d totally come and celebrate w/ y&#039;all though!  Thanks so much for the invite :)  Soak it all in!!!  It&#039;s an incredible experience :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wait, someone came to see you!!! Haha... was fun :)  Thanks so much for sneaking outta work for a few!
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  It was a blast.
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; -  I&#039;m so sad it didn&#039;t work out :(  At least we got the Blogger Conference coming up!  No way we&#039;re missing that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - TRUTH!!!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Kody @ Financial Money Tips&lt;/b&gt; -  Thanks, my friend!  Turns out we ended up going a different route because *someone* didn&#039;t calculate properly ;)  Hitting Denver woulda cost us a good 13 hours! Oops.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, Portland to Vegas WOULD be cool!  We def. had a good time last week - thanks :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  Do it!!  You will not regret it :)
@&lt;b&gt;ShoeGal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that is awesome.  Killer motivation to get it too! :)
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; -  Yeah!  It was a blast meeting you the other night :)   
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch, yeah I can imagine that.  I wouldn&#039;t be good in long trips by myself, but with friends/family it&#039;s always easier.
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; -  Hah!  I&#039;ll find you one day ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, well yeah she&#039;s actually a LOT more patient and accepting than I woulda thunk :)  But since travel is now part of my job (w/ Love Drop and networking, etc), she&#039;s really understanding and just wants the best.  And since I work from  home now, we get to see each other a lot as she&#039;s a Grad student :)  And Yup!  We have a card we plug into this contraption (along w/ our laptops/chargers/etc) which then plugs into the lighter socket.  So we literally have our own work stations in the car - it&#039;s awesome.  Except when you get no coverage in the middle of the desert ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenni (Traveler for Good)&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool!  I like that :)  VOLAR - I&#039;m gonna use it!
@&lt;b&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, best time I&#039;ve had in a while for sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - It could be worse though - my biz partner could be a hot girl, haha... then it would be a different story ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Natalie @ Mango&lt;/b&gt; - Haha nice.  Will check it out the next time I&#039;m bored ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stella&lt;/b&gt; - It was fun!!!  And now I want to move back! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money, I know you are probably enjoying the scenery, taking in the experience, and just living in the moment on this road trip. But if you do happen to get bored (say you&#039;re driving through somewhere really dull or its raining or something), we did a post recently on things to do when you&#039;re bored at Mango Money. A lot of them you can do right from the car, some online, some not so much. Check it out: http://www.mangomoney.com/blog/cheap-fun/bored-bored-bored     Have fun!!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the habit of saying &quot;yes&quot; to random opportunity more often than most, especially when it comes to travel -  so I love the direction of this post.    Once, I used the word VOLAR as my acronym for my Voice of Logic and Reason.  VOLAR is the side of your brain that reminds you that it&#039;s not the right time, you haven&#039;t budgeted for it, blah blah blah (excuses, even if some are legit).   Then a good friend reminded me that in Spanish, VOLAR means to fly.   That&#039;s all the excuse I needed.

Wave at us in Denver as you trip through!]]></description>
