					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on a no spend day! I believe I did the exact opposite and am having a spend day...well not today only...a spend weekend! Money has unfortunately been flying out the door the last three days, but we&#039;re hoping to recoup it all in the long term! Bought a new car, a Prius V so hopefully the gas savings will help. And we had to do all the stuff that goes along with buying a new car, adjusting car insurance (lowered the premium by switching), returning the leased car etc etc. The sad thing is we bought the car Saturday, and found a ding on it today already! Most likely from someone else&#039; car door.]]></description>

Is it hopefully an outfit you can then use again in the future too? Like a black dress or something? That&#039;s what we did for our bridesmaids in our wedding - they could wear any black dress they wanted so it was easier on everybody (we had a huge party) and they didn&#039;t have to waste any money :)]]></description>
