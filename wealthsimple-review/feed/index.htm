					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s cool that more robo-advisors are entering the investing space! I still think something like Wealthfront is better. Wealthfront manages your first $15,000 for free, then it&#039;s 0.25% after that. Betterment has a similiar fee of 0.25%. Wealthsimple seems good but I think their 0.50% fee is a little high.]]></description>

Excellent notes - thank you!!

#5 is the most important one in my view - you&#039;re making moves and looking for the best home for your $$$, even if Wealthsimple isn&#039;t it.

Thanks for the raw feedback :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys. I&#039;ve been using WealthSimple since November and here are my thoughts:

1. Their customer service history is questionable, a quick search on Reddit will show you a bunch of complaints, attributed primarily to the expansion into the USA.

2. Transparency of fees and what is/isn&#039;t included vs WS Black wasn&#039;t noted on any registration screens, nor could you find it simply by browsing the website. So, when you set up a portfolio with a 401k and a IRA, the WS algorithm doesn&#039;t acknowledge you have these accounts and won&#039;t set them up to be tax efficient unless you&#039;re a WS Black member. Just something to note.

3. The app and website are great, but the data and projections provided are rudimentary, not good if you&#039;re a data and numbers person.

4. They connect to Mint. Not sure about Personal Capital. 

5. It was great for me to just get started and moving away from my other institutions which charged an arm and a leg for very modest returns. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll stay with them long term but it&#039;s a great option to start with.]]></description>

Good work experimenting so much! That&#039;s the name of the game really - finding those that work well for you, and shutting down the rest...

Glad you&#039;re finding them helpful :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J. Money,

I have taken many of your recommendations.   I had digit.  they were sort of pain, because it started by taking small sums of money and then was taking $40 at a time.   With zero sum budgeting, digit didn&#039;t really work for me.   I was just transferring the $ back to my checking account every $100-$200.  When they just announced their money fee, I closed this account.

I also use Qoins for round ups on a credit card and the payment goes to the credit card.   And I have acorns for investing the round ups. This uses my checking account.  I have close to $600 in that since you recommended it.

I am saving for my next used car with that money.   I imagine when I have a few thousand or so, I could move it to wealthfront.   My that time there will probably be more of these companies (apps) out there.

Thanks for seeking out this info and passing it on.    I love the ones that deal with round ups.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It really does looks like a nice layout of the app. Sometimes that is what you need to keep coming back and keep that involvement up. I like to have some visual representation of what my money is doing. It helps me focus more. Cheers]]></description>
