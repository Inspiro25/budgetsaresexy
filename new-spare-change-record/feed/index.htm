Yes! Love!

I bet it&#039;s fun as hell bringing that big ol&#039; jug over to a bank, haha.. Unless you really have to roll all of those first - wow. That would take some time alright...

But for $700 it would be well worth it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sadly, we don&#039;t have access to Coinstar for US money over here (stationed in the UK), and the UK Coinstar machines don&#039;t have no-fee options (ie, no Amazon gift card option), so we will have to turn all our change into the bank the old fashioned way (bagged/rolled).

BUT... for the most part all our change gets tossed into a big 5-gallon water jug.  Every time we move, we deposit that change in the bank!  Last PCS we had over $700, saved over 4 years.  Since the British have $1/$2 coins and we tend to toss those in a jar as well (change really only gets used at the car park), I imagine we will have a huge chunk of change when we move in a few years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That def. sucks, sorry to hear :( Y&#039;all don&#039;t have a coin machine or something people can use instead so you don&#039;t have to carry or count anything? I guess if he likes to roll them up himself it doesn&#039;t really help though...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a guy who comes into the bank I manage and picks up at least four boxes of pennies each week, sometimes up to EIGHT boxes.  He&#039;s always looking for old pennies.  Sometimes he&#039;ll bring in boxes of pennies that he has ROLLED himself at home (all the ones he doesn&#039;t want).  

It is SO SO SO SO SO SO annoying.  SERIOUSLY.  Do people not have anything better with their time?  I cringe every time he walks in because I happen to be a very small person and it takes a lot of heavy lifting to get those boxes and boxes of pennies out of the vault.  

So I urge you not to do this to your bank tellers.  It really is annoying and they are all looking at you like you are insane.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s definitely wrong that as an employee of the bank he&#039;s doing that. Since he has such a vested personal interest in personal gain, he&#039;s not at all caring about the customers best interest.

PS - a $52+ fee on the coin sorting? SHAME. That&#039;s more than a 5.5% charge! BOO on that decision.]]></description>

Awesome! And you&#039;re so right - you can get just about everything off Amazon these days, which is why I keep buying stock in them! :)]]></description>

Ooooooh! You should totally sort through them and see if you have any rare or silver quarters in there! Not sure if the machine would pop them out or not since they&#039;d weigh differently and what not, but man I&#039;d have myself entertained for HOURS if I was in charge of all that change :) You have to be a big coin nerd for that.]]></description>
