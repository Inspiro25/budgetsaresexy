					<description><![CDATA[I so WISH I could do the FinCon Community Pass!  I&#039;m in Vegas that weekend for a friend&#039;s birthday (boo-hoo, I know), but we met in law school IN DC!
I am really interested in the CFPB speaker.  I hope you&#039;ll do a post all about it!]]></description>

Wow, have you really?? What kinds of place have they sent you on?? Sounds like such an adventure! :)

One of these days I want to just head to the airport without knowing where I&#039;m going and literally buy a ticket for the next flight out, haha... Wouldn&#039;t that be so exhilarating?!]]></description>

Back from the weekend and feeling MUCH Better!!

Was great to sleep in and have two full days to just lounge and not even think about work/blog stuff either which I&#039;m sure could slow down the healing process...

Not gonna say I&#039;m at 100% yet, but at this rate - knock on wood - I should be there sooner than anticipated! Especially after reading so many horror stories from everyone, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that home inspection reports are scam. They are vague if there is a remote possibility that there might be something wrong they recommend hiring roofing inspector, plumbing inspector and so on....Although those reports pale in comparison with Environmental Phase I reports for commercial properties. It typically costs about $2,000 and it&#039;s 40 pages full of fluff with only Summary page worth paying attention. The best part is if there is a remote possibility of a potential environmental issue then report recommends Phase II study. Which costs $20,000 and more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good luck getting some much needed rest this weekend!  I know it is a little hard with 3 young boys but you better listen to the doctor.

Just think you have a reason not to unpack 5 more boxes that you left in the garage or basement to do later :)]]></description>
