Amen, brother...

And thanks for the recommendation. I&#039;d heard of it before but didn&#039;t realize it was so powerful! (Or that he was the guy who inspired DR!).

Really cool it shaped your finances like that. Going now to read more about it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, I loved the post and comments. I am a Christian too! Eastern Orthodox, which is not as common in America. 

Someone up in the comment section mentioned Larry Burkett. Yes, Dave learned from Larry! I want to put a plug in for my Christian mother who gave me the book &quot;Debt Free Living&quot; by Larry Burkett when I was 18 years old. What a great gift that KEEPS on Giving!!!! :-) My Mom gave it to me because my Dad and Mom were not good stewards of their money for the first 15 years of marriage. In fact, my Dad used to buy a new car every year......

In our modern, consumeristic society we are SLAVES to debt. The Bible teaches how horrendous debt is with passages like &quot;A debtor is a slave to the Lender&quot;. Larry Burkett mentions this. If anyone here knows someone who is drowning in debt, I highly recommend &quot;Debt Free Living&quot;. the case stories in that book are still applicable today.

yeah, Dave Ramsey and Larry Burkett are not perfect, but there is a lot of wisdom in minimizing debt. Think about it today - who wins with debt!?! We DO NOT win. The greedy banks win. Anyway, I know I am preaching to the choir here on J. Money&#039;s blog, but if we can help others let&#039;s do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dave Ramsey was life changing for us! I grew up w/ a Dad that had a BS in management but was all about low interest loans on things. I heard quite often &quot;it&#039;s like free money!&quot;
 Had my daughter in &#039;04, read Total Money Makeover when I was pregnant, hubby&#039;s 22yr. Navy career was ending, debt was normal! We turned it all around baby stepping . I love envelopes whether actual or sinking fund savings accts. People get caught up when &quot;Bible&quot; is mentioned- we try to explain it as a book of some good ideas, 10 commandments= 10 pretty good ideas for a society! Always learning and yes, DR is a great starting point! Be well everyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dave Ramsey often gets dismissed because of a trending societal aversion to religion (specifically, Christianity).  Generally speaking though, if you look at the baby steps in a vacuum what he has done is written down a path to success for the lowest common denominator.  I think generally speaking his methodology is something that a lot of people need.  

He would also be better served to add realistic return rates in his calculation scenarios.  The thing that really gets me is the not taking out a home loan over 15 years.  Great in theory, or if you live in a LCOL area but for those of us in the DC metro, unless you were lucky enough to marry an ambitious partner, that is just not doable.  The lowest price house is $500k and that is for a piece of garbage.  I guess you can poke holes in anything when it comes down to it... Use of credit is also something I don&#039;t agree with.  My SIL follows Ramsey blindly, she closed all her credit cards and now has a terrible score.  Barely could get a loan for a vehicle.

The point of all that is that DR should be used as a starting point and as a person becomes more fiscally responsible they should graduate to something more in keeping with reality.]]></description>
