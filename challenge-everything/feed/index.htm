Ack - yes, good job!!! You crack me up with that God comment, haha... I find it&#039;s hit or miss with most warranties for sure. I personally like them at times depending on what we&#039;re dealing with, but if you poll the financial community here they&#039;ll def. say it&#039;s a rip off ;)

Keep challenging everything, though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the Challenge Everything concept, it&#039;s so refreshing!  So, here&#039;s one I&#039;m challenging right now, the Home Warranty.  I&#039;ve had two (separate houses) in my life and both times I&#039;ve experienced nothing but headaches and hassles.  Home warranties are generally $500 for a year and seems to be a big home selling feature giving the buyers piece of mind that if anything breaks, it will only cost a small service fee and you&#039;re back up and running.  Easy Peasy!
However,it has never worked that way for me, I&#039;ve been denied a claim until I pointed out that my policy did cover the issue.  When I asked why the associate denied my claim I was told he was new (uh huh).  Then had to write letters to God and everyone in an attempt to get the warranty company to make good on the contract.  Seems only then did they comply with the contract.  
With my new contract, I&#039;ve been waiting over 2-months for a washer to be repaired.  Ugh!  Next time, I&#039;m just going to ask for $500 cash and I&#039;ll deal with any issue myself.
So, I&#039;m challenging this norm of home warranties as a selling feature - they are a total waste of money.]]></description>

Nice! You&#039;ll have to let us know how it goes over time - do it!!

We cut out cable completely last year which saved us an additional $50/mo, but other than that just been going with the flow and watching the savings add up :) That&#039;s the nice thing with this challenge - you only have to do things *once* for recurring savings to happen! It&#039;s pretty sweet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article , fun to read and your writing is great. I like the idea of putting the savings in a different savings account. 
At this time a day I am doing the 365 Penny Challenge and this money is going into one of our savings account. This money comes out of my purse from grocery and entertainment envelope budget. 
I also signed up for checkout 51 , Walmart Savings and just signed up for Ibotta. These are all new and I have not drawn out the money but when I do I will put into savings. 
For the winter we are in Nevada renting a small apartment. Once we return to Minnesota we will be redoing our budget and downsizing our belongings.]]></description>
