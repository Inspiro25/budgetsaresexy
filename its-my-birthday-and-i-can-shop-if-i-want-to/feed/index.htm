					<description><![CDATA[Happy belated!  Just getting back to the blogosphere after a short holiday hiatus.

I struggle too over spending money on myself--or letting my husband buy me expensive presents, because really it&#039;s all coming out of &quot;our&quot; money, and I&#039;m so hyper-focused on saving and cutting back wherever I can.

But financial stability isn&#039;t about hoarding and being miserly.  It&#039;s about saving money wherever possible so that you can ENJOY your life--and if that means splurging on occasion on things that truly make you happy, then that&#039;s your prerogative.

Says the girl who just bought herself Les Miz 25th anniversary tickets for her birthday in April.  :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone!  I had SUUUUUUCH a great time yesterday.  Didn&#039;t spend a dime, but the hanging out and exploring shops was exactly what I needed from the crazy last few weeks hustling :)  Hope you all had a wonderful day/holiday weekend too!  Much love!

@&lt;b&gt;Lauryn Doll&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yup!  We actually didn&#039;t have a cake this time though, so no singing was involved (we went to Dairy Queen together :)) but they usualy do!
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome, thx! 
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - I love it!
@&lt;b&gt;sanjay&lt;/b&gt; - YES! Agreed!  We need to do that for ourselves every now and then - I like your girlfriend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Foxie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I bet!
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - YES! No prize at all, though It does help w/ feeling secure ;)  I agree we have to be happy in life though and not go hardcore in any one direction even if we mean well.
@&lt;b&gt;Braden&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Well happy birthday to you too then, my friend :)  We are kindred spirits!
@&lt;b&gt;CrystalH&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, very soon!
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - What do you think this is? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah we do!  And go for it - you worked hard this year :)]]></description>
