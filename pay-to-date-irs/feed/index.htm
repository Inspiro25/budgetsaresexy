					<description><![CDATA[Let me just tell you all something. Fun fact... Generous dates have paid up to$100- $400 to buy me dinner at Capital grill in dc. Just dinner. 
I also date on &quot; traditional &quot; websites. The quality of the men are much better on Wyp. And they get dates. They don&#039;t get lost in the masses of &quot;frogs&quot; out there. They aren&#039;t &quot;losers&quot; at all. They are intelligent, successful men. Who are dating beautiful girls. Are you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, will make a note of it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, no place here for Psychos.  Or Sociopaths for that matter, that&#039;s worse!
@&lt;b&gt;jesinalbuquerque&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I&#039;m still going to claim naivety and believe they&#039;re just going on dates :) Maybe you should go undercover and then write about your findings? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenny~Z&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you sure would!
@&lt;b&gt;MAH&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right?  I REALLY hope someone tells us they&#039;ve tried it before so we can get the inside scoop... I&#039;d be VERY interested in finding out!
@&lt;b&gt;Suba&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well that&#039;s easy - a HOT date.  Any of us can get dates if we really wanted to, but a sexy one?  Like, REALLY sexy one??  I don&#039;t think we&#039;re that good ;)  So for $100 you get to share your date with a hottie.  Who likes you for your money :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s the women receiving the money that&#039;s in question, not the site.  If you make $600+ by going on dates you&#039;re technically supposed to claim it.  Well, if it all comes from one person I believe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[100k members? I wish I thought of an idea like this. Escort service with a politically correct name...

But seriously it would scare the hell of out me. What exactly is that guy expecting for that $100? Why can&#039;t he get a date without paying for it? I have watched enough Law &#038; Order - SVU episodes to imagine all kind of worst situation and freak out :)]]></description>
