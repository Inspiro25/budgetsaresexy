Rock on!! I hope you guys enjoy it!! I&#039;ll have to live vicariously through y&#039;all now that we have 3 kids since this was posted and ain&#039;t no way I&#039;m getting on the road with them all, haha... In fact, ironically enough we&#039;re finally laying down roots and probably buying a house for the long term - hah! (Though not giving up on this RV dream for later!! :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, sounds like you&#039;ve got a solid plan started! We are going to do the same, in fact we&#039;re already living full time in ours. We found a good deal on a used diesel pusher here in Georgia: 39&#039; 2002 Fleetwood Bounder, completely remodeled with low miles. We paid $43k for it! There are deals out there (we bought ours from a dealer near Savannah). For full timing it, look for storage space inside and out and amenities like washer dryer. If you&#039;re not mechanically inclined at least figure out the basics to keep it going before you hit the road. Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the advice and encouragement here. My husband just started trucking so in a few months we&#039;re hoping to get an rv and im planning on traveling behind him. Realizing the pros and cons we also have a yr old son that we&#039;re excited to home school and raise in &quot;freedom&quot;. He&#039;s over the road so at least for the first year his home won&#039;t be far away and he&#039;ll be making doing so. I havent met any trucker wives who&#039;ve actually done this but I&#039;m definitely ready as I&#039;ve travelled many interstates in my moves (and never wanted to stop) lol. I plan on installing satellite though because I can&#039;t be withoutmy net.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband is a Lineman and travels for work,  we recently bought a 5th wheel and are living full-time in CA! We love it so much we are considering selling our home in OK and staying on the road indefinitely. :-) We have 2 kids (almost 3 and 6 months).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, no tips here unfortunately as I haven&#039;t gone through the process (yet), but I do admire you for giving it a shot! Or at least thinking and researching it all :) Let us know what you find out and if you ever go for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi folks - I&#039;ve enjoyed reading your comments.  My husband and I want to retire, but we unfortunately bought a house in 2007 that decreased in value to about $70,000 less of what we paid for it.  So, selling the house and moving to an RV park is now out of t he question.  It&#039;s sad because we spent a lot of money fixing it up and making it nice.  But the neighborhood continues to have foreclosures and tanking the selling price.  I&#039;ve lost hope that in our lifetime we would see much improvement.

Therefore, we are now thinking of buying an RV and being camp hosts in the summer at campgrounds in places we like and then living somewhere during the winter.  I would never have considered this, but it seems to be our best option. I&#039;m terrified, however, of buying a cheap RV that just falls apart and then we have no home whatsoever.  We don&#039;t have much money, but we&#039;re putting money in a savings account for a down payment.  Any ideas or tips, please???]]></description>
