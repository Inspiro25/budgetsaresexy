					<description><![CDATA[These are awesome! I have seen people do these before, but never thought about doing one myself. I believe I will give them a try. We are finally under $400,000 left to pay off! I believe they will help the kids see where we are at a glance and offer a subtle reminder to avoid debt so you never have to pay it off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love these! I created a mortgage countdown chart many years ago and meticulously crossed off each mortgage payment for five years. Itâ€™s fun to visualize the numbers dropping. This year we decided to create a paper chain, you know like the kind kids use to countdown the number of days until Christmas. Every month we take a link off and watch the chain get shorter!]]></description>
