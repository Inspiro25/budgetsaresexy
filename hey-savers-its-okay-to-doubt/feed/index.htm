					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Barb Friedberg&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, if that motivates you more power to ya!  It certainly keeps things nice and simple :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, thanks :)  Yeah, money is meant to be SPENT for sure - just gotta prioritize it and have that balance like you mentioned.  Personal finance covers all aspects, baby!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, we regularly SAVE, not for specific goals (except retirement and education for the daughter). When we want a treat, vacation, etc. we spend our savings. It works fine for us, as we both lean towards responsible spending. We love vacations and value putting our savings towards them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve finally moved on to saving for a rainy day/travel/fun fund. I can see some of it ending up back into my retirement savings, but at least it&#039;s money that I don&#039;t have to worry about spending. It doesn&#039;t have any prearranged tags on it.

Now I just need to find someone to travel with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a chronic ING-accounter for this very reason.  It&#039;s difficult to save up, and even more difficult to get a $0 balance at the end of it all.  But with a million sub-accounts for everything from emergency car repairs to my next security deposit to vacation, that $0 isn&#039;t representative of all my savings.  Thank you, OCD.]]></description>
