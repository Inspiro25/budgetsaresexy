					<description><![CDATA[Hey! A while back I made a small web tool that basically generates a tonne of fake lotto results (I think that I generate about 9 results per second). I figured that it would be interesting to witness the odds with my own eyes. Take a look and let me know what you think: http://thisinterestsme.com/lotto/ So far, nobody has won the grand prize on it, as far as I&#039;m aware.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The author of this article sounds like he has more in common with his fictitious &quot;Billie- Bob&quot; than he realizes.  Today&#039;s poor are not only the uneducated illiterates who survive off of government programs.  Many are well educated and over 50, and deemed no longer useful.  Many are also people who have had their homes foreclosed upon and can&#039;t pass financial screens for good credit when they apply for jobs.  To lump all poor people into one bread basket is a joke and it only adds to the problem.  Is this a tax on the poor?  No.  But it certainly is a great marketing scheme to bilk the poor of their needed funds.  Then again, many people (like me) only pay a buck for a ticket when the lottery gains become huge.  For us, it is a dalliance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sadly, only $150. Yeah, I know, it sucks. It was the Mega Millions, I think, actually. I&#039;ve come close before, and I&#039;ve won more times playing just a buck than the times I went crazy and bought 5 or 10 when jackpots were high, but that&#039;s relatively rare.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Christopher&lt;/b&gt; - I remember getting money like that at the arcades growing up :) Was so much easier to spend than when I had to use my own allowance money! Haha... 

@&lt;b&gt;Roger C.&lt;/b&gt; - WOW, that&#039;s crazy close!  What did you win instead of the jackpot then? Was it at least in the thousands range?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any who looks at the odds for the Powerball and the Mega Millions are really sad. That&#039;s not the point. It is usually over $200 million for a reason. Pretending you&#039;re smart for not playing it really isn&#039;t. I once was two numbers away from winning the whole thing. I had the powerball and three of the regular numbers. If I got the last 2, I&#039;m quite sure most of you would be harassing me for money, so quit the elitist act. I know human nature quite well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The trick to win the lottery is to play scratch tickets because the odds are simply greater. They can be as high as 1 out of 2 of winning SOMETHING (free ticket to the big jackpot).]]></description>
