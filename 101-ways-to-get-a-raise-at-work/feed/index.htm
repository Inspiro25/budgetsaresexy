Hey Zach thanks for the feedback! There&#039;s definitely no one-size-fits-all advice for this type of stuff. You&#039;re right that every company has different cultures and ever executive responds differently to stuff.  What works for some people won&#039;t work for others. All in all, standing out at work requires thinking outside of the box and doing things others don&#039;t usually do.  Thanks for your perspective and please feel free to share some points that HAVE worked out for you in the past. Cheers!]]></description>

I read this as tone deaf for so many other reasons. Reading company culture is huge and most of these suggestions are not helpful. Setting a 20 minute meeting with anyone at the C-level.... I mean, it depends on what your level is and how large the company is, but most C level people will just see you as wasting their time.

Most managers can easily identify brown-nosers, while they will act gracious because they are being professional, they will see these acts for what they are. Was this list just copied and pasted from some bad list floating around the internet?]]></description>

Standing out and being valuable is sometimes only half the battle. Making sure your compensated accordingly is necessary also for sure. I like how you mentioned be prepared to leave. That&#039;s big in negotiations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article and some good ideas.  Made me nostalgic for the old cubical days pre-pandemic. Anyway something I expected but didn’t see was to interview and get a job offer with a higher salary (either to get a “raise” by switching companies or to seek a counter offer from your employer).  This is playing hardball and not for everyone but worked for me.  Must be prepared to leave too.  Afterward I found out some of my peers got raises/promotions the same way.  At a minimum, know your value.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is nice to have a list of ideas around like this.  However, there are a few points where I wanted to add my perspective. The first, not all people like kids and dogs (especially not in the office).  On a very rare occasion an employee at my last employer might bring in a child to set up in a spare enclave when childcare fell through, and since the child was well behaved and kept to that room no one minded.  But the few times that loud, wild, or noisy kids were brought in they were the number one source of complaints.  Others are allergic to dogs, afraid of dogs, or just flat out don&#039;t like them.  Not to mention that no one else is allowed to bring other types of pets that they like to the office.  Also, the advice to be the one that organizes birthday/holiday/group bonding stuff, etc and to be the one that always takes notes for your boss should kept to an absolute minimum if you are female.  These are two of the tasks that famously backfire for us and serve to give others the perspective of us not really being a serious leader or true professional.  Seriously, most any search you do on advice for women professionals will tell you this isn&#039;t a good idea to be known for those types of tasks.  I cannot recommend the Ask A Manager blog enough for those looking for career advice, professional etiquette, wanting to know if what goes on at their office is normal or not, or even just seeing what employer actions are even legal.  Thank you for your thoughts on being a good co-worker.]]></description>

Side hustles are definitely important for hobbies, creative outlets, fun, or starting a new business. But I agree that being valuable (and happy!) at your primary job is very important. Have a great week IF!]]></description>

When I think back to all the people at my past employers that stood out - they were all positive, encouraging, and did something unique that brought value to the rest of the team. I will never forget these type of people :)  Cheers Debbie!]]></description>
