					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Every little bit helps, right?
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, I never said I wasn&#039;t crazy ;)  Because of that slight adventure, I am now a full-time blogger spreading the gospel of finance!  Could have never guessed that - I hate writing.
@&lt;b&gt;Corey @ 20&#039;s Finances&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, yeah for sure -- they sit there for up to 90 days plenty of times, but for whatever reason I guess those go faster?  It&#039;s all rather fascinating to me.
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, do it!  And then have her report back her results :)  We&#039;ll test it in real life!  We&#039;ll do it live!  WE&#039;LL DO IT LIVE!!
@&lt;b&gt;Babs&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!!  I love your style, my Babs ;)  Always doing your research and figuring out the best ways to stretch those dollars - nicely done.  I&#039;m gonna totally steal that trick when it&#039;s time for us to start looking elsewhere... I imagine it gets you excited even more too?  And when you catch a diamond in the rough? Saweeeeet.  Thanks for dropping your two cents my dear, actually got one of your guest posts going up soon - will holler w/ the date ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Bergie Powers&lt;/b&gt; - Yay!  Me too.  I especially like how I have both a pumpkin AND a gingerbread house on my site right now - talk about festive!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been working toward retirement for about a year, and signed up to receive listings from my retirement city last Jan.  Having watched the housing market on a daily basis for this long has taught me a couple things:  

1)  I noticed there are lots more homes for sale in the summer, but lots more price reductions and homes that sell for less than list price in fall/winter.  I asked a realtor about this and she confirmed that everyone wants to move in the summer, so there&#039;s lots more  listings and also lots more buyers competing with for the good homes.  In the winter, home sellers are more desperate (my words not hers), so buyers can drive a harder bargain.   So, if you can time your home purchase, think about buying your home instead of Christmas/Hannukah/Kwanzaa presents!   If you absolutely have to sell your home in November, you have my condolences.

2)  By watching listings from the same neighborhoods over a long period of time, I&#039;ve gotten a good sense of what is a reasonable price for a home with all the bells and whistles, as well as for homes with a few minuses.  There&#039;s frequently a big price difference between a house that is okay looking, and a house that is an eyecatcher.  In many cases, that price difference is a lot more than the cost of getting the upgrades done.  So, as J$ said, if you&#039;re a seller you&#039;ve got to pay attention to those things and make a little effort to get your house ready to compete in the markeplace.   

3)  If you&#039;re a buyer however, you might want to look more closely at those homes that aren&#039;t perfect and ask yourself if they&#039;d be your dream home with a few changes.  I did a little casual research into costs for things like refinishing or replacing countertops, flooring, kitchen cabinets,bathrooms etc. so I can make a rough guess of what it&#039;d cost to upgrade things when I see a house that has potential.  I&#039;m seeing a lot of bargains by looking at it that way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha - that&#039;s hilarious. I guess it makes sense because the people who are buying houses are ones who work during the week and then go house hunting on the weekends. But, it&#039;s still strange because I would imagine a house sits on the market more than a week. thanks for sharing.]]></description>
