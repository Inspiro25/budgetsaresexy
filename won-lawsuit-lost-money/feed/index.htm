					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;m okay with everything at this point :)
@&lt;b&gt;jesse.anne.o&lt;/b&gt; - You would think, right?  Just the way it works sometimes I guess.  Who knows, maybe hiring a different attourney would have gotten faster results?  (Though might have cost us way more in the long run too?)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, indeed I did ;)  I was the ONLY one who fully funded it too - can you believe that??  Some people filled it up half way, or even a quarter, but it&#039;s like come on!  That&#039;s FREE fullyvested money you don&#039;t have to do a THING for!  And you save like mad!  But you know how poeple are, they always *need* that money right here and now... still can&#039;t disclose info though, sorry.  Would give me and all my bosses/etc away which is no good for any of our privacy and/or legal battles.  Can&#039;t be defaming anyone/thing or I&#039;ll find myself back in the hot seat. No matter how right or not they are :(
@&lt;b&gt;Elle@Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah that&#039;s the problem I&#039;m really having right now -- how to make sure no one ELSE gets their ass handed to them again.  I don&#039;t know if they have any workers underneath them yet, but would love to warn them if I legally can w/out any repurcussions.  The problem with all of this is that they have much more (and better) lawyers than any of us do, so if they want to put up a fight they can easily do so.  So the other half of me is trying to stay away from everything just to be on the safe side.  $hitty situation all around though.
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, &quot;it&#039;s just business&quot; they&#039;ve said.  We won&#039;t be the ones judging them though once they&#039;re gone, so they can do as they feel is necessary.
@&lt;b&gt;Money&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, I know 100% sure I could dick them over REAL easily but I&#039;d have to be willing to deal with the consequences of what would come out of that.  A) Getting sued for defamation and Lord knows what else, and b) Fighting just as dirty as they were. At the end of the day it&#039;s just not worth it to me. I&#039;d rather blog about it anonymously and then move on w/ my life ;)
@&lt;b&gt;iwantmyhdbflat&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, wow!  Yeah not good news at all - I&#039;m sorry to hear that :(  But VERY glad you&#039;re at least getting your base salaries - I think the $hit would hit the fan so much faster if you all weren&#039;t getting anything.  I&#039;ll agree it is probably a problem with cash flow, at least in all my experience of this.  Hopefully they&#039;ll get some more funding or whatever and can pay you all at once so you can be caught up 100% again. Then I&#039;d start looking for other jobs if you haven&#039;t been doing so already ;)  All a mater of what you can handle though.  I was good for a while at my place, but some people dipped out after a certain cut off point.  You gotta know your limits and when to take action, that&#039;s for sure.  Keep us update]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Big companies can be as unstable as start-ups.

I&#039;m working in the Asian headquarters of a Swiss MNC, and they have owed our entire sales team - including me - commissions for the past 10 months.  That&#039;s TEN FREAKING MONTHS!!!  We still get our basic salaries and claims though.
Our company is known for being a bad paymaster to suppliers, but this time it has really hit the pits.  Accounts has a new excuse everyday and giving us impossibly complicated forms to fill up, just so that they can delay paying out commissions.  We suspect that cashflow is the problem.
I&#039;m going to report the case to the Hong Kong labour department if I still don&#039;t get my commissions by the end of this month.  The catch is that I&#039;m a foreigner and their laws might not protect me.
I so want to kick their a**!!!]]></description>
