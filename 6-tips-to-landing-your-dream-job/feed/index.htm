					<description><![CDATA[I will agree with that, as long as it&#039;s done in an appropriate fashion.  A lot of people are cynical and shooting down things left and right, BUT they never come up with any solutions or add anything positive to the mix.  If you can find issues and then fix them (or even make them better) then more power to you!  We def. need more of those types of people at a company :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#2

Why do I always see posts against skeptics and cynics? 

I absolutely think they are essential to any organization. In fact, they are the promoters of change. Sure, they&#039;re annoying to be with as your ego might be crushed around them. But some &quot;negative&quot; people are really necessary. If you&#039;re a skeptic, just make sure you are smart and you&#039;re making constructive criticisms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m assuming if you are trying to land your dream job, you already know what your dream job is, but I&#039;d suggest spending time making a list of things you want in a dream job.  Salary, work/balance, chance to grow, passionate industry, etc. before applying all over the place.]]></description>
