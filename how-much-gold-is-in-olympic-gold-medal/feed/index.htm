					<description><![CDATA[So, the medals are ony gold plated and then you have to pay taxes on them too.  Sure isn&#039;t like the old days, but of course, the Olympians from 1912 probably didn&#039;t make a fortune hawking McDonald&#039;s!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lynn @ Broke-Ass Mommy&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... right?
@&lt;b&gt;DebtsnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, well that&#039;s nice!!  I&#039;ve actually heard that about other countries too, like those who don&#039;t win much. Their winners get a TON of VIP treatment!
@&lt;b&gt;Gekko&lt;/b&gt; - In more ways than one :)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, same here... though I guess they ARE worth more if they ever go on the market.  They&#039;re only technically cheaper cuz of the gold weight and all that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting to see the progression in size. Dollar value, not so much. And this fact really surprised me. I thought that a golden medal would be worth so much more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was watching the Olympics the other day (or maybe I read it online) they said that Americans make $25,000 if they win a Gold medal, $15,000 for a Silver, and $10,000 for a bronze.  Of course they make a crapload more with endorsement deals afterwards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;K @ Get Worth&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, that&#039;s pretty cool!  Yeah, I&#039;d be interested in learning more about how much it costs to make them, and WHO does it all, too.  Would be pretty cool to nab the Olympics as a client :)
@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, I&#039;m sure they already write all that stuff off if they make any sort of money off it outside the Olympics :) You can be a small business in yourself, yeah?
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, yeah these athletes bring home TONS more than just the medals!  Advertising deals, free stuff all over from people trying to woo them, you name it.  It&#039;s win-win all around!  (Baby and Daddy are doing well!! Slowly getting adjusted and enjoying their time being spent together :))
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Right? That&#039;s the least of their thoughts going through their heads when winning :)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I know. And if not, your kids or grandkids certainly wouldn&#039;t have a hard time cashing in for that either ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ornella @ Moneylicious&lt;/b&gt; - YUP!  It means more than just the physical metals in it! And I&#039;m loving silver these days! Totally want to pick some more up, myself :)
@&lt;b&gt;Em&lt;/b&gt; - For sure - you could sell those bad boys for TONS no doubt about it.]]></description>
