					<description><![CDATA[Last May, at age 54, after 35 years raising six kids and 29 years homeschooling them, I was hired for a seasonal wildland fire support position with our local state forestry office. All my earnings went to our mortgage which we paid off January 31. With my husband&#039;s 401K, pension, and other sources of income, and being debt-free, we could retire now, but I just got started! I really like having a seasonal, part-time job since it lets me work and still have a life. Husband will be 59 this summer. His job is a good one with generous benefits but very stressful. He can retire or pursue other work possibilities pretty much whenever he decides to pull the trigger. I, however, plan to keep working as long as I enjoy what I&#039;m doing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have a super-specific number, as I&#039;m one of those people who would have no idea what to do with herself without SOMEthing on her agenda at all times, but I&#039;m aiming for mid fifties. The goal has been $1M by forty (though the last month has made that harder) and into the low $2M range by 50-52. 

My plans could absolutely change by then, but for now, I dream of being able to spend a month or two each summer in Finland, where summers are exquisitely divine, another month or two traveling wherever strikes my fancy, and the rest of the time at my home base in the US.]]></description>
