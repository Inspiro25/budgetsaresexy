					<description><![CDATA[I saw a clip awhile ago. A German restaurant owner said he had a very hard time finding waiters. Since most go to college free, who wants to work for low wages as a waiter? He had to raise salaries fairly high to attract workers.
So....when the Chancellor opened the doors in the past 2 years to displaced immigrants...it was humanitarian but also to help fill the lower end jobs.
There was a similar problem in NJ. With the high cost of living (especially property taxes), no one could survive working at a fast food restaurant for minimum wage so NJ was pretty much forced to raise it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In India, there is a Public Provident Fund in which you can invest upto Rs. 150,000 per year. The guaranteed rate of return is around 8% right now (used to be 12% in the nineties, so its slowing reducing). And this interest is tax free. 

The best deal is for Indians living abroad (NRI - Non Resident Indian). They can open deposits in Indian banks for any amount and get tax free 8% return! Doesn&#039;t get any better than this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’d imagine you can “hack” a lot more out of travel with all that cash you’d be saving too instead of throwing it away!&quot;

Ah but hang on a second there. Travel hackers aren&#039;t actually the ones incurring the debts and making the ridiculous interest payments (ok so there are people using the rewards system who also pay interest but these are not what I&#039;d call hackers as such!).

This system is effectively a transfer of wealth from people who are bad with money (paying interest) to those who are not. Nothing against this, and I&#039;d do it in a shot if the same opportunities were available in the UK as well haha. But let&#039;s be clear on what is happening here :)

On that last point, I am guessing people in the UK dislike credit card debts a little bit more than US, but not as much as French people, because there are some rewards available but they are not that great to be honest.

Cheers!]]></description>

I&#039;m guessing that refers to the comment I deleted of yours? ;)

Would have kept it if &quot;molesting of women&quot; hadn&#039;t been dropped...]]></description>

You&#039;re right about these French facts (although not quite sure about the percentage...). But I would add that contrary to the US : virtually no student debt, and very limited consumer debt (what american credit cards are used for)... 
Now maybe you prefer those ? ;)]]></description>
