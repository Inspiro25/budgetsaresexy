Can highly recommend. I have a full set of them (earned as rewards for selling in college) and they&#039;re strictly speaking a forever guarantee. I sent someone&#039;s knife from the...gosh, 60s or 70s? back to the factory and they just replaced it. Even the serrated ones can be sharpened, and you can request someone to come to your home and sharpen, although they will try to upsell you haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Years ago, I bought a 3/8 impact gearwrench set for my husband on Amazon. It&#039;s been an incredible set. It&#039;s great to be able to grab anything without having to go back and forth to the garage. The set, wrench pliers, cobras, m12 ratchet, and impact wrench appear to handle 95 percent of his road needs. It cost me 66 dollars in 2016.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I seriously couldn&#039;t agree with this more. A lot of times this will seem more expensive, but going for quality tends to pay for itself (if you do it right) in just one or two years. What eventually got me on this mindset was going from replacing my shoes every single year (or sometimes 6 months, depending on use) to opting for some much nicer shoes. Your example is Red Wing, which is definitely a great brand. There are a lot of good options though, and they&#039;ll pay for themselves in no time. With basic maintenance they can last for many years. Beyond that, they also have better support and are more comfortable than what I wore before!

I know that was a bit of a tangent - but swinging for something that is slightly more expensive now can be really worth it. It pays to not cut certain corners.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a 21+ year old Columbia ski. I almost choked when I bought it.  Just had the zipper replaced for the second time (plastic zippers aren&#039;t the most durable).  Also just replaced the zipper on my North Face coat for the first time (it isn&#039;t worn as much as the Columbia).  It&#039;s probably 19+ years old.  Once again, a plastic zipper.

Have had a set of Cutco knives for 22+ years.  I&#039;ve sent them in a handful of times for sharpening.  If they determine an item is too far gone, they&#039;ll replace it for free.  Unless it&#039;s vintage, in which case a person can decline the replacement.

Bought my 2011 Honda CR-V in 2014 with just over 18K miles.  It now has about 66K miles.  I&#039;ve read it is the best CR-V ever manufactured.  And if I maintain it regularly, which I do, it should last until at least 250K miles.  I hope so, I&#039;m 61, and don&#039;t intend to ever buy another car.

We are cleaning out our 91-year old mom&#039;s house because she has moved into assisted living.  Yesterday we packed her Revereware pots and pans (copper bottoms).  She and our dad were married in 1948, and this is the only set of pots and pans she&#039;s ever had.  They are still in great shape.]]></description>
