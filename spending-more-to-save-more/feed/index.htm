					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Darwin&#039;s Money&lt;/b&gt; - Haha exactly!!!  Same with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond - if you don&#039;t roll up with a coupon you&#039;re all kinds of jacked up ;) And the worst is when you accidentally leave them behind!!! Cuz you know you get tempted to just say screw it, haha..
@&lt;b&gt;Travis @DebtChronicles&lt;/b&gt; - Awwwwwwwww.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If it were just me, I would have declined faster than a TSA patdown.

If my wife were with me, she&#039;d most likely come up with some circular argument that would have my head spin just long enough to agree with it.

I&#039;m a sucker for her big brown eyes too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha you mention those Express coupons.  It&#039;s like Kohl&#039;s too.  My wife can&#039;t get enough of those coupons.  I&#039;m like, &quot;who the hell EVER pays full price at any of these stores?  What a chump!&quot;.  When a store constantly offers 20% off, isn&#039;t that really the &quot;non-sale&quot; price?  And a real sale is more like 40% off?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s cuz you are awesome!!  If only we can convince everyone else to be that good :)
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s perfect!  And oddly enough, my wife almost bought me something from it yesterday! haha... but it was for something I wanted to visit anyways - so I totally get that :)
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  You know, I would  have def. taken up that challenge if I was dared ;) If we&#039;re ever flying together, you&#039;ll have to remember that.
@&lt;b&gt;Kyle&lt;/b&gt; - I would have too if we were going, let&#039;s say, to Cali or something :)  And ESPECIALLY if it was in the evening!  I get soooo sleepy if I try drinking in morning/afternoon.
@&lt;b&gt;Peliroo&lt;/b&gt; - Shut it!  I pack like a girl, I know :)
@&lt;b&gt;rainbowfish&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh yeah I remember when some places let you take those 50% deals too instead of actually having to buy 1 to get 1.  Haven&#039;t seen one in a while here either :(
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yes - all good points.
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  I did!  I made $15 an hour! haha... that&#039;s a funny/cool way to look at it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Grant&lt;/b&gt; - There you go!  If you have more than 1 bag it REALLY makes it worth it then too - same w/ golf clubs.  You did good, sir, you did good.
@&lt;b&gt;Mary H&lt;/b&gt; - Haha never heard of it :)  but now Googling!
@&lt;b&gt;wldflr&lt;/b&gt; - See, now THAT is smart.  A) Because you can make the most use out of it (or at least your husband can), and B) you plan AHEAD for it!  Which is key.  Not that you always have that option cuz they may be booked and all that, but you guys set yourself up for best-case scenario and you jump at the opportunity.  It&#039;s perfect! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Well, I&#039;ll tell you a secret too.  On my way TO Milwaukee I DID get a free upgrade!  I don&#039;t know how I did it, but when I went to look at my seat # it pointed to first class.  I was like, huh???  is this a mistake? haha... it wasn&#039;t until the stewardess called me by my last name that I realized it was meant to be my seat, haha... so I got to enjoy it already! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Only if it was in the evening, and if I was going TO somewhere.  Like on a vacay or biz trip, etc.  Coming back from trips I don&#039;t care much for it, and if it&#039;s not in evening I probably wouldn&#039;t drink much anyways to take full advantage of it :)  Also, dinner in those places are awesome!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh that is a good one!  We&#039;re in initial talks about getting new mattresses so I can totally appreciate that groupon :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - True that. And is another GREAT perk about bugeting and knowing where all your money is at all times.  Cuz when you get an opportunity like that - whether it&#039;s good or bad - you can at least know right away what kind of affect it would have, thus giving you better chances at a good decision :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - I bet!!!  I would ofcourse doing it for international trips :) I used to work for the airlines and ALWAYS paid a litle more to fly in style across water... ofcourse &quot;a little more&quot; only meant like $30-$50 cuz most of it was comped! haha... oh how I miss those times...
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I&#039;m surprised the clerk didn&#039;t ask you to buy them and then sell it to her for $4 ;)  That&#039;s awsome you stuck to your guns though.  I probably would have caved in that instance, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Ryan&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I doubt they check ID in business class, but that&#039;s very interesting... you should try it one day and see what happens ;)
@&lt;b&gt;South County Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  They are GREAT when the stars align for you, but trouble when they catch you in vulnerable mode, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;slug &#124; sunkcostsareirrelevant.com&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  We have a winner!!!!  That is awesome dude.  I&#039;ve actually heard that before from another blogger years ago, but then I heard some rule came in place w/ credit cards that won&#039;t allow it anymore or something?  Or maybe you can only buy a certain amount each time on a card?  Regardless though, I&#039;m a big fan of workin&#039; that out :)  Though I&#039;m too lazy for it, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a very rare instance, yes you can spend more to save more.

Wait until the beginning of your credit card cycle.  Buy $2,000 worth of $1 coins from the US Mint free Direct Ship Program with 2% reward card.  Reap $40 in rewards.  Deposit coins in bank upon receipt.  Reap 30-50 days of interest on $2,000.  Pay off credit card balance in full.  Repeat monthly.  

RESULTS:
Increased spending = $24k/yr.
Increased savings = $480 + interest.

SPENDING MORE TO SAVE MORE SUCCESS!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The other day I picked up one of those internet deals... a gift card valued at $25 for only $2... and yes, there were stings attached to the card... (you have to spend $35 on food with an 18% gratuity). We bought it because my fiance wanted to go there with his buddies for his bachelor party so the $35 food will easily be hit, and we always tip 20% unless the service is really bad, so for us it will save us money because we knew he go out with a large group.

That same coupon we wouldn&#039;t have normally bought because we&#039;d have to spend more to save then we would for just ourselves to go out. 

Those social media deals are only good if you know you will use it or if it coincides with a planned shopping trip.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Crystal, if I was in the mood for drinking, aka all the time :), I would have jumped on it. Of course, there might have been a problem if I was asked for ID, but I&#039;m sure I could charm the crap outta the flight attendant and get hooked up. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I am the worst at this. Especially buy-two offers when I really only wanted one in the first place. I am suck a sucker for it. But the cashiers are the worst. I once bought one vinyl record frame at Urban Outfitters for $20. They were 2 for $24, so great savings, but I really only needed one. The clerk looked at me like I was crazy when I declined to get a second for only $4! 

That said, for $30 I totally would have taken the upgrade to business class.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel the same way! There is no way I would pay an extra $50 to upgrade to nicer seats. If it was a free upgrade, I&#039;d jump on it. hahaha.. It was only two hours anyway, no big deal right? If it was 20 hours for $50, I&#039;d pay for that. We got a free upgrade once on the way to Frankfurt, it was too awesome for words.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this has gotten most of us at one time or another.  I know a lot of people who get a little Groupon-crazy and end up trying to sell them off later when they realize they&#039;ve overspent!

As you mention, the key is knowing your budget at the outset, and then pausing for just a couple seconds before you buy to figure out if that extra cost is in your budget.  Or if you do have some extra wiggle room, use those couple seconds to make that quick trade-off comparison in your mind about what else you could do with that money.  Once you get in the habit, it&#039;s not as hard to pass deals up.]]></description>
