					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - You wouldn&#039;t be the first!  Check out what one of my good friends is doing - I&#039;m also tempted to follow! (just not *that* hardcore): 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/is-gold-the-answer-to-a-market-meltdown/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2011/10/is-gold-the-answer-to-a-market-meltdown/&lt;/a&gt;

@&lt;b&gt;Monica&lt;/b&gt; - It all helps out though!  And eventually you&#039;ll hit a good, efficient, gig that will put you over the top :)  Keep workin&#039; hard!!
@&lt;b&gt;Shondell&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s def. scary for sure.  We can only do our best though - remember that!  And if you find yourself slacking, maybe do something that takes just 15-20 mins towards something important to you? We can all find that time each day to make small changes :)  You can do it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - That is so scary indeed!!  Oh man, I hope none of us  have to go through that :(  Very very scary.
@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, not fun at all :(  Are you working on any backup plans just in case?
@&lt;b&gt;American Debt Project&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that&#039;s awesome (the Simpsons, not your situation ;)).  I&#039;m sure you already know you gotta just give it a shot once and for all and see what happens, but I totally hear ya on being afraid of that &quot;no.&quot;  There&#039;s gotta be another way to find a loan if it falls through though, eh?  It seems from what you&#039;ve said that you should def. be a good candidate.  If the place you&#039;re going to rejects you, start trying credit unions - they&#039;re GREAT at auto loans.
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff Crews&lt;/b&gt; - Damn straight!  WE&#039;RE in control, not them.  Great mindset to keep in you head - well done ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Monica&lt;/b&gt; - Oh no!  That&#039;s not fun at all, I&#039;m sorry :(  Are you working on any plans in the meantime?  Any hustling you can do to either pay off the debt once and for all, or start building back up that emergency fund?  I hope so! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sharon V&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  You do!  Do you work too, or just the bf?  I don&#039;t like to think about death a lot - THAT is scary (and love always comes first!!) - but the money situation can go to $hit real fast when stuff like that happens... always good to play &quot;what if&quot; earlier on than later.  I hope you never have to deal with that though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger @ Girls Just Wanna Have Funds&lt;/b&gt; - Good :)  You&#039;re a damn smart woman too, I don&#039;t have any doubts you guys couldn&#039;t overcome them.  You&#039;re crazy passionate!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gosh I loved this post but I hate discussing my fears so I just take it to God in prayer otherwise discussing them makes them all too real.   Most of them I&#039;ve made into life lessons.  So if I fear something that I&#039;ve seen happen to someone else then I try to learn from it so that I no longer fear it happening to me.  

 But I am aware of them and like you I am working feverishly to make sure that whatever happens, we&#039;re OK.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My biggest fear is my boyfriend getting injured or killed on the job. He&#039;s recently had a week off because he fell backward in an unlit place and injured his back. Thankfully, that wont&#039;t  affect us until next month, when we will have reduced expenses due to moving to a cheaper place. If he ever lost his income permanently though, it could be dire. We need an emergency fund]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My biggest is fear right now is me not finding a job soon and ending up getting divorced because of the financial strife.  We managed to make it through 2011 with only $2K on the credit card, but we also only have a little over $1K left in our savings account after initially having over $14K.  With a little one and a teenager to take care of, it is only a matter of time before the $2K increases exponentially.]]></description>

We managed to make it through 2011 with only $2K on the credit card, but we also only have a little over $1K left in our savings account after initially having over $14K.  With a little one and a teenager to take care of, it is only a matter of time before the $2K increases exponentially.</p>
