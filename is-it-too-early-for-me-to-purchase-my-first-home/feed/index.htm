					<description><![CDATA[StackingCash, just to clarify:  I&#039;m recommending a 30-yr mortgage to give you lower minimum payments, which will give you maximum flexibility in terms of payments if things get tough financially (like one spouse loses their job, or unexpected big medical bills).   But I strongly recommend you pay it off early by making an extra principal payment each month, or an extra $100 a month if you can.

And it&#039;s really not a 30-year commitment most of the time.  It&#039;s very rare for anyone to stay in one home for 30 years these days (although many of our parents did).  So when you sell the home, that mortgage is paid off, and you move on to another one, with (usually) tax-free profit to roll into the new house.  It&#039;s a great way to build a nest egg.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Bobby.  Unless you know you will be able to sell your house easily, your setting yourself up for a 30 year commitment as far as Janet is concerned.  Think about it, THIRTY years.  I hate to say it but with a 30k income I don&#039;t feel you would be able to truly afford a house because the mortgage is just one expense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being a single guy, 24, and I have no debt so I feel I can relate.

There is no way I&#039;d ever buy a house this early in my life. I feel like I&#039;m just getting started and I can afford all the nice things, I wouldn&#039;t want to tie myself down with a huge mortgage.  Like someone else said too, you meet a girl and she&#039;ll probably want to pick out a house herself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guys, this is GREAT stuff!!!  Two things I liked in particular (which I can&#039;t believe I forgot about!):

1)  The tax benefit to all that interest.  Yes!  I remember that being a huge selling point when we bought our home 3 years ago... shouldn&#039;t sway you one way or the other as it&#039;s a moot point if you&#039;re not ready to buy yet, but it&#039;s a great thing to be aware of once it&#039;s time :)

2)  The years you&#039;re willing to live in the house.  This was by far the #1 stupidest thing I chose to ignore.  Over price of house, mortgage, amount of space, etc etc.  I knew it was smart to stay put for 5-7-10+ years, but I just threw it out the window and said &quot;Oh I&#039;ll be fine&quot; anyways. And here we are 3 years later and I&#039;m going cRaZy here!  Nothing to do w/ the house we purchased, but everything to do with the desire to move and live somewhere else.

So big thanks guys!  Lots of great points and things to think about for our young house itching friend.  I know he&#039;s reading this cuz he passed it along to all his buddies (who knew a finance site could be exciting? haha..), and I can tell you he sincerely appreciates your time.  You guys rock.  And hopefully this helps others out there considering the big purchase too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post and great comments.

I have a few out-of-the-box clarifying questions for you:

1. Are you averse to taking in roommates? Buying a 3BR 2BA house and splitting costs among 3 responsible adults can pay off big. Just always make sure you can handle the mortgage if your renters decide to ditch.

2. Are you handy? I bought a Fannie Mae owned foreclosure that needed some work. With some skill and our local Habitat for Humanity ReStore, I made the repairs and have another fantastic property.

I believe home ownership provides lots of benefits. Some financial perks and also some intangibles. It should not be thought of as the basis of your financial future though, at the end of the day I love to quote Carlin:

&quot;That&#039;s what your house is, a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get...more stuff! &quot;

Finally, Ignore what banks and lenders say you can afford. Go with your gut. You are almost always better off with a smallish, low cost 3BR/2BA single family home in a nice neighborhood. There are plenty out there. I recently bought a house for $107k that sold 4 years ago for $230. Great little house. Great Neighborhood. It is now renting for 25% above the mortgage. They are out there.

Happy Hunting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never comment but I feel like I must comment on this. My advice would be to wait until you have an emergency savings. My significant other and I bought a house when we were 21/22 after renting for 2 years. It was great. Until I lost my job. And then he lost his job. We were living in a city with a very high unemployment rate and neither of us could find a stable job. We didn&#039;t have any savings and we were 3 months behind on our mortgage. There was no way we could sale the house. Short sale or regular sale. So instead of foreclosing, we decided to file bankruptcy at the age of 23/24 so that we could include our credit cards and we moved to a different state. Everything went through and we are rebuilding our credit and starting a savings. We are only 24 and we have been through more than most 44 year olds that I know! So please, get your emergency savings established first and then buy a house. I am completely for buying a house but you need that back up. You may think your job is great and you will never lose it but no job is guaranteed forever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll throw in my two cents since I&#039;m closing on a house tomorrow and I have $28K in student loans as opposed to your 8k.  Yes you CAN buy a home if you wanted however you have to make the determination if you SHOULD.  They are very different questions and really none of us can answer the last part for you.  Your biggest thing to look at is your shovel to hole because the salary is on the smaller side.  I would encourage you to create a budget to make sure you can afford a house.  Call a mortgage broker or a lender and have them put a estimated &quot;initial fees worksheet&quot; for you.  They&#039;ll run a credit check on you and you just tell them the purchase price amount and how much in earnest you put down and how much closing costs are being paid by the seller.  That will aid you in your budget in terms of coming up with the principle &#038; interest costs, hazard insurance premiums, real estate taxes, and mortgage insurance.  People usually forget about the insurance.  

The biggest items is going to be money to close ie cash flow, and on going maintenance.  I am having to write a almost $9,000 check for closing costs yuck!  However I did land a 4.00% flat rate.  Also, there will be no more landlord and maintenance absolutely will happen.  

If you do decide to buy PLAN FOR DELAYS.  For example, we bid 150k on the house and the appraisal came back in at 140k.  The sellers ended up disputing it, and this put a delay on our closing and now we are stuck closing during the week instead of on a Friday.  Home prices continue to fall despite some bright spots in the country and appraisers these days are under a lot of pressure to get the values right because of potential litigation and because of pressure from the banks.  Foreclosures and short sales keep driving down prices in areas.

Best of luck.  Personally, I&#039;ll be freaking out in 16 hours]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great question, J, and a good discussion of pros and cons.  As you point out, there are so many individual variables that it&#039;s hard to give a blanket answer. 

Many of your readers have warned about additional costs, which a potential buyer needs to be aware of, but no one has mentioned the tax benefits available to homeowners.  All that interest you pay on your mortgage every month is tax-deductible, while your rent payments are not.  That by itself will help offset some of the additional costs.  And the first-time homebuyer programs will help with some of the upfront costs.

Another factor that no one mentioned is that for the middle class in America, owning a home is the best way to build a nest egg.  We&#039;ve grown up in a society that demands instant gratification and having the latest toys NOW, so the enforced investment in a home is unfortunately the only &quot;savings&quot; many people have.

Another tax advantage of owning your home is that when you sell it, the profit you make (and there will be some, if you do your homework and buy it right) is tax-exempt, up to $250,000 if single and $500,000 if married.  That&#039;s right, tax-free income, the VERY best kind!  And you can do it as often as every two years! See:  http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/industries/article/0,,id=98921,00.html  

I know a real estate investor who has chosen the neighborhood and school district he wants to live in, and every two years, he buys and moves into another house in the same neighborhood, taking his tax-free gain and using it to establish college funds for his children and invest in more real estate.  (Although in today&#039;s housing market, I wouldn&#039;t count on it appreciating enough in just 2 years for there to be a big profit on the sale. It will have to appreciate by an average of 10-12% in order for you to break even on the costs of sale.)

There&#039;s a discussion of rent-vs-buy at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.military-money-matters.com/rent-or-buy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Military-Money-Matters.com&lt;/a&gt; that&#039;s geared towards military families, but you might find it helpful.  There is also a mortgage comparison calculator at https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mortcalc/ that will let you compare the monthly payments and amount of equity you would build using several different kinds of fixed rate and adjustable mortgages.

I know this is too long, but one more important thing.  I don&#039;t advise people to take out 15-year mortgages, because that locks you into a higher payment amount, and if you have a financial reversal, you have to go through the hassle and expense of trying to refinance.  As low as today&#039;s interest rates are, my advice if you decide to buy is to take out a 30-year fixed mortgage at the lowest rate you can get.  Then plan to pay it off early by making an additional principal payment with each payment (in the beginning, that could be as little as another $50 or so), or if you can afford it, pay an extra $100 or more every month with instructions to the mortgage company to apply it to principal.  (Be sure your mortgage has a &quot;no-prepayment-penalty&quot; clause.)  

Then, if you have a financial setback and can&#039;t afford the extra payments you&#039;ve been making, you can drop back to the regular mortgage payment for a few months till you get back on your feet, without the pressure of trying to refinance because you suddenly can&#039;t afford those higher payments.  Once you recover, go back to paying the additional principal amounts.

And I personally wouldn&#039;t &quot;pretend pay&quot; -- you&#039;ll lose that many months of equity and tax-deductible interest.  But figure your finances carefully to make sure you can afford the payments, taxes, insurance, repair fund, etc.

Good Luck!]]></description>

There is also a mortgage comparison calculator at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mortcalc/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mortcalc/</a> that will let you compare the monthly payments and amount of equity you would build using several different kinds of fixed rate and adjustable mortgages.</p>
<p>I know this is too long, but one more important thing.  I don&#8217;t advise people to take out 15-year mortgages, because that locks you into a higher payment amount, and if you have a financial reversal, you have to go through the hassle and expense of trying to refinance.  As low as today&#8217;s interest rates are, my advice if you decide to buy is to take out a 30-year fixed mortgage at the lowest rate you can get.  Then plan to pay it off early by making an additional principal payment with each payment (in the beginning, that could be as little as another $50 or so), or if you can afford it, pay an extra $100 or more every month with instructions to the mortgage company to apply it to principal.  (Be sure your mortgage has a &#8220;no-prepayment-penalty&#8221; clause.)  </p>
<p>Then, if you have a financial setback and can&#8217;t afford the extra payments you&#8217;ve been making, you can drop back to the regular mortgage payment for a few months till you get back on your feet, without the pressure of trying to refinance because you suddenly can&#8217;t afford those higher payments.  Once you recover, go back to paying the additional principal amounts.</p>
<p>And I personally wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;pretend pay&#8221; &#8212; you&#8217;ll lose that many months of equity and tax-deductible interest.  But figure your finances carefully to make sure you can afford the payments, taxes, insurance, repair fund, etc.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
