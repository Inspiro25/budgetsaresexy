					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for sharing this! Those little extra pennies keeping one from free shipping are highly irksome. 

I can see how playing with this tool could get addictive. I just did a few random searches, and the results are as amazing as you say.  But what to choose? Fun with Jurassic Dinosaurs stencils? 2 dozen #1 pencils? Build your Own Cupcake sticker set? Steelon Leaders? The Twilight Zone volume 4? The Precious Blood of Jesus? (Which, for $1.50, I have to assume is a book or some kind and not, you know, a relic.)

This would be no where near as much fun if there were pictures. The list of totally random items is delightful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hope you guys can end up using it!

@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right? Such an easy and HELPFUL idea!
@&lt;b&gt;Travis @DebtChronicles&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I actually thought it was gonna be pretty small myself, but it just came in the mail and it&#039;s actually big! I was shocked.
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s what I&#039;m saying... If you need something SUPER fast for whatever reason, either go out and buy it yourself in person or just pay for faster shipping in that one instance, ya know? I&#039;m not that impatient.
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME!!! I love that so much :) And totally gonna Tweet it and include it in my next link roundup too - thanks friend! And crazy it&#039;s in my &#039;hood of DC too, jeez.
@&lt;b&gt;Skint in the City&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... yeah right. Watch this post completely sell out all Swamp Lizards and it becomes the next &quot;big thing&quot; ;) Ya never know? Hope things are well for you across the pond, friend!
@&lt;b&gt;SMB&lt;/b&gt; - There you go! My wife actually has Prime too since she&#039;s a student, but I can never use it cuz I always want to use my Amazon credit and you can&#039;t xfer it out to anyone! Arghh... but at least it&#039;s all free credit ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, that&#039;s pretty cool! I hope they DO start that then for you, man... that would be great! They&#039;re out in the NYC/New Jersey area yeah? I swear I pass one of their huge warehouses when I drive to the city.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... there&#039;s nothing wrong with being a frugal SOB ;)
@&lt;b&gt;L Bee and the Money Tree&lt;/b&gt; - Love you too!
@&lt;b&gt;savvyfinanciallatina&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you like it! Try it out the next time and see what you come across :)
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhh there you go, that&#039;s a good idea... I guess we can do that with baby diapers and what not too since we always need more, but it&#039;s just not as fun now w/ this website I found, haha... Great idea though!
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s usually what I do too, but after a couple of weeks I lose patience and want to hurry up and complete the order :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds interesting, but I usually just hit &quot;save for later&quot; in the shopping cart.  Then when I want something else I get the free shipping.  I usually don&#039;t need that much extra crap that I can&#039;t wait until I need something else.  Besides, I do a survey program that gives me a $10 gift card to Amazon every month, so I usually have to wait until I accumulate those at the same time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The picture of that swamp lizard got my attention - I collect knives, most of them from Amazon, but occasionally from eBay.  As far as filler items, I may look at that site next time I&#039;m short of $25, but what I usually do is go to my wishlist or order history.  I re-order certain grocery items regularly, and don&#039;t mind having extra on hand if that&#039;s what I have to do for free shipping.  California sales tax immediately curbed my Amazon shopping, so it turned out to be another way to save money :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t buy a lot at Amazon, but then again, I  don&#039;t do a lot of online shopping either. Or offline shopping, other than food. I&#039;m a frugal SOB, I guess. But half the time when I am buying something on Amazon, I&#039;m in this predicament. I&#039;m usually about $5 short.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a pretty slick site.  Personally I get angry at amazon a lot, mostly because they have TWO warehouses within 30 minutes of my house and 99% of what I buy comes from them and still takes forever to get to me.  I wish they would do an inperson pick up (which I have heard they are considering) and I would pretty much stop shopping anywhere else.]]></description>
