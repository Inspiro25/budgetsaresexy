Out of all the answers, this one surprised me the most! 

I first found this site about 7 years ago when a friend asked me for a budgeting template and Google sent me here. I&#039;ve been reading and following ever since. 

Thank you for all the amazing content over the years. You&#039;ve done a wonderful job of engaging with your readers and always being kind to everyone. The impact you&#039;ve had on the community is immeasurable. 

I&#039;ll miss your posts but look forward to Joel&#039;s perspective.  Can&#039;t wait to check out your new project in July!]]></description>

Basically, yup!

It’s an ongoing process, but every year it seems I get more and obsessed with improving my work/life balance, with most of the focusing going towards the “life” part :) As evidence of me retiring from this blog, haha..

I don’t know if others think about it as much as I do, but I’m constantly thinking about *death* and what all this life means and what our purpose is here, etc etc, and anytime I go down that rabbit hole “work” is rarely a part of the picture. 

Now fortunately for many of us “work” really means “passion” so it’s not exactly a straight up job, but the more I contemplate death – and really NOT knowing when it’ll come! – the more I remind myself to live TODAY as best I can in case there isn’t a tomorrow. Something you can’t do too well if you’re finances aren’t in order and drowning in debt. So yet again more reason to work towards FIRE to be able to craft a more natural lifestyle for yourself! I’m only able to do this so fully because we put in the time and energy to get financially sound!]]></description>

Oh man, I&#039;ve just kept it all in my noggin and did my best to recall them when needed! But you&#039;re right it&#039;s not the most failproof system! Lol... Luckily wodpress has that little search section when you go to link to words in the article, but I don&#039;t know of any other real ways outside of just manually throwing them in a spreadsheet or something w/ notes... 

But really, it&#039;s probably fine even when you do forget things because a) you don&#039;t want to be linking to the same stuff ALL the time, and b) if you don&#039;t remember it probably wasn&#039;t anything too spectacular anyways? Plus most of this stuff just keeps being repeated in different ways only, so it allows you to recreate the thought or idea in fresher words to keep the party going... 

There&#039;s been multiple times I&#039;ve written the exact same post over the years without even knowing it :) And that&#039;s fine! People rarely remember it anyways, and every new day there are new people coming to your blog for the very first time. So don&#039;t let it keep you up at night too much. Just keep pumping out those articles!]]></description>

Thanks brother ;)

Nooo idea what a 1RM bench press is (I even Googled it and still don&#039;t know!), but currently I&#039;ve been really enjoying Boddingtons straight from the can... That little ball that floats around in it is a miracle worker! Haha... Love all the cream it creates up top as you crack it open!]]></description>

hey - it takes a couple of attempts to reach perfection! ;)

And nope - net worth basically remains the same no matter how you live: assets - liabilities.

You won&#039;t have a &quot;mortgage&quot; in the liabilities section of the breakdown, but of course your rent will still affect cash flow which ultimately changes the #&#039;s in the net worth, but you wouldn&#039;t put &quot;rent&quot; in that section or anything...]]></description>

HAH!

It&#039;s pretty hard maintaining a blog with everything else going on in life, so don&#039;t be too hard on yourself ;) And if you feel like you&#039;re making decent money then you probably are! Def. be proud of that! Maybe your expenses are just a bit out of whack or you&#039;re in that initial phase of getting things worked out? I bet you&#039;ll figure it out if you keep reading $$$ blogs and searching!

As for what I did before being a blogger - I was a project manager, graphic designer, customer service manager, realtor, airline agent, Old Navy associate and approximately 30 other titles before landing here ;) Ranging from $10/hr to $78,000 + bonuses.

Here&#039;s a breakdown of all the gigs whenever you&#039;re bored:
