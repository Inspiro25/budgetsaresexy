					<description><![CDATA[So here I am, a 26f virgin researching thisbecause it is intriguing. I am an attractive girl,college educated at a top U, short, athletic, E34, blue eyes, curly brown hair, while skin, and I am wonderingif I could do it. I feel like I have been a virgin long enough but I do not want to wait for a man who will probably be surprised by this. Maybe even uncomfortable. I imagine whoever I do it with the first time will just end like all other relationships and I will have given a piece of myself to no more than an ex bf. Instead I could do it with someone who really wants to do it for the first time and would be willing to give me something in return. I am also intrigued by the marriage option. I am beautiful and smart, I wonder if can auction my virgin hand in marriage… Maybe even on tv as a virgin bachelorette. Stranger things have happened. And it is not so bad. Promiscuous girls can leverage their lif style in many ways, and they are getting and having sex. Virgins shouldn’t get a bad rap for this. They are just being smart with something of value we have kept for a very long time at our own expense . to give it away at this point may just be silly. It is an investment on my part to be a virgin, and it should be an investment on his part to be a part of that. I won&#039;t find a virgin. And it doesn&#039;t make sense for me to wait for someone who has been having sex all the while just to show up and have me too before moving on again.]]></description>

Most research I&#039;ve found says that 85% of adults over 21 have had sex. 15% is not an insignificant number. As a guy I was a virgin by choice until I40 was 25.

Studies in high schools show the number of virgins remains stay at about 50%.]]></description>

I was a virgin until I was 19 (now 30).  It was a conscious decision since I did not want to be stuck in small town, TX for the rest of my life because of an accidental pregnancy.  So I waited until I found someone special and I knew I could afford to raise any surprises even if it happened.  And two of my friends now are still virgins at 26 and 30 (one gay male and one straight female) - they are waiting to meet someone special.  Virginity still exists, lol.]]></description>

Meant more along the lines of selling your *virginity* twice. And not scamming people into thinking they&#039;re buying it when they&#039;re not.]]></description>

So what if she does sell it again? I absolutely think prostitution should be legalized and taxed.  It has been around since the dawn of time and is literally never going away EVER.  Might as well as make it safe for everyone involved.]]></description>
