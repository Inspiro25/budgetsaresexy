					<description><![CDATA[There have been more than a few folks who say my voice is nice and I should be doing podcasts, etc. 
I wonder could I voice act using different tones? Like if I am laying on my stomach my voice sounds deeper and if I am talking to a woman, I can switch to the Dr. Love D.J. type of voice. 
At times I just do not know which tone to use so my default voice is a tad higher like I spoke when I was in my teens.
I think i will contact you Carrie and see what you think. I actually live in LA but move around the world a lot at my current occupation. 
Also, what are the requirements to join the actor&#039;s union?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, enjoyed the comments....

I&#039;ve always wanted to get into voice acting... Often mimicking character lines from movies, games, advertisements, radio jingles, etc....  
I&#039;m from South Africa and really feel like this is something I want to do.

Only problem is that every penny I earn goes to taking care of my kids, which makes it difficult to buy the recording equipment or pay for recording time in a studio.

When manage to make a demo. Where do I send it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Carrie,  thanks so much for this wonderful write-up, just reading some articles when yours popped up. I love voice acting so much that I want to make a career out of it, reading this made me realize I&#039;ve been going about it the wrong way. first of, I desperately need a voice coach, although, I&#039;m in Nigeria, I don&#039;t know how to go about it. I&#039;ll follow your advice on how to be better at it with tons of practice. thank you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/263a.png" alt="☺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Carrie! Thanks for the great article. I am a &quot;working&quot; voice over actor based in Oakland, Ca. I have an agent in SF and I audition all the time, but don&#039;t get as many jobs as I&#039;d like.  One of the issues I run into is that I never get any feedback from directors or agency regarding auditions so I never know where I can improve. I realize that they represent too many people to do this for everyone, but I can&#039;t tell you how many times I have been a &quot;top 3&quot; candidate only to miss out on the job. I&#039;d like to be able to make adjustments but never get any input as to where or why I may have missed. Is this something you think Alyson could help with? I want to learn how to nail my auditions more consistently. I feel like there is some tweak I could make that would have me working more. Thanks for your time :)]]></description>
