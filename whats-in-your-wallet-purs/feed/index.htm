					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome guys!  I can&#039;t believe so many of you took the time to actually type all of this out! Haha... are we nerds, or what? :) Feels kinda sneaky peering inside all of your wallets too, I love it ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I love that &quot;I am so worth it&quot; account!  Nice.
@&lt;b&gt;Andy&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... I&#039;ve heard you&#039;re pretty too.  (and smooth move w/ student card for discounts, I should go and put mine back in too!)
@&lt;b&gt;J. Otwell&lt;/b&gt; - Two cells?  Bleh... I&#039;d get so confused :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, better take it out before you get tempted to use it!
@&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I wish EVERYONE excepted Amex -- really sucks when you have to switch cards and ruin your game plan.
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Lunch bag counts - fun! :)
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - I wouldn&#039;t be able to fit all that in a money clip! Which is why I use that instead, it forces me to limit what I take ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Tim&lt;/b&gt; - I like how everyone keeps their college ids on them still, haha, y&#039;all are funny.
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  And good idea w/ passing the answers over in your own blog - maybe it&#039;ll keep on moving around the blogosphere! (Ooooooh love the picture of everything too, good job!)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, damn good idea though... I keep like $8 in ones and a butt ton of change in my car too, mainly for meters, but also for emergencies/random tolls.
@&lt;b&gt;Gina&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re a good person to know when they&#039;re hungry for candy! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, whatever works ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you know what I use for that?  A ring!  My sister got me this AWESOME bottle opener ring and I literally put it to use every single week.  Great for party conversations too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, congrats on losing all that weight though - that&#039;s great!  And even awesomer w/ that 10% off deal - it&#039;s a shame you live so far away from me ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ciawy&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s okay, you girls are allowed to get away w/ all that girlie stuff :)
@&lt;b&gt;lorakathleen&lt;/b&gt; - Stamps!  That&#039;s a good one... I always need those randomly, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Do you like it when you get carded all the time?  Some women do - makes &#039;em feel so nice and young ;)
@&lt;b&gt;SophieW&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  You DO have a lot of craziness in there today! Haha... I love it how you have $197 on you too, as if you&#039;re about to go out to girls weekend or something :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kari&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I haven&#039;t read the rest of the comments yet, but looks like you&#039;re in the top 3 for most items so far ;) Cute you have your SO&#039;s picture in there! I remember when people did that in high school, always wished it continued on...
@&lt;b&gt;WinrWinrChknDinr&lt;/b&gt; - Immunization Record?  That&#039;s a first! :)
@&lt;b&gt;kody&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, you may have the LEAST!
@&lt;b&gt;Kitchen Penguin&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME!  Another gold carrying starbucks lover :)  That is dope.  Also, funny as hell you have a frog dollar in there! haha... can&#039;t say I&#039;ve seen one of those yet in my day.
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin I&lt;/b&gt; - Move stubs?  Are you collecting them for anything, or just random cuz they stick in there?
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Booooooooooo no cash!
@&lt;b&gt;Tim G&lt;/b&gt; - Perkstreet!  Love those guys - everyone I know who uses them swear by &#039;em.  Guess you feel the same? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Laiane&lt;/b&gt; - We love wordiness here!  The more we can read and see from each other, the better :)  Thx for divulging all of your walletness secrets!  And I think you&#039;re the only one I know who uses a pre-paid cell phone ;)  I did&#039;t know they were still around!
@&lt;b&gt;Ramona&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Very cool... didn&#039;t expect Romanian credit cards to show up on today&#039;s list ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Diane&lt;/b&gt; - I still need to try Quickbooks out.  Everyone who uses it says it helps, but I just can&#039;t bring myself to use it yet... at least for the business side of things.  Don&#039;t think it&#039;s good for personal finances, is it?
@&lt;b&gt;WR&lt;/b&gt; - WHAT?  $600?? haha... you are asking for it, aren&#039;t you! Man, I&#039;d be scared as hell walking around w/ that much in my pockets... maybe you should have given THAT to Borders instead ;)  *tear*
@&lt;b&gt;diane&lt;/b&gt; - Yay! Lottery tickets!!! Good work :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, that is easy.  I like that!
@&lt;b&gt;PD&lt;/b&gt; - Good call w/ the flash drive, I really need to start bringing that around too - saves you soooo much time sometimes!
@&lt;b&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... apparently dog lovers carry around 16 cards ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Chet&lt;/b&gt; - That is SUCH a damn good idea w/ the iPhone - I need to start doing that.  Luckily most things are tied to my cell # which I can remember easily, but the rest I end up losing out cuz I hate carrying around discount cards :(  the iPhone apps would def. fix that problem faster.
@&lt;b&gt;Meredith&lt;/b&gt; - YAY to USAA!  BOooooooo to no cash!
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I remember doing that back in the day!  Writing numbers of all my friends (and girlfriends, woo!) on a post-it note in my wallet :)  In fact, I think I still have them somewhere... for good time&#039;s sake.
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice.  And a fire arms license?? Does that come in handy a lot?? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Skint in the City&lt;/b&gt; - A red button and a luggage key, huh? Haha... you sure are an interesting one!  And btw, did you ever tell me where you got that dope necklace from? I SOOOOO want one for me!  &quot;J. Money&quot; That would be hot :)
@&lt;b&gt;SG&lt;/b&gt; - You win the minimalism route!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way too much stuff!

1. Business cards for Skint in the City
2. Personal debit card
3. Joint account debit card for household stuff
4. Library card - excellent money saver, except when I need to pay overdue fines.
5. Boots (UK phamacy) loyalty card
6. Loyalty/points card for local petrol station
7. £31.52 cash - I use cash a lot. Easier I find than checking bank statements against receipts.
8. Fifteen Euros in notes from recent holiday.
9. A red button I&#039;ve been meaning to sew back onto a dress for about three months. I may never. 
10. A small key for a suitcase - why?? 
11. Many, many receipts, dating back around four months. Thanks JMoney - you&#039;ve prompted me to have a clearout!]]></description>

19 - starbucks &quot;pick of the week&quot; card x2
