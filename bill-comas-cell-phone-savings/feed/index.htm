					<description><![CDATA[The Challenge series is super motivational, thanks! Already canceled one audiobook subscription (I hate that these days is next to impossible to buy a single electronic thing, everything is subscription based) and next will cancel/switch dns service of one unused domain.

However, as a Finn I find where the savings come is in part quite different. For instance, I find it ridiculous how much Americans have to pay for a basic right such as the Internet ;) our plans here are €10-20 a month, with unlimited 4G data and calls. (Phones you buy separately so no scammy bundles.) Service level covers every part of the country except the wilderness. Also health and retirement plans are part of salary and universities are free. (The tax levels are the same as in New York.) That said, I will definitely want to be able to choose when to retire (not at gov-standard 67) and maybe start my own business again. 

I will definitely use this separate account idea for sold stuff - we&#039;ve sold a lot of unused stuff and just used that to lower our daily grocery bill but that way it seems to fritter away.

A pro tip for those who have less discipline (like us): we kept a couple accounts in another bank after switching banks some years ago. I put all my side earnings + joint extra savings there. We don&#039;t see them when we check our normal accounts and morgage -&#062; no temptations to use it and nice surprises whe we do check the accounts! (Also investments are in separate, cheaper investment bank.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been a RW customer for three years and there have only been three situations when it hasn&#039;t been great:
1. My son became a fire fighter after we switched to RW.  RW does not support the emergency call network for first responders i.e., a fire alarm.  My son ended up switching carriers.
2. International travel.  I bought a burner phone and 10 day service while traveling in France this spring.  The $40 price for this was small considering the savings we&#039;ve had over the past three years for domestic RW service.
3.  I don&#039;t have a gmail account and since my Moto was produced under Google&#039;s ownership, I am not able to back up my contacts.  I have lost all of my contacts twice and RW has no answer.

Overall it is a great service.]]></description>

Haha yup!

Thinking about all this stuff also gets you to make up random phrases too, like Bill Coma :)]]></description>

Yep - it&#039;s not fun! There are a ton of apps that try to help with this (some more successfully than others), but it&#039;s always a pain regardless and something always falls through.

Again why it&#039;s good to ask yourself though what&#039;s more important - cash money or old texts/contacts? In a way it&#039;s nice to start fresh too and just add back the ones that matter the most :)]]></description>
