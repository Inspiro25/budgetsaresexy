Hey Nona, what an interesting situation! I guess if there&#039;s a chance they can hire someone else when you resign, you could be opening up the position to another lucky person out there. I mean, if you don&#039;t need it, then why not resign? But it&#039;s very cool that you have the position to go back to if you ever want to work agian.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never returned back to work for my current employer after the birth of my 3rd child...I m still officially employed by them and I could even get A job back, after 6,5 years of not working a single day. (Dont ask, I work in Europe). 
At the time I had a pretty important key function in the company, but I had to choose for my family (there were some health related problems). 
So I left my employer without a follow up from one day to another.
I still feel bad for them sometimes.
I might finally resign this year because we have been FI as a family of 5 for a while now
(I havent gotten a penny from my employer in the past six years and I wont get any money when I resign, and I m totally ok with that)]]></description>

From my understanding a lot of executives have contracts in place with set terms and lengths. So if you leave mid-term (or get asked to leave), sometimes there are exit packages. I think most regular employees are employed &#039;at will&#039;. So there&#039;s no negotiated exit payment when they get hired, or when they leave.

That being said, when the pandemic hit, a number of my friends here in LA got made redundant and were given pretty decent settlements they weren&#039;t expecting. It was nice to see companies doing what they could to offer longer term employees compensation for the troubles of termination.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, very well played and glad that it all worked out! 

I am always on the lookout and love reading stories about people leaving their jobs and what happens to their compensation afterwards. It&#039;s not fair that executives get so much money paid out when they leave the company if the lower rung employees don&#039;t get anything. 

Great story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had this dilemma a few years ago.  I advised my new employer regarding the bonus and pushed back my start date.  After the bonus I then gave 3 weeks notice.  All were satisfied, including me.  Since the bonus was based on the prior years performance I did not feel any guilt.  And being upfront with all parties and providing ample notice allowed me to maintain my relationship with my prior employer and go into the new employer fully focused.]]></description>
