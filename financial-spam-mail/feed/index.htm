					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Awww thanks!  It was because of you all that I won them! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Natalie @ Mango&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  That&#039;s an interesting theory actually... I happen to LOVE post offices. I&#039;m always mailing out post cards from all my travels, or sending gifts to people via mail - I would be miserable w/out them :(  Yeah you can do a lot of great stuff online, but if we cut out the more  human-to-human element with mail, I have a feeling it wouldn&#039;t be good for everybody...  Hopefully they can just cut out Saturday delivery or something so they can keep operating for us!  Love &#039;em!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An LED light pen, huh? You know, at Mango Money we&#039;re brainstorming ideas for a great blog giveaway... Just kidding. Who wants an LED pen? Or any of the junk mail for that matter? I heard something recently that the reason the post office is doing so poorly is because all they&#039;re really delivering these days is junk mail, and sometimes bills--  but most people just pay their bills online these days. Anyone reading this: what (if anything) do you still use the postal service for? I&#039;d be really interested to know, thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;The Financial Blogger&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... do you know that every time I read one of your comments now, I hear your accent come through?  It&#039;s awesome!  Love that I know what you look and sound like now :)
@&lt;b&gt;Elle@Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, it gets sold over and over again all over the place here.  I must have signed up to something back in the day and now it haunts all of us ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Babs&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Sadly that&#039;s not the first time that&#039;s happened. Every now and then you hear stories of babies getting credit cards, and dogs too.  Then the parents go on a binge and get caught.  We live in a silly place!
@&lt;b&gt;Eric J. Nisall&lt;/b&gt; - That was a hard sentence to follow, haha... 
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, sometimes I wonder if they could be on to something though?  Cuz I got that call from Chase once and thought it was spam, and 2 months later we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/we-refinanced-our-mortgage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;refinanced loan&lt;/a&gt; saving me $400 a month! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenni (Traveler for Good)&lt;/b&gt; - Oh now THAT&#039;s hot!!  I love sharpies!!!! But I&#039;m actually glad they don&#039;t offer anything we like - cuz then we&#039;d get tempted to purchase their products! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... I wouldn&#039;t mind if companies send me stuff w/ Budgets Are Sexy on it, that would be hot :)  But yeah - you should def. blog about Cablevision, that&#039;s jacked up man. Wonder how many people will come out saying the same thing happened to them?! Will be interesting... also if one of their reps responded ;)  If they&#039;re good, they will.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t even know that those LED pens were still being made! Cablevision sold my information, so now I&#039;m getting a bunch of financial SPAM for my business. The only company that has both my business name and home address is Cablevision (for internet access), so I know it was them. I&#039;ll be writing a post about it later this week. 

Oh, I actually had a company send me an ink pen with my business name and home address on it. They want me to order 1,000 of them - but the sample broke in the mail! lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why can&#039;t they send things I&#039;d like... maybe a logoed jump drives or mini first aid kit?  I was offered a mini sharpie on a key chain yesterday.   I don&#039;t know about you, but my sharpie needs are minimal and don&#039;t usually go on the road with me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I get coupons for places I&#039;ll never actually go to. Like the coupons that come every month for orthodontia!

I love the offers from car insurance companies. Especially the ones that say something like, &quot;you could save $1500 on your car insurance.&quot; Umm, that&#039;s almost 2 years worth of premiums for me.]]></description>
