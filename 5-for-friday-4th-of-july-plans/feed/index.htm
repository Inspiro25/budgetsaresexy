					<description><![CDATA[Yep, no job for me. :-( It&#039;s a long story but I&#039;m kinda unemployable (not in a crazy way or nuthin&#039;). Everybody I know thinks it&#039;s weird that I&#039;m 29 and don&#039;t work. So I am hoping to one day make some dough from all this &quot;free time&quot; I have. I feel bad sometimes when I know my honey is working his a$$ off and I don&#039;t have money coming in. He&#039;s a great guy and doesn&#039;t complain about it---still think I need to contribute more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;KSUE&lt;/b&gt; - I want to play!!!! Only tried once w/ a bunch of personal finance bloggers, but that was over a year ago! And I came *this close* to winning! ;)  Forgot about that game...
@&lt;b&gt;Amy Lou&lt;/b&gt; - Some people here like to beleive it&#039;s &quot;Free Fishing Day&quot; every day ;)  I live near a lake and I doubt most of those fisherman have passes. I should whip out my pole again though, it&#039;s been a while.  And it&#039;s fun!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - You don&#039;t have a job?  I don&#039;t think I knew that... I know you&#039;re hustlin&#039; to make your blog a source of income ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - COOOOOL!!!!  That week vacay sounds just fantastic - good for you.  You&#039;re lucky I don&#039;t live near by or else I&#039;d be crashing it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - What??? You lost your job? I&#039;m sorry to hear that man :(  Wow.  Was it recent?  I feel like I would have known if not... I&#039;m sending you positive thoughts and luck okay?  Maybe you can find something that relates to your passion for food &amp; cooking? Or publishing? :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - That does sound fun!  I love me some live blues music - caught some myself yesterday on our boat ride. Mixed in w/ a little Johnny Cash action ;)
@&lt;b&gt;bleu&lt;/b&gt; - That Running Club sounds fun, didn&#039;t know they had those :)  I&#039;d join a walking club if I could get my hands on one of those.... though me thinks they&#039;d be full of people 3 times my age, haha... not that theres&#039; anything wrong with that.
@&lt;b&gt;John&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh gotcha gotcha... sounds fast :)
@&lt;b&gt;Steve&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I&#039;m sorry to hear that.  That can&#039;t be good :(  I hope all is fine when you return back - that&#039;s scary!  My Aunt and I was just talking about Albuquerque, and how she wishes she could move back (we weren&#039;t aware of the fire stuff). Unfortunately though she can&#039;t be at that altitude due to medical problems :( She loved the 20+ years she DID live there though!  And me too when I came to visit :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.What are you plans for the weekend?  Not really sure.  Trying to get back into our house because we had to evacuate from the big fire near Los Alamos New Mexico.

2.How much do you think it’ll cost?  Right now it is costing about $180 per day for the hotel and food.  The folks at the Hilton in Albuquerque were really nice because they let our dog stay with us.  Cannot say that about some of the hotel guests who complained about the dog barking when we went out for a few hours.

3.Do you have to go to work on Monday?  No, the 4th is a holiday for us.  Don&#039;t really know when I&#039;ll return to work given the fire.

4.If not, do you get paid for it,?  Yes

5.What part are you looking forward to the most? SSpending time with my family and those who mean alot to me...

6.*BONUS* What does “freedom” mean to you?  Freedom means having the opportunity to be whatever I want to be, do whatever I want to do, and live whereever and however I want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. What are you plans for the weekend? I had movie plans tonight but canceled because I am not feeling well.  Saturday I am meeting my running club (just joined them), then going to the gym, then going to work. Oh then a &quot;date&quot;, then playing things by ear for Sun and Mon
2. How much do you think it’ll cost? So far everything is free :)
3. Do you have to go to work on Monday? Nope
4.If not, do you get paid for it,?  Nope, I only get paid when I work
5. What part are you looking forward to the most? The running club, looking for some tips.
6.*BONUS* What does “freedom” mean to you? Having the opportunity to be provided and education and learn whatever it is you what to learn as well as the ability to do whatever job you would like to do.

Enjoy your holiday weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) Going out to dinner and see Transformers 3 with the wife on Saturday. Rest of weekend will be pretty much devoted to job searching.
2) About $30-$40 for dinner, $16 for two 3D matinees, and $12 for popcorn and soda. I guess the internet costs us about $.50 per day, so a dollar or so for job searching.
3) Unfortunately no. I just got laid off.
4) Well the movie is certainly going to be more interesting than job searching.
BONUS: To me, freedom means being able to make mistakes and learn from them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1)  I have to work tomorrow (sat 7/2) since I work at a bank, but after we close, we will be packing up the convertible and taking the 2 hour drive to Bemus Point, NY, where my fiance&#039;s family has a home right on Lake Chautauqua.  Or, Lake Lachalkwa as my 5 year old calls it!
2)  Just the gas to get up there and back, and some groceries.  There will be other families and we will all pitch in for cookout food for dinner, lunch meat and eggs/bacon.  Pretty inexpensive since we don&#039;t pay anything to stay at the family home!
3)  I don&#039;t work Monday, and in fact, I took ALL of next week off work (I get 5 weeks paid vacation every year!)  But, we will only be at the Lake thru Monday.
4)Yes, I get paid.  Gotta love banker&#039;s holidays!
5)  I am looking forward to how SLOW life is at the Lake.  We just chill, leisurely drink our coffee in the morning, sit on the deck looking at the water, go for boat rides, water ski, go tubing.  I am bringing myself a bottle of Jeremiah Weed since it is my new favorite summer cocktail, so I will be mixing up John Daly&#039;s all weekend and enjoying the weather, water, and company!  I also love to hang out with my fiance, his awesome family, and my son, Braeden.  I just hope he can stay awake for fireworks this year!  I got him on the jetskis last year (at 4 years old) and it was awesome!
6)  Freedom is being able to live and let live.  I am pretty liberal and don&#039;t judge people by their lifestyle, and to me, that is freedom.  As long as you aren&#039;t hurting anyone or putting anyone in danger, you should be able to live in a way that makes you happy.
Selling my old house would be financial freedom to me!  I need to get back to no credit card debt and only one mortgage!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Weekend Plans- I&#039;m still not sure about this, my honey works and my puppy is gonna freak out when she hears lots of fireworks. Maybe a BBQ, not sure. It&#039;s hard to do much for the holidays when you live in a tiny @ss apartment.

2. Cost?- We don&#039;t spend money on fireworks, because it makes more sense for us to just enjoy what everbody else bought. So, just a box of sparklers for the kiddo and some stuff for BBQ.

3. Work on Monday- Not really, I don&#039;t have a job---but Honey works :-(

4. Paid on Monday- he gets time overtime for being there

5. Looking forward- Not a clue but I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll have fun w/ whatever we end up doing.

Bonus: Freedom- Having the ability to pretty much do whatever I want in life.]]></description>
