					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Mike- Saving Money Today&lt;/b&gt; - haha, good luck w/ that sir.  know one way to avoid that? not having a garage ;)  (although, basements are probably worse -- I swear everything migrates there after every cleaning session)
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s the best right?  Jammin&#039; out to Jay-Z or some Bon Jovi!  I actually installed my old stereo into my new bookshelves in the bedroom so now it&#039;s always on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re so right...it&#039;s amazing how much crap we accumulate.  In the fall we cleaned out the basement and got rid of a TON of stuff...next up is the garage, if I can find it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny story - I went yesterday to donate all 7 bags of clothes/items to Salvation Army, and came back with a table :)  I didn&#039;t mean to (believe me) but it was so damn cool!  And only $20.  Just goes to show that the only true way NOT to buy stuff is to not go into stores or anywhere online, haha... 300+ items and only 1 back ain&#039;t too bad though.

@&lt;b&gt;twentysomethingmoney&lt;/b&gt; - So true!  I barely think of/remember stuff I&#039;ve given away.  And when I do, it&#039;s not like it&#039;s every super important.
@&lt;b&gt;Sunshine&lt;/b&gt; - Hmmmm...  you already try googling it?
@&lt;b&gt;Mummyscrooge&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s the key - once stuff is out, don&#039;t fill it back up!
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - Not if we keep doing it every couple of months ;)  I like the gradual way better - although it&#039;s not as exciting as seeing the 1-time major difference.
@&lt;b&gt;~Carla~&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... bow chicka wha wha!
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!  Esp during a staycation, that takes skill ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Good call!  I have these Armani jeans that have been re-patched and stiched a few times - and only costs $10 or $15 a visit (an older lady that lives down the street from us).  Unfortunately I&#039;m starting to outgrow these jeans, but still a VERY valuable person to know for sure.  Good addition.
@&lt;b&gt;Steph&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that is a problem that comes up... even w/ me.  It can take months for me to finally list something so I&#039;ll usually end up taking it out to donate if there&#039;s nothing expensive in there.  Or if I&#039;m just lazy/too busy.  As long as it&#039;s out of the house though, it&#039;s a-okay :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually love to clean up and out all the stuff I no longer find useful.  I love the minimalist idea too.  I have a dream that one day I will be able to buy one of those old shotgun style houses in the New Orleans French Quarter and they are pretty small.

The biggest problem I have is that I tend to make my three piles/bags/boxes and the &quot;sell&quot; pile seems to sit forever. I never seem to find the time to photograph and list each item nor do I have the desire to take it to the consignment shop and wait for them to pick through my stuff and tell me what they will take (I always feel insulted when they refuse something &quot;like my crap&#039;s not good enough for you??&quot;).

I suppose if I had some high dollar stuff it may get me more motivated, but as of right now, I just can&#039;t seem to do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a girl with way too many clothes, I tend to do the same thing, but tweaked a little. Maybe other women can relate:
A pile to donate
A pile to throw away
A pile to sell on eBay
A pile that needs some lovin&#039; from a tailor or a cobbler
I can&#039;t express how important it is to have a good tailor and a good cobbler. My $398 Frye boots that have gone through hell and back looked brand new after I got it back from my favorite cobbler. I could have kissed him, I was so thrilled! Many more years of wear out of an expensive pair of boots for only $30?! Yes, please. Tailors can also do miracles-if the reason why I don&#039;t wear a favorite jacket is because a hole has sprouted in the pockets, my tailor can redo the lining of my coat for much cheaper than it would cost to go buy a new one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually had to do this against my will recently!  I decided to redesign my room and since the theme was &quot;minimalist&quot; I ended up with a lot less &quot;spaces&quot; to hide my stuff.  So I had to face the hard facts about what I was going to give away/chuck.  In the end, my room is a lot more spacious and less junky, but I&#039;m sure in a year or so, I&quot;ll have to do the same thing again.]]></description>
