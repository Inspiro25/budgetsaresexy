					<description><![CDATA[J I have not carried cash on me for YEARS. I think there might be a $1 bill behind the copy of my insurance....I found that on the ground one day.

What &#039;safety&#039; reasons are you talking about that I would need cash for? Please explain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hmm, good idea but I never carry around cash. and when I do have cash, I have it because I have to use and usually end up with only change at the end of the day. but I have been saving my coins for almost a year. last year, I bought myself those coin reader jars at Target and whenever I get change, I make sure to save it. currently it&#039;s at $76.29 which is great because imagine where all those coin would have been if I haven&#039;t saved them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an excellent idea.  Very doable, the amount will grow over time and you&#039;ll also end up eating less bad stuff from the vending machine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved bartending.  It was a great way to earn money while not spending money and still going out to fun places (just on the other side of the bar) - I posted about the money aspects of it a couple of months ago(http://www.stepawayfromthemall.com/2010/09/actually-saving-money-by-going-where.html).

It was a great place to meet people.  Some of my closest friends come from the bar world (I bartended on the Sunset Strip for almost a year and Boston for around 5 years).  My key was not to fall prey to the bar industry lifestyle.  I treated it like any other job while in college and grad school.  Once I graduated I quit.  In my opinion there is no better bang for your buck while in school for a part time job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; -  Yeah, let me know how that works out.  I still need to try and go 100% cash for a month to see what happens :)
@&lt;b&gt;SheBudget&lt;/b&gt; - YES! Oh how I miss commisaries... product of a military family myself and LOVED going there :)  And also remember tipping the helpers for my mom...
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, never thought about that.
@&lt;b&gt;Lulu&lt;/b&gt; - You gotta have SOME cash on you at all times though my friend - right?  For safety reasons! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Karmella&lt;/b&gt; - Wow.  Never us an ATM?  I&#039;m impressed.  I got every paycheck and take out $100 for spending money - then everything else is paid w/ a credit card.... I always have to have cash with me.
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyCone&lt;/b&gt; - Go for it!
@&lt;b&gt;Doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - Yessirrr...Happy Monday indeed!  Hope it was awesome yo.
@&lt;b&gt;Desi Guy&lt;/b&gt; - Let me know how it works :)  Hear ya on the quarters too - coveted those like mad when we lived in apartments w/out washers &amp; dryers!
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - I like it! I&#039;ve been keeping a few ones one me for my homeless friends I always see. It&#039;s the WORST when you only have big bills cuz you can&#039;t ask for change, but you can&#039;t always give out a $10 or $20!  It also helps you if you know where you $1s are so you&#039;re not sorting through all your cash in the middle of the street.  (how did you like bartending btw?  always wanted to try that)
@&lt;b&gt;Jason@LiveRealNow&lt;/b&gt; - Money clips unite!!!  Better believe I rock one too, sir :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, a trip to Savings-ville!(wha wha....  that was bad)
@&lt;b&gt;ide&lt;/b&gt; - Damn, that is awesome!  I didn&#039;t last 2 months! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Amy&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  You and the Brits :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - But better the reward ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Sounds cool! I like hearing about creative banks.   Need a new one myself come to think of it...
@&lt;b&gt;Christy&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh gift shopping, GREAT idea.  As long as you start early in the year, of course ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - No you cannot!
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Better not tell him then ;)]]></description>
