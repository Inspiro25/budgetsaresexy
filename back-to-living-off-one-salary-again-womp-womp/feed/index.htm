I agree with you about commuting/daycare.  However, I know your point about tax brackets is made in the US quite frequently and it is fundamentally misguided.  I&#039;m not sure where you live, so this may be irrelevant to your situation.  In the US, moving to a higher tax bracket does not impact the taxation of funds below that bracket level.  Let&#039;s take an example based on joint filers in the US where rates are 10% for up to $17,400 and 15% for $17,400-70,700.  The argument that making 25,000 will push you to a higher bracket is technically correct, but it is important to remember that the first 17,400 is still only taxed at the 10%.  So you pay 1,740 on the first 17,400 and 1,140 on the 7,600 (25,000-17,400).  However, at the end of the day, you still added 6,460 of income thanks to being &quot;pushed&quot; into a higher bracket.  Again, can&#039;t speak for your taxation system, but in the US, this point is flawed.]]></description>
