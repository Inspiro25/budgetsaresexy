Amanda and other readers who have an interest in considering a condo hotel, I&#039;d welcome hearing from you.  In 2002, my firm became the first in the US to specialize in the sale of condo hotels.  Today this is still our specialty brokerage niche, and you&#039;d be surprised to see how far these properties have come.  Drop me a line anytime if you see this, and if you wish to discuss opportunities.  Joel Greene, Pres. Condo Hotel Center, 954-450-1929.  www.condohotelcenter.com.]]></description>

Hey John,

I&#039;m looking at a condo at Minerals in Vernon and my question is this: If you are renting the unit year round for a few days at a time, how come your income is only $300/mth? Also, who is the rental company, Comet Management? What is there rental arrangement?

Thanks for any info.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Tom Hunt, I own one at a place called Minerals Hotel in Vernon, NJ it&#039;s near a ski/ golf resort.  My place rents year round a couple days at a time. I go there every once and a while during the winter months to hit the mountain.  I bought mine cash for $39k all closing costs included and brand new renovated room and I make about $300 a month. 13 years and it will be paid off I already have had it for 3 years.  I only live an hour and a half drive though so it&#039;s easy for us to go there whenever we want.  Check it out though as another option..  I am also curious to where the location is of this condotel he was speaking of. I am looking for one in an area like Florida where it stays warm year round!

					<description><![CDATA[my Friend own a condotel in CABO. He would fly his plane down to Baja, enjoy his personal stuff which is locked off from rental. And made a small profit to offset the costs. I found your post while searching to BUY a condotel myself. Not easy to find. Guess, I will contact a real estate professional to help. I notice you did NOT mention where the property is located. Just wondering !]]></description>

Hi Kevin, that is a great point. I know this particular hotel has been around awhile and wasn&#039;t always condos owned individually. I know that other buildings have transferred ownership type. I would assume that it would just go back to a regular condo building and the owners can rent out the rooms on their own, sell or live in them.]]></description>
