					<description><![CDATA[I loved this article! Every family is different and eat different styles of food. I’ve never calculated our price per meal, but we shop exclusively at Sams club. Our budget is $600/month for a family of 4 and that includes diapers. And we eat meat! So it can be done!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why you need garbage bags? We use the free plastic bags from the store. Wtf you need dryer sheets.... or a dryer. We dry stuff outside and take it in if it&#039;s too cold. Smells better anyway.  I could go on... Wtf you need electricity? I mean, ALL the time?]]></description>

Exactly my thoughts. Sit the kid down and give me a more balanced meal that includes rice/potatoes and one vegetable. Snacking all day is never a healthy habit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/dollar-meal-budgeting/#comment-196464&quot;&gt;Dee&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s 10 pm in Missouri, and all I&#039;ve eaten today is a small bowl of steel cut oats with butter and nutmeg, a vegetable stir fry made with extra virgin coconut oil, onions, garlic, kale, black beans, carrots, broccoli, quinoa, and hot peppers, with a spinach/blueberry salad on the side that was drizzled with a homemade dressing of apple cider vinegar and EVOO, plus lemon water to drink throughout the day. My grocery budget is between $60 and $80 a month for one very active older person. I save a lot of money by preparing and cooking everything from scratch, having a year-round garden, and practicing intermittent fasting on a high-fat, low-carb, normalized protein diet. Tomorrow I look forward to something similar, but with variations on the veggies and the fruit.]]></description>
