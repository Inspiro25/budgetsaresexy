					<description><![CDATA[1) I&#039;m in CA and have Kaiser Permanente. 
2) LOVE them because 1) they saved my life when other doctors at several specialty (i.e., fancy, more expensive) clinics missed diagnosing--or even simply TESTING me--for seven years even though I tried to get help. 2) it&#039;s all in one place, so it is sooooooooo much easier. And your primary care doc manages your care. Oh, and free (and awesome) online services so I don&#039;t even have to go in for minor stuff. Just email my doc and move on. Was so nervous cuz my bro had Kaiser in the &#039;80s and it was NOT good. But they&#039;ve come a long way baby. The only caveat is that you may have to change your doc once or twice til you get one you really like. But that&#039;s no biggie, in my opinion, cuz you often have to do that in the real world too--but when you do it at Kaiser, the new doc has your whole medical history there on the computer. Um, is it clear I&#039;m happy with them? lol.
3) I get my insur thru my employer. Sorry.
4) Here&#039;s the thing about cost... it completely depends on what plan you sign up for. And with what insurer. Could be anywhere from $250 (for a really high-deduc) to $500 for a fully covered plan. So... you basically have to pick the response you like the most b&#039;c no one will be &quot;right.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[oh yeah -- and I see a bunch of people in the comments are recommending ehealthinsurance.com ... if you do go through them, click on a PF blogger&#039;s affiliate link to share the love! I&#039;ll post one on my site in the coming weeks when I&#039;m not so lazy (I&#039;m about to go on vacation for 2 weeks, baby!), and PT Money already has a link set up on his site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband is in the military, so we get free health care (TriCare).  I love it, but it does suck sometimes.  You have to make your appointments to see your Primary Care Physician at least a week in advance.  Of course, the one time I had pink eye and needed to see someone immediately they fit me in that day.  But Active Duty military always takes priority so even if you schedule an appointment at 8:30am, if they are behind in appointments, they always take the active duty service members first.  However, getting free health care and prescriptions sure beats the alternative of co-pays and expensive medicine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Basil Siddiqui&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;m very impressed with them so far!
@&lt;b&gt;wldflr&lt;/b&gt; - Oh nice!  Glad to see the LLC route working for another person :)  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s gonna be good for us yet, but we&#039;ll see what happens once my application gets approved or not (scary!!).  I&#039;ll count your vote in too, you may or may not be the closest so far ;)]]></description>
