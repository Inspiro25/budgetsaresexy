					<description><![CDATA[I had two thoughts when i read this.

1. I HATE when people talk about how other people are lucky because they did something the speaker hasn&#039;t. Someone once informed me how lucky i was to graduate college. Right, because it was all luck, and had nothing to do with me working my butt of for 6 years to put myself through school while working multiple jobs. I found that beyond infuriating.

2. This quote by Lao Tzu - 
   If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.]]></description>

yeah :( or they get offended and think you&#039;re being rude... I have to bite my tongue a lot and just leave things with, &quot;if you ever want to chat about money stuff, let me know anytime. I love helping out.&quot; and then leave it in their hands. that way they can let it simmer and hopefully come back later, on their terms, to ask for advice! but no one really does :(]]></description>

Yes.This.  Most people I know don&#039;t Google. They have no idea how to review a product before they buy it. They have no idea that sites like this exist. When I do mention and send them links they aren&#039;t interested.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes! I have people in my family who make over 100k who say they can&#039;t afford to travel, or do anything, when that is simply not true. I make 1/5 that currently and my priorities are getting out of debt and traveling. It&#039;s amazing what people normalize in their head and the excuses people give as to why they can&#039;t afford things. It&#039;s so frustrating especially when I know I make so much less, but have a much richer life. I try to get through to family and friends, but some people don&#039;t want to change their lifestyle and clearly have different priorities.]]></description>
