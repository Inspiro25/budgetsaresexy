Ahhh this is a brilliant idea!!! I absolutely love it! Not only because it&#039;s so *focused* on one area, but that it&#039;s targeted towards kids!! 

Going now to check out the project.... Here it is if anyone else wants to learn more! --&gt; https://www.biggerthanavillage.org/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I fell into this same idea last year...What started out as a local community &quot;Adopt-a-Family&quot; for Christmas turned into the realization that the need doesn’t end with the holidays.

As I discovered by talking to their clinician, our state support system has very little exit strategy aside from subsidized housing when foster “kids” over eighteen (and they are still kids at this point) age out of support.

When these young adults arrive in group housing they are given rudimentary supplies...one set of sheets and towels, one pillow...you get the idea.  

After they are approved for independent living, they leave with little more than that. No pots, pans, dishes, cutlery, bathroom supplies - no household basics and oftentimes only outgrown clothing that is too many years old.

These young people have survived the foster care program only to exit the system having to fend for themselves. They are virtually invisible to society. 

When you consider the number of items trashed daily all around us I thought...Imagine what we could accomplish with the concept of pairing donated home goods with these young people ready for their first-ever homes.

 *My* brand new &quot;baby&quot; :)]]></description>

Hi friend!! Of course I remember you!! And a hearty YES to geneology!! It&#039;s so fun finding stuff from your past and linking it all together! We took over some of it from an old family member here, but haven&#039;t sat down enough to really *add* anything new to it.. But with technology these days I bet it&#039;s sooooo much easier to do and eventually want to make it more of a priority :)

Please do stay in touch!! I always enjoy hearing what you&#039;re up to!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, do you remember the lady who said she was your oldest fan?  Well, I&#039;m still kicking and reading your &#039;stuff&#039;.  I&#039;ll be 94 in July.  I&#039;m pretty much a shut-in now that I don&#039;t drive anymore.  But I do get online and offer to work on genealogy for folks, especially if there is a &#039;Jackson&#039; in their line..  Genealogy is a jig-saw puzzle with no side pieces and I love a puzzle.    I&#039;m grateful for having genealogy to keep my mind active.]]></description>

That is so freaking cool!!

And what a great idea too! I don&#039;t think I would have ever thought of doing that?! You must have saved everyone so much time - love it.  (And making a note of this in case I&#039;m ever in a similar situation - thanks! :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is an experience I had in spontaneous volunteering that was pretty fun.  The week of Christmas Cincinnati was expecting a big snow storm and plummeting temperatures.  I was off on Thursday the 23rd and thought I would get to the grocery early to beat the crowds.  Everybody else had the same bright idea.   Staffing was short and the lines to the checkout literally snaked to the back of the building.  I asked the person in front of me to advance my cart for me. I then went to the front of the line and asked the cashier if I could help bagging.  She just shrugged and I asked the  first customer if she minded?  She let me and then I just kept going.  After the first couple of carts, I don&#039;t think anybody noticed I wasn&#039;t a paid employee.   When my cart came up the person ahead of my me helped to bag my groceries.   It was all pretty heartwarming.]]></description>
