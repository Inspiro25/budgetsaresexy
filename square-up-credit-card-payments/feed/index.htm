Most sates legally allow you to charge a credit card surcharge. So on your dashboard go to the tax section and type what percentage you would like to make the surcharge, likely 2.75% as that is what Square charges you, and voila - the charge is added and you are, well, square. note: there is space to add multiple surcharges such as credit and state sales tax, there is even an option for a tip. Check out the website, all the information is there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the people who don&#039;t &quot;trust&quot; the device or the people who use it ... let me get this straight - without any understanding of the way the data is encrypted and transmitted, you&#039;re going to say you don&#039;t trust it. But you&#039;ll hand your credit card or debit card to someone at a restaurant, right? And let them walk away with it to charge you? So what&#039;s to keep them from writing down your card number and all the info on it and using the card? If you&#039;re that paranoid, then why use your card at all?

And if you don&#039;t trust the person you&#039;re paying, then why are you doing business with them? 

I&#039;m really baffled by these statements. 

For the record, NO data is stored on my phone or in my account. Everything is encrypted and the only thing that shows up on the receipt is the last 4 digits of the card.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This does seem pretty cool, but I guess I&#039;d be afraid to trust people with it...
If I were a local merchant, I could see using it, as long as other people trusted me with it.

Since I don&#039;t have an iPhone and don&#039;t have any real need to collect money from people, it&#039;s not for me, but I do think it could be pretty useful for small businesses!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its an interesting concept, but I agree with many of the comments in that I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d fully trust someone with one.  There are already lots of people out there with credit card skimmers or readers for those touch-less cards, this just seems to make things easier for them.

That said, for those that do trust it it sounds like a great opportunity.  I have a friend who sells art at local markets that would definitely benefit from something like this, and the 3% transaction fee for something like that would be a pretty negligible part of doing business.]]></description>
