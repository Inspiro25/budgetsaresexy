					<description><![CDATA[Pay $ gUaP $ and don&#039;t use your debit or credit card at gas pumps nor in stores where you&#039;re unfamiliar with the terminals. I just got hit on my credit card last month for $165 and change. The person who allegedly skimmed my credit card # went online and bought a Tommy Hilfiger winter coat from Macys online in Hicksville, New York. Then had the nerve to use a $10 off coupon to bring the cost down to $155 and some cents. Now, my mom just got hit 2 days ago for online charges made in Tennessee for $200 and change on the 1st transaction. Then $130 and some cents on a 2nd transaction. Both made online in the same day. Pay that $ gUaP $ at stores. And if you do shop online, use Norton financial protection and be sure that your card is covered by $0 fraud liability! :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved it.
Just combine #2, #3 and #11. sit back and watch the magic (of compounding) happen.

You can do the math.

It&#039;s Simple (not really. but doable)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing this! I sure hope to start saving soon, but paying off my debt is number one. Boy is it hard though. My wife and I are both working full time to try and pay off over $200,000 in debt. We eventually want to move out of our apartment, filled with mice and mold, into a healthy environment where we can work to save money, buy a house, and start our family. It&#039;s a process though, a journey, and we&#039;re in it for the long haul. Thank you for the tips!]]></description>
