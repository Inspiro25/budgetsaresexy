Excellent questions! And ones we all have to figure out on our own whether they make sense or not to include :) I wrote an article around it once if you wanna check out: 

https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/do-you-include-pensions-in-your-net-worth-how-about-art-insurance-homes-cats-baseball-cards/

But basically I like to be more conservative and only count stuff that&#039;s &quot;real&quot; right now. I.e. money in the bank/investments/debts/etc. *THEN* when some of my assets convert (like let&#039;s say if I sell my coin collection or even this blog one day), i&#039;ll then incorporate the cash into the net worth at that point. Though I do like including our cars in the net worth reports which wouldn&#039;t fit that bill, haha...

So again, really just depends on what YOU think makes the most sense :) And don&#039;t be afraid to change it up over the years either! I used to include our kids&#039; 529 accounts in our net worth as well as other things but then decided I didn&#039;t like it so switched... You&#039;ll always be tweaking it over time and there&#039;s nothing wrong with that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why don&#039;t you include your business assets in your net worth? You own other assets (e.g., blogs, coins) correct? Don&#039;t they have some value? I am trying to create my own net worth spreadsheet and am having trouble determining whether or not to include my side hustle sole proprietorship biz assets, checking account and liabilities on the net worth. Thoughts?]]></description>

Excellent question, and it does make sense!

I try to note it in the actual paragraph, but I guess I forget a lot haha...

The answer is a pretty simple one though: currently I only invest once or twice a year when I go in to max out the retirement accounts one by one. The reason for this is that my income fluctuates so much as a self-employed &quot;business&quot; owner, and I never really know what amounts I&#039;ll be allowed to put in until I do my taxes. So even though I *prefer* to invest continuously throughout the year for dollar cost averaging effects, I just wait until I have the final numbers and then invest at that point. Usually around Feb or March of every year.

(My wife&#039;s TSP account listed above, however, gets funded with every paycheck as she has a &quot;normal&quot; job ;))

Oh, and then at the end of every year I&#039;ll also look at our total cash savings and decide if we should keep it as-is or move some over into other departments too, like investments. (Non-retirement). So in good years that&#039;ll be another time we make some moves as well...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am kind of new to your website so this might be a silly question with an obvious answer, but  right now trying to figure out where you list on your monthly reports how much you invested each month. I assume when you are in the green for Cash savings--that&#039;s how much you added towards your &quot;savings for whatever/rainy day&quot; fund. But where do you list how much you invested into your Roth IRA or Brokerage as I see only whether the value went up or went down:) Hope that makes sense.]]></description>
