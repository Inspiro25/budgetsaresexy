					<description><![CDATA[The husband gets paid bi-weekly and I get paid twice a month.  I pay all  my bills online so all our loans (mortgage, cars, credit cards) get paid every four weeks (mortgage from one and cars &#038; cc from the next).  All our monthly bills get paid from my check once monthly.  After two years, you guessed it, we are four months ahead on our mortgage not counting the extra we pay just to get is over with, and our cars will be paid off early saving a few bucks in interest.
Since I&#039;m a 10 month employee I don&#039;t make as much in the summer.  I put money aside each paycheck for the summer but it&#039;s nice to have the option of skipping a mortgage or car payment during summer recess if I absolutely have to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lynn: I can totally understand that. I think a lot of it also has to do with people that are paid hourly compared to salaried workers. Maybe not necessarily that they ARE paid hourly, but a certain type of person that is content working an 8-5 hourly job for 15 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interestingly enough, our workers are paid a lot more than minimum wage (but they are paid hourly with overtime) and we have a lot of long term employees (average time working here is at least 15 years or so).  But that means they have been getting paid weekly and know nothing else.  They also do not react to change very well (as seen in our experience with  health care coverage) so being paid weekly is what it is.]]></description>
