					<description><![CDATA[Insanity comes to mind.  Buying a home is an experience fraught with issues, emotional and financial.  A difficult and expensive proposition at best, and during a mini &quot;bubble&quot; such as we&#039;re experiencing now (as the result of artificially low interest rates), the market is full of investors attempting to cash in.  If you don&#039;t have a very, very good reason to throw yourself at the mercy of the system, why do it?  He&#039;s already a 1099, take out a business license and become self employed.  Write off expenses, take the maximum for a self directed retirement account (there are many, many options here and I&#039;m no expert), and KEEP RENTING!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with most commenters here.  It&#039;s a bad idea to pay mortgage interest just to reduce your taxes.  You are only getting benefit of the tax effect of the mortgage interest deduction.  It you just want a deduction - donate to a charity.  Same affect to your taxes.

Also, the Roth IRA is a great idea, but will not shelter current year taxes since there is not a current tax deduction for the contributions.  A SEP IRA would be best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many have said the same thing. Buying a house for the sake of interest deduction is not a good idea. In 2012, we paid $13,000 in mortgage interest, the government subsidized it with close to $3,000. The $10,000 difference is huge sum to put into some kind of other investments rather than buy a house. Plus the property tax plus the utilities, we paid more than $30,000 last year and for what? We know that most people use three rooms - bedroom, kitchen, and living room. For two people, that pretty much covers.

Find another reason to buy a house, not just simply interest deduction.]]></description>

Agreed! My CPA saves me tons of money every year, not to mention all the advice she&#039;s given every time my life changes (which, at this rate, is like twice a year!). Well worth the money.]]></description>
