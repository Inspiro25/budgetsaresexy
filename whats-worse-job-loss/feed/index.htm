Also a swim parent here, so if I can return the favor and share any wisdom… wear flip flops when you time. Lol. Keep up the sunny disposition.]]></description>

Haha I hope so!! What a perfect opportunity to pair down and live on less before you ever *need* to! You can get to that point much faster when you have a surplus than when you don&#039;t :) Then of course you don&#039;t need as much to retire on and can be even more stress-free - woo!]]></description>

AHHH SO COOL!!! I think you win the award for reading the longest :) I remember exactly where I was when I was posting that particular article too - at my desk job!! Before I even knew you could do blogging stuff for a living, lol.... Such fun times... You&#039;ll have to let me know when you hit that million if you haven&#039;t already so I can update it that you&#039;ve crossed over! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally appreciate this. One of my best friends is constantly stressed about his high-paying job and the possibility of losing it if they company makes some blunder, or the recession hits them somehow. He has invested well and comes from a well-off family so he&#039;s not in any REAL danger of ending up on the streets, but it still bothers him because of the massive expenses he has created for himself. Maybe someday he&#039;ll come around to the idea that he has built his own prison if I keep sending him links to articles like yours. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading for almost all of those 15 years. I went back to look and I read your blog since prior to April 2008 because I remember reading the “How To Become A Millionaire!” when it came out. I&#039;m number 57 on the add on list of bloggers who made that pledge.  I&#039;ve enjoyed reading your blog for all these years.  My blog does not really exist anymore but I keep it online just in case it helps someone like I was 15 years ago.  I&#039;m very impressed that you keep posting and you still are fun to read.  Enjoy your venture into gaming.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been here from early on, but only after the first year or two.
I have been on my own road to FI for a while And finally arrived there together with my huisbrand 5 years ago.
we have been stay at home parents for our 3 kids (15,13 and 8) ever since and we al love it to bits.
Especially since our 3 kids have (a light form)of  autism…Both of us being able to be  there for them fulltime keeps us all sane! 
Apart from caring for each other we also try to travel as much as we can. Making memories together is priceless and also for them its important to make their world as big as possible, since they have their own boundaries in their heads.
No time for volunteer work, but heads up for you! You are doing an amazing job there!

Haha, that&#039;s good!! Decluttering is always good for the soul :) Much less to think about (and maintain) once you get back outside and enjoying life! Hope you get some reprieve soon &#128588;]]></description>
