					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;strong&gt;Jeremy Orr&lt;/strong&gt; - Sometimes I feel like the more you tip, the more you end up winning in the end?   At least at Texas Hold&#039;em.  I swear everytime I tip big I win big.
@&lt;strong&gt;Geoff&lt;/strong&gt; - I think I&#039;d rather be a professional craps or poker player over dealing ;)  Although that&#039;s also because I&#039;m clumsy (and A.D.D.) as hell.  I wouldn&#039;t be cut out for it.
@&lt;strong&gt;The Penny Hoarder&lt;/strong&gt; - You should try it and then tell us what it&#039;s like coming in as a beginner!  Would make for a great blog series ;)
@&lt;strong&gt;Kristina&lt;/strong&gt; - Hahaha... I love your dad.  I&#039;ll have to come up and meet you all sometime :)
@&lt;strong&gt;Amber&lt;/strong&gt; - Wow, that&#039;s pretty interesting.  I bet people lose fake money much faster though!  If it looks like monopoly $ I&#039;d have no problem dropping it all over the place (which is bad!).  Pretty sexy though having women dealers ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my side gig too :)  My husband and I have been working with entertainment casino companies for about six years, and know blackjack, roulette, three-card poker, Texas hold-em, and (by far our favorite) craps.  It&#039;s really a wonderful job to put together extra funds for Christmas. When looking into the job, definitely know your state&#039;s rules on gambling (not allowed here) and make sure your company is operating in a way that is consistent - we use play money all the way, and they play for raffle tickets for prizes.  Personally, I like the fact that no real money changes hands - I find it hard enough to take fake money, let alone someone&#039;s real money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love playing craps.  It&#039;s definitely my casino game of choice.  My Dad taught me to play craps in Las Vegas on my 21st birthday, now I&#039;m 30.  He learned to play on a street corner in Toronto when he was younger, but now he has evolved his craps knowledge into the casino format of the game.  Street Hussle...Side Hussle...It&#039;s all good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve considered doing that as a side job too but never went into it.  Actually if it&#039;s slow like that during most of the year except holidays, perhaps it&#039;s something I should look into.  Interesting post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Technically, craps has two dealers and one stick man. The dealers place the bets for you and the stick man calls the game. 
Craps is fun but it&#039;s the type of game where you have to bet big to win big. You have to have your money out at the right time, you&#039;ve gotta &quot;know when to hold em, know when to fold em&quot; so to speak. If you have your money out at the right time you can do very well for yourself. 
As for how much a craps dealer makes, most of these guys work for tips, so take care of them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, maybe you&#039;re not rolling it the right way? ;)  I&#039;ve never played (yet) but whenever we go to Vegas or AC my friends are at it for hours and they swear by it.  I might have to make it my mission to learn on the next trip.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting... I didn&#039;t realize that craps had &quot;dealers&quot;, I would have thought they were chip placers or something like that.

I&#039;m a part-time craps player.  I can tell you that playing craps doesn&#039;t pay as well as dealing it.]]></description>
