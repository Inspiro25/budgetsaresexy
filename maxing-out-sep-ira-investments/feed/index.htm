					<description><![CDATA[If you are a small business the tax code is definitely structured in a way that pushes you to save.  The SEP vehicle is probably the biggest thing you can do to shuffle away income and save for your retirement.  Not a bad way to do it and it is great that you get to reward yourself with “play money” and pick some stocks that you personally enjoy.  2011 turned out to be a great year J.Money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[22k is a very nice amount to be able to put in your SEP IRA. :-) I&#039;m intertested to see (a bit down the road of course) how your favorite companies stocks perform. I thought it sounded pretty unique when you mentioned it a while back, so I&#039;ve been waiting for you to try it out. Good luck with them and the others you chose. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; -That works!  I actually picked up my first Vanguard fund too a little while ago (last year maybe?), really like them a lot :)
@&lt;b&gt;SupaDad33&lt;/b&gt; - True true, very good point there as well.  I guess I&#039;m hoping my investments just explode with returns where it would more than make up for the taxes I&#039;ll need to pay at the end? :)
@&lt;b&gt;DebtnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, I&#039;ll def. check it out!  Have never poked around anything like that before, so anything will be interesting to me at this poing :)  Appreciate you sharing it, helps a lot.
@&lt;b&gt;Penny&lt;/b&gt; - Great takeaways indeed!  I guess I don&#039;t really think about the diversified plan when picking stocks I love, something to be careful for sure, thanks :) 
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... great use of &quot;that&#039;s what she said!&quot; - love it ;)  To answer your qeustion, no, I don&#039;t use USAA&#039;s money management section there (though I have been thinking about it more lately), but I do think it&#039;s a smart choice esp. if you don&#039;t have any other methods or programs going on you use.  It&#039;s hard to say what&#039;s a good route for ya since I don&#039;t know you very well (or, at all! haha...), but have you tried out &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/mint&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mint.com&lt;/a&gt; or even one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/free-budget-templates-sites/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;budget spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt; on this site? That may prompt you to find some better ways to budget :)  Again, depending on whether you like to manually track more stuff, or have it automated and you just &quot;check in,&quot; etc.  Hundreds of ways to do it differently, but usually I find once you learn what type you like the most, you can start tweaking and testing and narrowing it down.  I think you&#039;ll find it soon :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah L&lt;/b&gt; - Hey friend!  Lovely hearing from you every now and then, glad you still enjoy the site :)  Awesome about your internship too, how exciting!!  Yes, I have heard of Bettermint, and wanna say I have even chatted with them before?, but no - haven&#039;t spent any time poking around quite yet.  You&#039;re not the only one who&#039;s said good things about them though, I think they&#039;re def. on to something :)  Thanks for stopping by!
@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; -  The funny part is that I&#039;m just as excited to invest $22,000 as I would be $220 :)  It&#039;s the mental un-stress that really does it for me!
@&lt;b&gt;Maggie@SquarePennies&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Maggie!  Pretty cool you&#039;ve used them to help refi your house :)  I&#039;m totally addicted to all their calculators, esp with my new &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/mortgage-payoff-plan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;kill my mortgages&lt;/a&gt;&quot; plan in effect, haha... they are awesome!
@&lt;b&gt;MoneySmartGuides&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Thanks :) I agree - maxing out all plans available to you will do WONDERS down the road, no matter what you (pretty much) invest in.
@&lt;b&gt;Julie @ Freedom 48&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s what I&#039;d like to think ;)  That way it hurts even less too if you get stung, eh? It&#039;s not like I&#039;m gonna STOP using their products or services! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kacie&lt;/b&gt; - Well, I wouldn&#039;t go that far, but I do know enough to not risk ALL my eggs, haha... it&#039;s very smart of you to know how you are, and what you&#039;re comfortable with :)  There are PLENTY other vehicles to invest and save with, so no need to jump in yourself if it&#039;s not on the comfort train. Thanks for sharing with us today!
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  I was a realtor for 3 months and loved it (and then hated it, haha...).  Thanks for stopping by and checking out the site, glad you enjoy it! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m too much of a weenie to invest in individual stocks. I don&#039;t have the stomach for it. But as long as you know what you&#039;re doing and you&#039;re not putting your whole portfolio in it, good for you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any small business owner is crazy for not taking advantage of a SEP IRA. It&#039;s certainly a win-win scenario.

As for your investments, they&#039;re a little aggressive for me, but if they work for you, that is all that matters. Everyone&#039;s risk tolerance and investment of choice is difference. The key though is that you are taking advantage of the retirement plan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am with you about Bankrate.  They are almost the personal finance bible.  We refinanced our house after gathering info there.  Great site!  I&#039;m too frugal to go to Starbuck&#039;s except as a treat, but I love, love, love Panera.  Their coffee is great and I&#039;m addicted to their Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwich!  

Good luck with those investments!  They sound pretty good.]]></description>
