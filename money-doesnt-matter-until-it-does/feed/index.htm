					<description><![CDATA[Spending money is easy. It is difficult to save money and takes dedication and discipline. Most people do not have discipline that they now postpone their satisfaction and control their desire for consumption. These people who do their delicacies to delay the satisfaction and they just make excuses!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jobs definitely do not care about you and whether you love them. They will change based on so many factors outside of your control. I was having dinner with  friend last night. She previously loved the job she&#039;s in as the work is highly engaging, but recently all of her close friends at the organization have found other employment. The things she does at work are still enjoyable to her, but the job is different. She&#039;s not as thrilled with it.

Things change all the time and the ability to absorb some of the punches while dodging the knockout blows is definitely something worth striving for.]]></description>

Good job getting to $100k! The financial habits/tips are generally the same regardless of age (it&#039;s just things need to be turbocharged more the older you get from starting), but I do see your point that most $$$ blogs skew younger/millennial.

Maybe try checking out some of the blogs that focus on traditional retirement more? Since we all like to talk about early retirement? :)

Here&#039;s a list from our Directory that might help, and you can search through a handful of other variables as well which will hopefully pinpoint better aligned blogs for ya:

That is awesome :) So much more impactful talking about this stuff in the real world too than online, so hopefully they&#039;re smart enough to ask you questions when they see you! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve been through so many ups and downs, and we haven&#039;t always been financially prepared for the down times. Those situations are so incredibly stressful that I don&#039;t want to be in that position anymore. I&#039;d rather work my butt off for the next few years, get rid of this debt, and save for the future than cross my fingers and hope it all works out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found that the people who say they love they love jobs most are the &#039;spendypants&#039; ones. They know they are not saving enough so the &#039;job loving&#039; line is a bit of a cover for them to also make themselves feel better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can so relate to having people in real life finding out your business on the blog.  We shared our debt-free story and it went viral.  The gist was to say &quot;hey, we made NO money but made saving and paying down debt a priority.  If we can do it, anyone can!&quot;   I had so many (well-meaning) friends jump on that!  &quot;Wow, I had no idea you guys were so broke!&quot;  haha Thank you...I think??  It&#039;s still strange when people approach me at church or on a Friday night hang-out and ask me about one of my posts.  I always pictured my blog and my real life in two completely different worlds.  Not so much.]]></description>
