I love how passionate you are! It sounds like your organization helps out a lot of people, and I could have greatly benefited from it myself all those years ago :) 

I&#039;ll agree it&#039;s a &quot;perfect world&quot; to check off all the items on this list, but you def. can&#039;t go wrong necessarily checking off at least a bulk of them. I think what matters most is that you&#039;re *consciously* going through the different variables and making the decision for yourself whether home ownership is right for you (and esp at that given time in your life). It seems like a lot of people have blindly came out of it okay from the comments here - unlike myself, hah! - but ultimately the more prepared you can be the better. And I&#039;ll agree - not many can check off all those items at least in their youth :)]]></description>

This is so fascinating (and helpful!) to read! I had noooo idea bout subdivisions until reading this, nor did I ever think about one-level homes and disabilities/etc (or snowmobile paths for that matter, haha....) Such great insight, thx for taking the time to brain dump on us :) And really just glad that it all ended up working out for you guys. Congrats on getting it paid off so fast! I&#039;d be surprised if these days there IS a prepayment penalty, but with banks you never know so good reminder to double check on that for sure. Thx for stopping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It all comes down to #9 for me (mostly) and my husband: neither of us wants the cost or the responsibility of fixing #(*$ when it breaks! Just tonight we were trying to shim up bookshelves and bolt them to the wall in our (rented) apartment to make them safer and more stable, and that pretty much maxed out our collective handiness... for the year! We love not being the responsible party if the dishwasher, fridge, or washing machine breaks. 

Of course, we&#039;re also in the DC metro area, so J Money already knows all about the COST issue as well. ;) I honestly don&#039;t know how so many of our friends are affording to buy townhouses and houses in this area. But even if we felt like we had plenty of money to make that decision ourselves, we still wouldn&#039;t want the responsibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bought my house 15 years ago, and have to say it was the single best financial decision I&#039;ve ever made (that said, I do agree that homeownership isn&#039;t for everyone, or right for all phases of adult life). The reason my homeownership journey has been so successful is because I received guidance from people who knew far more than I.

Before I began working for HomeFree-USA (www.homefreeusa.org) I was a member, so I received hands on guidance about whether it&#039;s the right time to buy a home, what I was looking for, my affordability, etc. Plus, I was double fortunate that my dad knew the local real estate well, and pointed me towards a neighborhood that he felt was going to explode in value (he was so right). Value increase was not my primary reason for buying this particular house though, I just wanted to be in this neighborhood and could afford it.

Regarding the Business Insider article, as someone whose organization primarily focuses on developing successful, sustainable homeowners, I actually don&#039;t agree with all of their points. It&#039;s great if you have 20% to put down, but that&#039;s not a determining factor in whether you can afford a home (personally, I didn&#039;t put anything down. I don&#039;t recommend that for everyone, but I&#039;m using myself as one of many examples of people who put little to no money down and have still been able to successfully maintain a home). Few to none of HomeFree-USA&#039;s clients have enough money saved for a 20% downpayment, however we&#039;ve been in business for 21 years and have a 0 foreclosure rate. That&#039;s telling.

2) Having a full emergency fund is wonderful (and extremely important) but again, should not be considered a homeownership deal breaker.

And finally, the credit question is slightly misleading. We regularly work with people with credit scores below 650, however they would be able to afford their mortgage and be a sustainable homeowner (there are a myriad of reasons that their credit report doesn&#039;t accurately reflect their ability to repay). The problem is, even if we can prove to a mortgage underwriter that the borrower will be able to repay the loan, the products that many banks are offering require a minimum credit score of 680 (they&#039;d prefer to see in the mid-700&#039;s, which is practically unreasonable for many Americans). The mid-600&#039;s question is misleading because, even if you do have that score and answer yes to all of the above questions, many lenders would still not loan you the money. FHA allows for credit scores as low as 580, but many lenders won&#039;t offer it to their customers.

Nonprofit homeownership education and financial organizations like HomeFree-USA are key to determining if someone is truly ready for homeownership (because again, many people are not. To flip it, there are people who will answer correctly on all of BI&#039;s questions and still not be mentally ready for homeownership). We are mortgage industry experts who regularly talk to lenders, the GSEs and regulators, and explain to them what&#039;s really going on with potential homebuyers. Likewise, we meet with clients every day and break down why now may or may not be the time to buy. We do not benefit financially by the size of the house someone buys as lenders or realtors do, we win by delivering mortgage ready, sustainable homebuyers.

Sorry for the long response, but as you can see I&#039;m very passionate about this topic:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In 2002, my husband and I purchased a 2/2  home built in 1990 on 7 acres in rural WI using his VA home loan- no $ down. It was a bank-owned property and in 2002 it was $86k; we had a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6%. We were a newly married, fresh out of the military and had only looked at one other house (next door to his parents). I had planned on renting for awhile as we had in Green Bay. It is dumb-luck or divine intervention that things ended up working out so well in this house despite our having zero knowledge of what we wanted or what we should be looking for. The only thing we agreed on was that it needed an attached garage.(Guess what we don&#039;t have). I read a lot of buy vs rent posts on other blogs and I&#039;ve never seen mentioned a couple things that now I&#039;ve found have been crucial to our success here. First off, we got a mortgage with no pre-payment penalty- not that we knew what that was at the time, or even asked for it.  Dumb luck. I had no idea some homeowners didn&#039;t have the luxury of throwing every spare penny at their mortgage to pay it off early. We paid the mortgage off in 8 years, our first-born was not yet two years old.  Next, our home was not within the boundaries of a subdivision. Again, dumb luck- we didn&#039;t open a plat book until the after we&#039;d bought. I didn&#039;t know rural communities have subdivisions and I imagine some of my neighbors don&#039;t either. But this very important stipulation allowed for us to build my husband&#039;s business on the highway facing side of our property a few years after purchase. With county approval (simple process) it was zoned commercial-something we couldn&#039;t have done if we lived in the house next door. Being self-employed allowed the flexibility required to avoid daycare, not to mention the shortest commute possible. Also, I can have chickens if I want (seriously,  $4 a dozen for fresh eggs at our local market) or dozens of other side-hussles if we choose. Additionally, without meaning to, we bought a newer-built  ranch-style home that is nearly handicapped-accessible, meaning, we could stay here a long, long time. With the exception of the washer/dryer (which we could have space for on the main level) and the fuse box, everything is on one level, including two full baths. Older homes with more &quot;character&quot; may have multiple flights of stairs, narrow hallways, and second story bathrooms which become unusable in the event of a disability. Of course, most young people are not looking for these attributes with their first home but in my line of work I&#039;ve seen families struggle to keep their parents or disabled siblings or children in their homes due to the layout. I would recommend taking these features into consideration, especially if you are a veteran, or plan to spend lots of time with parents/grandparents. Finally, our property line runs adjacent to the ATV trail, and the boat landing is less than a mile. Since I&#039;m not originally from this area, I didn&#039;t realize what a blessing (or curse) this could be. Take into consideration how far you would have to travel for the activities you love most. If you love to snowmobile, check if local ordinances require you to trailer your sleds within city limits of the house you want to buy. (Conversely, if you don&#039;t want to wake up in the middle of the night to BRAAAAPPPPP outside your bedroom window- don&#039;t buy adjacent to the trails!) Also, if you are into toys, do you have the space to store them? Your HOA or subdivision may have something to say about the pontoon in your driveway.
 Not that this house has all the answers. Forget all this hype over finished &quot;man-caves.&quot; A finished basement will add little to the overall value of your home unless it is exposed or has egress. While we have 3 additional bedrooms in the house, we could still only ever sell it as a two/two because they are non-conforming in the basement. Right now our two kids (boy/girl) share a room on the main level and at their age its not an issue, but I see how a 3rd bedroom on the main level would be preferable than 3 in the basement. Also, the acreage. You get taxed on all of the acreage regardless of how much of it you actually utilize.  A bulk of our acreage is low-lying along the highway side  or behind the house separated by a fence. And I&#039;ve learned no amount of acreage can prevent a complete jerk-off from building directly across the road from your driveway. So don&#039;t go looking for acreage because you don&#039;t want neighbors. I know rural living isn&#039;t for everyone. We&#039;ve made numerous improvements to the house ourselves; or with the help of family and  friends willing to work for beer and steak dinners. While we didn&#039;t go into buying this house with much of a plan, over the years it&#039;s been integral to how we live, work, and play- making it more of a homestead than just a house.]]></description>
