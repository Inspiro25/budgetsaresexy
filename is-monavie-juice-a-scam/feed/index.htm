					<description><![CDATA[You can use the principles of demand here, if the product is as good as &#039;they&#039; say it is people would not be able to keep their mitts off it, and it would sell itself. Instead what you get are shady &#039;distributors&#039; or &#039;wholesalers&#039; that are fast talking trying to unload their product, before they town finds out they are pushing snake oil.  Not one person has even let me try the product.  Also i see these &#039;guys&#039; at the local mall trying to get rid of all the juice their stuck with that has less nutritional benefit than a hand ful of blueberries]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Mom&#039;s friend introduced us to MonaVie a few years ago. She liked it and it made her feel good about getting more fruit in her diet! A few weeks later, she e-mailed us to let us know she had found a practically identical product called FruitaVie. Sold at Costco for $16 per bottle, a 65% cost difference! I tried FruitaVie a few times and liked it, but as a very healthy 20-something, I didn&#039;t find that it made me feel different. And, of course, I would NEVER expect a pure juice blend to cure any diseases whatsoever!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Monavie is in Malaysia now. a frind of mine just introduce the Monavie juice + the business opportunity. It seems like the company is approaching our Malaysia network marketing leaders with all the luxury cars. The Monavie business was established in Malaysia is 5 months ago and the business is growing very fast. After reading some of the post here, the Monavie juice is nothing special (juice + water only) like what my friend described to me. I think our Malaysia retail price below USD35.00]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So here&#039;s my MonaVie story.. This creepy old lady approached me at a grocery store. At one point she started getting too close to me..Like, in my personal space close. So close where I was forced to say hello. All I thought to say was &quot;Yes.. hi..&quot; She said &quot;Hi, I just wanted to say that you have an amazing auro permeating off your flesh. And for $20, I would like to talk to you about a business opportunity called MonaVie.&quot; I said &quot;Wow, well first of all, thank you so much for the kind words. As you approached me, I thought the same thing about you. I asked myself, &quot;Who is this amazing woman with such great energy just wafting off her flesh?&quot; Yes, I would love to speak to you... for $40..&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I want NATURAL, tasty and fresh juice, I pick some fruits from the grocery store, put them into my juicemaker and it&#039;s all done. Have done this countless times with all kinds of combinations (apple, kiwi, oranges, pears you name it) and it was always amazing.

Anything that&#039;s not made RIGHT in front of you with natural stuff, is not natural. And I&#039;d first kill myself than pay so much money for a &quot;juice&quot;, when I can make my own in 4 minutes.]]></description>
