					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I agree with Andrea and  I would also report someone if it was obvious, not for the reward but because the only way a tax system works completely is if everyone complies. The are many countries in the world that have major money problems because evasion is so high. By the way Does someone know if I could possibly get a blank IRS 8404 form to use ?]]></description>

Yikes - something definitely sounds shady over there for sure. My advice is to probably start looking around for other jobs as you never know what can be going on w/ her and the biz. You definitely don&#039;t want your job to dissapear out of the blue so it&#039;s good to prep early just in case (I was in a similar situation myself which I was eventually let go as the company started crumbling - it isn&#039;t as uncommon as you may think).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If anyone is still reading and responding to this chain: I feel angry because I have the feeling that my boss may be skipping tax somehow. She declines my request for a pay slip that I sign every time I ask. The only document I can keep is of the amount she&#039;s paid into to my bank account, which is only half of what I really earn. The rest she pays me in cash and I have no proof of receiving it, which could now get me into trouble, right? I wouldn&#039;t care how she chooses to conduct her business, if it didn&#039;t affect me, but I think it does now. Any advice on what anyone thinks I should or could do, please?]]></description>

Oh man... That&#039;s hard to do I&#039;m sure. I have no idea if I&#039;d be able to pull the trigger on that or not, but it&#039;s fascinating to hear about others who do - so thanks for stopping by and sharing today, brotha - appreciate it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently reported my ex through this program. She&#039;s an adult entertainer who eanrs $1,000+ on a single slow weekday and about $10,000+ on the weekend, meaning she had a yearly income of six figures and never paid a single penny in taxes in the past two years. I felt bad the first days after reporting her but the more I think about it, I think I made the right the decision. She is someone who enjoys the benefits our country offers yet she doesnt do her part by paying her fair share of taxes. Not to mention she has this horrible sense of entitlement. I know the chances of getting a reward are slim but I didn&#039;t do it for that reason. From my understanding if you report an individual they need to be making $200k + a year theirs a chance for a reward.]]></description>

Wow. That&#039;s no joke. I&#039;d Google for the right numbers/places to report him if you&#039;re serious about it. I really hope none of that&#039;s true :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have come into the opportunity to report someone to the IRS, and really all it is, is being a snitch. But the way I think about it is, I pay my taxes, always have, and always will. I get the help of the government when I need it, and when I don&#039;t, my taxes goes to those who need it, even if they are being greedy or not. So I am going to report someone, and its not huge money but close to a 100k. Which is a big deal, considering the fact, the roads suck, the medical still sucks at least for most, and our economy is kind of okay. So for the 40% of America that ignores paying their taxes, screw you. Now there are circumstances, I get it. You are a single mom, and its just for now, or you are bearly making it, and trying to survive. But if you are just being greedy, and don&#039;t understand the concept of too much money and not enough, then someone will for you...aka the IRS or the snitch that told them for you.]]></description>
