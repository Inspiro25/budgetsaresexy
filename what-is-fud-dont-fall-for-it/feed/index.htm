That&#039;s an awesome question to ask yourself.  I also like &quot;If I was the only person in this world, would I still buy this?&quot;...  It catches me when I want to purchase something just cause everyone else has it or I think it will look cool :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post on FOMO/FUD and thanks for giving examples of how a lot of headlines/media exploit human emotions to get them to do irrational financial decisions!

I feel like one of the best litmus tests for me when I want to do a financial transaction is to ask myself: &quot;How am I feeling right now?&quot;

If I have feelings of FOMO or anger or I feel like &quot;I *HAVE* to do this trade or else...&quot; - I walk away nowadays. And if I go back in retrospect, it&#039;s almost 100% of the time that walking away is the best decision.]]></description>

Hey Angie, I&#039;ve got a good deal for you... But you need to act NOW...  As of today, 1 share of VTI is $230. I suggest people buy as many as they can with their savings because the price is almost certainly going to go higher and higher and higher over the coming decades. :)

Kidding aside, I agree with you. There&#039;s a tasteful way to give people incentives and many people choose the opposite. Glad you got your money back from the paypal guy.

As for the video program, I have no clue about the costs involved. I&#039;d focus on the value it&#039;s going to provide your life and whether you think it&#039;s personally worth it for the price. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made a lot of purchase decisions at work.  I didn&#039;t mind competitors bad mouthing each others offerings.  I just tried to get to the facts, sometimes they were right and that information was very useful to avoid an inferior or overpriced product.  Of course in a work setting you aren&#039;t exposed to FOMO or greed or FUD as much because it isn&#039;t your money and you aren&#039;t buying things for yourself.  But maybe because of my work experience I was pretty impervious to FUD and just relentlessly dug for facts instead of opinions.  But that&#039;s typical for engineers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t seem to mind when companies do it but despise when individuals do it.
For example, I really want to get flexible and learn better mobility.  I started following this expert on Facebook and finally decided to take the leap and do a free consultation call with him.
Bottom line, he told me if I signed up (before the call ended), the program would only cost $5000.  If I didn&#039;t, the program would cost $8000.  To be honest, the manipulation worked.  He got me to PayPal him $5000.  However, after thinking about it for 24 hours, I decided to pursue a full refund.  After several back and forth emails, I finally got my refund.  He clearly reminded me though that it would be $8000 if I signed up in the future.  Because of this, he will never get any of my money.  I HATE manipulation!!!!

Another example just happened to me recently and I&#039;d like your take on it.  I follow a lady whose had much success healing all of her health problems thru a particular diet.  I&#039;m on her email list.  Just this week, she decided to increase the price of her &quot;program&quot; (15+ videos).
The current price is $343.  On Oct 22, it goes up to $555.  On Oct 29, it goes up to $777.  On Nov 5th, it goes up to $1000.  Then on Nov 13th, the program will no longer be around til next year??

This seems slimey to me.  First of all, you can&#039;t tell me the same information on those videos is worth now $600 more in a few weeks!!!
Now again, this slimy tactic does work because I&#039;ve always wanted to get a select few videos and those individually will be going up as well.
Sadly, this just reflects a person&#039;s morality.  
I also hate how everyone tries to overprice everything.  Just because you can get more money doesn&#039;t mean you should.]]></description>
