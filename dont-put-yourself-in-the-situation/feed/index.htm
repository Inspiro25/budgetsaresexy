					<description><![CDATA[@Doctor S- i&#039;m such a word dork...:)

@ J.Money I DO have some tips!! AND you&#039;ve inspired me to write a post!!! Here is the cut-to-the-chase version of how I haven&#039;t shopped since July 22:
I plan ahead and BATCH my shopping for the season ahead. Once a season I shop at outlet malls (still quality clothing) and don’t allow myself to randomly shop- otherwise i&#039;ll emotionally/unconciously shop and thats baaaaaaaaaaddd.
I dont buy something unless I&#039;d regret NOT buying it. If there is something that I think I need/want/have-to-have I ask myself:  how will I feel if I leave the store and don’t buy it? Will I think about it later? 9 times out of 10 the answer is no and I can put it back. If the answer is yes, I put it on hold. The stores ALWAYS hold things for at least 24 hours. If it means that much, is that important, I WILL come back for it and its worth it.
I don’t bring my wallet on errands, I carry cash. When I go out for lunch, my cards stay at my office. Sucks, but has to be done. 
I change up my outfits and dress for my body type (this is for all the ladies out there). I have 5 or 6 “go-to” items of clothing and I mix and match them up in all different variations and still get compliments ALL the time:)
I stop, I sit, I think. I ask: Will this blah-blah-blah really make me happy? Then I repeat this process until I either stop lying to myself or decide that I do need it and only then I can buy it.

Hope these help a bit!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Kim&lt;/b&gt; - You can read magazines, just keep it personal finance ones ;) haha... although even in those you see some pretty high-end ads! (Caddys, watches, etc etc)
@&lt;b&gt;Miss Lissy&lt;/b&gt; - Good one, lists do work.
@&lt;b&gt;JMK&lt;/b&gt; - MAN I wish I was as good as you w/ Christmas shopping! That&#039;s impressive!  I think the earliest I&#039;ve ever gotten it done was on the 22nd. Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jill&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD JOB!!!  You know the date and everything, that is awesome! :)  Any tricks/ideas you wanna share with us?
@&lt;b&gt;Burnette&lt;/b&gt; - Haha love that term &quot;Shopping Detox&quot;.  It really does work though, you&#039;re right.  Been pretty much &quot;sober&quot; for 3 years now!
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;d picket if i could blog at the same time ;)
@&lt;b&gt;brooklyn money&lt;/b&gt; - Haha YES!  Same here -it sucks.  Which is why when I DO go into stores I end up dropping a lot (if i find stuff worth it, of course) because who knows how long it will take for me to get back in one!  I usually try and get like 5-6 shirts and a pair of jeans each time, and then get rid of the old stuff in the closet.  Whatever # comes in, that same # goes out!  Helps w/ minimalism, baby.
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - That def. helps!  Still haven&#039;t listened to Ramsey yet, but I will one day...
@&lt;b&gt;Doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re a riot dude, haha... seriously, make me laugh :)
@&lt;b&gt;In Kinsey&#039;s Closet&lt;/b&gt; - Or just cut it up!  But then life would be pretty boring ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That would also do the trick ;) haha... good one.
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - Oh hell yeah it&#039;s hard!  Esp in your example - i do that every single work day!  But as I mentioned last week i&#039;m totally cool with that one ;)  Gotta &quot;splurge&quot; on something!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem is most people are too stubborn to take a look at themselves in the mirror.  I am the biggest complainer about my own habits, yet I shred myself on a weekly basis when I write about the dumb stuff I do.  But we KEEP doing it b/c we LOVEEEEE being in those situation that we shouldn&#039;t be in!  The irony of life is why we get up every day. 

@Jill - i had to look up the word &quot;unencumbered&quot; . I learned something new today! thanks!]]></description>
