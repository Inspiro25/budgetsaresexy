					<description><![CDATA[I had to laugh a bit at the use of the word &quot;sexy&quot; throughout this article and video. It was used a lot, even by J&#039;s standards, but I guess you have to indulge when given the opportunity!

I appreciate that you included teaching kids about money among these essentials. It&#039;s often viewed as a secondary financial responsibility, but I have been tracing the source of debt and bad financial habits back to what is learned from parents and what parents fail to communicate. I&#039;m glad to see you communicate this as a primary financial responsibility. Thanks, Jeff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Buck  I would love to just get paid to be Dwayne&#039;s stand in.   Don&#039;t think I&#039;m THAT big though.  :)

@ Kathryn   glad to it got a chuckle out of you.  :)  iMovie does all the transitions and the $8 mic makes a HUGE difference.  ;-)

@JW  agreed.   Many think that 10% is enough and see too many people saving well below that.   They&#039;re in for a rude awakening closer to retirement]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the video.  All very &quot;unsexy&quot; things indeed. Personally, I would move number two up to number one, especially if your employer matches. You can&#039;t beat a 50% return on 15% of your gross income.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Classic, solid advice.
1. Checking your credit report isn&#039;t *quite* as easy for Canadians. There&#039;s only two agencies. Equifax REQUIRES that you mail in a ton of crap, including ID. TransUnion doesn&#039;t let you request it online, although there&#039;s a reasonable phone system and they mail it out automatically after you answer questions.
2. Amen re: not saving enough for retirement. 10% is terrible and completely insufficient if market returns continue to fail. Max out ALL tax-advantaged vehicles - Roth IRA, 401k (in Canada, TFSA and RRSP). THEN save another 10% of your gross (which is easier cause of the tax rebate from your 401k or RRSP).
3. A really good book on teaching kids re: money is &quot;Money-Smart Kids&quot; by Gail Vaz-Oxlade. It&#039;s a short novella, easy to read.
4. Emergency fund: $1000 to start. Then build 3 months of earnings as you pay off debt. Then 6 months earnings after your debt is repaid. Nuff said.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jason 

Thanks buddy!   Life&#039;s too short to be serious all the time.  

@debtntaxes   My wife threw 2 shoes at me!  haha.   The second one just seemed more fun to be in slow-mo.  

@ LB Great additions.  Would have included some of those in the video but didn&#039;t want to be 15 minutes long.   :)

@ Peter  that belch was for you and your lunch baby!  

@ Melissa   Totally agree.  Borrow from 401k&#039;s is another pet peeve of mine.]]></description>
