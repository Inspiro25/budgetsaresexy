					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve gotten a handwritten letter since like High School... Where it asked me to circle an answer to a Prom question, haha... All this internet stuff has crippled the letter-writing industry ;) Good for you on pouring your heart and time into them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Normally I would get some Christmas presents for immediate family members, close friends and everyone else a christmas card.  Time flew by too quickly on a limited budget that I decided to not buy everybody presents or cards.  I would treat immediate family members and close friends to events or experiences that will create a memory for them.  I&#039;m treating my friend and her boyfriend to a teahouse between Christmas and 2 weeks after that.  I will write honest handwritten letters to my loved ones and friends.  In each letter will be kinda of an IOU to an activity or hobby that I&#039;ll treat them to with a due date on mind (whether it&#039;s 2 weeks or 2 months).  Few gifts I have are 100% handmade food gifts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems I&#039;m even closer to my guesses now ;) How funny is that?

@&lt;b&gt;K.K. @ Living Debt Free Rocks!&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo! Already gave him the winning name: Wigglesworth! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Laura Brown&lt;/b&gt; - Are you giving people handmade *rocks* or are you saying handmaking things ROCK? Haha... Or are they one in the same? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Erik&lt;/b&gt; - Way to go though, being finished this early on is impressive!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s brilliant!! And it feels good knowing you&#039;re all maxed out too, I bet :) A merry Christmas in many ways!
@&lt;b&gt;Liz&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! I can&#039;t wait to do allowances in our household too - changes the whole mentality with money for kids :) All of a sudden they turn into much more conscious spenders!
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - That sounds wonderful actually :) Enjoying the holidays as it was meant to be!
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - Better to be stressed about the long lines than not having enough money, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;Kim Satterwhite&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh how cool!!! Dogs for Christmas, I love it!!! And hope they don&#039;t read this blog ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Janine @ My Pennies My Thoughts&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re a smart cookie.
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - What???? Messed up! I&#039;m so sorry to hear :( That would upset me time and time again, ugh.
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - I love that too! Buying gifts and then forgetting about them! Turns into double gifts of excitement :)
@&lt;b&gt;Johnny @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;I know my wife said to spend $150 on her this year, but does that mean $300 in wifespeak?&quot; - HAH!! I think about that all the time too, even thougy my wife *swears* she means the amount she states :)
@&lt;b&gt;MrsGreen&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, that&#039;s sad :( I wonder if you can somehow turn it around later without them knowing? Like returning everything and then using the money to be given anonymously or something? Or will they then be pissed when they don&#039;t see their chachkies they got you in your house?
@&lt;b&gt;Mysti&lt;/b&gt; - Very very smart!
@&lt;b&gt;Karie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I bet... And it&#039;s had to please kids at that age too when everyone&#039;s flaunting their goodies! Good luck over there :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ryan&lt;/b&gt; - Good job!
@&lt;b&gt;Chris Bennor&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!! I SO love the $5 idea of yours. I bet we slowly turn to something similar over time too. It&#039;s getting harder/more complicated the more our families extend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Amanda&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, really?? That&#039;s an awesome idea!!! And you get killer discounts on cars too, huh? I&#039;d be all over that :)
@&lt;b&gt;The Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... me too usually, but this season I feel like if I don&#039;t start sooner I&#039;m gonna end up in trouble ;) But will still wait &#039;till the last minute anyways, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Your Boss&lt;/b&gt; - Love it! What kinds of things do y&#039;all do? Would love to bring it up to my family too :) We go to the movies every Christmas Eve, but it doesn&#039;t count for gifts, haha... yet.
@&lt;b&gt;Carol&lt;/b&gt; - I enjoy that a lot too :) Though I still want gifts for the kiddos to open and play with I guess if I think about it... but doesn&#039;t mean the adults couldn&#039;t hang out and kids only open them? Have fun this holiday season!
@&lt;b&gt;Verne Halom&lt;/b&gt; - Still something to take advantage of though! Way to go :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kris&lt;/b&gt; - Oh noes!!!! I hope everything works out okay for you guys, that&#039;s terrible :( At least everyone&#039;s safe and secure, yeah?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely wasn&#039;t stressed at all...until our car broke and now we&#039;re being hit with almost $3k of car repair expenses. Now I&#039;m not so much stressed as sad that everything we saved in the last few months is being wiped out...c&#039;est la vie I suppose!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J.Money No, I&#039;m based in the UK.  First Direct is the bank (if you&#039;re interested); but you must be a current (checking) account holder for the 8% deal, and it is restricted to a certain amount each month.

Christmas everyday, but with strings attached I&#039;m afraid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love Holly@ClubThrifty&#039;s comment - we should do that too. We usually don&#039;t buy anything during the holidays unless we&#039;re really moved to, it just seems like a waste to buy something for the sake of doing that. I&#039;d much rather everyone get together for a great dinner and spend time, doing a Secret Santa, baking cookies as gifts, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Christmas used to be a very stressful time for me. I would calculate and use budgets and calculate some more, and try to save and so on. A month after Christmas I would be horrified by my credit card statement because I would always go over my budgets. All of this changed a few years ago when my family and friends decided to stop giving gifts to each other and instead decided to do something fun together. The Holiday season became all about experience and not about budgets, savings and spending. Much more fun and much less stress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No stress here! My husband is a car salesman, so his employer places $20 in a christmas club fund for each car he sells. We always have plenty a the end of the year for family and are able to help a needy family. I think if we didn&#039;t have it, it might be a little stressful but you would just have to budget for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No stress. We all exchange presents (16 adults) but there&#039;s a $5 cap, so it&#039;s homemade, yard sale finds, regifting, passing on family treasures, etc.  It&#039;s a blast!  I buy the primerib early so I&#039;m over the sticker shock ($150) by the time Christmas rolls around. I do Christmas dinner and delegate Christmas Eve, breakfast, desserts, alcohol, etc.  I have two boys and will splurge a little but I&#039;ll still be well within my comfort zone.]]></description>
