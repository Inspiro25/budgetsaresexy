					<description><![CDATA[Awesome!  I&#039;m glad they&#039;ve been helping out :)

Currently, my E. Fund is mixed in with a lot of other cash in a Money Market Acct (to get a tiny bit more interest than a regular savings), but I&#039;ll admit it doesn&#039;t *feel* as nice doing it that way.  Normally I suggest separating it all out completely so it&#039;s nice and simple and you can see everything better, but the idea of opening up another account (on top of the dozen+ others I already have) keeps me from doing so myself ;)  If you only have the two right now, it might make sense to just open up another savings or money market with the same institution (so you can have it all in one spot) and then keep it separated.  Really a matter of preference though.  And how you operate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, congrats on improving your net worth! It&#039;s steadily climbing since the fall. 
I often use your budget and net worth posts as a template for my own budgeting, so I have a question about the emergency fund. Do you keep this as a separate account or simply leave 10K untouched? I have a basic checking / savings accounts system right now, and I&#039;ve thought of the savings account as an emergency fund of sorts. Maybe it&#039;s time to separate a certain amount of funds. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww, well it&#039;s just a matter of time until you&#039;re up there too!  We all go through the phases in different times of our lives, but if you keep pushing hard and staying on top of it you can get into the positives in no time :) Takes a lot of hard work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Miriam&lt;/b&gt; -  That&#039;s a damn good start, Miriam!  Having no credit card debt beats out a good 50-75% of all other Americans, so great job! :)
@&lt;b&gt;John &#124; Married (with Debt)&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m thinking of going through the Mint to pick it up - probably the Buffalo Proof as it&#039;s what my good friend has been prompting me to do.  And I don&#039;t really care what kind really, as long as I don&#039;t get scammed ;)
@&lt;b&gt;DebtnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; -  Awesome!!  Congrats on starting to track it all now - that&#039;s the hardest part to do!  Now you can see all your progress every month and tweak as necessary :)  Proud of you!!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well - we only do the best we can, right? :)  I&#039;ll be up in NY too in the next few months, used to live there and miss it.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; -  Heck yeah it does!  And we&#039;re all in different phases anyways, so you can&#039;t really compare it with others cuz it&#039;s not apples to apples :)
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks Maria - appreciate it.  It&#039;s only taken me 32 years to finally figure stuff out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Courtney&lt;/b&gt; - Good!!!  Me too actually, haha, sometimes I forget about that but it&#039;s SO TRUE! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kacie&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  It&#039;s a wonderful milestone indeed, and just a matter of time until everyone else reaches it too!  We all go through the phases :)
@&lt;b&gt;Flexo&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks dude!  If only I could tell everyone it was *your* site ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Rich Uncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, nothing wrong with that brotha.  I think it&#039;s smart to tweak the net worth system to fit what your goals are :)
@&lt;b&gt;Marianne&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool!  I haven&#039;t ventured down that path much either actually, I should add it to the list to look into though... I love currency stuff!
@&lt;b&gt;savvyfinanciallatina&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  I&#039;ll go check it out after I post this :)  And yeah, your financial life will dramatically change once you&#039;re in the &quot;real world&quot; - but def. for the better!
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Great!  That beats my 3.5% or so :)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that&#039;s right!!! And he&#039;s a comin&#039; in only a few short months - yikes!
@&lt;b&gt;richard @ moneygraffiti.com&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh I like the sound of new areas though, I&#039;ll check it out with my business partner and hit ya up if we&#039;re interested.  If Money Graffiti ever needs a partner, you better come to me first ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Hannah&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah girl! Rock it!  That&#039;s incredible :)  And I&#039;m def. more about option A and C, but NOT B.  Unless it&#039;s your dream home and/or you&#039;re gonna be living there for a long long time. Don&#039;t make the mistake like we did and buy more just because we could!
@&lt;b&gt;BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks :) Me too!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh you will, friend.  It&#039;s just a matter of time!  This is the first time in my life I&#039;ve been able to do this kinda stuff, so it&#039;s all new to me too :)  We all have to put in a crap lot of work to finally start reaching our goals, so keep it up!
@&lt;b&gt;Leigh&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  Me too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on the net worth spike J Money! My February net worth increase was over $2,500, but looking at a $10,000 increase with $2,500 going towards a mortgage is definitely kicking my butt. I want to get there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way to go!

We are about 5 months ahead of schedule for having our 20% down payment fund in place. This means that we could potentially  a) buy sooner, b) buy a slightly more expensive house, c) put more than 20% down (yahoo!) or d) some combination of the above. This has been due to some unexpected bonuses with both our jobs, our tax refund being larger than expected (I know I know, not free money, but it was still unexpected), being cheap (ha!) and picking up extra hours at my side hustle. 

I&#039;m so excited!]]></description>
