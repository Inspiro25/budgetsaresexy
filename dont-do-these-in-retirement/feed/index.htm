					<description><![CDATA[I love that you were inspired by blogs to retire early- that made you realize it could be a goal and an option. I need to soak in some of that inspiration myself! I do think saving money is sexy because I think it is smart for me, those are very attractive qualities. Learning how to handle money well is on ongoing pursuit and soaking details here and there really helps so thanks!]]></description>

&quot;If you have plenty of stuff to do outside of work, then you&#039;ll be fine after retirement. &quot; -- That&#039;s a great way of putting it! People who have lots of hobbies and are always *active* will have no problem, but if your personality is not like that like you said, then more time needs to be dedicated to figuring out how best to survive retirement, and maybe you just don&#039;t? Cutting back hours to half time or part time might keep a strong foundation for those types of people too so it&#039;s not so extreme.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice interview. I don&#039;t know how people get bored in retirement. Life has been so busy since I retired from my full-time job 12 years ago. There are plenty of things to do. I guess it depends on your personality. If you have plenty of stuff to do outside of work, then you&#039;ll be fine after retirement. I haven&#039;t been very good with the socializing part, though. All my friends are still busy.]]></description>

Well fortunately they&#039;re in school for most of the day so you get plenty of time (and rest!) for yourself before activating Dad Mode, lol... And meal prepping and fitness only takes so long so you&#039;d be fine, believe me ;) 

But you are right on the spouse thing. I get asked all the time - even from my own mom!! - if Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy truly is OK with it, so I&#039;ll literally ask her every 3-4 months just in case I&#039;ve overlooked any flags. And - I&#039;ll ask her if she wants to join me!!! But i guess our personalities are so different that that isn&#039;t even a thought to her as she likes the stability/routine of a 9-5 job (and health insurance!). But maybe one day ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree with the idea of finding things to do from 9-5, but it&#039;s so liberating! I don&#039;t know how people get bored in retirement, as there is always a need for volunteers, always community activism that needs support, a senior home that needs help, or books that can be read. I hope people find their second true calling, because the volunteers I&#039;ve met at parks, trails, libraries, and museums make the experience so much better, and they are happy!

I don&#039;t know about the places that are all uncrowded during the day though. I once took a random day off last year and the grocery store, library, car dealership, and doctors offices were all packed between 10-3 on a Wednesday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I feel like there isn&#039;t enough relatable content out there on the realities of early retirement and married people. I think it takes a special spouse to agree to a certain standard of living in perpetuity.  Early retirement is only possible if both parties agree that the other person&#039;s freedom&#062;stuff.  

I do sometimes imagine what days would be like though.  I would like to think I would have the freedom to focus on physical fitness and personal hobbies but in reality my days would probably just be prepping meals for my family, cleaning the house and then carting my 4 kids around to their 7 different sports practices (which, can be annoying to spend so much time in the car) but I wouldn&#039;t trade this time in my life for the world. Working I would trade but that&#039;s it.]]></description>
