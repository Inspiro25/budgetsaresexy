Obviously they didn&#039;t have financial problems. Kate &#038; Anthony must have been at the end of their ropes to do this, no pun intended. She had a 13 yr old daughter &#038; he had an 11 year old. It&#039;s the kids that suffer the most. Sad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$, I hear you buddy.  Though I qualify by the median survey definition of “wealthy”, I find this kind of obsession unhealthy.  It’s never about absolute wealth, but the ratio of net worth to fully costed living expenses that matters.  This ratio tells you if a millionaire is struggling or a guy with $300k has it made when it comes to ER.  This perspective comes to you even stronger while living in a developing country as I do now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The things in my life that bring me the most happiness turn out to be free or low cost. Hanging out with friends, time with family, playing sport, exercise, reading and creating. These high net worth articles are the types of articles that scare people that don&#039;t know any better not to even bother trying to save for retirement. In reality they may only need half what they think.]]></description>

Money definitely doesn&#039;t buy happiness, but have &quot;enough&quot; money affords you the ability to pursue the things that really make you happy. For me, time is the biggest driver. I want to have more of my time available to do whatever I so desire which would definitely include more activities with the kids while they&#039;re young and still think Dad is cool and fun to hang around. I also look forward to having more freedom to fail without the failure having a trickle down effect.]]></description>

I heard that too. Incredible. Last night, the news reported suicides are up 30% since 1999. It&#039;s now the tenth leading cause of death with 45,000 suicides in 2016. It outnumbers homicides. I heard a report that said Kate Spade was fixated when Robin Williams hung himself &#038; now she&#039;s done the same thing. You&#039;re right about people we think &quot;have it all&quot;....life really is fragile.]]></description>
