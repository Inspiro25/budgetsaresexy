					<description><![CDATA[Mine is simultaneously big and boring - I max out my 403b and Roth IRA every year. 403b with each paycheck and the Roth IRA as soon in the year as I can. Then I know I can spend or invest or do whatever with the rest without any worries because no matter what, I&#039;ve invested $25,000 toward my future this year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a savings account for weekly savings. Every week I save that amount of money. For example on January 1st I throw in $1. January 8th I throw in $2. By the end of the year I&#039;m only throwing in $52 and Ive saved almost $1400. It&#039;s easier to do when you&#039;re in the service industry and most of your income comes from tips.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a SAHM, I don&#039;t earn a regular income but have found ways to help us reach FI sooner. I signed up for ebates and have earned nearly $1400.00 so far. Last year, I joined TopCashBack and have made about $150.00. I don&#039;t like to shop, but when I do have to buy something, I read reviews, compare prices, use coupon codes, and go through cash back sites. Paying for everything we possibly could with a rewards credit card earned us $734.00 in 2018. All rebate and reward dollars are invested in a high-interest savings account or used to pay extra towards our mortgage.]]></description>
