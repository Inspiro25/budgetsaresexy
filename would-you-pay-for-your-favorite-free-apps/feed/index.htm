I like that route there ;)

Something to consider tweaking in our lives even if apps don&#039;t ever plan on charging! So many time suckers out there trying to steal our lives, haha...

Thanks for chiming in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would love to know more about the demographics breakdown especially age and income. My college aged sons know their data is being sold, and have know real problems with it. They like the targeted ads as it is less to deal with when they are looking for something, or at least a starting point. They have definitely had some impulse purchases but nothing outside what their current limited budget can handle or I frequently get sent a link that would make a great gift. I can buy it and save it for Christmas or birthdays.

It would be interesting to see if the quality of content improves overall since people are paying they aren&#039;t going to want to wade through junk to get to useful, especially for sites like Twitter.

I also wonder why people think that if the phone app was a paid subscription, they could just use it for free on the computer. I imagine if I need to pay for Google, it won&#039;t matter where/how I access it.

Interesting to think about. I do pay to be part of a couple of groups that use an app to communicate and share. So clearly I am willing to pay for something and I realize that an efficient use of my time is worth paying for. I think I would probably use fewer apps that are probably more distracting than anything else (ie social media) but would spend more time on what I really want to do (ie creative endeavors). It may be better in the long run.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The thing is that for most of these apps, the content is all created by the users (reddit, Youtube, etc...), so eliminating a large percentage of the user base would eliminate a huge amount of content and make the apps less appealing.

PocketGuard, most similar thing to Level I could find when Level was no more.

Now that I think of it &#039;finance tracker&#039; app might have been a better term. But the biggest benefit for me is being able to see all of my balances without logging into, what is it now, five different places? Oh right I have the 401(k) now! Six places! :-)]]></description>

Good point on whether others pony up for Facebook too! Would be no point if none of your close friends/family decided to keep it around...

(What&#039;s the &quot;finance aggregator&quot; app btw?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought you&#039;d mention that the majority would pay for Venmo! To me that shows some financial awareness and responsibility, if people value something that makes it easy to get paid back and pay others back.

Well, the question was about free apps, so I don&#039;t have to consider my music app of choice, my messaging app of choice, and Tasker, all of which I&#039;ve paid for.

I&#039;d pay a good amount for Maps. I&#039;d pay slightly less for my finance aggregator app. I&#039;d pay a couple bucks for my trail-tracking app. I&#039;d probably pay a couple for my sky map app, at least until I learn the constellations better. I&#039;d pay a few bucks for Duo, which is how I call my parents and grandparents to talk, since the cell signal at my house is so bad.
I wouldn&#039;t pay for games, my bill scheduler app (I&#039;d go back to logging into everything to schedule it), or the app that syncs my OneDrive with my phone (I&#039;d do that by hand though it would be annoying). El doctor would have to use his own phone to show me random YouTube videos (I&#039;m sure he&#039;d pay for it).
Whether I&#039;d pay for Facebook would probably depend on how many of the long-distance relatives decided to pay for it. If they all decided not to, I wouldn&#039;t either. If a bunch of them did, well, number one I wouldn&#039;t want to be left out of everything that happened between the every-couple-years-if-we&#039;re-lucky get togethers, and number two I&#039;d feel guilty making it look like learning constellations and tracking my walks and hikes is more important to me than keeping in touch with family.]]></description>
