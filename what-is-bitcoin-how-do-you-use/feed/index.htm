					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this! I saw a few mentions of bitcoin on Facebook and was totally confused.

I think it&#039;s interesting that you use *real* money to fund a bitcoin account. Something about that makes the new currency feel less credible to me.

That being said, I remember when I first signed up for PayPal over a decade ago. No one was using it but a few internet marketing companies, it seemed! Maybe this will be the next revolution in currency.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem with bitcoin is there is no regulation. Remember the financial disaster we just went through. What caused it was lack of regulation. Also, keep your money in the bank, and it is protected, to a certain point. Good luck to you if some hackers steal your bitcoins. Who are you going to go to?]]></description>

It would be interesting to fast forward through time 5 or 10 years from now and see how all this evolves. I agree with you that a digital currency will probably become mainstream at some point down the line.... whether it&#039;s Bitcoin or something new.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoins are the new age of currency. I actually think it’s time for us all to use digital currency because it&#039;s a more secure way of trading money. But, there are downsides of this currency as well like it can be easily used in the illegal trading of drugs etc. I hope they will make a more secure way of doing digital currency so everyone can easily use and benefit from it.]]></description>
