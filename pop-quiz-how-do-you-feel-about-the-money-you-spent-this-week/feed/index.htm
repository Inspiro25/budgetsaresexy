Persimmon - hah! Haven&#039;t tried that one yet!

We came across a &quot;pomelo&quot; though the other day and that was a fun one! Like a giant grapefruit, only much sweeter :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kind of late reading your blog but thought I&#039;d submit my input

Money I loved spending this week: I purchased luggage for my 14 year old nephew who&#039;s traveling to Iceland and Sweden this Christmas - first trip abroad. 
Money I hated spending this week:  I hate spending money on gas for my car.  I just don&#039;t just the whole industry.  Though did most of my Thanksgiving Day dinner shopping at a grocery store that gives points toward gas - this week paid $1.93/gallon.  Yeah!!!
Money I was surprised to spend this week! No surprises.
Money I knew I’d spend this week and am okay with: Planned to spent money for Thanksgiving Dinner - I host family every year.  
Money I spent towards my goals/dreams: Spent nothing on my goals/dreams.  

Good exercise.]]></description>

Ugh yeah, they make billions a year off that :( I hope you can get them to clear it though! I find If I call and ask nicely they&#039;ll refund &#039;em so long as it&#039;s not a recurring thing... In fact, just did that the other week when I realized I was getting dinged monthly charges for not having enough in my checking? I&#039;d never been charged before so wasn&#039;t sure what was going on, but they cleared the last 3 fees and I had to adjust the way I was managing stuff (it was for my business accounts that I admittedly don&#039;t monitor a closely as my personal ones).

At any rate, sorry to hear you&#039;re dealing with it all, but thank you for participating in this exercise today! Just read up on your answers on your blog post :)]]></description>
