Yikes! I definitely remember BMG because my parents were all on our case to not sign up, and once I did anyways and they were not too pleased haha... They told me it was a scam and looking back it kinda did seem like one eh? Even though a clever/fun one? Hopefully you&#039;re all nice and situated now! Better to learn earlier than later!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Remember BMG music club? I signed up at 17 years old and happily collected all of my free cassette tapes. Then I promptly forgot (not on purpose, honestly) about my obligation to buy the full-priced music. They auto-shipped each one and sent me the bills. I didn&#039;t pay them. They sent me to collections. I still didn&#039;t pay them (I swore I would take care of it next month, so on and so on). Several years later I wanted to get my first apartment and no one would rent to me. BMG had let the credit bureaus know that I was a bum, and the credit bureaus let all potential creditors know that I was a bum. I didn&#039;t realize the consequences of my actions (or inactions) until it was too late.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, awesome post! Thanks for sharing. 

My memories are little different. Mostly because I was told what to do and what not to do with my money by the government. I remember we had lots of money when I was a kid. I mean literally lots of cash at home. But there was nothing to do with it. My dad didn&#039;t get the permit to buy a car, and there was nothing to buy from the stores either. So after gaining back our freedom, we lost lots of money due to the economic situation. However, we also gained the freedom to start our own business. I learnt the value of money in a very young age. And now, being part of EU, things have changed again. 

To make a long story short, for me, financial success and money lessons have been completely different than for most people. Financial success is something I learnt from my childhood while being able to gain the freedom to decide what to do with my money. Now I am grateful for having all the options out there (investments, mortgage, retirement, grants etc). I believe it is crucial to learn from the past and to apply the positive into the future!]]></description>

Oh yeah, my dad is fine now. He actually just retired back in January so now he&#039;s got a lot of free time to do.... whatever he feels like, he&#039;s still figuring that part out. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those are some good quotes from Momma and Poppa $
It&#039;s amazing the random turns of phrase that stick with us, and how much we find ourselves repeating annoying things our parents said to us when we were kids!  ;-)
As a tangent, I have also adopted pet peeves of my parents, that I hated doing when I was a kid.  Where is the justice?!]]></description>
