					<description><![CDATA[How weird? I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m not an expert in this stuff, but I&#039;d guess it&#039;s the closing down of credit cards accounts that are making this happen? If they&#039;re you&#039;re only lines of credit/debts?

Contrary to what people might think, it&#039;s usually best to keep paid off cards OPEN to continue showing responsibility and available credit not being touched (aka your debt-to-credit ratio), etc. Of course if you don&#039;t trust yourself to not use them, then it&#039;s best to cut them up once and for all, but if not you can always leave open and just use it every few months to keep it &quot;active&quot; and then pay off the small balance/etc... Not much you can do about that now though :(

Maybe just email them and see what they say? It looks like you guys aren&#039;t the only ones in this boat.... Sorry to hear! And also - CONGRATS on paying off your debt! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brent - The exact same thing happened to me yesterday. Credit Karma has been carrying my score as 691 for months, and Credit Sesame had it at 741 since I paid off my closed credit card in Dec. Now Credit Sesame alerted me that my score is N/A and suggests that I needed at least one undisputed account on my report with a payment history in the last six months. I&#039;m very confused on what to believe and how this will affect my plans to apply for a new credit card and use it (responsibly) to rebuild my credit.
J. Money - any insight you can share?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been meaning to give Credit Sesame a try. I&#039;ve been using Credit Karma, which works off of you TransUnion report instead. According to them, I am at a 641. That&#039;s up 102 points in two years!]]></description>
