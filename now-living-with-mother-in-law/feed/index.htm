					<description><![CDATA[It all started as a 2 year agreement...been living with MIL for 13 years and usually love it. I do the cooking (love it) and she eats without complaining (even better since she does not cook well). My husband and I are happy to be here. She would be alone and I do not believe she would enjoy that experience so much. We talk all day since I am currently unemployed but actively seeking. My husband works nights so we have time to enjoy each others company in the afternoons. Our youngest daughter has returned to the &quot;Hut&quot; as we have named the house. It is small, but seems to be expandable. We all fit and have a great time with each other, extended family, neighbors and friends. It is a good situation. We are not saving at this time but we are paying the bills without crying each month. It is a serious blessing to be here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, I want to see the &quot;My crazy son in law is living with me&quot; guest post! But that being said, I think that&#039;s a nice arrangement for a whole number of reasons -- you&#039;ll connect more closely, probably form some cherished memories, you&#039;ll appreciate it more because you know its temporary, and you also save some cash as a bonus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been following your blog for a few months and I had to laugh when I saw your post.   I have just moved back to Virginia (born and raised) and have convinced my family to move back in with my parents.  I just started a new job and instead of finding a place immediately we are setting a goal of saving 20K before we start looking for a new place of our own. 
 It is not the best arrangement but saving on the monthly rent and utilities will more that make up for the trouble.]]></description>

Oh, it&#039;s totally going to go much better for you, as long as you aren&#039;t planning on buying a 160-year old house. That&#039;s not the plan, right? :)  It&#039;s ok, it has all been completely worth it to own the house of my dreams!]]></description>
