					<description><![CDATA[Ouch!! That sucks BIG time I&#039;m sorry to hear :( It really is the worst when we have to waste our own time to fix problems that others have created. Especially when we have no choice unless we just wanted to forfeit the money! 

The whole thing is sad w/ Smart Money...  I hope you get an answer/refund soon! Let us know when you do, and maybe the number you were calling so others in the same boat can be helped :) Appreciate you sharing your story with us.]]></description>

I know, right? Sad indeed... and now Newsweek is gone too, so I just pray Money doesn&#039;t go that route anytime soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a very dissatisfied customer. I&#039;m STILL WAITING (since the Sept 2012 last issue of Smart Money) for the conversion of the rest of my subscription to Barron&#039;s magazine. I called on Nov 6th, 2012 and was told that it would be done by the end of November. It is now Jan 22, 2013 and I spoke to two customer representatives today (Kevin and Wilbert) who couldn&#039;t give me a date of when the remainder of my subscription (from Sept 2012-Jan 2014) would be fulfilled. So I asked to speak to a manager (Michelle) and requested a refund. She said she would send it to the back office. I also left the #SMY number on my magazine label and my phone number with a request for follow-up. I have no way of confirming this is being done.

FIrst I&#039;m told (without my consent) that my nearly 2 yr subscription for Smart Money will be converted to another magazine (Barron&#039;s). And then I don&#039;t even receive it. This company needs to give a refund or provide another magazine subscription promptly. I&#039;ve been waiting 4 months! It has cost me time (numerous calls to customer service) and money and I have nothing to show for it. THey could&#039;ve had a new Barron&#039;s customer but instead they have a disgruntled customer who tells everyone to avoid anything to do with Dow Jones &#038; Co. Terrible customer service.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Geez, can&#039;t hardly believe such a well known publication with so much history is shutting down.  I&#039;ve picked up copies of SmartMoney for years and enjoyed reading it.  I know everything is going electronic and fast, but there is something about sitting around with a good magazine in hand on a Saturday morning drinking a cup of coffee you&#039;ll never get from your iPad.  Personally, I&#039;m a subscriber of Money, so not all is lost.  At least not yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder how long it will take for me to stop grieving over this?  It&#039;s only been a day and I&#039;m already feeling a tad bit better, haha... 

@&lt;b&gt;RichUncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - I ended up doing the same, haha... just to have a pure one without any mailing labels on it ;) Ya never know?
@&lt;b&gt;Jason&lt;/b&gt; - I don&#039;t know if they&#039;ll ALL go away, but I&#039;m sure 80% of them will... the population outside of the younger people are still pretty big :) Now maybe in 70 years?
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - It does, thank you!  I was halfway asking them just out of curiousity, but also I was hoping for someone to really answer them for us :)  So thanks!  Didn&#039;t realize print and online ad rates could be so different, or handled by different teams even, but it totally makes sense.  You rock.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Hopefully I&#039;ll get over it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that&#039;s also a very possible reason ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lynn @ Broke-Ass Mommy&lt;/b&gt; - They better not be!! I&#039;m hoarding them in my personal library just in case though - you can&#039;t have  *everything* digital!
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwwww, now that is crazy to think about! You youngin&#039; you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a different take on why Smart Money left print first...they got beat by the other magazines and publications. Capitalism and competition won in the end. Sorry to be harsh J. Money, but they shut down because others were better and won more votes and $. I had a two year subscription a few years ago but didn&#039;t renew.  I&#039;d thumb through their articles, but rarely read any...I guess others did too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m hoping those last questions weren&#039;t rhetorical because I thought I&#039;d try and address them - although this if from my magazine experience, not associated with SmartMoney specifically. 

What happens to all those advertising deals? Do they just go away or move online?
Most of the advertisers were probably contacted before the announcement in June to determine if they wanted to transfer their ad dollars over to the site, or get reduced rates for the remaining runs. Typically online/offline ads are managed through different ad sales departments with drastically different rates, so the advertiser would have the option of how to utilize those bucks. 

What about customers’ pre-paid mag subscriptions? Do I just lose all future months now?
As mentioned above, they will likely try and offer discounts to other products that the company owns, to try and limit as much return-money exposure (and a ridiculous amount of calculations). If the customer doesn&#039;t go with another product, the company could offer partial buy-outs or a free gift in exchange for the trouble. 

What happens to all the employees? Do they move online too or to other areas of the parent company (Dow Jones)?
Most likely, they have been whittling down the print staff for some time in preparation for this close. The people who are left will be offered packages or moved to the parent company - some with choice, some without. Remember that the magazine was produced/published several months ago as monthly editions can take up to three months to come to market. So most of the writers/employees from that last issue have already moved on to other assignments. 

Hope that provides a little insight...]]></description>
