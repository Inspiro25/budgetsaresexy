					<description><![CDATA[Awesome! I like keeping it nice and simple and easier like that too - 1 day a week is a LOT easier goal to shoot for than 2 or 3 or even 5! I see a trend here with your simplicity ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good job! that&#039;s awesome! (even though you didn&#039;t have anything against them).
Lately I&#039;ve been commuting with a friend to work and that has been saving me money, I try for one day a week (since my car can go 4 days without refueling that gets me to the weekend).

Also I used my stop and shop gas savings at a shell the other night and i saved 40c per gallon!  I&#039;ve never done it before and I was intimidated by the process but it turns out it&#039;s not hard and it saved me a lot of money.

Also, I&#039;ve started bringing lunch to work every day to minimize temptation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Vangile Makwakwa&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhh yeah, that makes sense. At least you&#039;ve got the extra money to prioritize like that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Pam&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s def. hard to win at least on a consistent basis.... Still trying to figure out &quot;the trick&quot; ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder which area helps more with stress: The massages and acupuncture or vacations? :) I&#039;ve never tried the former, but I&#039;m alllll about the latter! Love me some vacays. And smart phones for that matter - as long as they make your life EASIER and not harder. The ability to access email 24x7 can be both a splendor and an annoyance, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I stopped spending money on my weekly massages and acupuncture sessions. This does concern me since it impacts my health and stress levels. The money has gone into my travels - I have taken 3 vacations this year to London and Madagascar and different places in South Africa. I am now actively working on getting back on track with my budget and I think I would play the lottery if I was guanteed a win or maybe I will eventually invest in a smart phone because they seem rather smart.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Wayne @ Young Family Finance&lt;/b&gt; - I know, at first I was pretty impressed w/ my scanner too, and then it quickly turned into an annoyance, haha... But I guess it does more good than harm ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Liquid&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah - they&#039;re so much more colorful than ours! Actually, most of the world&#039;s money is. I wonder if people think ours are lame and boring?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I buy lottery tickets on occasion. I don&#039;t do it to win. I do it for the social aspect. Becoming a part of something bigger than myself.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty impressed at the scanner/phone &quot;knowing&quot; what you&#039;re doing with the money! Wow!  I know a few people who swear by lottery tickets. It&#039;s especially not bad when you win the money you use to buy more lottery tickets. It&#039;s not my chosen form of entertainment (partially because it only lasts for a few seconds) but they are fun stocking stuffers.]]></description>
