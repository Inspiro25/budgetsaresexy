					<description><![CDATA[You do not want to wait until you move... you make more and less stressed if you keep on top of it. You can get a better price if you are not in a hurry... at some point someone is going to find it is EXACTLY what they were looking for. (I&#039;m still in the middle of getting as much as I can sold before shortly moving overseas.. not fun.) But I am looking forward to starting out fresh and making different decisions this time around. :D
And whatever you do don&#039;t throw everything into garbage bags at the curb. :P Huge pet peeve. If you aren&#039;t going to send it to a second hand store, leave a &quot;free&quot; box out on the curb. I just found a barely used scrapbooking cardboard kit in someone&#039;s recycling.. it just caught my eye walking by even though it was under another box. I&#039;m going to throw it in my garage sale. :D Free money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately I don&#039;t have an old Iphone to sell...and I won&#039;t be buying a new one either.  I guess I just don&#039;t need to be &#039;in-touch&#039; with everything and everyone 24 hrs a day.  I will just keep my little &#039;ole cheap $9.99 phone I got when the hubby got his Iphone (he has the need I guess)...my phone works just great and gets me in contact with the people I need to talk to.  Other than that...i got this here computer...it&#039;s good enough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Brandi&lt;/b&gt; - That would do it!  And if you&#039;re REALLY good, you can *pretend* you&#039;re moving once a year so you don&#039;t let it all pile up again :)
@&lt;b&gt;Everyday Tips&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! I do that exact same thing!  I&#039;ll look at my newly cleaned portion of the house a few times a day just to remind myself how awesome I am. Haha...it also helps me to keep it that way.
@&lt;b&gt;Craig&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a great idea man, really really good one.
@&lt;b&gt;Patti&lt;/b&gt; - YES, do it!  Even if you only last a week you&#039;d have cleaned up soooooo much.  You do it for a month you are a rock star ;)
@&lt;b&gt;HighClassLowIncome&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, and I thought my 2 years of waiting was good!  Macs are sweet for sure - our main comp is one @ home.
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Do it! do it! do it! sell that bad boy and upgrade &amp; then pocket the difference.  It&#039;s a win-win situation :)
@&lt;b&gt;Impulse Magazine&lt;/b&gt; - The one thing that wasn&#039;t overhyped though?  The BATTERY LIFE!  Can never have enough my man.
@&lt;b&gt;kt&lt;/b&gt; - That is amazing!  I&#039;d really like to get closer to that type of lifestyle. Maybe not a backpack or two worth only, but certainly a lot more managable than I have now.  Although when we start having kids I&#039;m sure that &quot;stuff&quot; # will be going back up!
@&lt;b&gt;nyx&lt;/b&gt; - Damn straight.  I bought an iPod 3 years ago before my &quot;financial change&quot; and I&#039;ve listened to it a total of 3 times.  Maybe 4.  $hit, I don&#039;t even use the one on my iPhone! haha...but I was tempted to get it just like everyone else did so I dropped the $200.  And if I hadn&#039;t engraved all over it I could have at least sold it for a decent amount ;)  

I also like your mentality of only having a few things, but letting them be your favorites.  If everything we owned were our favorites that would be hot! Would always be enjoying those items you have :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it amazing how much we buy yet how little we use? I&#039;ve recently learned to know my habits first and to think about purchases 30 days before I get it. For the most part I just stick to my favorite stuff which is only a couple of things. I&#039;ve realized that since I only have a couple of toys that I really like to spend the money for quality so that it&#039;ll last me longer.

I don&#039;t even have an ipod, my bf gave me an MP3 player but I rarely use it, its the type of thing that I might use on vacation or on road trips which is why I haven&#039;t bought an ipod yet, mostly i use my computer to listen to music, lol. I&#039;ve also realized we don&#039;t need an item for everything that we want to do such as a paper towel holder, my paper towels hold themselves up just fine without a paper towel holder. 

Sometimes you just have to think for yourself, find alternatives, etc. You don&#039;t need everything that they say you need to live a nice life.]]></description>

Means that i can very easily live from a backpack while hiking thru europe or south america or where ever]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a good idea!  My wife has been looking at the 4 so I might just seller 3G based on this. 

Oh and way to rock the Newton this morning.  Apple was so far ahead of it&#039;s time then, but that really was an awesome platform.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friends have been selling their old iPhones too and making a little extra cash! I luckily have never given into the iPhone trend but they do seem cool (I&#039;m a recent MAC convert over here.. ;) )

I&#039;m planning to relocate soon... and there are some things that I&#039;d like to try to sell just to lessen the load and make some extra $$.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. My guy just sold his iPhone 3GS for $305! (The thing is that many people want an unlocked phone - buying a new iPhone 4 unlocked goes for about $699).  We have a bunch of books and comic books that I&#039;d love to unload for some $$ even if it&#039;s a little.  The thing that takes away is the time to arrange and catalogue. But I love the litte a day approach. I will start implementing this at home ASAP.]]></description>
