					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jon B&lt;/b&gt; - Glad it helps! :)
@&lt;b&gt;daveM&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, good idea too. Especially if you&#039;re playing a lot more riskier w/ your money than other investments - it&#039;s good to cap it at a smaller % until you figure out what works/etc... or maybe until your risk tolerance changes ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One small suggestion is that you limit your position sizing so that you are not exposed for more than 4 - 5 per cent of your fund on any one security. That will allow you to upgrade your holdings more often.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hey everyone just wanted to drop my two cents in as a former stockbroker turned individual investor.  I have found that investing emotionally, and yes that does mean in brands that you are in love with, not to be such a great idea.  Its really good to have a great experience with a brand or company, but every technician will tell there is a difference between XYZ the company and XYZ the stock.  I tend to follow macro moves of the market with index and specialized ETFs and use market based indicators to move in and out of investments.  I have had good success with this strategy over the last two years.  I journal my thoughts about the market daily on my blog. Good Luck Everyone...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Janine @ My Pennies My Thoughts&lt;/b&gt; - So far so good :) I&#039;ll have to keep my eye on them as time goes by to see if it&#039;s a winning strategy or not... But so far I&#039;m liking where it&#039;s going!
@&lt;b&gt;Jon B&lt;/b&gt; - Worth a shot, right? You can always go back to recommended funds at any point too down the road :) I&#039;d just make sure the bulk of your investments are good to go if you&#039;re planning on picking stocks here and there for fun like I am... I wouldn&#039;t dare do it with all my eggs :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good post...I&#039;ve been thinking about selling off the mutual funds I was recommended into and its refreshing to see someone else who has done just that.  Mine will be at a loss too, but I feel like things could get a lot worse and I might be better managing my own money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think investing in companies you are passionate about is a great way to go out investing. If you don&#039;t believe in a company and share some of their values, I personally don&#039;t think they make good investments... and you proved that right here!]]></description>
