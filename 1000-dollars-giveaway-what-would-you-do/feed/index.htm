					<description><![CDATA[I did - can you believe that?? Luckiest thing I&#039;ve ever won! :)

Ramit just blogged about it here:
http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/1001-contest-winner-and-twitter-posts/

Sucks about Opie and them not responding, but hopefully they mention something one day so we can all be kept in the loop...  I&#039;ll be blogging about winning this $1,001 soon, woohoo!]]></description>

BTW, never heard from Opie and Anthony about their $1,000. throwaway bill despite 2 posts to their Facebook page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I asked Opie and Anthony on their facebook page about that bill. No reply. And you&#039;re so right; the odds on that are astronomical since you&#039;d have to read the serial number on every bill you get (and who knows what that bill&#039;s serial number was?) Our odds are tremendously better, haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Natch, you&#039;re as eligible as anyone else, J.! Wish  that we could put more into circulation to up the odds--but it&#039;s a start. BTW, I wonder if that one-shot bill from Opie and Anthony ever got found?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;richard @ moneygraffiti.com&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!  Or even from me! :)  I don&#039;t think that $1,001 is done yet - I wanna say we have another week left to find out still?
@&lt;b&gt;michelle&lt;/b&gt; - I like the shoes idea :) It&#039;s always soooooooo hard for me to spend $ on shoes - sometimes I wish I didn&#039;t care so I could get the ones I really wanted! Hehe...
@&lt;b&gt;Devin&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome plan!  Congrats on going back :)]]></description>
