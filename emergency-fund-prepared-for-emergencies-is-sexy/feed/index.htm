					<description><![CDATA[My EF is pretty pitiful right now.  Income is tight and bills are high.  We have about 1 month worth of expenses in the EF right now.  I also have a Christmas Fund of $500 and a small Vacation Fund.  Lately, we&#039;ve been dipping into the EF for things like car maintenance because our income has been so tight (it will be improving once my husband&#039;s car is paid off in November! That&#039;ll be an extra $270/month we&#039;ll have available).  I should probably take $200-$300 and put it in a separate account for expenses like car maintenance and what not.  I think I&#039;ll create one of those Oh-Biscuits accounts today!  Thanks for the great idea.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heck yeah, now you&#039;re thinkin&#039;!  I&#039;m all about buying it up when it&#039;s low, especially since we&#039;re still relatively young :)  I like that slush fund y&#039;all are adding up too - that&#039;s awesome.  But not as much as your killer Emergency Fund, my word!  Great job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[it took a couple years to build up, but we have an emergency fund that covers 6 months of expenses (with some belt-tightening &#038; elimination of &quot;fluff&quot; spending)...but in doing some doomsday budget calcs, I realized that it would actually be more than 6 months we have covered.  Assuming that we are eligible for UI for 6 months:
- if hubby loses his job, we can cover 33+ months
- if I lose my job, we can cover 48+ months
- if all hell breaks loose and we both lose our jobs at the same time, we&#039;re covered for 9 months.  

All our savings are automated, with weekly transfers going into multiple accounts - the less time I have to think about saving, the more likely it is to actually get done.  Now that the EF is built up, we can contribute more heavily to our other savings funds: &quot;fun fun&quot;, car, gifts, tuition, house fund (for household misc &#038; fixes), and the relatively newly created slush fund.  That slush fund is where extra money goes to each month, and when it builds up, we decide what to do with it - making extra debt payments or put towards investing.  Lately, paying down extra debt has been winning out since the market has been so volatile (1% return at ING is better than what feels like an umpteen% loss in my 403b), but I&#039;m set to increase my 403b contributions in the very near future - may as well buy extra while the prices are low!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Joseph!  I&#039;m all about the emergency funds so I&#039;m really glad you brought it up and shared the love w/ everyone here.  Appreciate you responding to comments and watching out for me while I was gone too - you rock, man.

@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - I like that a lot - having emergency items on hand too, just in case the world goes to hell and money is worthless all over! (ya know, like if alients came or the world exploded ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, seperating a few accounts work out REALLY well for me.  I find having them in different places helps me focus and mentally do better every month.  Esp with taxes - that stuff scares the bejesus out of me, so SEEING all that money in there really does wonders :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenny~Z &lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that sucks - I&#039;m sorry!  GREAT that you had it all saved up and ready to go for exactly that though, you&#039;ll have it saved back up again in no time :)
@&lt;b&gt;WinrWinrChknDinr&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I do that too -- keeping more money in my checking account and pretending it&#039;s $0.00 in case I F up and do something stupid ;)  It&#039;s saved me on more occurences than I&#039;d like to admit.
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @ Stay Thrifty&lt;/b&gt; - I had an F U fund too ;)  But I got beaten to the punch and was laid off 2 weeks before I wanted to use it! Haha... damn good I was working on it though, that&#039;s for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;Gene&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! I agree - having good insurance in place is also VERY very important, especially when others are involved like family or spouses/etc.  Though it sucks ass having to dish out money when nothing bad is happening, it def. feels good knowing that you&#039;d be okay financially just in case something DOES pop out of the woodwork.  The last thing you want to be thinking about is money when something bad goes down in your life...
@&lt;b&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, right?  Interest blows on cash right now BUT if you&#039;ve got a mortgage tied to a variable rate you are LOVING it ;)  As I am w/ my 2nd one - though I need to get better like you and start paying it off more aggressively... it is in the works though.
@&lt;b&gt;Ms. S&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s a damn good feeling, I know!  I always prefer having more in the bank instead of $0 and less debt.  You can always use your cash to pay off bills, but you can&#039;t take out cash back from them!
@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, that sucks :(  I hope it gets better for you!  Debt collectors are no joke.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish I had something like this last year. This time last year I had a accident couldn&#039;t work for two months, had not one red cent coming in, yet I still had bills coming out I&#039;m still trying to get on top of it, but it&#039;s getting the better of me, I have debt collectors calling nearly everyday. It&#039;s been a year to the day and I hate it. As soon as I get my insurance payout I&#039;m opening an emergency fund, because I never want to be in this situation. I would say I would start today but that&#039;s not realistic because I don&#039;t even have a $1 spare. I don&#039;t go out, all my money goes on bills and fuel to get to work otherwise no money. I just keep hoping it will get better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Joseph

We don&#039;t have anything regarding our finances automated (savings or bills). It&#039;s more of a personal choice thing. I like to be the one in control of my money and tell how much of it to go, where, and when. I don&#039;t like to look at the balance, and wonder what happened. And I hate the thought of someone else (other than me) having access to my account to take money as they see fit, even if it is for my own good. Heck, I am not even sure I trust my bank. It&#039;s curious, because I always heard that most financial gurus say not to automate things, and to remain in control of everything.

I have enough discipline to pay ourselves first at the beginning of the month (sinking funds, Roths, and other investments), and at the end of the month (with whatever money is left over from our budget down to the $2000 low limit). It works for us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Ginger I agree that having multiple streams of income would be substantially more useful than having a large emergency fund. After all, having multiple streams of income would hopefully mean you never ever have to dip into an emergency fund. This is ideal. That said, most people only have one source of income, maybe two, so for the rest of us it’s important to have a minimum of 3 months of expenses in an emergency fund. I love the idea of working toward multiple income streams and I hope that most people can find that! Thanks for the comment.

@WinrWinrChknDinr Nice work having 5 months set aside. I am curious why you don’t automate your savings? Just a personal choice or you’ve just never bothered to set up an automation? 

@South County Girl congrats on hitting that 6 month EF! Mini funds are a good idea too -- the idea is to have something, how you do it is up to you! Nice work!

@Jeff Love the name for your unplanned expenses savings account. Gave me a good chuckle.

@Michelle good luck working on that emergency fund! A blog is a great way to keep yourself in check. I wish you the best!]]></description>
