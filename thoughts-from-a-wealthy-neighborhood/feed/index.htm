					<description><![CDATA[As a young child I often dreamed of living in one of the more beautiful neighborhoods in my Southern California community, but those dreams were based primarily on the natural beauty of the area.  Yes, the streets were definitely lined with gorgeous custom homes, but what touched my heart was the sprawling green lawns, the massive old oak trees, and the piece de resistance, a creek, that to this day still flows through several of the properties -- my property included.  I live there now with my husband.  And we and our three dogs love it.  Not everyone who resides in those communities we love taking that Sunday drive through, live above their means.  We don&#039;t.  My husband and I are what I call &quot;a late (or later) in life married couple.&quot;  And we got lucky.  Individually we each saved and invested throughout the &quot;important years,&quot; and have continued to do so during our marriage.  And on a side note, we have a couple of luxury cars too, but ours are now 6 and 14 years old.  We are living our dream, not the Joneses&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now I want to know how people came to be in that neighborhood and have those cars, too! Love hearing stories of how people got to where they are. I hope you interview some of those neighbors for a blog post!]]></description>

You know, I think you are right on at least half the places here. So far the only ones I really see during my walks are older and look retired, and the other half are at least 15-20 years older than me. So it could be they bought early and now reaping the benefits! I&#039;m just waiting to come across someone my own age (who doesn&#039;t live with their parents) to see what I can find out ;) But I&#039;m also running out of time - gonna be off again and finally into our new home soon! Woohoo!]]></description>

I was wondering the same thing actually (feeling pressured or not), and I don&#039;t think I would to be honest with you. In fact, I&#039;d probably ENJOY being the odd man out more! I&#039;ve got no shame pimping my beat up caddy around these streets, haha... it def stands out at least ;)]]></description>

I think you&#039;re right on that one. And I bet if we were all around on this blog a handful of years from now we&#039;d be able to comfortably live in those areas too!]]></description>
