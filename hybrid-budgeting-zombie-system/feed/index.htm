The way you so calmly explain how your month to month &quot;budget&quot; works so easily should be a huge flag to others that a doable and usable budget beats all others!  Well done!]]></description>

BOOM! You&#039;ve mastered something half the country will never do :) We all slip from time to time, but as long as the trend is going upwards with that net worth just keep on doing your thing and tweak as you go! It&#039;s an ever-evolving process!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found your website this past week, so am still trying to review all of the content, which looks pretty good so far, when I as this particular piece I had to comment.  I have been using this type of plan for a couple of years now.  I set up a completely different checking account, and every payday, which is biweekly, I deposit an amount into it which equates to 1/2 of the monthly total of bill.  This has another advantage, which is since I get paid biweekly, I end up putting in 13 months worth of bills every year, not saying this is a replacement for a regular savings plan, but it is nice to see that total alway be enough to cover all your bill. As to the 2nd part of the plan, I than take out &quot;spending money&quot; for the week which consists of grocery, gas, and personal money for the pay period.  To be honest still working on self-discipline for the rest of the budgeting process, primarily saving as much as possible, but by following this hybrid method, the bills are paid on time, and we&#039;re able to keep some money on hand for groceries and such.]]></description>

Debbie,  just write &quot;casserole&quot; on some freezer tape, stick it on the container and it should be completely safe. 
 Since you know this is code for &quot;cash, a roll&quot; you too will remember where your $ is stashed!]]></description>

Oh damn! That would be wild to find! Another place to look for hidden cash? The lenses of old school cameras... A guy once told me he found $3,500 in $100 bills rolled up in one of them at a yard sale, and now checks them every single time he comes across one :)]]></description>

Here&#039;s a story I heard on the radio last year.

The home of an old lady who passed away was being cleaned out.  One person was cleaning out the freezer and found stacks of bills buried in the corner.  As they cleaned out the home more and more money was found.  I believe it amounted to something like $30,000.  A fair chunk of cash.

It&#039;s safe to say she wasn&#039;t hiding it there out of fear of zombies.]]></description>

Cold hard cash. Love it. Great idea. I heard some people hide jewelry in the fridge/freezer too! Just hope the burglars aren&#039;t hungry if/when they break in!]]></description>

Yeah, here in the US most people tend to think &quot;it could never happen here&quot;... and although I&#039;m no doomsayer, I also realize that it could most definitely &quot;happen here&quot; (*looks at the national debt*) and that it&#039;s best to be prepared for the worst.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Southcountrygirl,

Let me introduce you to something we called the mini pouch.  It is any wallet, or other money capable holding enclosure, that is easily carried with you and has 3 to 4 slots you can put cash in.   I used my Daytimer for years.  My spouse typically purchased 80-90% of our household items and food , and 100% of our clothes, therefore my daily need for cash was much, much less.  
Each Monday, I would take $40 for gas, $20 each  for entertainment,food,household and Misc. for a total of $100. Anything I did not spend would go back into the pouch and I would &quot;restock to the $100 level again each week.  You might want to try this with the &quot;hubs&quot; as he continues up that learning curve!]]></description>
