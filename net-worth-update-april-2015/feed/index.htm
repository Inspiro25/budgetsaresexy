The nice part is that you&#039;ll reach it at some point real soon :) Then time for a new goal to keep pushing forward!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job. It&#039;s so powerful to track those numbers. We&#039;ve been tracking our net worth for the past 5 years and it&#039;s amazing how fast it grows when you spend much less and invest the rest. Last year we finished paying off our remaining debt and grew the net worth by 45%! Now we&#039;re less than 4 years away from affording early retirement. Keep these coming!]]></description>

Oh, nice!!!! I would die if mine said that, haha... In fact, I&#039;m still waiting for them to tell me if they&#039;re renting for another year after raising it by $25, so maybe they&#039;re taking forever cuz they&#039;re interested in buying too? That would be something!]]></description>

Absolutely! Our coffee budget will probably never go down, but I&#039;m more than willing to stop eating as much fast food and only eat at good restaurants! And, gotta love those side hustles!]]></description>
