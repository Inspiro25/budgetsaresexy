					<description><![CDATA[Wow, great stories about your experiences Joel! 

I hear you. I have a love/hate relationship with real estate. There&#039;s really a lot more involved with it than people think. And, it&#039;s definitely not passive as you still have to manage the business and keep an eye on it (as in any other business).

Glad to hear about the sale of your 2 rental properties. I just cashed out on a mobile home fix up myself. Sometimes, it&#039;s just nice to get the cash and not have to worry about the types of things that come up when buying and holding. 

Looking forward to hearing more about the sale of the last two properties!]]></description>

With your workload, it&#039;s smart to consider waiting until you have more time up your sleeve to take on a real estate project. You can always outsource management to a property manager, but there&#039;s always the ultimate responsibility of managing the manager, and obviously researching and picking the right properties to buy.  REITs offer great exposure to real estate with zero time management :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We sold 3 out of 4 of our rentals in the past year. We are in a hot market and the pandemic made us realize that we were ready to move on ! We paid the taxes and invested the rest!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article! I have never owned an investment property, only my own homes. About a year ago, I decided to diversity into some REITs (SCHH and VGSLX). In total I have about $75K in the REITs. I have gone back and forth about just selling the REITs and using the money to put down payments on a rental property or 2 (I live in Pittsburgh where property can still be had for pretty reasonable) and taking out mortgages for the balance (leverage debt for my advantage) It *feels* like I am leaving money on the table by not doing this. 

At the same time, I work 50-60 hours a week currently and have small children and I just don&#039;t feel like I can manage that AND the rental properties. I love the passive aspect of the REIT. So I think for the time being I will stick to the REITs to keep life simpler, even if it means giving up some profits.

I should be at 50% of my FIRE number by end of the year. I think I will actually retire in 5-8 years at age 46-49 and possibly look to buy a rental property and try it out then when I have more bandwidth and my kids are older.]]></description>

Maybe, maybe not. Returns aren&#039;t dependent solely on the property type, or just a few specific factors. It&#039;s more like 1000 little things that make a rental investment good or not. Location (near good schools, healthy amount of jobs, easy access, fun community, malls, good eats, healthy city progress, low crime, parks nearby, etc.) is a huge contributing factor, no matter whether it&#039;s a SFH or multi-family.

I don&#039;t regret buying 4-plexes. I regret rushing into so many without a clear end goal. Now I have to backtrack a little.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the article, great info shared. Do you think you would buy a different type of property if you started over again? Instead of a 4plex maybe 1-2 SFH&#039;s would have gotten better returns (can sell to home buyers-not just investors?) and maybe a better tenant pool?]]></description>

Cheers JM!  I&#039;m keeping 1 physical rental, which is a duplex that cashflows well and has long term tenants. Also I have several syndication deals (apt complexes) that are passive and dependable. So i&#039;m not exiting real estate completely, just the physical properties that suck up most of my time. :)

Good luck on the sale and congrats on simplifying you portfolio!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[been reading your blog since the j money days.  Im currently thinking the same thing.  I&#039;m in the process of liquidating one of my rentals, and for the same reasons you&#039;ve outlined.  Tenant issues, repairs, and a white hot real estate market.

I had to pay for depreciation recapture for the first one which wasn&#039;t that bad, since I didn&#039;t own it that long-- 3 years, and the current one in escrow I&#039;ve owned for 4 years.  The other one I had I&#039;ve owned since 2006; and since there&#039;s a ton of equity, I know I&#039;ll get hit with a big depreciation recapture bill.  The tenant so far (2 years +) has been stellar, but I know that the hvac, water heater etc&#039;s shelf life is fast approaching.

What I might end up doing is 1/2 real estate and 1/2 index funds, stocks.  I hear you on the passive component of index funds though.  Someone once told me, whenever you receive a call from your property manager-- it&#039;s never good news.  It can be neutral news, but it&#039;s either that or bad news.

Keep up the great content.
