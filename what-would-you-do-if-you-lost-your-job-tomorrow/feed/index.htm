					<description><![CDATA[I think you had a great plan for your meeting. Also, you have a lot to fall back on as well. I guess this is why you build up an emergency savings account and plan for things like this the best you can!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man, you all sure know how to make a blogger feel good!!!!  THANK YOU x a lot.  Seriously, i kept coming back here to read this throughout the day before things got settled and I appreciate each and every one of you taking the time to comment :)  You guys rock.

To answer some of your questions, we actually didn&#039;t have any layoffs (at least yet).  Turns out some people were quitting already and those of us remaining are more than happy to take over these new duties.  I don&#039;t want to jinx anything here, but it may turn out even better than it was before.  So really - no complaints at all :)  Except that now I can&#039;t blog full-time...

BUT, you know what I am going to do? Save-Save-SAVE and put together a game plan to make my actual dreams here come true.  This way it&#039;s all on MY terms instead of in the hands of others!  It might take me a few extra months, but it&#039;s just a matter of time until I rock it out...and I have you all to thank for it ;)  Without you I&#039;d be rambling off into the abyss!

So thanks again guys.  Much love to all y&#039;all, and here&#039;s to a great 2010!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re my favorite blogger to read about money.  I am excited that you still have a job!!!  CONGRATS!  I&#039;ve been downsized twice, then I worked as an independent contractor, and now I&#039;m back in the business world.  You just need to roll with the punches and realize that God has a plan for you.  Thank God you&#039;re on the right track financially.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope that things go well for you today!

I&#039;ve been downsized twice with no warning, so I&#039;ve been there, and the second time put me in a financial bind, since I had recently purchased a house.  

After that I determined that I will work for myself and control my own destiny. :-)]]></description>
