Hey Nicole, THANK YOU for this. It&#039;s nice to hear that you consider how the other side is feeling. I hope more recruiters follow suit!  I&#039;ve had some very comfortable interviews in the past and can tell you that I open up WAY more when the people asking questions are understanding, welcoming, and &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people!  Thank you again :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many years ago I interviewed for a job with a different company than where I was. It was a panel interview with about 4 people on it, and it was intimidating. For one of the questions that I was answering, the person I would be reporting to interrupted me and said ‘I don’t think you understand the question’ and went on to repeat it. The way she went about it was very rude. For me it was insight into her personality and I realized I didn’t want to work for someone like that. For them it may have been my nail in the coffin for a job it turned out I wasn’t that interested in.

I am a Recruiter now and I carry that experience into all of my interviews I conduct. I try my best to  make people welcome and comfortable and treat it as more of a conversation than a high pressure situation. I find most people do give honest answers in this setting instead.]]></description>

Glad to hear you think some interview questions are dumb too. Why ask questions that you already know the answer to (or know people are going to stretch the truth with)?... 

I agree that putting more thought into the questions will bring out better and more transparent answers :). Thanks for sharing, Chris!]]></description>

Must be hard to hide your feelings when speaking to new recruits... especially after years of experience in the role and feeling burnt out. I can see it&#039;s a tough situation.

Glad to hear your road accident wasn&#039;t worse! And that you have a flexible and understanding workplace!]]></description>

When I was a teenager I thought good marks in school meant good marks in real life too. I guess I didn&#039;t know any better.

You&#039;re right though -- interviews are just as much about reading how the managers act and talk as they are watching and hearing you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In one of my first interviews, they asked me where I wanted to be in 5 years and I told them I&#039;d love to own a bakery. This information was, and is still true. However, it was in no way the answer they were looking for. and not only was the rest of the interview brief and awkward but I certainly did not hear back from this company, who specialized in installing Christmas decorations. Whoops!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been interviewing on and off for about a year now. Some of the questions are so stupid, I hate to say this. Like rate yourself on a scale of one to 10 with (insert random skillset here). Do you lie and say &quot;oh, 8 of course!&quot; or are you honest and say &quot;sorry, only a 2 with this one.&quot; Do they really want to hear a truthful answer or do they want to convince themselves that you are in fact an &quot;8.&quot; Maybe they should have put more effort into structuring a really good question for you instead? Another one, where do you see yourself in 5 years? I mean, seriously lol, first of all, hardly anybody stays at a job for more than 2 years anymore because they want to advance, make more money, learn a new skill, and staying someplace for 5 years can be a coffin nail In your career if the company just wants to keep you in the same spot. Another one I was asked recently, &quot;How do you feel about telling the truth?&quot; Omg, I kid you not. Of course, you say yes, but what if you want to take a sick day because you are burnt out and not really sick? Do you lie? Everyone lies, it&#039;s just a part of being human. Most lies are harmless, other lies, not so much. So, do I lie? I try not to, but, sometimes, it&#039;s difficult not to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The part about not telling the whole truth on the hiring side....I was trying to change roles and the rest of the team was gone. I was over worked &#038; didn&#039;t like the role anymore. I didn&#039;t fib that is was amazing, but I couldn&#039;t tell interviewees how unhappy I was, or I&#039;d never be replaced and move to the new role. Due to being there a while, and normal change over, I&#039;d trained 2 other teams of people, who had moved on. I&#039;d liked the job &#038; role at some point but was outgrowing it.

As the interviewee, I think there&#039;s a fine line to not get over your head, claiming to be an expert in something they expect you to do as soon as you start, and not being overly honest. Just like any relationship, there&#039;s the investment of time to know each other. After working there a while your 5 times late answer with your reasoning would have likely been better received when they knew you weren&#039;t late so you were thinking of extreme circumstances.  

A few years ago, it was only a light snow &#038; I skidded off the road. Due to major accidents on bigger roads, good luck getting a tow truck. I am still grateful to this day for a crew/ van of guys who got me back on the road. I&#039;d given myself extra time, checked the traffic etc. I am also thankful that I had a job that needed me there the 8 hours to do a job, but didn&#039;t require a specific start time. I am honest with bosses that especially as my current role has plenty of computer work, I&#039;m not risking my life in bad weather.

Happy Friday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Come on Joel! It&#039;s interviewing, not getting a good mark at school.
In your interviewer&#039;s case, her reaction is actually telling a lot about her more than about you. Not flexible, not understanding, unwilling to listen, probably hard to work for. If the candidate has other interviews, she lost points there.
Sure it might land you a job. A job you&#039;re happy in and prosper in... unlikely.]]></description>
