I know! We got super lucky with finding the place we did - was a solid $400-$1,000 less from everything else. So crazy how much it all costs, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s hysterical that your kid ordered a toy through Amazon Echo!  We both laughed over that story.

You are paying so little for day care!!!!  We pay $1500/month for a baby, and it goes down to $1200 when he gets older.  And that&#039;s heavily subsidized by work, like almost $1000!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those tupperware containers are the only way to go. We have used them in every move and then we stack them up in a storage closet for next time. We move a lot. Haha!]]></description>

Nice work! I admire you for that!

And totally agree - housing can be AWESOME to own for sure. Especially if you do your due diligence and wait until the right one comes along/etc/etc... If I happen to find a steal one day and also in the mood to try it out again, I just might. 

I think it&#039;s important to know whether you&#039;ll be living in the same spot for a while or not too. Just in the past 3 years we&#039;ve lived in 3 different places which of course is NOT ideal to home ownership. So that&#039;s also an important factor to consider for all others reading this right now.]]></description>

Awww, haha.... yeah some of them are the worst. We didn&#039;t deal with any of that nonsense other than the slowness, but def. looking into flat rate next time (if there is a next time!) for sure. I don&#039;t know how easy they are to come by but hopefully there&#039;s at least a couple to choose from!]]></description>

Luckily we can change our positions anytime we want to :) There may be a time I own again in the future, but for now we&#039;re good so we roll down that avenue... I&#039;ll never say never again with this type of stuff cuz life is always changing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand why you prefer renting to owning, but it can be a boon to own. I got a great deal on my house and have already paid It off.  The hose is worth $100k more than I paid for it too. The amount of maintenance that would have to occur would have to be $15k a year to make it better to rent for me.  I&#039;m aiming to retire by 55, and being mortgage free really helps me do that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I envy your mentality toward change! Me dealing with a potential move is overwhelming just at the thought. Kudos!

I own my home but would much rather be a renter. I agree with you that there is no right or wrong answer to that. I just would prefer calling someone else to deal with a problem as opposed to me dealing with it (and paying for it).]]></description>
