					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to J$ and Stack-On! YAY! When I get the safe delivered I&#039;ll send you a note and an inventory of what I put in it, so we can keep this convo going. I&#039;ve been really inspired by this to get my files and important paperwork together, and also inspired by so many of these ideas. (Like, we have survival cards but my husband carries them in his wallet -- except for when we get on airplanes, so then they get taken out and left in a drawer somewhere. Whomp whomp. I&#039;ll find them and put them in the safe!). Woot!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the suggestion of the home inventory; we&#039;ve definitely talked about doing that before! Although we&#039;re pretty anti-gun, we inherited a number of them when my husband&#039;s dad passed. away. Locked up safe &#038; sound until he figures out what he wants to do with them in the long run!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/interesting-stuff-people-put-in-their-safes/#comment-279251&quot;&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ll see if I can get a copy of it for you :)

&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Here you go! Scanned in copy of the obituary --&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/jack-william-bullington-obituary.jpg&quot;&gt;Jack William Bullington&lt;/a&gt;

And then here is the backstory :)

*****

I am pretty sure I encountered this obituary during a free trial subscription I had to the Seattle Times in college.  I loved reading all the sections of the paper and I never skipped the obituaries.   But this one - to Jack William Bullington from his wife Gayle - got me right in the feelers and I clipped it to save immediately.  

What I love about this obituary is that it is simply an ode to a good husband.  We know nothing about where Jack was born, his descendants (if he had any), his civic involvement, education, achievements or what he did for fun, though we can infer that he spent some time in the Navy from the photo his wife chose to feature.  We see this departed husband only through the lens of a woman who loved him dearly and who is overwhelmed with gratitude for the 42 years she was given with him on this earth.  Does it get any better than that?!

Now here&#039;s where I really get dramatic; I believe the late Mr. Bullington is partly to blame for why I am single today.  Because I have kept this obituary for the last 17 years (i.e. most of my adult life!), I have asked myself at various times in my life if I could write such an obituary about whomever I was with at the time.  I didn&#039;t just cut and run if the answer was &quot;no,&quot; but Gayle&#039;s ode to her husband has served as quite a powerful litmus test to use for a relationship check-in.  I find the notion of &quot;loving with integrity&quot; especially moving, as it is also a challenge for me in terms of how I show up in the lives of those I love (and not just in the romantic sense).  So I not only want to find someone who fits this ideal, I want to grow toward it myself.  

Since I first read this obituary, I have been married and divorced, with several relationships before and after, none of which passed the &quot;Jack Test.&quot;  But I believe there&#039;s a wrench for every nut in this world, even this one, so we&#039;ll see what the future holds!

Anyway, this is why the obituary lives in my fireproof safe now.  It represents a dream and a challenge for continued growth.  And it&#039;s just so freaking BEAUTIFUL!]]></description>
