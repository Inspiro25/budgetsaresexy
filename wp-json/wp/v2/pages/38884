This guide will break everything down so you can get started.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why Choose a Side Hustle?<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who doesn't want to bring in extra cash? Everyone will have a different idea of what extra income means for them and their family, but one thing is for sure -- successful side hustles create a path to financial freedom.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you're making a few hundred extra bucks a month to pay off your car, or a few thousand extra a month so you can quit your day job, side hustles let you build your finances and create a life with more control and self-reliance.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potential benefits of side hustles:<\/span>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple sources of income<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ability to pay off debt<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boosted savings for emergencies<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial independence<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased self-reliance<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achieve financial freedom<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max out investment accounts<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibility of creating passive income<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chance to explore new career possibilities<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the perks of having extra money in your pocket (woooo!), side hustles can also let you explore your passions or try out new skills. If you're not stoked about your day job but need the steady paycheck, there's no reason you can't begin to build your dream job on the side.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That's the beauty of side hustles ... they can be whatever you want them to be. They can be an opportunity for a little extra money or the possibility of creating a new full-time job that you love and feel good about.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side hustles are what you make them, and they're only as successful as what you put into them. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustles-couples\/\">Side hustles for couples<\/a> are also becoming increasingly popular, working hand in hand with your life partner!<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Much Money Can I Make?<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There's a limitless potential for extra cash depending on the side hustle you choose and the work that you're willing to put into it.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extra money you make really comes down to the type of side business you start or get involved in and how hard you're side hustling. It's ultimately up to you. Make $100 a month as a weekend delivery driver or $5,000 a month as a virtual assistant -- the choice is yours. Or hit the jackpot by developing a side hustle that brings in passive income!<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Starting Your Own Side Hustle Business<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you go all in on hustlin\u2019, be clear why you\u2019re doing it. What goal are you trying to achieve? Is it to pay down debt? Is it to be able to afford more vacations? Maybe it's so you can work from home while taking care of your littles. Whatever the reason, this is your \"why.\"<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your \"why\" is important because it will help you decide what type of side hustle idea to go with, and it will serve as your motivation to keep going and building even when things get tough.<\/span>\n\n<strong>Figure out your \"why\" and post it somewhere (or everywhere!) so it can be a constant reminder of the reason you're starting this new adventure.<\/strong>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you've found your motivation, consider your passions and your skills. If you're going to be working on your side hustle while also handling a full-time job, it's best to choose something you're passionate about, especially if you have some skills to back it up.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working a side hustle will take a lot of hard work and may require odd hours. If you choose something you're passionate about, it will be easier to keep the momentum going without experiencing burnout.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Make a list of your passions and skills and decide which ones would be the most lucrative.<\/strong> Make sure there's a real need for the work you plan to do. For example, let's say you have a passion for writing and marketing. You can offer freelance writing services to local businesses. You could also take your business online and expand to offer virtual assistant services.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what kind of hustle you decide to pursue, prepare yourself to put in some work. You may have to make sacrifices, especially if you're also working a full-time job. Working on your side hustle may mean waking up extra early or staying up late, missing time with family and friends, or skipping the latest Netflix series that everyone else is binging.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sacrificing doesn't mean you have to abandon your social life completely, but you'll have to be strict with yourself and use your time wisely.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Define Your Business Plan<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you've determined the right side hustle, it's time to create your business plan and get the ball rolling.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide on your goals for your side hustle, and make them specific. Broad goals, such as \"make extra money,\" aren't actionable. There's no way to track your progress without clearly defined goals. A more concrete goal would be something like \"earn $1,000 by [date].\"<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a goal like that, you can easily track your progress and see whether you've achieved your goal, surpassed your goal, or how far away you were from reaching your goal. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2021-financial-goal-setting-and-the-fresh-start-theory\/\">Setting a goal<\/a> like this one will also help you figure out how many clients you need to acquire or sales you will need to make per month, week, or day based on your product or service price.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide how much time per week you can devote to your side hustle, and create a schedule to stick to. It's easy to get distracted when you work for yourself. Set a schedule, so you don't find yourself prioritizing other duties during the time dedicated to your side hustle. You'll never make progress if you don't manage your time.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have 10 available hours per week to work on your side hustle, schedule them out weekly. Tell yourself that you're dedicating the hours of 6 to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday to working on your business. Write down your schedule, and keep it next to your \"why.\"<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pursue any necessary training required for starting your business. If you need to brush up on your skills, take the time to do so. Set up your social media and website, if necessary. If you need to learn some particular business skills first, do your research or take a course and get it done.<\/span>\n\n<strong>(Just don't get caught up in the education trap! Many people will get stuck here thinking they need just a bit more training, and you can easily find more and more areas you want to get better in. Don't procrastinate for the sake of education.)<\/strong>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You'll probably never feel completely ready to get started. You can easily get stuck in the planning stages. It's essential to lay down a good foundation, but it's impossible to perfect your business before you even get started.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most skills need real-world experience to hone them properly. You'll feel better prepared with each client you serve or each sale you make. Remember that it won't always be as scary as it is in the beginning. There will always be more to learn and more ways to improve, but that shouldn't keep you from getting started.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also remember that your business plan isn't set in stone. Once you get started, you'll be able to see what's working and what could use adjustments. As a business owner, it's best to do an analysis at least every quarter to identify opportunities, problem areas, and continue to grow.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">How to Find and Apply for Local Side Hustles<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're just looking to make a little extra money and don't mind partly working for someone else, you can get started right away.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a car and you're looking for a side hustle that requires no startup costs, there are many delivery app jobs services you can apply for like, DoorDash or Grubhub.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to find other side hustle jobs in your area:<\/span>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out if any local businesses have part-time jobs available<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search for a local side gig in your area on Craigslist<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for a service like Steady, Dave, Gigwalk, or SideHusl<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post your skills and services on social media<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these platforms will provide you with one-off side gigs to bring in a little extra cash or more lucrative side hustles, like virtual assistant or social media manager positions, based on your particular skills and experience.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Is That Side Hustle Legit or a Scam?<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an opportunity seems too easy and sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be on the lookout for signs that a side hustle opportunity is really a scam in disguise.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most well-known companies will be safe, but be wary of companies you come across online or otherwise that you haven't heard of.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers commonly use mystery shopper job listings and survey sites to scam people out of money and provide you no real work. There are, of course, some real opportunities in these categories, but be careful.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a side gig requires you to deposit a check and immediately send part of the money back, be cautious. Mystery shopping gigs will sometimes make this request, and it's almost always a scam. The money you send back comes from your account, and the bank eventually figures out that the original check was fraudulent.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a side gig requires you to pay a membership fee to receive work, do your research first. Some companies, like survey companies, will take your membership fee and then never send you surveys or send you so few of them that you don't even recoup your fees, much less make a profit.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don't do work for free, either. If a freelance opportunity requires you to write or produce a free sample project before being accepted, make sure they're legit before you send them anything. Some people will take advantage of you by taking your sample and using it, and then you never hear from them again about real work.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people choose network marketing with a multi-level marketing (MLM) company as their side hustle. While there are legitimate MLM companies that you can make a real profit with, if you put in the work, there are scams out there, too. Do your research. If an MLM company puts more focus on acquiring new sellers than they do on acquiring customers for their products, they're a pyramid scheme and nothing more.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you choose to work with an established company for your side hustle, be cautious and make sure it's the real deal. Try to speak to others who already work with the company. Look carefully at the company's website and social media pages. Also you can search through trusted bloggers' websites that have lists of services they have tried personally.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steer clear of gigs that require you to pay for training or equipment, especially if they aren't a well-known company. If they hire you too quickly or don't seem to care much about your experience, training, or skills, it's a red flag. Avoid working for a company where there won't be a paper trail. Trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Check Local Laws and Regulations<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're forming your own business as your side hustle, find out if you need to acquire any licenses or permits before you begin so you don't get in trouble with your local or state government. Consider forming an LLC so you'll be protected from personal liability for business debts.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be careful when starting a side hustle while you're working a day job. Ensure your side hustle isn't a conflict of interest that could get you fired or in legal trouble. If you choose a side hustle that targets the same clients or customers as your full-time job, this could create a problem.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're considering starting a side hustle related to your full-time job, make sure you haven't signed a non-compete agreement. Don't steal trade secrets from current or former employers or use the resources or working hours of your full-time job to work on your side hustle.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure there are no restrictions for having a side job in the contract for your day job. You don't want your new side hustle to jeopardize your full-time job or get you into legal trouble.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Do You Have to Pay Taxes on Your Side Hustle Money?<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All income through the year is subject to taxes and must be reported, <strong>even if it's just a small amount of extra income from a side hustle.<\/strong> When you're employed, your employer reports your income and shares some of the income tax burden.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a self-employed side hustler, you must report the side hustle income yourself and pay self-employment taxes. Make sure to set aside some of your extra cash to pay the IRS at tax time. If you're not sure how much to set aside, a good rule of thumb is about 25% to 30%.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IRS also wants their tax payments throughout the year, and that's why income tax comes out of every paycheck you receive from an employer.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the taxable income you make from your side hustle is over a certain amount, you may be required to pay quarterly payments of estimated taxes to the IRS. If this is the case, you can be slammed with a penalty payment at tax time if you didn't make your payments on time.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a general rule, if you think you'll earn at least $1,000 for the year, you'll need to pay quarterly estimated taxes. As an alternative, if you have a side hustle but still work at your day job, you can choose to have extra taxes withheld from your check by your employer, so you're covered for your side hustle. The IRS has a handy tax withholding calculator to help you decide how much of an adjustment to do.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For any expenses that you plan to claim, make sure to keep reliable records and receipts. The IRS may ask for proof that you really did buy $1,000 in equipment for your side business. If you have no records, there could be some trouble. Keeping records can be as simple as designating a folder for receipts or getting a digital record-keeping system. Whatever you choose, just make sure you're staying on top of it.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make this easier, you can open a separate business or regular checking account just for your side hustle. Doing so will make it simpler to track your extra income and expenses from your side hustle when it comes to tax time.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When in doubt, hire a tax professional, so you know you're doing it right.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Know When to Call It Quits<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side hustles aren't always easy extra money. They're hard work. That's why it's so important to choose something you're passionate about, so you avoid burnout.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If side hustling has become a drain that you're genuinely not enjoying, don't be afraid to quit. Take it as a lesson learned on the path to discovering what you'd like to do and what you're passionate about in life.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">How to Make Your Side Hustle a Full-Time Job<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may know from the second you start your side hustle that you want it to become your full-time job. That's great, but don't expect to start side hustling and be able to quit your day job right away. Everyone's heard stories of people who were able to do this, but that's not the norm. If you get started and see your business take off immediately, that's one thing (yeehaw), but don't expect it happen so fast.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work hard on your side hustle, but make sure you view it for what it is so you don't get disappointed if it takes a while to grow. <strong>It's a side hustle, meant to supplement income, allow you an avenue for pursuing your passions, and enable you to develop new skills.<\/strong> Dream big, but you'll also have to start small. In most cases, it's going to take a lot of hard work and time to build it up to a full-time job if that's what you want to do.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if it takes a while, take pride in the fact that you're investing in your future and building the life you desire. Let it fuel you when you're working late hours after a day at your full-time job.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re ready to turn your side hustle into your full-time job, make sure you check at least a few boxes before you put in your resignation letter. Make sure you're receiving steady cash flow from your side hustle, not inconsistent bits here and there.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good goal is to aim to be earning, at the least, 75% of what you make at your day job. Try to have at least six to eight months' worth of personal and business expenses saved up as a cushion if things don't work out as planned.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are setbacks or it feels like it's taking a long time to build, remember your \"why,\" your motivation for starting your side hustle. The sacrifices you have to make and the long hours you have to put in will all be worth it when you focus on the reason you set out on this adventure.<\/span>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Time to Start Hustlin\u2019!<\/h2>\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you're considering a side hustle to make extra money or because you want to start a business while you still have full-time income coming in, the best time to start is now. Most people who have successful side hustle businesses all say the same thing -- they wish they would have started sooner!<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting a side hustle isn't a track to easy extra money. It's hard work. It will require sacrifices, learning new skills, and potentially late nights and early morning work hours. But a side hustle is something you do for yourself, to help you build the life you want -- so have faith in yourself, find your \"why,\" and get to work!<\/span>\n<a name=\"ideas\"><\/a>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n\n\n--><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">80+ Real-life Side Hustle Ideas:<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alright, without further ado&#8230; Here&#8217;s our side hustle series of all the stories we&#8217;ve shared on this site over the past 15 years.

She\u2019s taken her expert knowledge on minimalist living and found a way to share it with others via an online product. The best part: There\u2019s no upper limit on your passive income opportunity here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great side hustle if you want to build something once and keep the cash coming in over and over and over &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #80: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-pet-waste-removal-aka-pooper-scooper\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cleaning Up Poop!<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($60-$80\/hr)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get paid to be a professional pooper scooper.

You can make extra money flipping high-fashion clothes and handbags. This side hustler lives in an affluent area and discovered she could buy name-brand cast-offs at local thrift stores &#8212; many just one season old &#8212; and re-sell them on eBay for a nice profit. She says the trick is to find trendy cuts by popular designers, so if you know what those are, maybe you can hustle your way toward affording those yourself. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #10: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-a-mystery-shopper\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mystery Shopper<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($200-$500\/mo)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hey, shopaholics, you <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get paid to shop: Companies hire anonymous shoppers to shop in their stores. This helps them better understand their customers\u2019 experiences. You have to take lots of notes and deal with your taxes, and it\u2019s very low pay at first &#8230; but this hustler shares some tricks on increasing your income. Sign up at MysteryShop.org.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #9: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-an-etsy-seller\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etsy Seller<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($50-$100\/mo)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many crafters have turned their hobby into an extra income stream by selling their projects on Etsy. This entrepreneur shares how she got started selling jewelry on Etsy and what to expect when you\u2019re just starting out (it\u2019s slow going but worth it if you love crafting).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #8: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-i-write-meal-plans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meal Plan Helper<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($5-$8\/mo per client)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This entrepreneur found a way to make extra money from a task her family was already doing: creating healthy meal plans. Once she realized that meal-planning isn\u2019t something everyone has time to do for themselves, she built an online business around it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #7: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-a-gun-permit-instructor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gun Permit Instructor<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(&#8220;decent chunk&#8221;)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s another (very different) example of turning a hobby into a business. After this hustler and his friend took training to get a permit to carry a pistol, they figured they could provide a better training experience. After getting several teaching certifications, they launched their own in-person business that teaches people what they need to know about legally carrying a gun.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #6: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-a-house-cleaner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">House Cleaner<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($1,000\/mo)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, scrubbing toilets will never be sexy, but the extra money you can get from it is very $exy. Here\u2019s how one self-starter went into the cleaning business for herself and makes about a grand a month (and gets exercise while she works). This side hustle has low start-up costs, and unlike some other gigs, there\u2019s no downtime that you end up not getting paid for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #5: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-a-craps-dealer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Craps Dealer<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(&#8220;good&#8221;)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dealing craps at corporate events or holiday parties is a fun side hustle that works well if you have a regular 9-to-5 job. Most of this event-based work comes in December, so it\u2019s not a good option if you need additional income year-round &#8212; although you can also work at casinos during the rest of the year. Watch for ads from event companies saying they\u2019ll train you at craps (or blackjack or roulette!).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #4: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-a-babysitter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Babysitter<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($30-$45\/sitting)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the young at heart who like kiddos, playtime, and toddler snacks, consider providing childcare to a local family. Get the word out about your babysitting availability on Craigslist or Sittercity and at places of worship. Getting a background check can help you stand out from the crowd and put potential clients\u2019 minds at ease. Bonus: You can learn a lot of life lessons from little people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #3: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-a-live-in-landlord\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Live-In Landlord<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(free graduate school!)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This hustler rented out two spare bedrooms in his home, and the income allowed him to pay for graduate school without taking out any student loans. As he put it, \u201cthis really isn\u2019t a skill, it\u2019s more like an asset that is not being utilized to its fullest potential.\u201d So if you\u2019ve ever thought about &#8212; and hesitated &#8212; renting your space on Airbnb, here\u2019s a story about the power of using all your available assets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hustle #2: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-series-im-a-restaurant-server\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Restaurant Server<\/a> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($100\/shift)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hustling as a waiter or waitress can really pad your budget and has the added benefit of free exercise &#8212; this waitress walks at least 5 miles on a busy night.
