That way anyone can follow along here easier and hopefully join in and save too!<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to the series, it&#8217;s my new mentality of challenging the &#8220;norm&#8221; and getting my expenses as low as possible without sacrificing quality of life. Every month I focus on a new bill or expense that has been status quo for years &#8211; or even decades (damn) &#8211; to determine what&#8217;s truly important <em>now<\/em> in my life.

The reason is that every permanent drop in your spending has a double effect: it increases the amount of money you have left over to save each month, and it permanently decreases the amount you\u2019ll need every month for the rest of your life.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That last line stopped me in my tracks: &#8220;it permanently decreases the amount you\u2019ll need every month for the rest of your life.&#8221; This hit me hard, especially now that I\u2019ve come to realize <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/02\/number-needed-retire-safely\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retiring early hinges heavily on your monthly expenses<\/a>.

Satellite TV &#8211; reduced by $15 ($60 down to $45) by switching to a lower package that still has our preferred TV channels, but I am working on convincing the wife to drop completely :)<\/p>\n<p>2. Cell phone &#8211; reduced by $90 ($160 down to $70) by switching my phone line to Republic Wireless $10 plan and moving my wife to a single line plan with Verizon ($60) &#8211; I am trying my hardest to stick to the $10 Republic plan but may have to go to the $25 plan whenever we go out of town away from my usual wireless networks.<\/p>\n<p>3. Internet &#8211; reduced by $25 ($55 down to $30) by doing a quick online chat with a representative to ask them how I can lower my monthly payment because I have noticed another competitor offering lower cost\/higher speed.

However, your Challenge Everything series was always in the back of my mind, so in August I opened another savings account (Thanks, Capital One 360!) and deposited a check from Ebates in there. Since August, I haven&#8217;t done any bill-challenging&#8230; All I&#8217;ve done is transfer any unexpected money into the account &#8211; Craigslist sales, Ebates, a refund from the city for unknowingly overpaying our water bill, Christmas cash, etc. Most of it has been &lt;$50 increments at a time.<\/p>\n<p>I checked it this morning and realized we&#8217;d hit the $1,000 mark&#8230;basically without lifting a finger.<\/p>\n<p>First, I wanted to thank you for the inspiration! That&#8217;s $1000 that would&#8217;ve just unknowingly slipped through our fingers in the last five months, even being pretty hands-on with our finances. Second, I just wanted to encourage anyone who feels like their life is pretty lean and their finances in check&#8230; there are always unaccounted for dollars. Don&#8217;t get complacent and always hold yourself accountable!
