As a result, I&#8217;ve had the best money year ever. You guys help me keep my eye on the ball. Thanks for all you do. May God&#8217;s peace be with you!!!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>&#8220;J. has been inspiring me for months. It was a Money Show\/Afford Anything podcast episode that inspired me to start blogging &#8211; J\u2019s advice was to just start writing and write everyday. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. More importantly, Jay challenged me to FINALLY calculate my net worth. I had been avoiding this because I assumed I was deep in the red, but it turns out I\u2019m worth more (financially) than I thought!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>&#8220;J, First off I\u2019d like to say thanks for all the work you do. Thanks to the money show podcast my life has turned 180 degrees. I went from overspending, underinvesting, and accumulating debt to being in a strong financial position. In less than 1 year since discovering the show and the FI community both my significant other and I have paid off all our debt (totaled $49,000), put away over 6 months in emergency savings each, and now comfortably save\/invest over 53% of our income. I grew up in poverty so I hope you know that having others to learn fiscal responsibility from makes a world of difference to people like myself. My life will forever be improved thanks to the resources I\u2019ve found such as bloggers\/podcasters like yourself!&#8221; &#8211; B.K.<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>&#8220;Your and Paula&#8217;s podcast was recommended to me from someone in a financial Facebook group I am a part of and I have learned so much from just listening to the first couple of episodes. I am still a bit of a novice in the area of finance (great at saving, debt management and budgeting but not so much in investing) but you have inspired me to work towards both financial independence and using my degrees to work for projects that I am passionate about as an entrepreneur. Thank you for what you do.&#8221; &#8211; Mia<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>&#8220;Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for the Afford Anything Podcast. I started binge-listening to it a few weeks ago from episode 1.

You guys are incredible- I remember you mentioning that you love hearing how people found you. I get that you decided to hop off that podcast train, but it was great listening in on your conversations with Paula. You guys offer so much wisdom!! Since listening, I\u2019ve opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard in one of their Target Retirement Funds. I also got real clear on which services I can offer as a side-hustle: freelance writing (I\u2019ve actually already gotten paid to write multiple times so I\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t pursue this sooner *facepalm*). Thanks for always dropping so much of your knowledge!&#8221; &#8211; Peter<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>&#8220;Started these podcasts lately. Loved the Money show. Finished the podcast series until, until&#8230; the episode where Jay left. That took me a week. I was addicted to the show by Paula and Jay. I was listening while commuting, at the gym, everywhere I could. You both did a wonderful job to keep us entertained and also provide value at the same time.&#8221; &#8211; Sanjay<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>&#8220;Dude, I found you through the early episodes of the Afford Anything podcast, but have totally enjoyed reading your blogs. You slay me with the way you write. I feel lucky to have J. Money in my ear when I&#8217;m reading, because you totally write like you talk!
