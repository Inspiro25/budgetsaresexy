It explains how Budgets Are Sexy collects, use and safeguards your personal data. By using the sites and providing us with personal data you are consenting to our processing data in the United States and under its laws.<\/p>\n<p>While we do our best to protect your personal information, Budgets Are Sexy cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. What does all of this mean? Just as in the investing world, you must protect yourself. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password and\/or account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online, especially when using a computer that other people can use also or if you are on an unsecured network.<\/p>\n<p>Many of our advertisers or partners, such as brokerages, merchants, or data providers, link from our site to areas on their own sites where they sell their own products and services.

On occasion, we may also ask you for other personal information in connection with surveys, contests or other promotional offers running on our site, but again, your participation in these features is purely voluntary.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>1.2 Information we collect about you from using our site:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>While on our site, we automatically log certain information about how you\u2019re using our site.
