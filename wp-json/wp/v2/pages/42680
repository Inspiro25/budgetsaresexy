NO MORE STUFF!). We&#8217;ve been going for months now, and have since made hundreds of dollars while freeing up the mind&#8230; It&#8217;s SO much easier than trying to sell a whole bunch of crap all at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>You can see our main experiment page here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/craigslist-selling-rule\/\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly Craigslist Rule<\/a><br \/>\nAnd here&#8217;s how much we&#8217;ve earned so far: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/craigslist-money-tracker\/\" target=\"_blank\">$1,127.67<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Let&#8217;s See How Much <em>Digit<\/em> Saves Me!<\/h2>\n<p>This is one of the easiest of them all as it requires absolutely no effort once it&#8217;s set up. All I did was sign up to my new favorite financial company out there, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\" target=\"_blank\">Digit<\/a>, and now every few days it xfers over a few bucks into my account based on what it&#8217;s algorithm thinks I can safely save without noticing.

Capping my record at a respectable 29 months, and freeing up my time to be spent more wisely ;) It was a fun experiment while it lasted!<\/p>\n<p>You can see the running total of everything spent here: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/ultimate-baby-child-costs-tracker\/\" target=\"_blank\">Baby Costs Tracker<\/a><br \/>\nAnd the final summary and category breakdown here: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/03\/how-much-babies-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Grand Finale &#8211; $28,185.49<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Operation Mortgage Pay Off<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A few years ago I had the urge to purge our mortgages once and for all and become completely debt-free. We had a surge of income for a nice period of time, and I figured if we plowed an extra $2,000 against them every month we could get rid of one of our biggest expenses and live scott-free forever! I mean, who doesn&#8217;t want to shed their mortgages or rent?? Well, we did great for a solid 18 months or so knocking out a cool $35,000, but sadly times changed and it didn&#8217;t make sense anymore to continue. We were starting to make room for a new baby in the household, and we knew we didn&#8217;t want to live there forever. So we hit pause, moved out (it&#8217;s now a rental property by default), and now just pay an extra $150+ towards it every month by <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/debt-paying-tip-round-up-payments\/\" target=\"_blank\">rounding up the payments<\/a>. We didn&#8217;t make it past the finish line, but at least we got $35k of debt knocked off!

I wanted to roll it over into my own accounts over at USAA instead of left tied to my company who later went out of business and screwed me (fun times!), but I didn&#8217;t know *what funds* exactly to roll them into. So similarly to other experiments I enjoy doing, I decided to break up my $180,000 into <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-401k-ira-test\/\" target=\"_blank\">three separate traditional IRA accounts<\/a> and then track its performance.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first was invested into a portfolio that USAA recommended, but didn&#8217;t manage<\/li>\n<li>The second was invested into a portfolio that USAA recommended, but DID manage &#8211; with only USAA funds in it<\/li>\n<li>And the last $60k was invested into a portfolio that USAA recommended, managed, but had both USAA funds <em>and<\/em> outside funds included in it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At first it was a close call, but after three years of leaving it alone (and, quite frankly, being too lazy to move all the money over), we had a clear winner. Want to guess which one? :) The portfolio I left alone and wasn&#8217;t actively managed. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/net-worth-update-april-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\">Here were the final results:<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>IRA #1<\/b> (NOT Managed): $79,141.43<i><br \/>\n<\/i><\/li>\n<li><b>IRA #2<\/b> (Managed, USAA funds only): $73,199.26<\/li>\n<li><b>IRA #3<\/b> (Managed, ALL different funds): $74,024.92<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can learn more about this experiment here: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-401k-ira-test\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Ultimate IRA Test<\/a>. I eventually dumped them all into a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\">single Vanguard account<\/a> which finally streamlined everything and became MUCH more efficient. It was a fun experiment to say the least though&#8230; And the folks at USAA had a good kick out of it too. Well, most of them ;)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>12 Months of <em>Love Drop<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In 2010 I sucked about giving back, so I partnered up with a philanthropy buddy of mine (<a href=\"http:\/\/natestpierre.me\" target=\"_blank\">Nate St. Pierre<\/a>) and together we challenged ourselves to affect one family&#8217;s life every month for the entire 2011 year. We built a site around &#8220;micro-giving&#8221; (if thousands of people only donated a dollar we could make a big impact in someone&#8217;s life!), and traveled across the country showing up on peoples&#8217; doorsteps to &#8220;drop the love&#8221; our community put together for them. Each of these &#8220;drops&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovedrop.us\/past-drops\" target=\"_blank\">were filmed<\/a>, along with the story on why we chose to help these families, and we then shared them back with our community to show them the power of their generosity. After all, it&#8217;s one thing to donate a few bucks, but a whole other to watch the faces of the recipient receiving it!<\/p>\n<p>It was hard to pull off month after month, but we completed the mission and when all was said and done Love Drop had raised <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovedrop.us\/total\" target=\"_blank\">over $90,000<\/a> of goods and services (and money) for our 12 families, and it&#8217;ll be a project we&#8217;ll never forget. The highlight was when a recipient of these gifts later turned around to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovedrop.us\/blog\/our-1st-drop-recipient-starts-her-own-love-drops\" target=\"_blank\">launch her own version<\/a> of Love Drop to pay it forward :) Little acts of kindness can be powerful in life!<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/g_3f6Sy-F-c?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>You can check out the entire site here: <a href=\"http:\/\/LoveDrop.us\" target=\"_blank\">LoveDrop.us<\/a><br \/>\nAnd what our community did for each of our 12 families here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovedrop.us\/total\" target=\"_blank\">Love Drop Recap<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>The $2.00 Savings Experiment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This was when I realized that the more $2.00 bills I came across, the more I ended up saving because I never wanted to spend them! So I started a &#8220;rule&#8221; that every time I passed a bank I had to go in and &#8220;buy&#8221; whatever $2.00 bills the teller had at that time. Sometimes I&#8217;d walk away with 3 or 4, and others 20. Over time my stash grew like crazy and it was definitely working, but then it got to the point that I didn&#8217;t want to have so much cash just laying around my house and not banked somewhere or invested :) So I ultimately stopped (I think I had $600 or $700 by the end?). If you&#8217;re having trouble holding onto money though and not spending it, def. give this idea a shot!<\/p>\n<p>You can read more about this trick here: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/two-dollar-bills-savings-trick\/\" target=\"_blank\">The $2.00 Bill Savings Trick<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>The $100 Lottery Experiment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In 2009 I was a big lottery ticket guy, and I couldn&#8217;t\u00a0 have asked for more entertainment out of those $1.00 scratchers ;) So I thought it would be fun to engage our readers here and pick up 100 tickets in one fowl swoop to see just how good the odds actually are. Up until this point I had done so-so with winning over the years (definitely more losing than winning, but not enough to deter me, haha&#8230;) and my guess was that I&#8217;d come out with $125 in my pockets afterwards. Was I correct? Well you&#8217;ll have to click to see, but a cool twist that came out of it was when readers decided to match my earnings and donate them to charity. So I ended up doing the same and we made a big ol&#8217; event out of it :) No one loses when the $$&#8217;s going to charity!<\/p>\n<p>The kick-off of the experiment: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/11\/100-scratch-off-lottery-project\/\" target=\"_blank\">The $100 Scratch-off Lottery Experiment<\/a><br \/>\nThe results of the $100 lottery experiment: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/11\/results-of-100-scratch-off-lottery\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Results&#8230;<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>The &#8220;No Spend&#8221; Challenge<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This was one of the first challenges I ever tried when I was ready to get serious with my money. I actually lasted over 40 days doing it over Lent, and it was a hard wake up call realizing I had a nasty habit of spending aimlessly at the mall and other stores without even realizing. I&#8217;ve since saved anywhere from $200-$300 a month scaling back these unnecessary shopping trips, and from that point forward I was cured :) The trick?

The idea was that I&#8217;d track every purchase I *didn&#8217;t buy* that I REALLY wanted to buy, which would in turn motivate me to keep spending less and saving more :) It would look something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flower oil painting: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$20.00<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Hand-painted table from Peru: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$40.00<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li>TOTAL SAVED: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$60.00<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those are literally the only two items I listed before I forgot about it.
