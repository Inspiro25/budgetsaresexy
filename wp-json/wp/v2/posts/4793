\u00a0We just went to the jewelry stores and looked for something that  appealed to us without even looking at price tags at first. \u00a0Every  jeweler asked us how much we were looking to spend and we simply  replied, &#8220;We&#8217;re just looking for something that we like.&#8221; \u00a0<em><strong>The best  strategy that worked for us was to shop for the ring first and then figure out the diamond specifics later<\/strong><\/em>. \u00a0The center diamond was going to account for the majority of the cost of the ring. \u00a0We found that most rings we liked, without the center diamond, ranged in price from the 1 to upper 2-thousand dollar range. \u00a0The center diamond ended up costing a few multiples of the actual ring.<\/p>\n<p>We shopped at many different jewelers, form the  national chain jewelers to the boutique jewelers. \u00a0It took us visits to  four different stores to really narrow things down. \u00a0One particular  store offered much more selection in the thinner bands that we were  looking for. \u00a0So, we went back to that store and asked to move onto the  next step of selecting the center diamond for the ring. \u00a0Many people know about the 4 C&#8217;s of ring shopping: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gia.edu\/lab-reports-services\/about-the-4cs\/index.html\">Clarity, Cut, Color and Carat<\/a>. \u00a0These are the most important factors in diamond  selection, but for those looking for some extra credit, it would help  to pay attention to another set of four criterion: Depth, Table, Ratio  and Girdle. \u00a0I&#8217;ll leave it up to Google to discuss all of those  parameters, but here is what mattered most to us: Carat and Color.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My fiance wanted to break into the 1 carat sizing of the diamond,  so that is what we did.<\/strong> Something like 1.04 carats. \u00a0Now, this is  where our financial sense kicked in. \u00a0We were willing to sacrifice on  the other 3 C&#8217;s to get a better price on the diamond. \u00a0If we wanted to get a diamond  with near perfect Color, Clarity and Cut, we could have easily added  thousands of dollars to the price tag. \u00a0We were shown a set of diamonds  and ended up selecting the one diamond that had a  better Color rating, but less Clarity than the other diamonds. \u00a0Our  reasoning was that you can notice the better color rating with the naked  eye much more than an imperfection within the diamond.<\/p>\n<h2>Blood Diamonds vs. Canadian Diamonds?<\/h2>\n<p>One more thing though, I wanted to be guaranteed that the diamond we selected would not be a &#8220;blood diamond.&#8221;  \u00a0There is this thing called the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kimberley_Process_Certification_Scheme\">Kimberley Process Certification Scheme<\/a> that is supposed to ensure that all diamonds are not conflict diamonds.  \u00a0But, I really don&#8217;t buy stock in that certification *scheme* because,  well, I just think it is a scheme and I&#8217;m a bit cynical. :) \u00a0So, I  shopped around.. I even found that companies were creating diamonds in  machines! \u00a0I first made sure that my girl would be ok with a man-made diamond,  because girls can be weird about these things. :) \u00a0So, after getting  the green light, I called one of those companies up and spoke with a  sales person for about 25 minutes asking questions about if the diamonds  they make are the same, molecularly, as natural diamonds (they are) and  if they could make white diamonds in 1 carat sizes. \u00a0Unfortunately,  they can&#8217;t make white diamonds in 1 carat sizes because of current  technical limitations. \u00a0But, one thing the sales guy said changed my  whole outlook on diamond shopping. \u00a0He said, &#8220;You should just go with a Canadian diamond until we can start making larger white diamonds.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I had no idea what he was talking about. \u00a0<em><strong>Canadian  diamonds?<\/strong><\/em> I didn&#8217;t even know diamonds came from Canada, but after some  more Googling, I found that Canada started mining diamonds in 1998 and  has a few diamond mines now. \u00a0Most importantly, Canada has the highest diamond  mining labor and environmental standards in the world, which is  something that I care about. \u00a0Diamonds that come from Canada are laser  inscribed with a goose logo which I try to locate every time we snuggle  up on the couch and watch TV, but still haven&#8217;t found. \u00a0Also interesting  is that Canadian diamonds have a predictable combination of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gemnation.com\/base?processor=getPage&amp;pageName=cut\">Depth, Table, Ratio  and Girdle<\/a> characteristics and are, on average, whiter in  color than African diamonds.<\/p>\n<h2>Voting with my money<\/h2>\n<p>So, back to the jewelry store, where I would be  &#8220;voting with my money,&#8221; I humbly requested that the jeweler present us  diamonds that were sourced from Canada. Our sales rep immediately stood  up and went to the back room and actually generated quite a buzz in the  store about the request. \u00a0She then went over to the phone and spoke  with a supplier who would ship some diamonds overnight for us to look  at. \u00a0In the end, we selected a Canadian diamond and had to wait about 6 weeks for our ring to be made in platinum and have the diamond set. \u00a0It was worth the wait!<\/p>\n<p>Now, we have another long wait until we finally tie the knot next year. :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>Who knew???\u00a0 Big ups to <strong>Jack<\/strong><\/em><em> for shooting this over &#8212; my brain was fried this morning and really thought this was an interesting one.\u00a0 Go Canada! :)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Guest post by Jack &#8211; a fellow Budgets Are Sexy reader!)
