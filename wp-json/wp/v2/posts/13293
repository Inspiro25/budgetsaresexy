Well, it matters only to your financial future and your work place happiness. How will you climb the ladder or become more successful in this economic environment without being a star? You have to be someone who makes the whole team better. Someone, as the saying goes, who is better than the sum of his parts&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>The Dead End: You Or The Job<\/h2>\n<p>I have had the pleasure of hiring and working with lots&#8217;a folks over my 30 years owning a business, and have been on the boards of companies\/organizations with hundreds of employees. And yet it still amazes me how many people think they&#8217;re under-appreciated and under-paid.<\/p>\n<p>We have met the enemy, though, and we are it! We have the unlimited capacity to be self-delusional. You know who YOU would rather work with, but does anyone ever think that you&#8217;re THAT person???<\/p>\n<p>Those that get ahead the quickest have a few basic skills in common. The old saying &#8211; <strong><em>common sense isn&#8217;t very common<\/em><\/strong> &#8211; has been repeated trillions of times &#8217;cause it&#8217;s true!<\/p>\n<h2>Ten Tips To Success<\/h2>\n<p>What are a few basic tips for you to take to work tomorrow that will make you a better employee?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Show up with a smile!<\/strong> Show up with a smile! Show up with a smile! A sense of (appropriate) humor will get you a corner office or promotion quicker than a snark or cynic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t be the first out the door!<\/strong> No, I&#8217;m not <em>just sayin<\/em> you have to be a workaholic with no family life. But don&#8217;t let your mind\/focus beat <strong>you<\/strong> home.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t bring your problems to work-<\/strong>and if you do- remember number 1! Fake it with a smile the first hour and you&#8217;ll get your mind where it ought to be.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compliment <\/strong>the folks one step below you, your equals, and those one step above you-any time it&#8217;s appropriate. Practice it on little things until it becomes automatic. If you get razzed about it, that probably means you are not doing it right. Learn your coworkers hobbies, their family issues and what makes them tick.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never criticize<\/strong> those same people unless it&#8217;s in private, and done in a &#8220;<em>What do you think you might have done differently<\/em>?&#8221; method rather than, &#8220;What the hell were you thinking, dumbass?&#8221; method.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never be satisfied<\/strong> with your knowledge of a subject. Those who don&#8217;t <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/08\/3-things-money-cant-buy-sniff\/\">continue to learn<\/a> are going backwards. If you aren&#8217;t reading journals in your field, going to <a href=\"http:\/\/FinancialBloggerConference.com\">conferences<\/a>&#8211; even on your own dime- you&#8217;ll soon be the old guy in the same job you have now. Or out on the street&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Learn <\/strong>about areas <strong>outside<\/strong> your focus. If you&#8217;re a new grad, don&#8217;t just work on your own project, see how your manager deals with staff, clients, and bosses. See what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Use those skills with your co-workers. If you&#8217;re an engineer, see how the sales department closes the deal. Use that knowledge to ask for a raise or get that special project you&#8217;ve been eying.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Always review your email before you hit send: <\/strong>Forwards and replies are like snakes in the grass waiting to strike! A respected mentor of mine still gets red in the face remembering one such mistake. Never send an email when you are angry or upset. If you have something controversial to discuss, Pick Up The <strong>PHONE, dammit<\/strong>! E-mails are forever! People have trouble understanding moods when reading-they may miss your sarcasm and get the wrong message. <em>(EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: If you use Gmail, click under &#8220;labs&#8221; and add &#8220;Undo Send&#8221; to your account. It saves me every single day!)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Be on time (That&#8217;s French for early)<\/strong> and ready to work.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deliver<\/strong> before deadlines and without reminders.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Think about your own career<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you on the fast track, or the bridge to nowhere?<\/li>\n<li>Are you the &#8220;go-to&#8221; guy, or the &#8220;I hide when I see him coming&#8221; guy?<\/li>\n<li>Are you the one people come to for advice, or just to share an inappropriate joke or comment?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Seeing <em><strong>the real you<\/strong><\/em> in the mirror-can be painful. Realistic self-evaluation, even when it hurts, can help break bonds holding you down. If you have a trusted friend at work, do a little constructive criticism of each other. Without change, that glass ceiling you imagine might really be made of 20 feet of concrete, and titanium re-bar, speckled with kryptonite&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t wait on that bunker busting bomb to free you! <strong>Free yourself<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>Just as a professional golfer goes through the difficult process of breaking down his swing, and developing new muscle memory to improve his score, you must do the same at work.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nNow, go break par, and don&#8217;t forget to enjoy the round!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>Dr. Dean Burke blogs at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themillionairenurse.com\/\">The Millionaire Nurse<\/a> where he teaches the basics of personal finance using humor and his medical background for a unique twist.
