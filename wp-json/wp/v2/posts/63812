But It&#8217;s Also Kind of Awesome."},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy Friday, lovely people!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today I\u2019m going to talk to you about volunteering and how awesome it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And by awesome, I really mean &#8230;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inconvenient, thankless, frustrating, gritty, and a total pain in the ass! (But then somehow if you grit through all of this, that\u2019s when the awesome and wickedly satisfying bits come in &#x1f600;.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been volunteering for almost two years for just a few hours per week at Meals on Wheels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re not familiar with it, it&#8217;s a volunteer program that gets average people like me delivering meals to homebound people in the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My job is to drive around and deliver nutritious meals to people who can\u2019t source food for themselves. It\u2019s definitely not a glamorous volunteer opportunity, but I continue to show up each week and work my hardest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any hard work in life, you can complain and focus on all the negative things, OR you can smile and focus on all the positive things! Volunteering is about looking on the bright side, because <\/span><b>your attitude determines your experience.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what I do, the goods and bads of working for free, and some fun stories I\u2019ve collected along the way &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Oh, and if you want to sign up, too, here\u2019s<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org\/americaletsdolunch\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to volunteer for Meals on Wheels.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Delivering for Meals on Wheels<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My job is to drive around Santa Monica and deliver meals to homebound people. Some of the meal recipients are sick or bedridden, some live in poverty, but most are just older adults. In addition to dropping off a meal, I also do a friendly visit and a quick safety check-in to make sure all is OK. (I also like to sneak in a few dad jokes sometimes because many people are craving human connection and I\u2019m often the only person they see the entire day.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my first year as a volunteer driver, I was assigned a different delivery route each week. This kept things interesting, brought me to different areas of the city, and exposed me to all types of diverse situations. This year I have a regular route, delivering to the same people each week. I try and take whatever is thrown at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63862 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Meals-on-wheels-bag-e1618534238953.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is what the food looks like. Each client gets a hot meal, cold sandwich, juices, milk and various snacks. Some special clients also get frozen meals for weekends or additional needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delivery volunteers use their own cars and sort the food into individual bags before each drop-off. We used to help with other minor admin tasks before and after shifts, but since the covid 19 pandemic hit, safety measures have been put in at the headquarters facility with strict social distancing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Sucky Side of Volunteering to Deliver Meals<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I try my hardest to focus on the positive stuff, but I\u2019d be lying if I said volunteering was always fun. There are downsides, and this is probably why most people don\u2019t volunteer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It\u2019s inconvenient. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is always something more fun I <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be doing instead. Like last Friday my friend asked me to go surfing with him in Malibu, but I couldn\u2019t because I committed to volunteering that day. Fun things like this pop up every week, but making a commitment to volunteering regularly means saying no to these other things. Giving up spare time is hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Traffic in LA is terrible.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There\u2019s no parking, volunteers have to pay for all our car costs, and fighting the midday traffic during lunch hour can put you in a bad mood pretty quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It\u2019s kind of sad.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can be depressing to see how the clients live. Messy and smelly homes, extreme poverty, etc. It\u2019s hard not to get emotional after visiting people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Some people are rude :( <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Many clients are extremely appreciative for your service. But sadly, some are not. There\u2019s nothing worse than going out of your way to help people who don\u2019t say thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Nonprofits can be unorganized and understaffed.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There\u2019s a shortage of truly dedicated volunteers, which puts a strain on the workers who actually show up. Also, the processes and work practices of some nonprofits can be inefficient. It\u2019s really hard to put in 100% when you know sometimes your efforts are being wasted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know, I sound like a complainy-pants! All of these \u201cdownsides\u201d just highlight how much privilege I have. Plus, dealing with these aspects is part of the job I signed up for. So it\u2019s better to dwell on the positives&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Awesome Things About Volunteering With Meals on Wheels<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the cool things I\u2019ve experienced donating my time &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Meeting good people! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think I\u2019m an annoyingly optimistic and happy person, you should see some of the other nerds I volunteer with! These people are the most generous, thoughtful and joyful people I\u2019ve ever met. :) Interesting people from all walks of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It gives you perspective. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think you have a hard life? You should see some of your senior neighbors\u2019 situations. Every volunteer shift is a reminder of how blessed I am in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Visiting new parts of town.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Driving around Santa Monica and Venice is really interesting&#8230; While out and about I always notice new stores, paintings on walls, and cool start-ups all mixed with the Southern Californian beach culture. Exploring your own community is fun!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You get to see the direct benefit. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you get involved in charity personally and see the look on people\u2019s faces when they receive help, you feel immediate accomplishment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Personal growth and learning new skills. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of life\u2019s coolest personal growth experiences are found outside of your comfort zone. Volunteering continues to change who I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>**My favorite benefit** Collecting fun and weird stories to share! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s always something to laugh at and funny memories to be made along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Personal Highlights From Volunteering<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to have fun while you volunteer. These are a few stories from my travels as a Wheels volunteer&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I delivered to a woman who answered the door without any pants on. She was probably 90 years old. Instead of acting shy or apologizing, she just smiled and shrugged her shoulders as if to say,<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cI don\u2019t really feel like wearing pants today.\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, one Wheels client dresses up in a three-piece suit every day, even though he never leaves his house. He wants to look his absolute best for the 1-2 minutes when I come to his front door. It\u2019s the highlight of his day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was delivering to an older lady once, and she asked me what type of food was inside. I looked at the box and read her the menu. Next she asked if I could read out all the ingredients of the food. I had a few minutes to spare, so I read her all the ingredients. Next, she asked if I could read them all out <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">again<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So I did, a little slower this time. Then, she asked if I could read them out a third time!&#8230; At that point, she said she just wanted someone to talk to. Guess she liked my Australian accent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months ago I was on my meal delivery route and the Macarena song came on the radio. I hadn\u2019t heard the Macarena in years, so I turned the volume up. I started bobbing my head and moving my hands. One thing lead to another, and I was doing the full Macarena dance in my car. At that moment, I looked to my left and saw some kids in the car next to me were filming me on their cellphones and laughing&#8230; I\u2019m probably on YouTube somewhere. &#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met one woman last year who was 101 years old! No kidding, she was the oldest person I\u2019ve ever met. Still walking around, and her mind still sharp as a tack. She asked me questions about my life, and I asked about hers. She reckons the secret to happiness in life is having kids. &#x1f62c;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there\u2019s a bunch more stories I\u2019ve shared on my personal site over the years if you want to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/category\/volunteering\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check them out here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Giving Time vs. Money<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up I always found it was easier to give money vs. volunteer my time. It\u2019s probably because I usually felt that I had an excess of money but never had enough time in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then a few years ago my situation reversed. When I quit my full-time job, I suddenly had an abundance of time and became much more stringent with money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may reverse again in the future. Or maybe I can give both?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, <\/span><b>any giving is good giving.<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-include-charity-in-your-budget-and-other-ways-to-give\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no right or wrong way to be generous.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Do what you can, and have fun along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a great weekend!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy Friday, lovely people!
