It is worth paying for; it is worth losing a job for; it is worth going to jail for. I would rather be a free pauper than a rich slave. I would rather die in abject poverty with my convictions than live in inordinate riches with the lack of self respect.&#8221; &#8211; Martin Luther King, Jr<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>I was originally going to blog about how money is only temporary,<\/strong> but then I looked at the calendar and realized it&#8217;s Martin Luther King day. So instead, like a true nerd, I decided to find out if the good doctor was as amazing with his finances as he was fighting for social equality ;)<\/p>\n<p>And the short answer is, yes and no. Yes he <em>could have <\/em>kept all his earnings to himself and better secured his family&#8217;s finances, however his #1 mission in life as we all know was not to grow his personal wealth or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/early-retirement-quiz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retire early<\/a> (was that even a &#8220;thing&#8221; back then?), but to advance our civil rights. Which of course he succeeded magnificently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>True to his words above, he left this world with much more conviction than money:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>MLK Jr. died not only without financial assets, but without a will. Despite his widely known premonitions concerning his own early demise&#8230; King died intestate. Although his wife Coretta had admonished him for years to set some funds aside for the higher education of their four children, King left his family with no appreciable benefits from his five books, hundreds of speaking engagements, his ministry, and of most concern to his wife, the $54,600 he earned as recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. While Mrs. King thought some of the award money should be invested for the children\u2019s sake, her husband donated the funds to the movement.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>That $54,600 he was awarded in 1964, btw, is equal to about $416,000 in today&#8217;s dollars.<\/strong> Plenty enough to secure your kids&#8217; future for a while. (Interesting side note, legendary singer Harry Belafonte ended up raising money to ensure that King&#8217;s children were supported through childhood and educated. This article over at Salon.com goes into a bunch of things most people don&#8217;t know about M.L.K. if you&#8217;re interested in reading more.)<\/p>\n<p>So yes, he <em>was<\/em> good at prioritizing where his money went, it just didn&#8217;t go into his own pockets :) His daughter <a href=\"http:\/\/www.celebritynetworth.com\/richest-businessmen\/lawyers\/bernice-king-net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bernice King<\/a>, however, rings in at a fair $1.5 million according to <a href=\"http:\/\/CelebrityNetWorth.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CelebrityNetWorth.com<\/a> (don&#8217;t click that unless you REALLY want to be sucked into famous peoples&#8217; money &#8211; it&#8217;s addicting!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Dr. King was able to do really makes you wonder about your own legacy, doesn&#8217;t it?<\/strong> What we will all leave behind in terms of making a positive impact on society? Do we want to be known for being awesome at our money or being awesome at something much farther reaching?<\/p>\n<p>I suspect days like today are set up to inspire and remind us of the power of dreaming big on top of giving thanks to a tireless leader. Did you now there&#8217;s actually only <a href=\"http:\/\/www.todayifoundout.com\/index.php\/2013\/01\/martin-luther-king-jr-facts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two other people<\/a> in American history that have a national holiday in their honor? George Washington and Christopher Columbus.<\/p>\n<h2>And then there&#8217;s the &#8220;Freedom Budget!&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>During my search for answers, I also came across another item you might find fascinating &#8211; something called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fool.com\/how-to-invest\/personal-finance\/2013\/01\/21\/martin-luther-kings-financial-dream.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Freedom Budget<\/em><\/a> that M.L.K approved of.

I&#8217;ll leave you with one last passage spoken by him just two months before his assassination&#8230; It&#8217;s amazing how well he lived his mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I&#8217;d like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.<\/p>\n<p>I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won&#8217;t have any money to leave behind. I won&#8217;t have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind.
