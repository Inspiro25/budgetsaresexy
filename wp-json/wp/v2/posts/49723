Not that I wasn&#8217;t going to take the tests anyways, but MAN did those carrots excite me during study time. And my part-time job helped keep it sustainable too (could you tell I didn&#8217;t have any money goals back then? :))<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays I wouldn&#8217;t dream of rewarding myself like that, no less <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/09\/weekend-money-traps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hanging out at the mall<\/a> so much, but it did become obvious over time that I&#8217;m someone who accomplishes things much faster &#8211; and happier &#8211; when I&#8217;m tricked into doing them. As lame as that may sound.<\/p>\n<p>So today I thought I&#8217;d share some of my current tricks I&#8217;ve been playing around with, along with more proven ones over the years in hopes it sparks some good experimenting on your end too. Some of these are finance-related and others not, but so far they&#8217;re all doing me a world of good. <\/p>\n<p>Here they are!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#1. As soon as I put my kids to bed (8&#8217;ish) I hurry up and brush and floss my teeth, and then hop right into the shower<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This helps me get &#8220;the chores&#8221; out of the way, thereby letting me enjoy the rest of the evenings with full bliss. But it also brought another unintended benefit &#8211; it forced me to stop snacking and drinking adult beverages throughout the night! Because after all, who wants to do their chores TWICE? (&lt;&#8211; I literally have to remind my wife about this at least twice a week when she asks why I won&#8217;t help her indulge in more ice cream, haha&#8230; Sorry honey! Habits!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP:<\/strong> If you get into *bed* right after the shower, many other fun things start happening too ;)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#2. I&#8217;m not allowed to drink coffee anymore until I&#8217;m ready to do work-work<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, once you wake up the first thing you think about is coffee. So you pour yourself a large cup, start doing some random tasks to work yourself up for the <em>actual<\/em> priorities, then pour yourself another one when it&#8217;s time to get down to business. The problem with this is that by that time you actually get to the meat and potatoes you&#8217;ve already downed two cups! And now you have to get through the whole day without crashing else you keep pumping more into your veins!<\/p>\n<p>So in an attempt to cut back AND be more efficient with my working, last Spring I inducted a new rule that said <em><strong>No Coffee Until You&#8217;re Ready To Do Real *Actual* Work, Sir.<\/strong><\/em> No more sipping and reading and just passing the time. You can dilly dally all you want, but until you&#8217;re ready to get to the important stuff, no caffeine will touch your lips.<\/p>\n<p>And do you know what this did? A) Force me to get to my work a helluva lot faster, and b) indeed cut down on my intake! Because the first cup is always enough to power me through major item #1, and then when it&#8217;s time to work on major item #2 I&#8217;m ready for a refill and then it&#8217;s lunch time. And ever since enacting this I haven&#8217;t wanted to gorge myself anymore after that. Probably because I now associate it with &#8220;having to do work&#8221; :)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#3. When I&#8217;m around people, no looking at my phone <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about this one before, but I used to be horrible at staring at the screen instead of the person in front of me. The only way I knew how to break it was to make up a rule, so now I&#8217;m not allowed to pick up my phone whenever a living breathing being is around. I still slip up from time to time, but it&#8217;s proven rather successful, and the main reason I know this is because now I&#8217;M the one on the other end being ignored! And it sucks! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>#4. Once my money is invested, I&#8217;M NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT!<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/no-touchy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/cant-touch-this-gif.gif\" alt=\"mc hammer dance\" width=\"413\" height=\"310\" \/><\/a>This is a big one, and probably the only way I&#8217;ve been able to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grow my net worth so quickly<\/a> over the years. You can be as good as anyone at stashing your money somewhere, but if you&#8217;re constantly transferring it back and forth, what&#8217;s the point?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saving only counts when it *stays* there.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You either put your money away and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/no-touchy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LEAVE IT ALONE<\/a>, or you figure out how to budget better and save yourself from thinking you&#8217;re saving when you&#8217;re not. The way I&#8217;ve learned to do this well is to choose accounts that will *penalize you* up the a$$ if you pull from them. Namely, retirement accounts.<\/p>\n<p>This is why I push all my investments through them!<\/p>\n<p>Yes they&#8217;re great for taxes\/matches\/etc, but it also REMOVES THE TEMPTATION to pull from. And forces you to live like you&#8217;re poorer too, since you never see any of the money hitting your accounts (at least if you automate it). Best trick ever for my finances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP:<\/strong> For all you FIRE people &#8211; check out <a href=\"http:\/\/madfientist.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MadFientist.com<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/GoCurryCracker.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoCurryCracker.com<\/a> to find out how to then *convert* all that money later to be used earlier than 62&#8230; But not too early, or you&#8217;re back to the beginning again!<\/p>\n<h2>#5. I can splurge on my hobby, but only with money the hobby itself makes<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/04\/when-its-time-to-detach-yourself-from-your-things\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">love and hate with coin collecting<\/a>, but once I figured out the hate was mainly out of internal reasons and not external, I&#8217;ve been officially back on the loving train again :) Which is good for &#8220;having fun,&#8221; but could easily be bad for my wallet without any limits placed (as often is the case with hobbies).<\/p>\n<p>So to keep things in check, I&#8217;m only allowed to spend money on buying coins with the money I&#8217;ve made in *selling* coins. This not only lets me indulge in my hobby guilt-free, but also to be more conscious of what I buy, and why. Not un-similar to how we should be spending our regular money too!<\/p>\n<p>Currently I have $250&#8217;ish in an envelope for this, and I tend to spend about $50\/mo on the hobby.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Shameless plug: the best coin blog EVER! &#8211;&gt; <a href=\"http:\/\/CoinThrill.com\">CoinThrill.com<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>#6. Lastly, here&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve started trying this week: before you buy something, ask yourself first <em>what you&#8217;d be willing to pay for it<\/em>!<\/h2>\n<p>I caught this over at Sarah&#8217;s blog, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yesandyes.org\/2013\/03\/moneyhappysimple-tip-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YesandYes.org<\/a>, and I just love how simple &#8211; yet genius &#8211; it is. How better to place a value on something than actually *placing a value on that something* before you find out the true price? If you valued it higher than it costs, voila! Decision made! (So long as you can afford it, anyways). And if it&#8217;s a price much higher than you valued it, voila again &#8211; decision made!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done this over the years without even realizing it, like when buying a pair of shoes (&#8220;if it&#8217;s $40 and under they&#8217;re mine!&#8221;) all the way up to our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/bye-bye-frankencaddy-hello-car-payments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last car purchase<\/a> (&#8220;Please be under $20,000, please be under $20,000!&#8221;), but it&#8217;s a great thing to try and make a <em>habit<\/em> out of too.<\/p>\n<p>Even when some things you can never put a value on (internet, coffee, sex ;)).<\/p>\n<p><strong>So yeah &#8211; a few things to consider!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll shout whenever others make the list, but in the meantime here are a handful of other tricks and hacks\/habits to consider as well:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/08\/awesome-money-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Awesome Money Ideas<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/03\/quick-money-tricks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">29 Quick Money Tricks<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/09\/mad-money-scientist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Become a Mad Scientist w\/ Your $$$<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/04\/financial-triggers-grow-your-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20+ Triggers to Hack Your Life &amp; Money<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/02\/savings-hacks-hall-of-fame\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">More Inductions To The Saving Hacks Hall of Fame!<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Let us know if you&#8217;ve tried any of them before!
