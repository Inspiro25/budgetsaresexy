Great one!&#8221; Then I thought that most of my friends I have now DO live the same way as me, so it&#8217;s not all *that* accurate really&#8230; And then I doubled back and again thought, &#8220;You know what? My <em>old<\/em> friends are the ones who sucked with money, not my current ones. I&#8217;m just hanging out with the smart ones these days!&#8221; Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you caught all that, I&#8217;m pretty much agreeing that yes &#8211; you do have to live differently than everyone else to reach your financial goals :)<\/strong> Or at least <em>most<\/em> of them.<\/p>\n<p>The 18 y\/o me didn&#8217;t really get that, nor did the 25 year old me, but now the 33 y\/o version&#8217;s got it down pat. As well as the people he know associates and hangs out with. No more crazies sucking away both my energy and vision!!<\/p>\n<p>I once had a &#8220;best friend&#8221; mock me and tell me I was a loser for getting up and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/how-i-blew-threw-1000-before-i-turned-22\/\">moving to NYC<\/a> so I can explore and chase my dream of being a graphic designer. She told me there wasn&#8217;t a point because I was going to fail and waste all my money (which both DID end up happening btw, though I had a helluva time doing it!), and that I should just &#8220;stay home&#8221; like everyone else she knew and not bother. Because everyone she hung out with were stuck and barely had any motivation to do anything substantial. Still pisses me off to this day&#8230; Little did she know I was <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/wanna-know-the-cheapest-way-to-travel-the-world\/\">traveling the world on a dime<\/a> and partying like a rock star! Haha&#8230; I only failed in the &#8220;designer&#8221; department &#8211; certainly not the adventure one ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anywho, making the conscious decision to do the best for YOU and YOUR FINANCES over others is a pretty important concept to grasp.<\/strong> Even if it goes against your friends\/familys&#8217; habits or lifestyle. That&#8217;s not to say you can&#8217;t splurge or slip up every now and then &#8211; you most definitely (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/06\/sometimes-splurging-is-okay-to-do-it\/\">and should!<\/a>) do that &#8211; but overall you gotta be watching out for #1 cuz only #1 cares that much. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being frugal and sexy anyways,\u00a0 right? ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the rest of that email I got over the weekend&#8230; Pretty motivational stuff:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My wife and I have been living well and on a budget since 2006.\u00a0 I think I have always had it in me, but the hardest decision was to live DIFFERENTLY than everyone else.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2006, my wife and I have accomplished:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting rid of my $75,000 in student loans (sold our home at the peak of the market)<\/li>\n<li>Paid for her Masters in Education &#8211; $21,000<\/li>\n<li>Saved enough for her degree ($12,500, 50% is paid for by her school)<\/li>\n<li>Paid off all of our credit cards ($36,000)<\/li>\n<li>Actually put some money away for retirement ($65,000)<\/li>\n<li>Paid off extra on our house (we now have $65,000 more than we would have)<\/li>\n<li>We have a reasonable emergency fund, checking, and savings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Crazy what a little sacrifice, hard work, and listening to people like you will do. FYI, we rented out two levels of our home, and I took a second hobby\/job that pays me decently each month if you&#8217;re wondering how we did ALL of that.)\u00a0 We now only rent out the MIL.\u00a0 We also sold off our second expensive car, moved to a location where we are only blocks from work&#8230;etc..etc..etc.<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, it&#8217;s people like you that are helping people like me.\u00a0 Inspiring to say the least, because it lets us know OTHER PEOPLE ARE KICKING ASS being frugal and budgeting properly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So the next time someone&#8217;s tempting you to offload some of that money that you don&#8217;t want to do, just remember &#8211; <strong>BE DIFFERENT!
