This being a personal finance blog and all, I thought I\u2019d share the numbers and costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not like we\u2019re extreme frugal travelers or anything, but we\u2019re also not big spenders. We found a few ways to cut corners (free flights, avoided some tourist traps, stayed with friends a few nights) but spent heavily in other areas &#8212; intentionally. &#x1f60e;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the summary of costs:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flights: $22.40<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VRBO hotel (7 days, including trip insurance): $1,615.60<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rental car (10 days): $356.87<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ubers (to\/from airport): $149.70<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gas: $48.08<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID tests: $400<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food\/Booze (incl friends): $1,487.25<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>TOTAL: $4,079.90<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things we *didn\u2019t* spend on:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dog sitter for Cooper: $0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time off work: $0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shopping\/souvenirs\/excursions: $0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking in Waikiki: $0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Some Trip Highlights<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s been ~5 years since we visited last, and almost 9 years since we lived in Hawaii. Most of our friends in HI have gotten married, had kids, bought houses, etc. so there was a lot of catching up to do. Here were some of the trip happenings:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We caught up with 21 friends over 10 days. (My wife has mad scheduling skills!) Dinners, BBQs, happy hours &#8212; we ate very few meals alone.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Went out to the sandbar in Kaneohe, snorkeling and paddleboarding.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfed the North Shore (a very humbling experience)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sat poolside at the Elk\u2019s club for an entire day drinking cocktails<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fishing at One\u2019ula Beach (&#x1f41f; caught = 0, &#x1f37a; drank = 7)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poker night at friend\u2019s house (only lost $7, not bad!)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pho, ramen, udon noodles, spam musubi, the best poke on the island, etc\u2026 My wife is a huge foodie (if you want any food recommendations, drop questions in the comments and wife will respond! *hopefully)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>COVID, Vaccines, and Travelling to Hawaii<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick update (as of April 2021) on the COVID situation as I know many people are still freaked out to travel by plane. My wife and I each got our first vaccine shot in early March, so we were traveling half-vaccinated. I realize 1 shot doesn\u2019t give you full immunity, but given the safety measures at airports and on airlines etc, we felt pretty safe to travel. We also called our friends on the island to get the local pulse on how COVID was being handled. The week we traveled Hawaii was averaging about ~53 new COVID cases per day in the entire state, so we felt OK traveling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time we flew, the state of Hawaii was enforcing either a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travelers, OR you could bypass quarantine if you could produce a negative COVID test taken within 72 hours of your flight. This is why we paid $400 in COVID tests \u2026 Hawaii wouldn\u2019t accept just any negative test, it had to come from one of their \u201ctrusted partners\u201d &#8212; which turned out to be a real expensive pain in the ass to find. In Los Angeles there are only about 5 trusted testing partners, each with costs of $175-$300 PER rapid test &#8212; regardless of insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for social distancing, we flew out of Long Beach Airport which is mostly outdoors. Honolulu Airport was fairly empty. Our plane on the way there had 80 passengers out of 175 seats, so quite spacious. Plane on the way home we somehow scored Row 1 all to ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63898 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/View-from-plane-e1619752522625.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pic taken from our plane window on the flight home right after takeoff!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Free Flights via Southwest ($22.40)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is talked about a lot in the FIRE community, but for those that don\u2019t know\u2026 Southwest Airlines offers some wicked credit card promotions that if combined correctly, let you earn a \u201ccompanion pass\u201d for a few calendar years. This means a selected partner can fly with you, for free, on any flights within a set time period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In early 2019 I signed up for 2 credit cards (SW personal and SW business) and received the companion pass as well as 125,000 welcome SW points to cover flights. Our companion pass was supposed to expire last year, but Southwest extended this through 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>All in all, we paid $11.20 each for our flights, so $22.40 total. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crazy, isn\u2019t it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Couple other flying notes and savings:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We brought breakfast to the airport (and drank coffee before we left home in the morning) so this saved us from buying expensive convenience food\/coffee.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife made salad and lunch wraps for the plane flight so we didn\u2019t have to buy anything while flying and weren\u2019t hungry when we landed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free movies, text messaging, etc. on Southwest and we packed all our headsets\/cables\/technology stuff so we wouldn\u2019t have to buy anything.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These might seem small and obvious, but tiny airport costs really add up. Planning in advance can shave hundreds off your total trip cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>VRBO &amp; Crashing With Friends ($1,615)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lodging is one area we were happy to splurge on. We were invited to stay with a handful of friends (for free), but part of this vacation plan was for me and my wife to spend time together just the two of us. We ended up staying 3 nights with friends on the North Shore and got a rental condo for 7 nights in town (Ilikai Hotel).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63899 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Ilikai-room-e1619752513553.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A peek inside the condo<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63896 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Sunset-balcony-scaled-e1619752538128.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunset from our balcony<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though this place was expensive (worked out over ~$220 per night after fees\/taxes), we found a few ways to save money:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Parking = $0. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We always scoured and found free overnight parking at the Ala Wai Marina, right next to our hotel. <\/span><b>This saved us a whopping $28 per night<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that our hotel charged.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Home cooking: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We chose a VRBO with a big kitchen so we could make our own convenience foods and snacks. This saved us hundreds by preparing our own food.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>BYO everywhere! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before checking into the hotel, we hit Walmart and bought about $300 of wine, champagne, hard seltzers and beer. Having our large hotel fridge stocked meant we had cold drinks to bring everywhere vs. buying at higher prices along the way.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Food and Booze ($1,487)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately $600 of this was buying food and drinks for other people. My wife and I like to pick up the bar tab sometimes, buy drinks, and take friends out to say thank you. (Our friends also hosted us and treated for some meals, too!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half of the time we splurged &#8212; our most expensive dinner was $170 for 5 people at Moku Kitchen in Kaka\u2019ako &#8212; and the other times we ate quite cheaply &#8212; homemade avocado toast or scrambled eggs for breakfast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63897 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Scrambled-eggs-breakfast-scaled-e1619752531663.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cheap and delicious egg breakfast we made for probably under $5 of ingredients.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, food is something we never regret spending money on while traveling. Especially meals with friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Coast FIRE and Blowing Our 2021 Travel Budget:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I budgeted about $10k for travel this year, and we\u2019ve already blown about 5k of it on trips! Oops. &#x1f62c;\u00a0 And with a lot more travel planned this summer, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll go way past our anticipated amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, this doesn\u2019t concern us too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beauty of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/coast-financial-independence-building-wealth-even-if-youre-not-saving-any-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coast FIRE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that we no longer have to contribute to our investment accounts to grow our retirement nest egg. As long as we\u2019re earning roughly the same amount we spend each year, our portfolio should naturally double in size every 10 years or so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if we end up spending $2k, $3k, or even $10k over our travel budget this year, it only puts a small dent in our retirement timeline. We are prioritizing travel while we are young (and have no kids!) vs. trying to save as much as possible and retire early.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have any \u201crevenge travel\u201d planned this year or next? Curious to hear if you think blowing $4k over 10 days in Hawaii is careless.
