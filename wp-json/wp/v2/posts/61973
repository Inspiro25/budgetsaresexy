Lifestyle creep, or lifestyle inflation as it&#8217;s sometimes called, is <b>the process of living up to your means.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i>It means increasing your spending as your income increases.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you earn $50,000 a year. If you&#8217;re anything like the average American, you&#8217;ll end up saving\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/saving\/2016\/10\/03\/heres-the-average-americans-savings-rate.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a little over 5% of that<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Consider that 5% of $50,000, or $2,500, your annual profit margin for the year. In other words, your lifestyle cost $47,500 that year.<\/p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s say over the course of a few years you end up changing jobs, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-started-a-quarantini-%f0%9f%8d%b8-business-during-the-covid-pandemic\/\">starting a business<\/a>, or getting a series of raises. Now you&#8217;re earning $100,000 a year.<\/p>\n<p>If you kept your lifestyle costs the same as they were when you were making $50,000, you would have just had a <i>very<\/i> profitable 12 months!<\/p>\n<p>But in most cases, as you earn more, you start to spend more too. And that $47,500 lifestyle quickly becomes a $95,000 lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t happen overnight; it just &#8220;creeps&#8221; up on you. That&#8217;s lifestyle inflation.<\/p>\n<p><i>It&#8217;s only natural &#8212; you can afford it!<\/i><\/p>\n<p>A nicer car, a bigger house, better clothes, fancy vacations, expensive restaurants. Those are all common ways your lifestyle can begin to creep back toward that average 5% savings rate.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is Lifestyle Inflation Risky?<\/h2>\n<p>Lifestyle inflation has been called &#8220;the biggest threat to financial planning.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s so bad about rewarding yourself when you earn more?<\/p>\n<p>The main issue financial planners and other money nerds get worried about is having enough. And &#8220;enough&#8221; is commonly defined as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/four-percent-rule.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">25x your annual expenses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Save that much and invest it responsibly and you&#8217;re theoretically set for life.<\/p>\n<p>That means at your $47,500 annual lifestyle cost, you&#8217;d need to amass a nest egg of almost $1.2 million.<\/p>\n<p>But at a $95,000 lifestyle cost, you&#8217;d need double that&#8211;almost $2.4 million.<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s the biggest risk and downside to lifestyle inflation: <b>it prolongs your path to financial freedom.<\/b><strong> And in some extreme cases, <\/strong><b>may even make retirement unattainable&#8211;at any age.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i>What&#8217;s the ultimate lifestyle upgrade? How about being able to spend your time however you want.<\/i><\/p>\n<h2>How to Avoid (Ineffective) Lifestyle Inflation<\/h2>\n<p>Lifestyle inflation is often associated with a &#8220;keeping up with the Jones'&#8221; mentality. At its worst, it&#8217;s a rush to buy stuff we don&#8217;t really need that makes zero impact on our long-term happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, researchers have found a surprising trend they&#8217;ve called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hedonic_treadmill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedonic adaptation<\/a>.&#8221; This explains humans&#8217; tendency to return to a baseline level of happiness relatively quickly after things happen to them&#8211;good or bad.<\/p>\n<p>It explains why people who win the lottery aren&#8217;t the happiest people on the planet. In fact, many\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/4176128\/powerball-jackpot-lottery-winners\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wish they&#8217;d never won in the first place<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So how can you avoid unnecessary or ineffective lifestyle creep?<\/p>\n<h3><b>#1. Establish a Comfortable Baseline to Avoid Lifestyle Inflation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Make sure your basic needs are met. If you&#8217;re hungry or don&#8217;t have a safe place to live, those are naturally &#8220;lifestyle creeps&#8221; that make total sense!<\/p>\n<h3><b>#2. Treat Your Household Budget Like a Business<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Thinking about your budget and surplus income as household &#8220;profit&#8221; is my favorite way to re-frame spending. As income increases, we become more profitable.<\/p>\n<p>To be sustainable, a business needs to make a profit.<\/p>\n<p>Your household is the same way. You can&#8217;t lose money every year &#8212; or even break even &#8212; and survive long-term.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But businesses spend money too. They just spend on those things they think will<\/strong> <b>generate a positive return.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Consider the same with your household spending.<\/p>\n<p>Will that bigger house make you happier in the long-run? It&#8217;s possible. But it might also mean a snowball effect of higher utilities, maintenance costs, weekends spent doing yard care, and expensive home improvement projects.<\/p>\n<h3><b>#3. Sit on it<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re making a big purchase decision, or even some smaller ones, can you revisit it next month? Or next year?<\/p>\n<p>If that inaction saves you hundreds or thousands of dollars a month, that&#8217;s worth a huge amount to your long-term financial independence.<\/p>\n<p><b>This is a really important one when it comes to overcoming lifestyle inflation.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Because of compound interest and the time-value of money, the <i>longer you can defer lifestyle inflation,<\/i> the better off you&#8217;ll be down the road.<\/p>\n<p>We have an inherent understanding of this. At retirement, an extra $500 a month invested when in your 20s will be worth a lot more than an extra $500 a month invested in your 50s.<\/p>\n<p>After graduation, I was in a big rush to &#8220;grow up&#8221; and get a place of my own. Looking back, I think that was a mistake.<\/p>\n<p>Living like a college student for even just another year or two would have made my personal profitability much stronger as a young professional.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Evaluate New Spending to Avoid Lifestyle Inflation<\/h2>\n<p>In our house, we have a few frameworks we use to evaluate new spending.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Know What You&#8217;re Really Buying<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The first is trying to determine what we&#8217;re <i>really<\/i> buying.<\/p>\n<p>Are we buying quality time, sanity, experiences? Are we helping others? Are we taking away some significant pain?<\/p>\n<p>This is inspired by Tim Ferriss, who recommended asking something like this: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/tim.blog\/2016\/08\/22\/how-to-waste-money-to-improve-the-quality-of-your-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How can I &#8216;waste&#8217; money to make life easier or better?<\/a>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If we can be confident our money will have a positive impact on our well-being or happiness, we gladly part with it. That&#8217;s one reason we travel as much as we do and why the kids go to daycare (more on that below).<\/p>\n<h3><b>Is it a One-Time Purchase or a Recurring Expense?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The other important consideration to make when evaluating new spending is whether it&#8217;s a one-off purchase or a new ongoing monthly expense.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, we&#8217;re quicker to make one-off purchases that make our lives better than commit to a new recurring cost.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Is it a Band-Aid or a Permanent Fix?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Does the purchase solve the root problem?<\/p>\n<p>Or does it just mask a symptom?<\/p>\n<p>If the problem is temporary, a &#8220;Band-Aid&#8221; solution is probably fine. But for longer-term problems, you&#8217;re better off buying a permanent fix.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Is it Easily Reversible?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Before I buy something, I almost always check the return policy. If I don&#8217;t like it or change my mind, can I get out of it?<\/p>\n<p>On bigger purchases without a return policy, could you re-sell the item to another owner?<\/p>\n<h3><b>Does this Purchase Have a Snowball Effect That Will Lead to Lifestyle Inflation?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Some purchases don&#8217;t end when you sign on the bottom line or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sidehustlenation.com\/credit-card-rewards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> swipe your credit card<\/a>. Some end up costing you more for years down the road.<\/p>\n<p>That bigger car? Yeah, it&#8217;s going to cost more to fill up every time you need gas. It&#8217;s going to cost more to insure. It&#8217;s probably going to cost more to maintain.<\/p>\n<p>That bigger house? It&#8217;ll cost more to heat and cool. You&#8217;ll pay more in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-appealed-my-ridiculous-property-taxes\/\">property taxes<\/a> and mortgage every month. You might need more furniture.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not all bad &#8212; some &#8220;snowballs&#8221; are good. What if you move closer to work? There&#8217;s a positive snowball effect there of shorter commute times, less money spent on gas, more time with your family.<\/p>\n<p>And that leads me to my counterpoint about lifestyle creep. <strong>What if we approached <\/strong><b>new spending as a chance to <em>optimize<\/em> our existence?<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>The Alternative: Lifestyle Optimization<\/h2>\n<p>If there&#8217;s one thing that gets me fired up, it&#8217;s the idea of optimization, progress, and improvement. (In fact, we gave our first-born the middle name <i>Kaizen<\/i>, meaning &#8220;continuous improvement.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>So instead of blindly letting your lifestyle &#8220;creep,&#8221; consider how you can use your money to optimize your life.<\/p>\n<p>What would that look like?<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the right balance of spending, saving, and giving?<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com\/blog\/conscious-spending-how-my-friend-spends-21000year-on-going-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ramit Sethi<\/a> argues that you should<\/strong> <b>spend &#8220;lavishly&#8221; on the things you love, provided you ruthlessly cut costs on the things you don&#8217;t.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>What could you buy to genuinely make your life (and the lives of others) better, not just today, but in the future as well?<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s lifestyle optimization, and really that&#8217;s the whole point.<\/p>\n<h2>Where Have We Optimized?<\/h2>\n<p>While our household is still solidly profitable, we certainly spend more than we did a few years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some things we spent \/ are spending money on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>An e-bike.<\/b> I freaking love this thing. We ride to preschool almost every day and I ride it downtown as well. So far it&#8217;s taken 750 miles off my car. (An example of a one-off purchase that saves money and brings joy.)<\/li>\n<li><b>TSA Pre-check.<\/b> This is a total unnecessary luxury, but it just makes me happy every time I go through security. At $20 a year for 5 years, including Global Entry, it was well worth it.<\/li>\n<li><b>Running the air conditioning more.<\/b> Even though the heat is usually pretty temporary, we&#8217;re more apt to cool off the house these days.<\/li>\n<li><b>Renewable energy.<\/b> For our monthly power bill, we had the option to pay a little more to use electricity from 100% renewable sources. It was an easy decision.<\/li>\n<li><b>Health.<\/b> Not that we ever ate really poorly, but we tend to buy supposedly cleaner, healthier food. I go to a weekly yoga class for flexibility and injury prevention. I started getting annual\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wellnessfx.com\/\">WellnessFX<\/a> blood tests.<\/li>\n<li><b>Books.<\/b> I still get a lot of books from the library, but if I see a title on Kindle I want to read, I&#8217;m quick to order it.<\/li>\n<li><b>Clothes.<\/b> I don&#8217;t buy a lot of clothes, but when I do, I try and get something that fits well and will last. Sorry Old Navy!<\/li>\n<li><b>Giving.<\/b> This is still a work in progress, but supporting causes we care about is becoming a higher priority.<\/li>\n<li><b>Slower travel.<\/b> Recognizing that the transportation part is the most difficult part of travel for us these days, we&#8217;ve opted for fewer but longer trips if that makes sense. Fewer 3-day weekends and more week-long trips.<\/li>\n<li><b>Daycare<\/b> (see below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most of these aren&#8217;t huge expenses, but make us happier people.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Kids: The Ultimate Lifestyle Creep?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Daycare for our two boys is our biggest line-item expense at the moment &#8212; over $2,300 a month.<\/p>\n<p>Save for college? How about save for daycare; it&#8217;s immediate and it sure ain&#8217;t cheap!<\/p>\n<p>But that daycare is part of our lifestyle optimization plan. It allows our boys to learn critical social skills, interact with kids and adults outside of home in a safe and structured environment&#8211;and importantly, it frees up time for me and mom to work. Work, I should add, that we both find fulfilling.<\/p>\n<p>Studies show that<a href=\"https:\/\/smartasset.com\/retirement\/the-average-cost-of-raising-a-child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> raising kids costs $200,000 on average<\/a>&#8211;not including college. But if you dig into the numbers, a big chunk of that is in buying or renting a bigger house. That&#8217;s one reason we&#8217;re trying to delay that as long as we can.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Could Kids Be Saving You Money?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>I saw one semi-depressing anecdote the other day. It was from a parent responding to one of those &#8220;how much it costs to raise kids&#8221; articles.<\/p>\n<p>Her argument was that kids actually <i>save<\/i> her money &#8212; because she&#8217;s stopped traveling and eating out!<\/p>\n<p>For some parents, high achieving offspring are their retirement plan!
