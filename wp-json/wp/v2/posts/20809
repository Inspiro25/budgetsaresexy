Then you become an adult. Things like, oh, I don\u2019t know&#8230; an overwhelming lack of time and money get in the way of ever experiencing the adventures you once thought you\u2019d have. There are bills and responsibilities. Ick. Ugh. Blah. Meh. But you do what you must.<\/p>\n<p>Every time you think of those dreams, you say \u201cSomeday day I\u2019ll do that. As soon as I\u2019m done with this other part of my life.\u201d Guess what. There is <em>never<\/em> a time when those adventures make sense in the real world. Something is always in the way. Maybe your career. Maybe the timing. Maybe a general lack of money. Maybe something else.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would happen if you decided to take a risk?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I decided I wanted to find out. The smart move would be to keep the career job, pay off the rest of my debts, and wait before launching off into the type of adventure that I\u2019ve always wanted to have. But I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019d rather live that adventure&#8230; I want to do something worth talking about, rather than wait around for silly things like money or the right timing. <em>The right timing may never come. <\/em><\/p>\n<h2>My Adventure (is going to be awesome)<\/h2>\n<p>By best friend and I are going to travel around the USA in my car, living and working from the road, under the name, wait for it&#8230; &#8220;Girls Be Trippin.&#8221;  (Cause we\u2019re both girls. Road trippin\u2019 around. Duh.) We\u2019re taking my Ford Focus, and we plan to go couch surfing &#8211; with friends and relatives, but also by using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.couchsurfing.com\/\">CouchSurfing.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately&#8230; while our lodging may mostly be free, the financial outlook is not looking good from the outside in. I recently decided to get a travel friendly computer (the MacBook Air). The computer is awesome. The price wasn\u2019t. Which means, I went from no credit card debt, to a little extra (although I did pay for some of it in cash).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh, and I also quit my job just a little while back. <\/strong>And I have an auto loan on my car (thankfully I\u2019m not upside down on that and I haven\u2019t missed any payments yet). And I have student loans. And since I\u2019m a web developer, I have things like domains and hosting to pay for every month for all my personal projects. Let\u2019s look things over, shall we?<\/p>\n<h2>My Financials (are a problem)<\/h2>\n<p>All of the cash in my bank accounts (including a $1,000 emergency fund) add up to: $2,408.76&#8230; yippee! But I owe $4,011.89 to my car loan, and $1,633.16 on my credit card. Hmm. Not so great. My monthly obligations are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student loans: $150<\/li>\n<li>Cell phone: $50<\/li>\n<li>Rent: $250<\/li>\n<li>Web costs: $75<\/li>\n<li>Car Payment: $188<\/li>\n<li>Auto Insurance: $140<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here, I\u2019ll do the math for you. Without even including other changing expenses like food, clothing, \u201cfun money\u201d or extra debt payments&#8230; that\u2019s about $855 in monthly commitments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sure, things like \u201cRent\u201d won\u2019t actually be rent once I\u2019m on the road<\/strong>, but instead money for gas, storage for things left behind, paying my family for cat care, etc&#8230; \u201cRent\u201d will probably look more like $300+. I won\u2019t have room to be picky, but I\u2019m still trying to make money doing things that I actually enjoy doing. Right now that includes WordPress plugin development, and selling silly songs on <a href=\"http:\/\/fiverr.com\/\">Fiverr<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Overall regular income right now? A whopping <em><strong>$220 a month<\/strong><\/em>. The math doesn\u2019t add up right now, which is a problem. I\u2019ve taken a few side gigs (photography and web development) and sold a few personal belongings to make ends meet in the meantime, but something will have to change. Something tells me we\u2019ll never be quite as secure as we\u2019d like.<\/p>\n<h2>The Solution (is to be optimistic)<\/h2>\n<p>As it stands, I can\u2019t reduce my bills any further. I\u2019ll need to find extra income. Here\u2019s a few of my game plans:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Idea #1: Get the Road Trip Sponsored<\/strong><em> &#8211; Immediate Income Likelihood: Low. <\/em>I\u2019m doing this road trip with my best friend. We\u2019re going to be blogging, making videos and sharing our adventures for anyone who wants to live vicariously through us. That\u2019s also a great opportunity for anyone who wants to support our adventure and get their brand talked about in association with general awesomeness and the message that you <em>can<\/em> live the way you want to (&#8230;even in this economy). <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Income Potential<\/span>: Depending on who eventually sponsors us, this could be anything from donated cameras, to a gas budget, to complete travel expenses covered.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Idea #2: Sell Road Trip Merchandise &#8211; <\/strong><em>Immediate Income Likelihood: Low. <\/em>Along the idea of monetizing the actual road trip, we\u2019re going to brand ourselves. We\u2019re both writers and creative types. People might be interested in buying what we produce. Obviously, we\u2019ll mostly be putting out free stuff (like the blog and videos), but who\u2019s to say people don\u2019t want a sweatshirt with my face on it? Or you know, at least some funny picture I draw. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Income Potential<\/span>: Realistically, I\u2019d expect that we could eventually bring in $200 &#8211; $300 through merchandise per month. It depends on how big or fanatical of an audience we draw, and how creative we get with merchandise ideas.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Idea #3: Become a YouTube Partner &#8211;<\/strong><em>Immediate Income Likelihood: Low &#8211; <\/em>Ultimately, I want to be a YouTube Partner. I already publish entertaining videos on my personal channel under the alias \u201c<em><a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/terriblyserious\">Terribly Serious<\/a><\/em>\u201d, but YouTube is also where we\u2019ll be <em>sharing our travel videos<\/em>. Both channels have a chance to become a YouTube Partner, which essentially allows us to make money just by sharing videos. Pretty cool, huh? From what I understand, you need at least 1,000 subscribers to be taken seriously by YouTube and subsequently get invited as a Partner. We can\u2019t count on that right away. (But you can help by subscribing to us of course ;)) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Income Potential<\/span>: No idea.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Idea #4: Premium WordPress Solutions &#8211;<\/strong><em>Immediate Income Likelihood: Not Bad &#8211; <\/em>This idea is already in the works, and slowly growing. I\u2019m going to continue focusing on developing premium WordPress themes and plugins. The more solutions I produce, the wider opportunity for income I have! <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Income Potential<\/span>: Currently at about $120 per month.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Idea #5: Web Development Clients &#8211;<\/strong><em>Immediate Income Likelihood: Good &#8211; <\/em>My goal is to develop and maintain products, but until that takes off I can start accepting clients for web development work again. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Income Potential<\/span>: Anywhere starting from $1,000+ per month depending on length of projects and the budget of my clients and how many clients I\u2019m willing to take.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Idea #6: Launching An Online Business &#8211;<\/strong><em>Immediate Income Likelihood: Low&#8230; but after 2-3 months, Very Good &#8211; <\/em>I\u2019m launching a business with a couple of awesome partners sometime in the beginning of 2012. Until it\u2019s out, it\u2019s top-secret, mostly because I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m allowed to say. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Income Potential<\/span>: Enough to retire. Or you know, enough to not really worry about employment for a while.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Until then&#8230; other income supplements I\u2019ll be looking at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offering services to friends and family with \u201csuggested donations\u201d to support the trip<\/strong> (Within 15 minutes of posting a Facebook status offering a list of services I would offer with suggested donations to support the trip, I got $50. Not bad.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mini services with Fiverr<\/strong> &#8211; which you\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/fiverr-review-tips\/\">already read about<\/a> doing on Budgets Are Sexy (This brings about $80+ per month for me with my current gig.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Passive income through Google AdSense<\/strong> (I\u2019ve made $100 annually before, but never took this project seriously.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Passive income through selling random designs on Zazzle products<\/strong> (I make about $20 every 6 months or so, but never took this project seriously.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Getting hired as a blogger<\/strong> (I&#8230; don\u2019t know how much this pays.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Putting on business web seminars in the cities we visit<\/strong> (Would probably start at around $500+ profits per speaking event. I have an event manager who I\u2019ve helped out in the past and is willing to coordinate that sort of thing for me free of charge.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Becoming so influential that people are constantly sending me free things<\/strong>, donating to my causes, and hiring me out of nowhere ;) (Priceless.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Hint:<\/em> If you\u2019re ever in need of any of my services (from blogging to writing a song, to design &amp; development and more) just hit me up over at anne@girlsbetrippin.com &#8211; mention you heard of me from <em>Budgets Are Sexy<\/em> to get the appropriate J$ discount!
