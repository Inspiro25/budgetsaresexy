Down 5 hours from our normal late-night feeding we were trying to break ;) I&#8217;m actually feeling like a responsible adult these days! (And to answer my own question from earlier &#8211; no, we do not have any curfews, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also LOVING the feeling of vagabonding over here. It&#8217;s amazing how normal your life can be without a ton of your stuff weighing you down. This must be what it feels like to be a minimalist? We each have a suitcase or two of clothes, and a handful of toys for the baby, but really it&#8217;s like 1\/1,000th of the things we own on this Earth. Even though, granted, we&#8217;re using all my mother in law&#8217;s stuff too, of course. I can&#8217;t claim we&#8217;d be that comfortable in a house without any furniture or beds or TVs, but overall the break from reality&#8217;s been pretty refreshing :) And our mother&#8217;s having fun too!<\/p>\n<p><b>Something else I&#8217;ve been noticing is that our mother-in-law lives in quite the wealthy neighborhood.<\/b> I never really paid attention much before, but it seems every other house on the block is a million+ with perfectly manicured lawns and plenty of luxury cars in the driveways &#8211; as if to match each of the different outfits for the week. It&#8217;s rather fascinating. You know you&#8217;re in a different world when even the parking lot at the Home Depot looks like a luxury car dealership! Haha&#8230; I can&#8217;t <em>not<\/em> park next to a Benz or Rover, or even sexier, a Maserati every time I roll up. Even the people getting arrested there looked like a million bucks! (That&#8217;s right &#8211; I said arrested. The last time I hit it up there was some dolled up chick getting pushed into a police car in handcuffs for doing who knows what&#8230; felt like the Real Housewives of DC up in here!)<\/p>\n<p><b>In a weird way, I&#8217;m also starting to feel more rich too.<\/b> As if there&#8217;s some sort of osmosis playing a part here allowing OUR wallets to grow just by *being around* all these Richie Riches, haha&#8230;. (Well, I assume most of them are rich, even though we all know looks can be quite deceiving). In no way do I desire any of these fancy pants homes or lifestyles which require many a thousands to maintain every single month (though I will take the cars!), I am, however, sensing the hustler in me starting to flex his mind muscles the more I take my neighborhood strolls :) It gives me hope that I, too, can afford whatever the hell I want one of these days &#8211;\u00a0 regardless of what it is!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an odd, yet motivational, feeling to have indeed. Especially since &#8220;don&#8217;t be like the Joneses&#8221; have been engrained in our heads every since laying eyes on our very first finance blogs :) But I can TOTALLY see how easy it is to fall into this trap! Being surrounded by all this wealth is making ME want to be like them too! Only more in the &#8220;<em><strong>making of the money<\/strong><\/em>&#8221; department over the &#8220;nice things&#8221; one. Something, again, I&#8217;m assuming is accurate unless this whole community is a huge facade. It just makes me want to get out there and kill it!<\/p>\n<p><b>So needless to say we&#8217;re having quite the interesting time over here.<\/b> And getting in lots of quality time and adventure all while racking my brain to figure out how to make tons more money too. Which, thus far, has totally escaped me, haha&#8230; I&#8217;m halfway tempted to stop some of these guys mid-grocery shopping and ask how they came to live here! Just don&#8217;t want to make any more of a scene than I am w\/ my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/article\/saving\/T023-C011-S001-4-things-my-mohawk-has-taught-me-about-money.html\">&#8216;hawk<\/a> and <del>pimp<\/del> <a title=\"total loss car\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/car-considered-total-loss-by-insurance\/\">broken mobile<\/a> out front&#8230; It also seems that a majority of the people here are in their 50s and 60s, so perhaps the &#8220;trick&#8221; I&#8217;m missing is simply time?<\/p>\n<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll stop my ramblings there :) I guess all we can do is keep on hustlin&#8217; and banging out those goals with the hope of hitting our dreams before we&#8217;re all old and wrinkly. And even in that case it wouldn&#8217;t be too horrible. I can rock a Range w\/ some chromed out rims in my 60s!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>[Photo by doug_wertman]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So it&#8217;s been over a week and a half now chillin&#8217; at the mother-in-law&#8217;s, and so far everything&#8217;s going superbly.
