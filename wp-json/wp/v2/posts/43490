Though he chose a different path in the end (you&#8217;ll have to click to see! ;))<\/p>\n<p>Here are the four memories that impacted my finances the most:<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with used stuff!&#8221; <em>&#8211; Momma $<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>If my mother had a blog, it would be called Used Stuff is Sexy (though considering she still doesn&#8217;t know what I do for a living, I doubt that would ever come to be ;)). I&#8217;ve never met a person who loves getting a good deal so much, and she instilled in us children early on the power of being thrifty. Mainly for the savings it brought (she raised us on a meager Military salary as a stay-at-home mom), but also for the &#8220;thrill of the hunt.&#8221; So it&#8217;s no surprise where I got <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/yard-sale-season-tips-tricks\/\" target=\"_blank\">my love of yard sales<\/a> and thrift shops from. Or my hankering for antiques &#8211; which by nature MUST be old and used!<\/p>\n<p>Here are all the areas we now save on immensely because of my mom:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clothes for myself<\/li>\n<li>Clothes for my kids<\/li>\n<li>Toys for my kids<\/li>\n<li>Furniture<\/li>\n<li>Books<\/li>\n<li>Music (think records &#8211; mmmm&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li>Cars (the most savings!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Stuff we never bought used were food and underwear &#8211; I wonder why?<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;You can buy anything you want&#8230; If you go out and earn it.&#8221; <em>&#8211; Momma $<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>This was another of my mother&#8217;s favorite sayings, and one that taught me the best lesson of all: how to appreciate money. Nothing puts things in better perspective than having to go out and earn all those dollars yourself! Especially when your allowance is only $1.00\/week &#8211; hah! But time and time again my mother continued repeating it until it finally sunk in and I quit pestering her.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/game-boys-and-401ks\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/original-game-boy.jpg\" alt=\"old game boy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>This occurred when <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/game-boys-and-401ks\/\" target=\"_blank\">I wanted my very first Nintendo Game Boy<\/a>.<\/strong> You can click the link for the full story, but in a nutshell I wanted a Game Boy bad &#8211; the old bulky tan ones before they got colored and shrunk &#8211; and of course my mother said I could have it as long as I saved up all the money ($90.00). I was adamant that I just had to have it, so I saved and saved and saved, and finally &#8211; what seemed like an eternity later &#8211; I had amassed a whopping $80.00. It wasn&#8217;t enough to pick up the golden toy, but it was at that point I realized that it wasn&#8217;t worth trading my hard earned money for anymore. Something I&#8217;m sure my parents knew was gonna happen :)<\/p>\n<p><em>(I did end up getting my hands on one a little later when I implemented the &#8220;used is good!&#8221; lesson from mom and found one for $30 + games at a yard sale &#8211; score!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I still slip up every now and then and waste my money (*ahem* <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/09\/i-once-spent-4000-on-bottle-of\/\" target=\"_blank\">$40.00 Bling H20<\/a>), but that game boy totally changed my perspective. And as you have witnessed with my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/the-new-challenge-everything-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\">Challenge Everything Savings Account<\/a>, it&#8217;s quite powerful to watch those pennies add up over time when you let it ride and never touch! I guarantee I&#8217;m going to appreciate whatever I end up doing with it more so than my &#8220;paycheck&#8221; money. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/money-experiments-update\/\" target=\"_blank\">I&#8217;ve been hustling for over 6 months<\/a> on that bad boy &#8211; it better get me something GOOD! :)<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever put anything on a credit card you can&#8217;t pay off at the end of the month&#8221; <em>&#8211; Poppa $<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>As I got older, my father started stepping in more and laying down the law on money (fun fact &#8211; my father does NOT like used things, except for cars\/motorcycles. Which gets confusing when you him dropping $100+ on a pair of running shoes when you&#8217;re only allowed to get a pair for $20 or less.) And one of the first things he told me when I got to college &#8211; outside of &#8220;make sure to have fun, kid &#8211; you have to go into the real world after this!&#8221; &#8211; was to never put anything stupid on my (co-signed) credit card that I can&#8217;t pay off in 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>A) because my parents would have to do so,<br \/>\nbut mainly B) So I didn&#8217;t end up screwing myself for years and years to come.<\/p>\n<p>Something I&#8217;m very much aware of now seeing all the emails and comments come in from some of y&#8217;all :( Credit cards are no joke. And I&#8217;m beyond thankful I had parents who were on my ass about it! (Another fun fact &#8211; I once put a chocolate bar on it thinking I could slip it by my parents &#8216;cuz how would they see?? The next month when the statement came (oops) I got a firm talking to.)<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;If you only do one thing, invest up to your company&#8217;s 401(k) match&#8221; <em>&#8211; Poppa $<br \/>\n<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>This was by far the best thing that ever happened to my finances. It took me years (and one <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/01\/tip-treat-savings-as-monthly-bill\/\" target=\"_blank\">pretty embarrassing trip to HR<\/a>) to finally catch on, but once I did I quickly learned how rapidly your money grows. And even more so when YOUR COMPANY DOUBLES YOUR MONEY FOR YOU FOR FREE!!<\/p>\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t have a 401(k) anymore or free matches, *tear* (downside to working for yourself), but <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\">I&#8217;ve maxed out at least one retirement account every single year<\/a> for the past 6-7 which I owe my father every last bit of credit for it. Without him harping on my back to get it started I&#8217;d have continued on wasting it away through dumb lifestyle increases. It was hard to really see the benefits at first &#8211; all you notice is your money flying out of your paycheck every two weeks! &#8211; but once your $100 becomes $1,000, and then $5,000 and $10,000 and so on, it&#8217;s hard to ignore <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/my-a-ha-moment-accumulation\/\" target=\"_blank\">the momentum<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mikedelgado\/status\/576451033179639808\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43498\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/not-investing-401k-funny.jpg\" alt=\"not investing 401k funny\" width=\"550\" height=\"574\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/not-investing-401k-funny.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/not-investing-401k-funny-287x300.jpg 287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>The only reason my net worth is flirting with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">half a million dollars<\/a> right now<\/strong> is because I kept fueling it every single year and letting the power of time and markets do its thing. It probably took me 5 years to reach my first $17,000, yet last month alone <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/net-worth-calculations-480k\/\" target=\"_blank\">it increased by $17,000<\/a>! And I didn&#8217;t even contribute to it!<\/p>\n<p>So make sure you&#8217;re investing at least up to your company&#8217;s match, and if you really want to be a baller try maxing the whole thing out. If $18,000 is just way too much, shoot for maxing a Roth IRA @ $5,500 or\/in addition to other things you&#8217;re already working on (paying off debt, saving for home, etc). Maxing out one retirement account every month <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\">will make you a millionaire<\/a> over time.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Needless to say, I owe everything to my parents :) Including my life!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>And of course, there were other tips they mentioned over the years too which I promptly ignored:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get an apartment when you don&#8217;t have a job.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/how-i-blew-threw-1000-before-i-turned-22\/\" target=\"_blank\">I did it anyways<\/a>, and quickly learned how fast you can burn through money.
