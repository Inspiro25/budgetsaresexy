It looks like over 250 of you listened (I thought I had <em>at least<\/em> 2,000 smart people here, but guess I was wrong&#8230;) and the results of our first question was surprisingly shocking!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I asked how many of you guys will be taking on a &#8220;No Shopping&#8221; challenge with me for the next month,<\/strong> and over HALF of you agreed to join me. Half! That&#8217;s incredible! And only proves to me again how smart you guys really are! ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the results of that question so far:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43028\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/reacht-shopping-ban-results.gif\" alt=\"reacht shopping ban results\" width=\"413\" height=\"202\" \/><strong>I\u00a0 genuinely thought the numbers would be reversed,<\/strong> with &#8220;No ways&#8221; being in the 50-70% range and the &#8220;in spirits&#8221; being in the 20% range. And then of course we have the nerds who actually enjoy having a life, pshh&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We had some pretty cool comments being sent over through the app too:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just paid off all my plastic and 2014 taxes owed, now everything except utility bills and some grocery $ is going right to savings and Roths!!

Bad attitude or dont do their responsibility money is deducted. So hey, I&#8217;m teaching money lessons!&#8221; &#8211; Melissa M.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s my birthday and I&#8217;m def going out to eat\/drink tonight and tomorrow&#8230; Just saying ;-)&#8221; &#8211; Joseph G.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Very very impressive&#8230;<\/strong> And if you notice the trend, those who are heavy on paying off debt &#8211; and accomplishing it &#8211; seem to be those who are gladly accepting the mission to keep the momentum going. They&#8217;re already used to &#8220;living on less&#8221; and now turning those debt payments into savings and want even MORE of that juicy $$ to hit their goals! What a beautiful thing!<\/p>\n<p>And I send love to all y&#8217;all who answered the poll too regardless of how you answered :) Just the fact you&#8217;re interested in continuing the $$ talk offline shows you&#8217;re in it to win it. It&#8217;s been a fun experiment so far, and would love for more of you to join us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now I don&#8217;t know how y&#8217;all are doing w\/ the ban so far, but I&#8217;ve already slipped up twice:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I got free coffee at an entrepreneurship meetup (score!) but then turned to find a strategically placed tip jar (Uh-oh&#8230;). I instinctively reached into my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/09\/wallet-crashers-1-j-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">money clip<\/a> to pull out a dollar as is customary, and as I&#8217;m literally dropping it into the jar I suddenly remember about the ban! ACK!!! &#8220;Does this count?&#8221; I ask myself real quick. &#8220;Is anyone looking at me right now??&#8221; I then think as I&#8217;m scanning the room&#8230; Ultimately I decide that yes, that dollar is going to be dropped into that jar so remove your grubby hands, please!, and no &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it should count towards breaking my ban because a) I find it&#8217;s important and respectable to do, and b) technically it would be a business expense as I&#8217;m there to network and grow my biz\/etc. Think that&#8217;s the right call?<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-top: 15px;\">I drove to McDonald&#8217;s as carefree as could be to buy my son his first Happy Meal. We had visitors in our house for the first time in probably 6 months, and after the kids worked up an appetite after running around our house 1,800 times, I was put in charge of take out. It never crossed my mind until late that night that I just broke the ban as I was so caught up in what a father I now feel like getting a Happy Meal for someone other than myself! Hah! So this one DEFINITELY broke the ban and I deserve a hard slap on the ass for it (also interesting to note &#8211; it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve eaten there in maybe a year?)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>All things considered, 1-2 breaks in almost a full week is actually pretty good.<\/strong> I won&#8217;t be winning any Perfect Awards anytime soon, but it&#8217;s important to remember that our brains take a while to adjust to such a new &#8211; and sometimes drastic &#8211; mindset when its so used to humming along status quo. That doesn&#8217;t mean we should get lax in our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/02\/no-shopping-ban-reacht-app\/\" target=\"_blank\">No Shopping mission<\/a> here, but just to keep in mind we&#8217;ll screw up and to try and be more conscious about it in the future.<\/p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t any of you give up just yet!! Still got a handful of weeks left! :)<\/p>\n<h2>My biggest expense costs me <em>WHAT<\/em> now?<\/h2>\n<p>Horrible segue, but over the weekend I also put together a bunch of numbers for a meeting come up with my accountant (that&#8217;s right &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/do-you-tackle-your-own-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\">I pay a person to do our taxes<\/a> and wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way!), and in doing so I saw that big scary number of how much we paid for daycare last year.<\/p>\n<p>It pains me to even type the numbers out right now, but here goes&#8230; (holds back vomit). Last year we spent over $16,000!<em><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> <em><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$16,951.00<\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/em> to be exact, ugh&#8230; Now we&#8217;ve already covered all the reasons why we have our kids there so I don&#8217;t want to rehash that again, but the takeaway here is that it&#8217;s a large freaking number and you can do a LOT of other amazing things with it instead if you were fortunate enough to do so.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>And this is where our &#8220;what can we afford instead?&#8221; game comes in.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a chance to have some fun and play a little &#8220;what if&#8221; action so you don&#8217;t go and beat yourself up too bad.\u00a0 Even though, of course, you DO need to sit back and reflect on such spending to make sure it still makes sense in your current situation and you&#8217;re not just getting complacent. In our case it does right now, but only for another month or two until the wifey finishes grad school and we change up a huge chunk of our lives.<\/p>\n<p>[FYI: this is partly why <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/02\/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet\/\" target=\"_blank\">my early retirement spreadsheet<\/a> says I can&#8217;t hit financial freedom until I&#8217;m 54!
