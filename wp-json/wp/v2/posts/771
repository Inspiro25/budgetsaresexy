It&#8217;s great to know that I am not forced to work out housing and other living expenses all on my own; however, even with this &#8220;safety net&#8221; of sorts, I still strive to maintain my own expenses as much as possible.  My husband may be &#8220;Mr. Money&#8221; on this blog, but I try not to call him that at home &#8211; wouldn&#8217;t want to crouch his fiscal style if I can avoid it!  ;)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Many of you may be aware of how we generally operate financially as a married couple.  <\/span>Typically, we get our paychecks deposited into our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/01\/to-combine-or-not-to-combine-finances.html\">separate personal accounts<\/a>, and we each deposit a certain amount of these into a &#8220;common account&#8221; for home-related items like the mortgage, groceries, etc.  This worked out great when I was working with a full-time job, but as a student, my tiny TA stipend just isn&#8217;t enough to cover the same <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/12\/how-were-putting-mrs-through-grad.html\">monthly needs<\/a>.  Thanks to personal savings, some <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/08\/we-just-became-members-of-pay-it.html\">financial help from family<\/a>\/selling off some inherited stocks, I was able to put together a good chunk of money to pay off my &#8220;share&#8221; of the common expenses for most of the first year or so of my being in school (much of which is noted in the &#8220;cash savings&#8221; area of J&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/02\/net-worth-january-down-down-down-says.html\">net worth updates<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>As with any savings, however, they start to dwindle when you actually need to use the money! Thus, I have made a tremendous effort during my grad-student days to continue to build up my portion of the &#8220;home fund&#8221; for the duration of my schooling.  Below are a few of my favorite frugal-living tips on a grad student (or any kind of student) basis:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Save, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/12\/5-financial-tips-for-college.html\">save<\/a>, save.<\/span>  It&#8217;s the same tip that everyone tells you, and there&#8217;s a good reason for that: It&#8217;s just hands-down the most important.  Since my portion of our &#8220;shared&#8221; expenses comes out of the stockpile of cash I accrued before starting school, the rest of my salary (a whopping $12K annually), almost entirely goes directly into my savings account.  If I have an immediate personal expense, I pay for it out of this money, but otherwise, it&#8217;s all stuffed into my own &#8220;home fund in waiting&#8221; account.  <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conserve your travel expenses.<\/span>  If you&#8217;re a commuting student, trying to condense your class schedule into 2 or 3 days a week can save a ton on daily commuting costs. <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Keep an eye out for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/09\/how-to-pay-rent-by-volunteering-for.html\">extra work<\/a> opportunities. <\/span> If you can find some good RA or TA jobs on campus, even the pittance that these jobs pay can definitely add up in the end &#8211; I think I added a solid $3K to my salary last year based on RA jobs alone.  (Just remember not to take on more work than you can handle!) <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/08\/halfcom-amazon-overstock-college.html\">NEVER buy your textbooks at full price<\/a>.<\/span>  EVER.  Go through Amazon, Half.com, or any other online textbook source &#8211; or if you don&#8217;t need to keep your books, get them from your campus library! Take the extra time to shop around for good book deals; it def. pays off in the long run.  <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Avoid falling into the campus Starbucks\/fast food\/vending machine traps.<\/span> Pack snacks, drinks, and a lunch from home as often as possible.  <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Alcohol can be a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/11\/my-wallet-gets-beer-goggles-too.html\">major drain<\/a> on expenses when you&#8217;re in college.<\/span>  Though this would apply more to most undergraduate than graduate students, my advice would be to A) drink less, B) drink cheaper stuff, or C) drink at home or at a friend&#8217;s house.  If you must go out on the town, options A or B can at least keep the cost at a more manageable level! <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Become well-versed in the art of window shopping.<\/span>  And if you&#8217;re shopping online, make use of the &#8220;save for later&#8221; option instead of buying things on impulse.  You&#8217;d be surprised how waiting a couple of days can give you the necessary perspective on whether or not you &#8220;really need&#8221; a certain item.  <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All in all, life as a grad student doesn&#8217;t have to be a total sacrifice &#8211; besides, so much of your time is spent on schoolwork that you tend not to worry about a ton of frivolous spending anyway! Just stay focused, save as much as possible and remember that light at the end of the tunnel. Now back to the paper-writing cave I go&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guest post by Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy ;) Life as a graduate student is notoriously tough.
