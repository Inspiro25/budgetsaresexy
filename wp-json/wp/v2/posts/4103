(Notice all the ads over there on the right).<\/p>\n<p>But online ventures are only a SLIVER of what&#8217;s out there.\u00a0 People have been hustlin&#8217; for hundreds and thousands of years and there&#8217;s always a way to make more money if you really put your heart into it.<\/p>\n<p>So today we&#8217;re starting a new series called the &#8220;<strong><em>Side Hustle Series<\/em><\/strong>,&#8221; and the only purpose it&#8217;s gonna serve is to show ya&#8217;ll how many OTHER ways there are out there to bring in that extra cash. And what better way to showcase these than by sharing the written accounts from the hustlers themselves? You may not like or even think about doing any of these, but they&#8217;re all real-life stories of people making trying to make that extra money. And sometimes it doesn&#8217;t always work out!\u00a0 It can really take some trail and error to maximize those profits.

In Quicken I classify them as pets, but my real intent is that they provide us food, compost our leftovers from the kitchen and provide our garden with fertilizer.<\/p>\n<p>This past Spring I decided to jump into chicken farming with both feet and raise not only laying chickens but chickens for meat too.\u00a0 Now, if you were to talk to most farmers they would tell you its hard work, never a day off.\u00a0 I get bored easily with projects I start and I don\u2019t \u2018love\u2019 hard labor, in fact I can be a bit whiny at times.\u00a0 Yet this Summer I became a chicken farmer and I\u2019m trying to make some money from it.<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/O-MsO9DhkTo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/O-MsO9DhkTo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the breakdown of how it worked out:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>Will it make $?:<\/strong><\/span> This year was a test.\u00a0 By the end of the season I would know a lot more about chicken farming and if I liked it I\u2019d be all set to go into larger production for Spring 2011. I created a spreadsheet and put in all the costs and the potential revenue.\u00a0 What I saw was the more chicken, the more profit.\u00a0 When I ran the numbers it looked like I would break even at about 100 chickens.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/baby-chick.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 2px 0pt; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/baby-chick.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"baby chick\" width=\"250\" height=\"339\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>March- Order the chickens: <\/strong><\/span> In March I ordered my first batch of 25 chickens. I ordered \u2018slow-grow\u2019 Cornish Rock chickens because they can survive at over 7000 feet above sea level which is where I live.\u00a0 They are bred to be ready to harvest after 10-12 weeks.\u00a0 The \u2018fast-grow\u2019 variety used in most industrial farms mature in 6-7 weeks.\u00a0 They don\u2019t do so well at our altitude and I don\u2019t need my chickens keeling over from heart attacks.\u00a0 \u00a0I built a brooder for raising chicks in the chicken coop and waited.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>April-<\/strong><strong> Building<\/strong><strong> infrastructure:<\/strong><\/span> My husband, Michael, and I built two mobile chicken pens.\u00a0 At three weeks old I\u2019ll move the chicks from their nursery in the coop to the mobile pens. \u00a0In the pens they will get moved around the yard every day to a fresh patch of grass.\u00a0 The grass and bugs will supplement their feed while their <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/sell-your-poop-%f0%9f%92%a9-for-money\/\">poop<\/a> will fertilize our land.\u00a0 We were able to build the pens from materials we had laying around so it cost us nothing.\u00a0 We are reading up on the subject of processing chickens and my husband, who likes to read reference books for fun, is starting to build a chicken plucker. \u00a0Pluckers can cost up to $1200 retail. Not something we want to invest in for an experimental chicken farmer. If his homemade plucker isn\u2019t working by the time these chicks are ready we\u2019ll have to do it by hand.\u00a0 Our chicks arrive late April and were in good shape although I got shorted\u00a0two chicks. Day two I checked in on the brooder and it was full of active little chicks except for one who had moved on to chicken heaven.\u00a0 It happens.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>May- Full time farmer:<\/strong><\/span> I quit my job (Whoo-hoo! Now I can farm full time!).\u00a0 This was not the plan but my husband knew it was inevitable.\u00a0 This weekend the chicks will be 3 weeks old and big enough to come out of the brooder and into the new pen.\u00a0 Thank god, because yesterday I ordered 50 more and I\u2019ll need the brooder for them!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>Mid May- Predators:<\/strong><\/span> The coyotes have moved in and eaten two of our chickens.\u00a0 A little coyote education:\u00a0 Coyotes have their pups in February.\u00a0 They feverishly feed them through May traveling up to 3 miles to find food. Once they find a good supply of food (my chickens) they move in and don\u2019t leave until the supply is depleted.\u00a0 This could include my cats and two small dogs.\u00a0 Along with the coyotes a raccoon has taken up residence and is enjoying the fruits of our chicken labor.\u00a0 I spend the week \u2018battening down the hatches\u2019 of the mobile pens.\u00a0 They are much more difficult to move now because I have surrounded each one with 18 cinder blocks.\u00a0 \u00a0Moving the pens daily was one chore the kids could do on their own.\u00a0 Now I will have to help them, but I will be getting my weight bearing exercise!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/securing-mobile-chicken-pen.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 2px 0pt; float: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/securing-mobile-chicken-pen.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"securing mobile chicken pen\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>June- Processing:<\/strong><\/span> We butchered our first chickens.\u00a0 We\u2019re down to 14 from the original 25 I had ordered thanks to predators and other mishaps.\u00a0 We processed 7 one day and 7 the next.\u00a0 The plucker is working great but since we are new its slow going.\u00a0 The rains are coming and already we had to move the pens in a panic during a heavy downpour so they wouldn\u2019t get submerged in water.\u00a0 We can still hear the coyotes but the pens seem to be holding up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>July- Wrapping Up:<\/strong><\/span> This weekend Michael and I spent two full days butchering and dressing the last 50 of our meat chickens. \u00a0Believe it or not, it was fun, lots of work, but fun. \u00a0I felt like I was finally getting the hang of how to dress the chicken about midway through (I still leave the killing to Michael). \u00a0When I first met Michael, meat was not something I ate regularly. \u00a0I had probably cut into a piece of\u00a0raw chicken meat twice. \u00a0I\u2019m not exaggerating. \u00a0I was not a vegetarian; I just got a bit squeamish when the meat came out. \u00a0Now I can pull the lungs out of a chicken in record time.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming my labor was free here\u2019s how it turned out:<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"300\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"121\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"><strong>Description<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"><strong>Pric<\/strong>e<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"121\" valign=\"top\">75 Chicks<\/td>\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\">-$162<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"121\" valign=\"top\">Equipment<\/td>\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\">-$269<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"121\" valign=\"top\">Feed<\/td>\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\">-$371<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"121\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"><strong>Total Cost<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"><strong>-$802<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"121\" valign=\"top\">Chicken Sales<\/td>\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\">$891<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"121\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"><strong>Net Gain<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"><strong>$89<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<strong>Raising our own chickens to eat has been a huge learning experience for me.<\/strong> It lasted about 3 months from the time the first babies arrived to butchering the last batch. \u00a0My goal was to get closer to my food and see if it could turn into a bit of supplemental income. \u00a0I did get much closer to my food and am still able to eat it (something I thought I might give up on).\u00a0 Did it give us additional income? \u00a0Well&#8230; yes, but not much.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>Interesting in reading more?\u00a0 Check out Molly&#8217;s chicken blog here: <a href=\"http:\/\/chickentopia.wordpress.com\/\">Chickentopia<\/a>, or hit up her personal finance blog: <a href=\"http:\/\/mollyonmoney.com\/\">Molly on Money<\/a>.
