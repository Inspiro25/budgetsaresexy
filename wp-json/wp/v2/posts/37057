It&#8217;s now been 3 years since that fateful day of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\">being let go<\/a> and jumping into blogging full-time<\/strong> (anyone still reading from 2010?), and as we cross the 6 Million page view mark, I can&#8217;t express how grateful I am to still be here.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Who knew a blog could change your life?? :)<\/p>\n<p>Throughout these past few years however &#8211; and really, the past 6 overall &#8211; I&#8217;ve learned a lot and continue to do so almost every single day. I haven&#8217;t seen anything evolve so fast as the internet&#8217;s been doing this past decade, and I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re all here right now taking advantage of it :)<\/p>\n<h2>Here are a handful of things I&#8217;ve learned over the years:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s incredibly rewarding being able to do what you love every day.<\/li>\n<li>Even though half of the stuff I do is just as annoying as the stuff everyone else has to do :)<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s often more stressful than a &#8220;regular&#8221; job too &#8211; at least those I&#8217;ve ever had. (Especially when you&#8217;re the sole provider for your family)<\/li>\n<li>And speaking of family, they pretty much think you goof off all day and will call\/drop by anytime they want because apparently when you&#8217;re home that means you&#8217;re not working.<\/li>\n<li>But that can be fun sometimes too :)<\/li>\n<li>And can give you a nice break from hustling 24\/7.<\/li>\n<li>Which is probably the hardest part of the job &#8211; there&#8217;s no &#8220;turning it off&#8221; switch.<\/li>\n<li>But it is awesome to be able to set your own schedule.<\/li>\n<li>And work in your pjs. (though warning: you always feel\/are less productive when doing so)<\/li>\n<li>Lately, it&#8217;s also starting to get a bit lonely (I work from home).<\/li>\n<li>And going to coffee shops only takes you so far.<\/li>\n<li>I also have to continually remind myself that work is <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/11\/how-much-money-really-matter\/\">not the most important thing<\/a> in the world.<\/li>\n<li>Nor is my &#8220;brand&#8221; or <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/budgetsaresexy\" target=\"_blank\">twitter<\/a> account, or anything else us bloggers obsess aver. (See also: stats)<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s wonderful being recognized in your own field, but I&#8217;m thankful it doesn&#8217;t carry over into the &#8220;real&#8221; world. No one knows, or even cares, who you are offline &#8211; it&#8217;s freeing.<\/li>\n<li>Also, I&#8217;ve stopped telling people I&#8217;m a blogger when asked what &#8220;I do.&#8221; They never understand, so now it&#8217;s &#8220;online consultant.&#8221; No one knows what that is either, but they always shake their\u00a0 heads in agreement and move on to the real reason they asked: so they can tell you what THEY do ;)<\/li>\n<li>With freedom, also comes analysis paralysis. It&#8217;s often times hard to focus when there&#8217;s no limits.<\/li>\n<li>On the plus side, when you finally DO know what you want to harness your energy on, you can start doing so *right* away.<\/li>\n<li>But the money flows all over the place, so it&#8217;s important to stash it away when the times are good. There&#8217;s less stability working for yourself.<\/li>\n<li>On the flip side, the rewards can be much better. I once made $22,000 over a weekend for probably 12 hours of work. (And then, 2 years later, lost $8,000 on a new idea\/project).<\/li>\n<li>You can deduct a lot more than you think with a home office too.<\/li>\n<li>And you feel like you&#8217;re in a &#8220;special&#8221; little club with other entrepreneurs. Even though it&#8217;s just as &#8220;special&#8221; as any other job out there ;) (If we had signs on our fronts saying who was self-employed, we&#8217;d give each other high fives when walking by each other &#8211; similar to how motorcyclists and jeep owners acknowledge each other on the road)<\/li>\n<li>But you also have to deal with insurance and quarterly taxes for having the pleasure.<\/li>\n<li>And doubting yourself, then praising yourself, and then doubting yourself all over again.<\/li>\n<li>When you become successful at one project, you also think you&#8217;re going to be successful on all of them (you&#8217;re not).<\/li>\n<li>And you fail a lot more times than you succeed.<\/li>\n<li>But, the times you succeed make you forget about all the failures! ;)<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s definitely not for the faint of heart.<\/li>\n<li>Nor, for *everyone* &#8211; contrary to what many entrepreneurs like to say.<\/li>\n<li>Working for yourself is not the only way to define success either. What makes you <em>HAPPY<\/em>, does. At least to me&#8230; In career, love, and life in general.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>So, I&#8217;ve pretty much learned a lot over the years :)<\/strong> And I honestly couldn&#8217;t tell you where I&#8217;ll be this time next year, or any of the years afterwards for that matter. I love my job, but I also love a bunch of other stuff in life too (and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/all-30-jobs-ive-ever-done\/\" target=\"_blank\">I&#8217;m no stranger to switching jobs!<\/a> ;))<\/p>\n<p>What I DO know, however, is that <em>I just want to be happy<\/em>. Whatever that looks like. Right now that means working for myself and continuing to grow our family, but perhaps it&#8217;ll look different later. Perhaps I&#8217;ll go back to 9-5 one day, or maybe I&#8217;ll continue blogging for the next 30 years when it&#8217;s not even called blogging any more. Who knows&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>But right now? I am happy. <\/strong>And blessed to be able to write a post like this. I never saw this lifestyle coming, but the world works in mysterious ways if you keep your eyes open. And that&#8217;s probably the biggest lesson learned throughout this whole experience: being prepared for when opportunity knocks (and *knowing* when it&#8217;s indeed an opportunity, too).<\/p>\n<p>Thank you guys so much for being a part of this journey with me throughout the years! And supporting all my crazy projects! :) You can&#8217;t have blogs (professionally)\u00a0without readers, so I thank you from the bottom of my heart.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"border: 0px;\" alt=\"j. money signature\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/main\/j-money-signature.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"34\" \/><br \/>\n&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>Word-press photo by <a title=\"J.
