This is measured by taking the ratio of your net worth and dividing it by your annual expenses. So if you have a net worth of $100,000 and your annual expenses are $25,000, your score is 4. Alternatively you can have a negative score if you have a negative net worth, someone who owes more to others than the cumulative total of all their personal assets.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pay no attention to that &#8220;proposal&#8221; part, a minor formality at this point.<\/strong> What <a href=\"http:\/\/jlyblog.wordpress.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">jly224<\/a> has come up with (his real name, btw) is the next Big Thing to hit personal finance since Dave Ramsey &#8211; I&#8217;m calling it now. When you&#8217;re discussing this with your kids 20 years from now, you can tell them you were one of the first to know about this, courtesy of your billionaire friend J. Money ;)<\/p>\n<p>In all seriousness though, I agree this is a much better score to keep track of than your credit one. Sure it&#8217;s a necessary evil and we&#8217;ve gotta make sure it looks okay for that next time we finance a car\/house\/spaceship (those things are expensive!), but watching your net worth and expenses can do you much better over the years.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s two reasons why:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your net worth gives you an overall snapshot of your money.<\/strong> Your credit score gives you an overall score on how much cheaper you can take on debt.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your expenses tells you how much you&#8217;re leaking every month.<\/strong> Your credit score tells you that at least you&#8217;re leaking it with less interest. (That is if you&#8217;ve got a good score. If not, it&#8217;s laughing at you while punching you in the &#8216;nads)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I also like this score tracks a ratio vs credit history too, since you can have a great credit score but still have lots of debt and\/or no savings\/investments\/worth whatsoever. Whereas with this new &#8220;proposed&#8221; PF Score it gives you a much more accurate financial picture.<\/p>\n<p>Again, Fico scores are still important because companies need to know how trustworthy you are with your money (though I had a good laugh when jly224 mentioned: &#8220;I have to give the banks credit here for coming up with a great money making idea&#8221;), but it doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t track both.<\/p>\n<h2>So step #1 is to figure out your net worth<\/h2>\n<p>You probably already know this number if you&#8217;ve been a reader of this blog for more than 2 days (I tend to shove this down people&#8217;s throat, but that&#8217;s only because I care! ;)) but if you haven&#8217;t, here&#8217;s the general equation: <em>Assets &#8211; Liabilities = Net Worth<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Now what entails an &#8220;asset&#8221; or &#8220;liability&#8221; is totally up to you &#8211; some people include their cars, homes, personal effects, while others ignore them all, even their retirement accounts! (crazy, I know) &#8211; but it&#8217;s really whatever you think is important to track. You can use simple excel spreadsheets to document it all too, like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/budgets\/j_budget_template.xls\" target=\"_blank\">the one I created and use<\/a> every month, or you can use programs such as <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/mint\" target=\"_blank\">Mint.com<\/a> or even <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital-whats-your-pf-score\" target=\"_blank\">Personal Capital <\/a>which I hear does an excellent job.<\/p>\n<p>Then for fun you can compare your net worth with dozens of personal finance bloggers out there with my nifty <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/blogger-net-worths\/\" target=\"_blank\">Net Worth Tracker<\/a> post I created last week ;) You can see what others are doing to grow their numbers, as well as those higher &#8211; and lower &#8211; than you for some prime gawking. But that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re allowed to do. No getting down on yourself or anything &#8211; the only number that matters is YOURS!<\/p>\n<h2>Next, it&#8217;s time to find your average spending<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully you&#8217;re already tracking this stuff too, whether in those same <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/07\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\">excel spreadsheets<\/a> or other budget tracking software (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ynab\" target=\"_blank\">YNAB<\/a>, maybe?), and all you have to do is pop open the screen and add some numbers together. Or if you&#8217;re a super nerd like me, you&#8217;ve already got it engrained in your head while obsessively trying to lower it every other second ;)<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, once you&#8217;ve got those two numbers it&#8217;s time to play ball. As a refresher, here&#8217;s the ratio again: <strong>Net Worth \/ Annual Expenses = PF Score<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now you know what&#8217;s coming next (I&#8217;m about to ask you to run the numbers and divulge your own score!), but as always I&#8217;ll never ask you to do something that I wouldn&#8217;t do first. So, let&#8217;s run my numbers, shall we?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>My net worth: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/02\/net-worth-update-january-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\">$433,149.74<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>My annual expenses: <strong>$66,000<\/strong> (ugh.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Making my Personal Finance Score&#8230;. bum bum bum&#8230; a hefty <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>6.56<\/strong><\/span>!
