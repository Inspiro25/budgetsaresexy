We&#8217;ve been talking about moving for the past 3 years now, and for whatever reason it finally clicked in our head and we actually pulled the trigger.<\/p>\n<p>IT FEELS SO GOOD!!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the progress from start to finish for those who&#8217;ve missed it:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/and-were-off-time-to-get-our-house-rented-out\/\">We decide to finally move and put our home up for rent<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/we-found-a-new-place-to-live\/\">We find a new home to rent!<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/moving-all-our-stuff-out-this-weekend\/\">We move everything out of our old house and into storage<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/new-home-renovation-costs-18000\/\">We decide to spend $18,000 on renovations<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/now-living-with-mother-in-law\/\">We live with my mother-in-law for a few weeks :)<\/a><\/li>\n<li>We move into our new home! YAY!!!!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Awesome awesome awesome. I don&#8217;t know what comes next in this grand scheme of ours (the plan is to live here for just one year until the wife finishes her dissertation), but either way the rest is just secondary. We&#8217;re living our dream *right now* and I&#8217;m soaking it all up as much as I possibly can :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a list of the things we&#8217;ve gotten into so far in the 3 days we&#8217;ve lived here:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taken walks to the local cafes every morning (notice there&#8217;s multiple!)<\/li>\n<li>Hung out with local family every day (granted, half of that &#8220;hanging out&#8221; was them moving boxes and furniture into our house, haha, but still &#8211; quality time! ;))<\/li>\n<li>Taken baby $ to some new parks and walking paths<\/li>\n<li>Gone into the local pawn shop (had to check that out, of course)<\/li>\n<li>And really just explored as much as possible when taking breaks from unpacking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We still have a ton to do with getting the house in order and what not (I&#8217;m currently nudged in between 10 boxes and empty bookcases courtesy of my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/02\/j-money-target-diy-library\/\">blogging library<\/a> from the old place), but all that will come in time so I&#8217;m not too worried. The trick is eventually getting back into &#8220;work mode&#8221; so I don&#8217;t throw everything away chasing a new adventure out here! Haha&#8230;. which I&#8217;m only halfway really worried about ;) I gotta take advantage of working for myself sometimes, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another thing I&#8217;m cautiously watching is *how much we spend* on all these new walks\/cafes we&#8217;re now taking on.<\/strong> It&#8217;s amazing being able to walk everywhere now, but man &#8211; almost all the places we end up involve us handing over money! Haha&#8230; Perhaps that&#8217;ll fizzle out though once we get nice and settled and fazed away from vacation mode. Or maybe I&#8217;ll just budget it all in now ;)<\/p>\n<p>All I know is that this is one of the biggest changes we&#8217;ve taken on in quite some time, so I&#8217;m soaking it all in and enjoying as much of the process as I possibly can &#8211; even the frustrating ones. Like finding scratches all over our furniture cuz I suck at packing, or how one of the rooms here smells like something died in it! Ugh. (Good thing I don&#8217;t own it! :)) Not to mention how nervous we are now that our place is finally up to be rented and we have to start paying <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/new-home-renovation-costs-18000\/\">the multi-thousand dollar bills<\/a> for the upgrades we&#8217;ve done. What if no one likes it? What if we&#8217;re stuck paying for two homes?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lots and lots of scary stuff swirling around.<\/strong> But I wouldn&#8217;t change it for anything. Much better to feel alive and pursuing dreams than stuck in a rut just wishing, ya know? So we take it day by day and do our best to ride the waves as they come in.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be blogging about more rental stuff here as time goes on, as well as other things I&#8217;ve forgotten to update y&#8217;all about lately (like the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/car-considered-total-loss-by-insurance\/\">car situation<\/a>! Look for that tomorrow), but the word of the day is that yours truly is safe and sound and now officially a Southerner ;) I&#8217;ll tell you one thing &#8211; people are a LOT nicer here than they are in D.C.! They actually smile and wave to you when you walk by, haha&#8230; and not just cuz I look funny rocking a &#8216;hawk ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hope things are going well in your hood too! And your adventures are also coming along nicely! <\/strong>If I can ever help out with anything, don&#8217;t be afraid to give a shout. I don&#8217;t know everything, but I&#8217;m pretty good at giving opinions :)<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see ya back here again tomorrow&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>FYI:<\/strong> As you&#8217;ve probably noticed, we haven&#8217;t shared what city we&#8217;ve moved to.
