And you &#8220;just never know&#8221; when it&#8217;ll be your lucky day! &#8220;Someone has to win it!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Here were some other wild stats from <a href=\"https:\/\/lendedu.com\/blog\/how-much-do-americans-spend-on-the-lottery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the study<\/a> too:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Americans spent $71,826,676,000 on the lottery in 2017 which is more than video games ($43.8B), movies ($11.89B), and concerts ($8B) combined&#8221; &lt;&#8212; WOW!!!<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Massachusettsans spent the most on the lottery at $737.01 per capita, which equates to nearly 2% of their annual household income&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Rhode Island, Delaware, and New York were the next three biggest spenders, at $502.01, $475.75, and $426.27 per capita, respectively? (What is going on with the NorthEast??! Haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And then my favorite:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;After we bought $1,000 worth of scratch-off tickets for the third consecutive year, our winning percentage from this year was 22.93% compared to last year\u2019s 22.61% and the first year\u2019s 21.62%. We can confidently say that your chance of winning on scratch-off tickets is ~22%.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Had to laugh hard at that last one as I used to do experiments like this all the time back in the day myself ;)<\/strong> Though fortunately I only had the cajones (and patience) to try <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/100-scratch-off-lottery-project\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$100 experiments<\/a> vs $1,000 ones which was way more than enough to satisfy my curiosity, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And once we even raised over $200 for charity! &#8211;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/results-of-100-scratch-off-lottery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The results of the $100 Scratch Off Lottery Project<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/results-of-100-scratch-off-lottery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61401\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/100-lottery-scratchers.jpg\" alt=\"100 lotto cratchers\" width=\"564\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/100-lottery-scratchers.jpg 762w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/100-lottery-scratchers-300x269.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/a><em>(I couldn&#8217;t&#8217; even get the tickets to fit in that picture to the right!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how my &#8220;winnings&#8221; came out on that one, which consisted of playing one hundred $1.00 holiday scratch-off tickets:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>12 $1.00 winners<\/li>\n<li>4 $2.00 winners<\/li>\n<li>2 $3.00 winners<\/li>\n<li>2 $6.00 winners<\/li>\n<li>Grand total winnings: $38.00<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So pretty much the *opposite* of impressive, and clocked us in at a flat <em><strong>20% winning percentage<\/strong><\/em>, which is both worse than the odds the lottery states (1 in 4.21), as well as the results from LendEDU&#8217;s tests&#8230; And it only got more annoying when I asked them how much *money* they won in their last test ;)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi J.,<\/p>\n<p>We won $2,858 on this year&#8217;s $1,000 test.<\/p>\n<p>The years prior we lost a slight amount of money each time.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Triple their money!!! WOW!!! And way different sounding than a &#8220;23% success rate&#8221; haha&#8230; Not that that was the point of the email or anything, but still&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>While we didn&#8217;t come close to bringing home that much in our experiment though (or even breaking even, for that matter!), I did <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/results-of-100-scratch-off-lottery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">take away a few things<\/a> that ultimately ended up affecting my favorite pastime once and for all:<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the TL;DR version:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sometimes it\u2019s more exciting <em>thinking<\/em> about things than actually doing them<\/strong>. The idea of <em>playing<\/em> 100 lottery tickets far exceeded the joy of scratching them!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gambling brings out the emotions in you!<\/strong> I was a hot mess by the end of the 1 and 1\/2 hours it took to go through them all, and then ended up with a major headache to cap it off.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Giving back is contagious.<\/strong> It was meant to be just a fun little project we did over one weekend to raise a few bucks and awareness, but after someone jumped in and offered to match our total winnings, it prompted others to do the same and our $38 original donation quickly ended up becoming $222! Which wasn&#8217;t too bad for a fledgling new blog at the time! :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>And then lastly, there really can be too much of a good thing.<\/strong> As I mentioned above, I used to LOVE playing the lottery casually for fun, and even though I rarely won it was still a much more enjoyable experience than playing a ton of them all at once. Similar one might say with consuming drinks of alcoholic nature, where one or two a night might hit the spot, but saving them all up to the end of the weekend can have a drastically different effect, haha&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Still, a fun project to try back in the day, and I&#8217;m probably much better for it now ;)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How about you though?
