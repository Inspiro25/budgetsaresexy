This is a memorable purchase for me which really surprised me.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that I have been rethinking is how much I get out of what I purchase. For an example, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-were-your-most-memorable-purchases-this-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your Goodwill story<\/a>. I love Goodwill and shop there all the time. I know you can get great deals there.<\/p>\n<p>Last year I met up with a life insurance agent who cleared $300k last year and he was telling me how he bought these suits at $1k-$3k price points. I was shocked and told myself I would never. Clothes depreciate. What a waste.<\/p>\n<p>Then it struck me. He made almost 3x money as me last year! Maybe he understands something I do not. I still shop at Goodwill, but I started buying very nice and expensive Polo shirts after this thought struck me. Direct from Polo at $80 a piece. I thought if I presented myself better and opened stronger with a new nice Polo shirt it might help me generate more business like my friend.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a realtor and as soon as I did this I started getting much more respect and picking up clients at a faster rate. I just inked a contract for a $340k property from one of my last open house leads. That\u2019s a $10k commission check from an $80 shirt purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, some may say that it\u2019s just in my head and maybe I got lucky, but the reality is that I <em>did<\/em> feel more confident in my abilities to close more business for myself. I feel that&#8217;s 100% worth it.<\/p>\n<p>If I was on the outside watching myself buy a piece of clothing for $80 I would shake my head and think how superficial. But now I have been buying branded t-shirts that say &#8220;Realtor\u201d, &#8220;Real Estate Agent&#8221;, &#8220;I sell real estate,\u201d etc and still to this day when I order off eBay I cringe. I never have paid $20-$40 per shirt as most of my clothes have always been hand me downs from growing up in a family of 6! And I\u2019m the Goodwill guy like you.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, the opportunity for my business and ROI from being a walking billboard and spending just a little bit more to \u201credeem\u201d a depreciating asset is amazing to me. This took me by surprise, and made me think to myself that maybe cheap is not always best in every circumstance. I feel strongly that if I had worn my Goodwill polo shirt at that last open house it would have been more difficult for me to close that deal.<\/p>\n<p>I always used to wonder why the Uber rich purchase things that don&#8217;t make the most sense to the rest of us, but maybe your money really is a mirror of your priorities. By prioritizing my appearance and professional image and nothing more, I was able to pick up more clients for my business.<\/p>\n<p>What are your thoughts around this?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what I wrote back, which may surprise you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think you could be very right on that!<\/p>\n<p>And even if it IS just in your head, does it really matter since business is booming?! :) I&#8217;d be buying $80 shirts left and right too if I was experiencing that, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So I say keep going with it and see how far you can take it. What does your car look like for example? Whenever I see realtors in Beemers and Benzes I&#8217;m always thinking they&#8217;re much more successful\/skillful whether it&#8217;s the truth or not.<\/p>\n<p>In areas where perceptions matter like in realty\/sales\/etc I def. think it&#8217;s worth &#8220;putting on a show&#8221; more, so long as it doesn&#8217;t go overboard. You only need so much to milk 90% of the rewards, and you could pick up a 7 or 8 year old luxury car for the same as you can a normal car but get that &#8220;oomph&#8221; out of it.<\/p>\n<p>So yeah man &#8211; I&#8217;m with you! Sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/bad-excuses-to-spend-money-%f0%9f%92%b5-%f0%9f%a4%b7%e2%80%8d%e2%99%82%ef%b8%8f-%f0%9f%92%b5\/\">spending money<\/a> really DOES help you make money in the end. Just gotta know *where* to spend it :)<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see if you can get close to that $300k this year!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p>We went back and forth a little bit more (turns out he already rocks a luxury car), but that was the gist of it all. Spending more in order to gain more &#8211; in this case with business. It sounds stupid and really <em>shouldn&#8217;t<\/em> matter at all what you wear\/drive\/etc, but perception is a silly thing and sometimes you have to play the game.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My thoughts on it anyways. Ever catch yourself spending more in certain areas to get better results?! Whether in career or goals or *cough* love?<\/strong> What do you wear on a first date &#8211; your everyday duds or your nicer ones? ;)<\/p>\n<p>I remember <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/all-30-jobs-ive-ever-done\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">being a realtor<\/a> myself years ago and how lame I looked rolling around in my bright yellow Ford Mustang when I was trying to get people to take me seriously. I had no problem with those who already knew me (my only sales! Hah!), but I guarantee I would have been more successful had I *looked* the part more. Thank God I had normal hair at least!<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, it eventually led me to becoming a professional blogger which ironically means wearing unprofessional clothes too, haha, so this stuff can work in the opposite way as well :) The trick is knowing what makes you more credible in people&#8217;s eyes and then taking advantage of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Agree?
