Upon picking it up I discovered it was not actually a $100 bill but somebody&#8217;s business card made to look like a folded up bill. On the other side it says &#8220;you want the real thing? Visit my website at etc. etc.&#8221;. While walking to my building I saw 20 more just like it scattered all over the place. Creative idea, although I am not sure if it is legal. I was also disappointed that it was not the real thing, so I threw it away once I realized I had been tricked. One of the potential drawbacks to this marketing strategy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Haha.. Yes, probably not good to piss off your potential clients before you even grab them ;)<\/strong> Though it is clever! Unlike that wannabe pimp though, a true gentleman uses REAL dollar bills when marketing his business. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-money-biz-card.jpg\">*Ahem*<\/a>. It may not be a cool hundred in your pockets, but at least it warms your heart faster ;) Now as far as the legal part, I&#8217;d like to think it falls under that &#8220;gray area&#8221; everyone talks about&#8230; The legal tender can still be used after a few doodles, so it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m destroying gov&#8217;t property, ya know? I prefer to not test them out though and bring it to their attention, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>This also reminds of a time back in high school when we were learning about accounting and how to write a check\/etc (I wonder if they still teach that?), and I thought it would be a fun experiment to drop these fake blank checks around the halls to see if anyone would pick them up. And then, of course, think they were real and went on to cash it at a bank &#8211; for however much they deemed appropriate to steal ;) Looking back it was pretty mean of me considering you could get in SERIOUS trouble trying to cash in on fake money and commit fraud, but luckily no one took the bait and I quickly forgot about it the next day&#8230; At least I don&#8217;t <em>think<\/em> anyone tried?<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, while my friend above got fooled for a hot second and realized he was not the proud owner of a new $100 bill, there&#8217;s been plenty of times where we&#8217;ve all at some point come across REAL money on the ground for sure! I remember three such times very clearly:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>When I was 7 years old and found a $20 bill.<\/strong> Remember how your mom would always take you clothes shopping, but of course you never wanted to be in those stores in the first place? And would run and hide under all those coat racks so she couldn&#8217;t find you? (Or was that just a guy thing? ;)) Well, one of these times we were in some run down discount store and when I was hidden beneath a bunch of coats I found a crisp $20 bill beneath my feet. I felt like a millionaire!<\/li>\n<li><strong>When I was 18 and found handfuls of half dollars and other valuables.<\/strong> You know those theme parks that have lazy rivers and what not running through them so everyone can cool off in the Summer? And you jump on all those inner tubes and float down without any cares in the world? When all the adults were doing that, my teenage friends and I would hide under our tubes and scan the bottom of the pools searching for lost treasures like coins and jewelry ;) And we&#8217;d go around, and around, and around allllll day long inevitably either getting caught by the lifeguards (is that really illegal though?) or getting too water logged and not being able to see clearly for hours after that. Haha&#8230; it was awesome. And we&#8217;d literally find $20-$30 a piece at the end of it all, and many times half dollars for whatever reason. Once I found 7 of them all in one pile! Do you know how\u00a0 hard it is to grab that and hide them in your pockets?? It was hilarious&#8230; And another time we even found a diamond ring which we promptly returned to lost and found like good little Boy Scouts&#8230; We may take people&#8217;s money, but never their jewelry! ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>When I was 25 and found a bag of cash outside my car door.<\/strong> It was one of the strangest things I&#8217;ve ever come across, but on that one fateful day &#8211; out of alllll the open parking spots &#8211; I open my car door to go to Food Lion and a plastic bag full of wrapped dollar bills is laying there at my feet. At first I thought it had fallen out of MY car, but indeed I do not roll around with wads of cash like that, haha&#8230; After the shock wore off, I picked it up, looked all around me to see if it was a trick or if someone was gonna come hunt me down later and kill me (you never know!!), but I was the only person in sight and there were literally like 5 other cars in the entire parking lot which holds 500. It was surreal. The total amount that was in that bag? $82.00. Score!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember what the point of me telling you all this is today, haha, but it sure was fun going down memory lane ;) Maybe it was to always keep your eyes open for piles of money laying on the ground? Or to get creative when trying to market your business?<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Either way, what would be MORE interesting is hearing about your stories on finding free stuff!<\/strong><\/em> Would you be so kind as to share them with us today? Let&#8217;s see who&#8217;s found the most valuable thing out there! Maybe our weekend will be blessed with even more of it :)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oh man, today&#8217;s post already cracks me up and I haven&#8217;t even written it yet!
