Two weekends in a row now shopping up a storm, and I must say I feel like a 13 year old again when I used to rock the sales w\/ my mom back in the day (awwwwwww). Not only did she instill the love of a good bargain in my genes, but also the adventures of it all no matter where lived :) And being a military brat, we&#8217;ve hit up yard sales all across the world from California to Korea &#8211; with each one being just as exciting as the last cuz you never know what you&#8217;re gonna find!!<\/p>\n<p>To me, it&#8217;s like modern day treasure hunting :) And if that picture up there is any indication of what&#8217;s to come the rest of this yard sale season, you can bet your sweet ass I&#8217;ll be one happy blogger over here. It&#8217;s amazing what people don&#8217;t want anymore!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a list of all my steals over the weekend:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Realistic FM Concertmaster Stereo (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$15.00<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; This one I actually got at the Salvation Army after hitting the yard sales (which is why it cost a bit more), but it totally blew the pants off me when I plugged it in.\u00a0 For something that&#8217;s over 40 years old &#8211; and from Radioshack actually (hah!) &#8211; it sure does fill a room\u00a0 up :)\u00a0 And it fits nicely on the shelves of my new library &#8211; replacing the $150+ stereo I WAS gonna buy instead for it.\u00a0 Check out this awesome ad for it at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radiomuseum.org\/r\/radio_shac_realistic_fm_concertmast.html\">Radio Museum<\/a> which shows it used to sell for $70 bucks&#8230;. which was probably like $200 back then!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Old school books for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/02\/j-money-target-diy-library\/\">my library<\/a> (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$10.00<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; Love these!!\u00a0 Especially since I got them all bargained down from $3.00 a piece :)\u00a0 Here are the titles I picked up:\n<ul>\n<li><em>The American Claimant<\/em> by Mark Twain (1897)<\/li>\n<li><em>Stories From Dickens<\/em> by Walker McSpadden (1924)<\/li>\n<li><em>Gulliver&#8217;s Travels<\/em> by Jonathan Swift (1940)<\/li>\n<li><em>Travels With Charlie<\/em> by John Steinbeck (1962)<\/li>\n<li>and <em>Tom Sawyer<\/em> by Mark Twain (1962)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Redskins onesie! (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$0.50<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; Gotta make sure my boy knows who the best team in the league is ;)\u00a0 And maybe by the time he&#8217;s grown up enough to understand football, we&#8217;ll actually have a winning season! Haha&#8230; praying that RG3 does his magic!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Skull mug (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$1.00<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; From World Market, actually too &#8211; pretty sweet.\u00a0 I probably could have bargained it down a bit, but the Mrs. was giving me the evil eye so I had to hurry up and snatch it up before she told me not to&#8230; for some reason chicks don&#8217;t like skulls much ;)\u00a0 Which reminds me, I still have to pick up that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/02\/10-awesomely-manly-un-piggy-banks\/\">skull bank<\/a> we listed here a while back!\u00a0 Love that thing!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Indian knife set (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$3.50<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; This was probably my favorite find of the bunch &#8211; a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/93346754\/vintage-hand-carved-wood-knife-fork\">hand carved knife set<\/a> made in India back in the 60&#8217;s (I googled to find out) and each side of the sheath has either a knife or a two-prong fork thingie &#8211; with locks in place, and all. I was hoping it was worth more than the $20-$35 I saw it for sale online, but it&#8217;s still a nice piece to go on display for sure. Also in my library, haha&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>And then here&#8217;s the awesome currency stuff I picked up!<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$1.00 Silver Certificates (4 of them for only <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$9.00<\/span> total!)<\/strong> &#8211; I know I know, they&#8217;re technically only worth $1.00, haha, but in reality you can sell them for anywhere from $7-$15 ;) Which I probably won&#8217;t anyways since they&#8217;re nice additions to my currency collection &#8211; even though I actually found one in circulation (aka my pockets) the other year &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/08\/i-just-found-strange-yet-oddly-alluring\/\">remember that<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li><strong>1822 U.S. Penny (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$12.50<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; That thing is the size of a quarter! Haha&#8230; but pretty damn cool it&#8217;s almost 200 years old :) I found all these coins at this guy&#8217;s table that was set up at a flea market I came across while yard sale&#8217;ing.\u00a0 The guy had been collecting for 50 years now, how crazy is that??\u00a0 Everything he had was marked down 50% off of &#8220;value,&#8221; but obviously no one really pays full price anyways.\u00a0 Was fun chatting with him for a handful of minutes though and learning too :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>1621 Spanish Reale\/Copper (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$7.50<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; This was one of my favorite of the coins because of *how* they used to make them: they&#8217;d mold the circles themselves, and then stamp the two sides w\/ the seals and info :)\u00a0 So they&#8217;re a lot more raised than the coins we have in modern day.\u00a0 But can you imagine?\u00a0 Holding something that&#8217;s 400 years old?\u00a0 I love this stuff.<\/li>\n<li><strong>1665 Spanish coin\u00a0 (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$2.50<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I believe it all the way, but apparently this thing had been found in an old ship wreck off the coast of Guam I wanna say (I think that&#8217;s what he told me?). I feel like they should be worth a helluva lot more than a handful of bucks, but then again I know absolutely nothing about coin collecting &#8211; just that it&#8217;s fun :)\u00a0 And since I don&#8217;t have any old shipwreck coins, I&#8217;m gonna stick with the story, hehe&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>U.S. Liberty Copper Coin (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">$5.00<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; Nothing too special about this one other than it being 1 oz. of copper which I don&#8217;t own yet :)\u00a0 And a far cry from the $1,900 I spent on the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/03\/bought-first-gold-coin-us-mint\/\">1 oz of gold<\/a> last month! Haha&#8230; pretty crazy how metal can differ in value eh?<\/li>\n<li><strong>1904 Indian Head Penny (<span style=\"color: #008000;\">Free<\/span>)<\/strong> &#8211; Since I bought a handful of his coins, he just threw this one in for me :) It&#8217;s only worth <a href=\"http:\/\/coins.about.com\/library\/US-coin-values\/bl-US0001-Indian-Head-Penny-Values.htm\">a few bucks<\/a> at that, but another nice addition to my collection for sure.\u00a0 He was a really nice guy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/yard-sale-treasures.jpg\" alt=\"yard sale treasures\" width=\"500\" height=\"310\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>Pretty neat, huh?<\/strong>\u00a0 So it looks like I spent about $60 bucks this weekend on all kinds of goodness.\u00a0 All of which I could have easily done without, but all which also totally improves my life ;)\u00a0 Music, books, and money &#8211; what&#8217;s not to enjoy? Haha&#8230; oh! And football :)<\/p>\n<p>To top it all off, we then donated 5 large trash bags of clothes and un-wanted goodies to the Salvation Army &#8211; which probably paid for all of this and THEN some when it&#8217;s time to write it all off next year.\u00a0 So it stays within my &#8220;one in, one out&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/08\/living-minimalist-lifestyle-is-it\/\">minimalism endeavors<\/a> too.
