A Hypothetical Example&#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hey you. Do you want to invest in a real estate project with me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say I find a massive apartment complex for sale for $50 million. If we get a bank loan with 80% financing (borrowing $40 million), this makes our down payment only $10 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get the $10 million cash down payment, we just need to find<\/span><b> 200 people to put in $50,000 each<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To keep things fair, everybody will own an equal share in the investment and receive an equal share of the profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I estimate that the rental profit from the building (all revenue minus all expenses) will be $60,000 per month. If we divide this between our 200 investors, this means <\/span><b>$300 positive cash flow per person, per month<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That\u2019s about a <\/span><b>7.2% return per year <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8212; not bad!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better yet, I also project that when we go to sell the building in 5-7 years, we could sell it for $60 million. That\u2019d be a $10 million profit we can also share. So instead of giving all 200 investors their initial $50k investments back, they\u2019d all get <\/span><b>$100k returned after 5-7 years<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Double their money!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, what do you think? Am I completely nuts?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you regularly read this blog then you know that I\u2019m definitely nuts &#8230; but deals like this are actually quite common. They are happening all around us, all the time. They are referred to as real estate syndications or private placements.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is a Real Estate Syndication?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A syndication is just a fancy name for a partnership. It\u2019s when a group of investors bundle their money and resources together to invest in a real estate project &#8212; typically something larger than any one investor could tackle on her own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, these investments generally were not available to the public, and sometimes they were\/are by invitation only, as with <\/span><b>private placements<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But, thanks to crowdfunding and online social networking, it\u2019s becoming easier to find and invest in syndications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post I\u2019m going to explain the basics of how a typical syndication deal is structured. I\u2019ll be referring back to my oversimplified and hypothetical $50 million apartment building scenario for some examples, but please keep in mind that <\/span><b>every syndication deal is different.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They come in custom shapes and sizes, like any real estate investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Can Anyone Invest in a Real Estate Syndication?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s think about this for a second\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you and I were seriously looking for 200 people to each invest $50,000 with us, what type of investors would we prefer to have? Would we accept money from just anyone? Or would we prefer that they meet certain investor qualifications?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we took money from 200 novice investors, we\u2019d probably be signing ourselves up for headaches. Not only would we be flooded with questions, but if any of them were financially unstable, they might also want to withdraw from the partnership early. They would be a time-suck and possibly a legal pain in the ass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we would want experienced, wealthy investors who could just transfer us money &#8211;&gt; and then leave us alone. Less time managing investors means more time working on projects and profits! To make it easier for us, we might want to find only 100 investors with $100k each. Or just 10 investors with $1 million each.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also strict legal guidelines we would need to adhere to. Because we are using other people\u2019s money to buy real estate (or selling \u201cshares\u201d of our investment company), <\/span><b>this is technically selling securities<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We\u2019d need either a license from the SEC or somehow be able to be exempt from SEC filings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Most real estate syndication groups require their partners to be \u201caccredited investors,\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or at minimum \u201csophisticated investors.\u201d They use syndication attorneys to structure deals to follow SEC guidelines, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/syndicationattorneys.com\/articles\/506b-506c-question\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these 506b and 506c rules<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most syndication money is raised behind closed doors rather than being advertised to the general public. Real estate groups target high net worth individuals and prefer investors they have an existing relationship with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(At the end I\u2019ll share how you might be able to build relationships and find some syndication or crowdfunded real estate opportunities yourself.)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Syndication Objectives and Real Estate Niches<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re evaluating an investment, it\u2019s important to understand the goals of the project (other than just looking at numbers). Large real estate companies usually have a specialty or niche that they work inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some examples of syndication niches include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial or office buildings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-storage facilities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile home parks<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/raw-land-investing-bill-gates-and-the-stock-market-scaries\/\">Raw land development<\/a> (buying land and building something from scratch)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single family homes (buy packages of 50-100 homes within a certain target area)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residential apartment complexes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I like it when the<\/span><b> project goals align with my personal investment goals.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why I invest in \u201cbuy and hold\u201d syndication deals with a small value-add component. I want to buy cash flow positive properties that have rent increase opportunities as well as appreciation potential. The deals I invest in must be conservatively leveraged, have a strong rental track record, and be located in a growing area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to invest with a like-minded group of people. Common goals = better partnerships. &#x1f44d;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Syndication Team and Corporate Structure:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><b>The group that finds the deal and manages the overall investment is called the \u201csponsor.\u201d <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are in charge of overseeing the entire business plan, and making all major decisions on behalf of the company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could be just one person or a small group of highly skilled individuals that specialize in different things (like a finance guru, an investor relations person, and an operations rockstar).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The individual investors are usually called \u201climited partners.\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These are the people putting up the money. Technically they own shares in the corporation, however they don\u2019t really have any voting rights on what the partnership can and can\u2019t do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syndication investments are not publicly traded or transferable to anyone else. So once a limited partner invests his or her funds, <\/span><b>they are fully committed until the project is over<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the company is dismantled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TRUST plays a massive role when investing your money in a real estate syndication. It\u2019s very important to vet out an experienced sponsor and fully research who you\u2019re going into business with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our fake $50 million scenario, I might demonstrate my legitimacy as a sponsor by showing potential investors a successful track record of similar deals I\u2019ve managed in the past, with references. Also, I could show my faith by investing $500k of my personal money in the project (buying 10 of the 200 shares myself). <\/span><b>Good sponsors eat their own dog food.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a post I read many years ago that helped me big time&#8230; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biggerpockets.com\/member-blogs\/9145\/53959-vetting-an-apartment-deal-sponsor---10-tips-from-an-insider\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vetting an apartment deal sponsor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Check out this post for beginners, too&#8230; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biggerpockets.com\/member-blogs\/9145\/65780-syndication-25-faqs-by-investors\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syndication: 25 FAQ\u2019s by investors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Projected Returns for Syndications<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re looking at an investment proposal, the sponsor will highlight how much profit they think you can achieve for your invested capital. It\u2019s important to note, these are <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projected<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> returns, not <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actual<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> returns. <\/span><b>Nothing is guaranteed when you invest.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does a sponsor no good to lie about these numbers or trick you into investing. I\u2019m not saying that investment proposals are always accurate, but usually very experienced people have put the numbers together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my experience, most syndication sponsors will underestimate vs. overestimate. If they blow investor expectations out of the water, people are likely to invest with them again. If they overestimate and shit the bed, then people won\u2019t trust them again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each real estate project has different timelines, objectives, and profit schedules. Some provide a great ongoing cash flow and passive income throughout the life of the project. Others provide a huge profit split only at the end of the investment term. Some deals pay a small amount of both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the residential value-add deals I am interested in, I hope to achieve a 7-8% cash on cash return every year, as well as 1.5x to 2x return on my investment when the project closes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to aligned goals, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure the projected returns of the company suit your individual investment strategy and risk tolerance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Syndication Sponsor Fees<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my hypothetical scenario, I said all 200 investors would split the profit \u201cequally.\u201d But in real world syndications, profit sharing happens *after* the sponsor collects 2 types of fees&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first is an upfront acquisition fee. This compensates the sponsor for the enormous amount of effort it takes to find a deal, analyze it, hire lawyers, pay the deposit (personally), raise capital and create an entire business plan that everyone will be happy with. It\u2019s not uncommon for a sponsor to evaluate 200+ properties before finding one that meets their criteria. It could be a 6 month to 1 year process, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The acquisition fee is usually ~2% of the total deal size. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my fake scenario, 2% of $50 million is $1 million! (Seems like a lot, but split between the team of people putting the deal together &#8212; it\u2019s reasonable.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second fee is an ongoing management fee. The sponsor needs to ensure the business plan is executed properly, the investors are attended to, everyone gets their profits, the monthly reporting gets done, contractors are managed, taxes get filed, etc. If the project is large enough, they might even hire a dedicated manager for all this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The ongoing management fee is usually ~2% of incoming monthly revenue.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In our scenario, let\u2019s say the incoming total rent is around $500k per month. The sponsor would collect a $10k per month (2%) fee to cover all the management work involved for the full life of the contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There can be other fees (or incentives) for the sponsor included within deals. A common one I see is an acceleration bonus tied to overperformance. For example, if I end up selling our hypothetical building for $70 million instead of $60m, I might write in a clause that everyone buys me free beer for life because I just tripled their money!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Taxes and Cost Segregation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a question I hear a lot: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat about all the tax benefits of real estate investing&#8230; Can I claim things like mortgage interest and expenses in my tax filing?\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is Yes, and it\u2019s really easy!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each year, the company files a tax return for the entire project. All deductions like depreciation, loan interest, and expenses are accounted for. Then, the total amount of income\/expenses are divided exactly between the shareholders according to the proportion of their ownership. Each owner is issued an individual K1 statement, which is just a form you file in your personal tax return.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our hypothetical scenario, an individual investor would own 1\/200th (0.5%) of the overall project. Their K1 statement each year would represent 0.5% of all income, 0.5% of all deductions, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate syndications are very tax-efficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Real Estate Syndication Pros and Cons<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the goods and bads that come with investing in syndication deals:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syndication Pros:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Passive income! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you commit to a project as a limited partner, you don\u2019t need to do any ongoing work.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Expertise and experience:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Many syndication sponsors have decades of real estate experience and work in elite teams.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Private equity investment:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Shares in the investment are not publicly traded or transferrable, so your share in ownership won\u2019t fluctuate or be diluted based on market volatility.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Diversification (within asset class):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some syndications bundle a handful of properties (like a fund), so your risk is spread across multiple properties and rental income streams.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Very tax-efficient:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The people doing the syndication taxes are experts in maximizing every real estate tax benefit available for the project.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Limited liability:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As an individual investor, you are protected from any horrible things that happen.

All the risks for each syndication are clearly detailed in the contract.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>How to Find Real Estate Syndication Deals<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good investment opportunities don\u2019t just fall in your lap. Well, sometimes they do, but for the most part you gotta go out and hunt for them! Here are a few ways you can find syndication deals&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First, there\u2019s the old school networking way <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(this is how I learned about this stuff). I went on BiggerPockets.com and typed \u201csyndication\u201d into the search bar. One hundred names popped up and profiles of people who work in that arena. I clicked on all these people\u2019s profiles and read their blog posts, comments, website links, and anything they had to offer. Then I narrowed that list down to about 20 of interest, and asked each person for a 15-minute phone call to introduce myself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Networking is all about asking good questions (and being genuine). People in real estate love to help beginners learn. If you respect their time, they can help you learn about partnerships and deals, or at least point you in a good direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Next, listen to podcasts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Start with this one &#8211;\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/joefairless.com\/best-ever-show-2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Best Ever Real Estate Podcast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
