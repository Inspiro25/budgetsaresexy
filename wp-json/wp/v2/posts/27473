Haha&#8230;.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seriously though, what a ride so far&#8230;. two+ weeks come and gone and I now have a brand new human being to take care of forever and ever (and ever)!<\/strong>\u00a0 And I now know why they make them so adorable too &#8211; cuz they cry all over the place and constantly need your attention! Haha&#8230; but I wouldn&#8217;t change it for the world :)\u00a0 I&#8217;m loving every single second I spend with the little booger and I swear he&#8217;s already grown about double in size.<\/p>\n<p>Here were all the stats for those baby lovers out there:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight: 7 lbs 5 oz<\/li>\n<li>Height: 21 inches<\/li>\n<li>Mohawk: n\/a<\/li>\n<li>Number of days late: 8<\/li>\n<li>Hours in labor: 27!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>It was a wild experience to say the least :)<\/strong>\u00a0I literally went to bed at 2 a.m. the night before it all started &#8211; thinking I&#8217;d get some work done &#8220;just in case&#8221; &#8211; and 15 minutes later the contractions started getting stronger and stronger and the whole adventure began from that point forward.\u00a0 So not only was I delirious from the start due to the lack of sleep already, but my endorphins were incredibly high too which was super good considering I had no idea what we were about to get ourselves into!\u00a0 9+ months of waiting around and then BAM!\u00a0 Here comes the baby!!! It&#8217;s so funny&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Well, funny to me at least &#8211; 27 hours in labor wasn&#8217;t so fun for the Mrs ;)\u00a0 Although I must admit she handled it all rather impressively. Especially towards the last rounds of pushing where she actually cracked a joke and had all the nurses laughing! Haha&#8230; I&#8217;d tell you what it was, but to be honest my eyes were too fixated on Baby $&#8217;s head half way popping out of his home! Not to get too graphic up in here, but it&#8217;s truly amazing to see how they can come out of such small areas :) I watched the entire thing from start to finish (despite the crazy amount of blood everywhere, *shiver*), and the second I saw his light brown hair on his head I had tears streaming down my face in complete awe.\u00a0 It was at that moment when it all sunk in and I couldn&#8217;t believe our dreams had come true!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">WE WERE HAVING A BABY!!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Man&#8230; I&#8217;m tearing up just thinking about it again :)<\/strong>\u00a0 But it&#8217;s so true &#8211; that moment when you first see your child is incredible, just like everyone always says but you never understand until you actually go through the entire thing.\u00a0 I told my wife 2 minutes later that I want to hurry up and get another one and she just about divorced me, haha&#8230; probably too soon ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a handful of events that has happened in the weeks since:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>He lost a little weight in the beginning, but fully regained it later when mom&#8217;s milk came in (TMI?)<\/li>\n<li>We got him circumcised, and almost had a heart attack when we came home to a diaper full of blood! (all, of course, was fine in the end &#8211; his little member just got stuck to the diaper :()<\/li>\n<li>Days later he had a shirt full of blood and we AGAIN almost had a heart attack (the leftover umbilical cord scraped the baby&#8217;s belly, and all was fine there too &#8211; it&#8217;s always something!)<\/li>\n<li>Days after that it started smelling really bad and I freaked out and took him back (yet again) to the doctors. Who joked that I better not be in there because of his umbilical cord again, but of course I was cuz I could have sworn he got a flesh eating bacteria!\u00a0 (he did not, and again was a-okay)<\/li>\n<li>The wife and I tried to go on a date one night but it went horribly wrong when we got stuck inside a store due to massive thunder storms and Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy kept worrying that something was gonna happen to our baby and\/or house! ;)\u00a0 Which is a shame cuz out of allll the places to be stuck for a half\u00a0 hour, an ice cream store is the place to be!\u00a0 Normally pretty romantic, haha&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/baby-j-money-chillin.jpg\" alt=\"Baby J. Money chillin\" width=\"226\" height=\"294\" border=\"0\" \/><strong>All that to say that we pretty much freaked out every other day ;)<\/strong>\u00a0 And celebrated weird milestones like his first poop and his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.justthefactsbaby.com\/baby\/article\/why-babies-smile\/92\">fake smile<\/a>, haha&#8230; we&#8217;re doing much better now though since we&#8217;ve had his 2 week checkup and everything seems to be going pretty well&#8230; I guess all new parents goes through this terrifying initiation?<\/p>\n<p>Crap, hold on a sec I hear him crying&#8230;.. [45 mins later] Okay, back :)\u00a0 The bad thing about working from home?\u00a0 You&#8217;re kinda sorta still on call! Haha&#8230; we&#8217;ll see how long that lasts, though&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s move on to some of the financial aspects of it all now, that&#8217;s enough of the crazy baby stories.<\/strong> Here are a few tidbits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We&#8217;ve spent over $25 on\u00a0Vaseline which was weird, but also kinda important w\/ circumcision stuff<\/li>\n<li>We had to pick up a handful more of onesies and blankets cuz apparently 10 of each wasn&#8217;t enough! Haha&#8230; MAN they need to get changed all the time! :)<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve gotten a lot of free food from people which is awesome cuz we could barely tell up from down most times at night! (And days, for that matter)<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve started getting bills in the mail now, and so far the totals are hovering around <em><strong>$8,000<\/strong><\/em>!\u00a0 And we expect there will be many more to come once they all get through the pipeline and hit our insurance\/etc (LUCKILY we don&#8217;t have to pay that full $8k or whatever the grand total will be in the end, but still &#8211; pretty pricey!\u00a0 Reminds me of a tweet someone sent me the other day, &#8220;You have to pay for babies in the US??&#8221; Yup!\u00a0 No universal healthcare here, I&#8217;m afraid&#8230;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>And I&#8217;ll of course be updating our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/ultimate-baby-child-costs-tracker\/\">baby money tracker<\/a> over time too<\/strong>, which will have a humongo jump this month and next I&#8217;m sure &#8211; esp if I end up opening up that 529 I&#8217;m thinking about still (I&#8217;m actually starting to question it, but we&#8217;ll leave that for another day&#8217;s post&#8230;).<\/p>\n<p>If you can believe it, I also got into a bunch of other things too over <del>vacation<\/del> paternity leave.\u00a0 Apparently I&#8217;m a LOT more productive when given windows of opportunities ;):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I cleaned out 75% of my basement making it as clutter-free as it&#8217;s ever been!<\/li>\n<li>My mom and I built an entire garden from scratch (pics and costs coming soon!)<\/li>\n<li>I scored all kinds of deals at thrift stores and estate sales<\/li>\n<li>I sold one of my online properties for a good chunk of change! (Details coming soon on that too)<\/li>\n<li>I watched about 100 hours of late night Pawn Stars and American Pickers while comforting baby&#8230; Learning all about the Civil War and other times of past with all their valuable antiques ;)<\/li>\n<li>And I pretty much lived as close of a &#8220;retirement&#8221; life as I probably will whenever that day comes around. A little work action to keep the brain pumping, and a whole bunch of family and adventure time w\/ the rest of the hours&#8230; Was a nice taste of the good life for sure :) Minus the lack of sleep.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>And now, life gets back on track and we start a new &#8220;normal!&#8221;<\/strong> Lots to look forward to and learn still, but all good things to be excited about. It&#8217;s nice having our priorities be a beautiful little boy these days than a beautiful little dollar, haha&#8230; though of course money will always be a passion :)<\/p>\n<p>And, like always, I&#8217;ll be back to blog about it all again tomorrow!
