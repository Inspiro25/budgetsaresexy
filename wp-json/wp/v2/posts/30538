Though I do have mad respect for the pioneers who made that trek. That\u2019s some badassery right there). I mean, who doesn\u2019t love a good case of cholera or hunting buffalo to get their blood pumping? I know I do.<\/p>\n<p>But did you also know that while we were fording the river, trading for oxen, and buying bullets, we were also learning about personal finance? It\u2019s true.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t believe me, you can check out my series &#8220;The Oregon Trail Guide to Personal Finance.&#8221; But I\u2019m not here to promote that (even though it\u2019s really awesome and you totally need to read it). No. I\u2019m here to tell you that once the journey ends, there\u2019s still a long way to go.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019ve always wondered what happened to the settlers at the <em>end<\/em> of the game.<\/strong> I mean, you get to Oregon and then\u2026what? What do they do? Where do they live? How do they earn money? Those kinds of things. Fortunately, the clever folks who created The Oregon Trail have a follow up game that helps me answer those questions. And, wouldn\u2019t you know, I\u2019ve learned a few more financial lessons from that (I swear, these people are evil geniuses).<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a sample:<\/p>\n<h2>Take care of your necessities first<\/h2>\n<p>In the game, you arrive at a completely empty plot of land save for trees, rocks, and the occasional buffalo skull. In order to build on it, you first need to clear the land. Once the land is cleared, you can start building. But what to build first?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a good question, and the answer is simple: Take care of your necessities. Find a water source. Chop down trees and build a shelter. Start a fire with some of the logs. Hunt a squirrel or rabbit or find some nonpoisonous berries to eat. Cover the basics. Because if you don\u2019t secure what you need to survive, it\u2019s almost impossible to do anything else like raise animals or harvest crops.<\/p>\n<p>Your money works the same way. When you get paid, pay your necessities first. Pay for your housing if you still have to. Set aside money for food and transportation. Make sure you have enough to pay for electricity (unless you live in a completely \u201cgreen\u201d house or are Amish &#8211; then you can forget about that payment). If you need medication to survive, budget for that as well. Once those are taken care of, you\u2019re pretty much good to go. Then you can take what&#8217;s left over and use that for the stuff you want.<\/p>\n<h2>Have a logical plan<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to look at the empty plot of land and just start haphazardly building stuff. A tavern, a general store, a hunting lodge, a bunch of houses, maybe a farm; those all seem like a good idea for a town. I mean, that\u2019s totally the kind of town l\u2019d like to live in. But there has to be an orderly plan for where you place those things. For instance, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to put the hunting lodge next to the tavern. That could get dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds kind of like a budget. Income is just like that empty plot of land. If you don\u2019t have a plan for how to spend that money, you\u2019re just going to spend it on whatever you want without really knowing where that money goes. You\u2019ll spend in an illogical way that makes no sense and could cause a potentially dangerous situation, like massive debt or a missing big financial deadline or opportunity.<\/p>\n<h2>Work hard but remember to rest<\/h2>\n<p>The game is really big on monitoring your energy. Each task that you perform whether it\u2019s collecting money from the stores or building a storage shed or harvesting crops, they all require you to use energy. When your energy meter runs out, you can\u2019t perform another task until it resets (and your \u201cspouse\u201d even reminds you that your energy meter is empty and you can\u2019t do anything else. Thanks, nagging spouse). Sometimes you\u2019ll work really hard and get an energy bonus but mostly the work just depletes what you have stored up.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re trying to build a successful town, it\u2019s hard and sometimes painful to rest; you want to keep working and working until you have nothing left to give. It\u2019s the quickest way to be profitable, working around the clock, having our hands busy constantly. But that\u2019s also an easy way to burn out and make some potentially unpleasant mistakes (like forgetting to craft some medicine and your pioneer dies. Oops).<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are self-employed, work for someone else, work in the home, or have some other work situation, it\u2019s important that you allow yourself to take a day off. Resting boosts your ability to perform at the top of your game. Resting allows you to recover, prevents you from burning out and helps you avoid mistakes. Resting gives you a mental break (and often, during your rest, you\u2019ll find a solution to a problem that had been nagging you). Resting affords you the time to be proud of your accomplishments. And most importantly, resting gives you the opportunity to connect with your family and friends, which is more important than anything.<\/p>\n<h2>Be kind to your neighbors<\/h2>\n<p>One way to build up your town and earn rewards is to visit neighboring towns and help the townspeople with their chores. You get rewarded in little hearts that allow you to obtain a bonus trip to the prospecting field (where you get to blow up rocks with dynamite, which is awesome.) and you get visitors to your town, allowing your businesses to be more profitable. It also helps to build relationships, so in the event of a flood or stampeding buffalo\/etc, you can get some help rebuilding your broken town. Everyone wins!<\/p>\n<p>In real life, the game\u2019s neighbors are our networks. It\u2019s important to have good, solid relationships with your family, friends, and your community. Because in the event of a tragedy or unemployment or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-started-a-quarantini-%f0%9f%8d%b8-business-during-the-covid-pandemic\/\">starting a new business<\/a>, these are the people that you will turn to for help. They\u2019re the ones who will come to your aid and support you. The nicer and more helpful you are to people, the broader your network becomes. And honestly? You never know what kind of opportunity can arise as a result of that network.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I love games that make me think (yes, I\u2019m a huge nerd), particularly games that make me think about money.<\/strong> Because, in addition to the lessons learned here, there\u2019s the whole earning, budgeting and spending money element to the game that makes it even more challenging.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s a whole different post.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Okay, Sexy readers.
