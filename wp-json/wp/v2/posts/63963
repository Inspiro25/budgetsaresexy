These 20 questions are designed to bring couples financially closer together by understanding each other\u2019s past, present, and future thoughts around money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just for new couples. Even though my wife and I have been together for 10+ years, we went through these questions recently and found some new and fun things about each other! Having the same financial mindset is important to us because <\/span><b>we can achieve our goals faster as a team vs individually.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you\u2019re up for the challenge, grab a bottle of wine one night this week and hit up your significant other with these questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(And just for fun, I\u2019ve included my wife\u2019s answers. Gives you more insight into my <\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> better half, plus you\u2019ve heard enough of my crap recently. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f609;<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">******<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. What\u2019s your first money memory?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the store one day when I was little I remember my older sister was asking mom to buy her new clothes. I was extremely nervous about my parents spending money, because growing up I believed that my family and I were on the verge of being homeless. (We weren\u2019t at all!) I\u2019m not sure if this was a cultural thing with my mom always penny pinching or just some weird kid stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Did you know how much your parents earned when you were a child?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, I thought that we were on the brink of homelessness growing up. I think I started to get the real picture in middle school when my dad brought home a big-screen TV one day. I rarely got new clothes or toys as kid, I always had hand-me-downs from my sister. So the fact that my dad could buy a brand new large TV had me thinking that we were doing better than just OK. I never knew my parents\u2019 salary and was taught it was rude to ask people.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Did your family have a budget? How did you feel about it?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, my family never had a budget. My mom just never spent any \u201ccareless\u201d money. Any money that we did spend was seriously scrutinized. If I did want something like a toy or fancy outfit, my parents would tell me to ask for it for my birthday or Christmas. Probably about 50% of the time I would get it if it wasn\u2019t too expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Did you get an allowance as a child? What did you do with it?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, I never got an allowance. I kind of wish that I had and was taught how to budget out what I needed. Instead I was taught just don\u2019t spend any money &#8212; ever. And when you do \u2026 feel guilty. But, I was very fortunate. For example if I wanted to go to the movies as a kid with my friends, my parents would give me just enough to buy the ticket and I would be expected to give them back exact change.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Did your parents fight about money?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely, my dad would want to spend a lot of money on random things like toys, boats, cars etc. and my mom would be against all of it; she didn\u2019t want any luxurious items.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. What money habits did your parents practice? How did you feel about those habits?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The basic money habits of my parents was mom saving all the money and dad spending all the money. Seemed normal to me\u2026 I guess I felt fine about it. Seems like a waste of energy now that I\u2019m older, like wouldn\u2019t it be easier just to get on the same page and not fight?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. What drives your financial decisions?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our budget. All our wants and needs are budgeted for. And our lifestyle. \u201cOur\u201d as in my husband and I. We are fortunate enough to make decisions based on what we want in our life, not just what we need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>8. If you won $1 million today, what would you do with the money?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably put whatever we need towards reaching our FI number early then give the rest of it toward clearing our families\u2019 mortgages and helping other people (family\/friends\/community) get to their FI-number faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>9. What\u2019s one money habit that you admire about me? (i.e. your significant other)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You taught me about investing. Before you, I was just a money saver\u2026 I would\u2019ve been working for my entire life if I didn\u2019t start investing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>10. If I (your significant other) lost $100 on something and didn\u2019t tell you, would you be upset with me? How about $1,000?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes of course I\u2019d be upset. We have a very open communication relationship so the fact that you wouldn\u2019t tell me is the most hurtful. It doesn\u2019t matter the money amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>11. What scares you about money?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market scares me. Mainly because it\u2019s something that\u2019s not tangible. I know it\u2019s there, I know it\u2019s growing, but I can\u2019t physically see it. No matter how much my mind understands how it works, I always have a little bit of anxiety about is that money real? Where is it right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>12. What do you wish you knew more about?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would like to learn more about budgeting with children. That is a very personal area though, and most of my friends that I\u2019ve asked have completely different views on how much children cost. For example, one of my friends said that it costs $40,000 a year to raise her child. Another of my friends (who lives on the same street) is raising three children on a teacher salary! Obviously people do it differently depending on their priorities and resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>13. What would it take for you to feel happy about money?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do feel happy about money already. It\u2019s the tool that is making my way of life doable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>14. What does having money mean to you?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having money means work\/life balance. Working in a field of my choice, not for income.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>15. What are you comfortable telling about your money? Any debts that are important to know?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was extremely spoiled growing up. I had college paid for and family that supported whatever field I wanted to go into. No debt :)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>16. What are you working towards? What dreams do you have (1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years)?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I consider my job now as part-time. I absolutely love this work load. I enjoy my work days, I also enjoy my days off. If I continue to like this, I will keep going for probably the next five years. After that, who knows? We might be FI by then. Possibly go back to school, possibly stay at the job I have. Or go travel! My 5 &#8211; 10 year dreams change consistently, I have a long bucket list.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>17. What do you want to leave behind (for kids or others)?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to have free education. Also, if we have kids I want them to have some travel experiences while we are a young family. Leaving money behind for them isn\u2019t as important as teaching them life skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>18. Do you expect to get any inheritance from your family?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most likely. But I\u2019d really rather them spend it all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>19. What would you want to happen to your money if you died?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d like to donate most of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>20. Do you expect to support your parents or other loved ones in the future?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. But most likely not financially. I expect to have my parents live with me at some point.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">******<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welp, there you have it. My wife is spoiled yet frugal, both a happy worker and freedom-focused, who wants to travel more and invite my in-laws to live with us one day. Lucky me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would love to hear some of your responses if you care to share \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make it a great day,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, money nerds!
