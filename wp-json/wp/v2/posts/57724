Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>They also found than over half of people (51%) also feel their own friends and family\/colleagues don&#8217;t *actively listen* to them either.

Let&#8217;s buy it and become adults!&#8221; Before we knew it we were knee-deep in $350,000 of debt and scrambling to get a good budget going. (Although true story &#8211; it did get this blog off the ground! :))<\/p>\n<p>It had been engrained in our heads our whole lives that owning a home was a right of passage and The American Dream, and everyone and their mothers (especially their mothers!) helped convince us this was true. Only of course, we all know it&#8217;s <em>not true<\/em> for *everyone*, and we soon found ourselves owning a home we shouldn\u2019t have purchased to begin with and dealing with all the debt that followed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Long story short, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/we-sold-our-house-no-more-mortgages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we sold it and lost a BUCKET FULL in the process<\/a>, but ever since I&#8217;ve made it my mission to only follow what *I* truly want out of life instead of what everyone else thinks is best for me.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Much to the dismay of all mothers out there ;)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve since:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stopped working a 9-5 to become a full-time blogger<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/good-vs-bad-reasons-to-quit-something\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quit projects<\/a> that were taking off, and held onto others <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-i-fired-myself-from-rockstar-finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">for longer than I should have<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Gotten rid of over 80% of my stuff<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-triad-of-hustling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stopped hustling<\/a> and chasing money 24\/7<\/li>\n<li>Turned down high paying book deals and speaking gigs<\/li>\n<li>And probably do a half dozen other things daily that would make the Joneses next door cringe<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sometimes it works out, and other times not, but it&#8217;s always on MY watch and according to MY values. Which is really the whole point of this money and decision stuff, right?? To go after the things that best fulfills you? You can still ask for advice and consult loved ones, of course, but at the end of the day only YOU know what truly matters to you, and if that happens to go against the grain, well, then it happens to go against the grain!
