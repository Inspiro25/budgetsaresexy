It&#8217;s been well over a month now since our little guy has ventured into Pet Heaven, but unfortunately he left quite a wake of expenses in his path before taking off. And these vet visits &amp; medication (all 5 of them, I wanna say?) started adding up as I sorted through the months.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before I tell you how much we spent on him though, do you wanna take a guess as to whether it was higher or lower than the total baby costs?\u00a0<\/strong> I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it before I started tracking them both at the same time, but MAN was I shocked with the resulting number. Are you ready for this? In the same amount of time we&#8217;ve been spending on baby stuff, for a grand total of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/ultimate-baby-child-costs-tracker\/\">$2,748.29<\/a> so far, we&#8217;ve spent almost $1,000 MORE on Bob!\u00a0 For a whopping <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$3,737.75!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Pretty crazy stuff&#8230; And again, that was only the past <em>9 months<\/em> leading up to his passing &#8211; he had been sick for quite a while before that too :( Not that we would have changed anything going back in time anyways, of course, but still &#8211; it&#8217;s no fun on the wallet either way you look at it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>After all these years of tracking my money and spending time with this stuff day in and day out, it&#8217;s funny how things still surprise me and sneak into our budgets like that.<\/strong> I of course KNEW we were spending a lot on him throughout the whole ordeal, but I just didn&#8217;t realize how MUCH really. Which is pretty bad for a finance blogger. Just goes to show we get lazy too!! And maybe that I need to start paying attention a bit more strictly too like I used to? I don&#8217;t think our expenses are going to be &#8220;normal&#8221; anymore in the future, that&#8217;s for sure :)<\/p>\n<p>Either way, it just goes to show that this stuff adds up fast. And if you&#8217;re not paying attention, it can suck you dry in no time. Which leads us to the question of the day: <em><strong>What&#8217;s an area of YOUR budget that&#8217;s been adding up a lot faster than you originally thought?<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 And more importantly, can it be slowed down if you really want it to be?<\/p>\n<p>I Hope so!\u00a0 It&#8217;s one thing to pay for one-off expenses here and there, but a totally different one that takes a life of its own over time &#8211; we all gotta be careful out there. These debts are sneaky devils! :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><strong>PS:<\/strong> That urn that we ordered for Bob so we could <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/pet-heavens-get-fuller\/\">keep his ashes<\/a>?\u00a0 IT&#8217;S BEAUTIFUL!\u00a0 We got it two weeks ago in this awesome cherry wood box, and it even came with an imprint of his little paw on it :) So cute! And as crazy as it sounds, we feel like he&#8217;s still here! (We were also right about that $200+ price tag &#8211; it was for cremating him separately from the other guys, which was well worth it in the end.)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So as I was tracking all those baby expenses last week, I kept noticing these other charges hitting our account over and over again too&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/biggest-budget-expenses\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[20,98],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-26554","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-budgeting","category-debt"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What&#039;s Your Biggest Expense Category Lately? | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/biggest-budget-expenses\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"What&#039;s Your Biggest Expense Category Lately? | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"So as I was tracking all those baby expenses last week, I kept noticing these other charges hitting our account over and over again too...
