This is the not-so-good part.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to mixing money &amp; family, i&#8217;m usually against it. As it turns out though, i can easily be convinced ;)<\/p>\n<p>People say they&#8217;ll loan out money if they trust they&#8217;ll get it back, but how do you know who WILL and who WON&#8217;T do so? Are your friends and family inherently trustful in this dept? For me, If i&#8217;m not sure I can trust you, I&#8217;ll at least test the waters.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><strong>my uncle&#8217;s situation.<\/strong><br \/><\/span><\/span>He&#8217;s in his late 50&#8217;s, broke, and unfortunately barely living off unemployment, disability, and who knows what else. He&#8217;s been loaned money dozens and dozens of times (literally) by friends and family, and has rarely paid them back &#8211; if ever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So WHY exactly did i loan him money?<\/strong> Well, when it comes down to it I love him to death. He&#8217;s always been the &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;fun&#8221; uncle, and I REALLY wanted to give him a chance to redeem himself, at least in the eyes of his direct family. Of course, there was no way in hell i was gonna tell my parents this &#8211; they&#8217;ve lost thousands and have had enough.<\/p>\n<p>He asked for $400 so he can finally move back to the area and be closer to all of us, and promised to repay it back within 2 months, but ESPECIALLY before our wedding. At the time, that was 3 months away.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Initially i thought Hell to the No!<\/strong> I need that money for the wedding, and the odds of getting it back, at least according to past history, was a good 10% &#8211; if that. But you know what? I figured i&#8217;ve never been burnt by him before, and it&#8217;s probably taken a lot of guts to ask for $ from someone half his age. And he MUST be serious in returning it ESPECIALLY because of the upcoming wedding.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of the full $400, I agreed to $100 and blamed it on my lack of savings. I had to determine an amount that i could easily lose and still be okay with &#8211; and<strong> $100 was the magic number<\/strong>. We&#8217;d still be okay for the wedding, and I had just received a bonus so I could budget it in there fine. I also told him that if he paid it back on time, I will gladly loan him more down the road.<\/p>\n<p>He understood, and was extremely gracious for it, so i dropped that bad boy in the mail hoping to one day see it again. And even more so to raise other&#8217;s opinion of him. It felt GREAT inside, and I forgot about it&#8230;apparently, he did too :(<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:180%;\">my benjamin&#8217;s situation.<br \/><\/span><\/strong><\/span>It&#8217;s now been 4 and 1\/2 months, the wedding has come and gone, and the money is still &#8220;1 paycheck away&#8221;. And by paycheck, I mean the unemployment check as he hasn&#8217;t worked for quite some time.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this post though isn&#8217;t to rag on my poor uncle (well okay, it is a little&#8230;but only cuz i need to vent somewhere!), but it&#8217;s really to help put things in perspective when this stuff happens. I&#8217;m definitely pissed i&#8217;m out the $100, but i have to remember that <strong>he needed it more than i did<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In all honesty, I can&#8217;t really blame anyone but myself.<\/strong> I knew full well that the odds were stacked against me going into this one. And regardless of his intentions or excuses, I at least accomplished my original goal &#8211; to give him a chance. It didn&#8217;t end pretty, but i&#8217;m gonna do my best to forgive and forget.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is part one of a two part series on loaning family money.
