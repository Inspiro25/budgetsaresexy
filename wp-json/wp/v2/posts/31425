I found exactly 0 silver coins in this latest, crazy, experiment of mine, and I won&#8217;t be trying another anytime soon ;)<\/p>\n<p>Although to be fair the &#8220;making money&#8221; part was only half the reason I cashed in $500 of my cold hard cash for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/12\/silver-searching-500-half-dollar-rolls\/\">50 rolls of half dollar coins<\/a> :) The other half was to help me fill out my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/030709698X\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=030709698X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20\">Whitman blue books<\/a> to see if I can get all the years and mintmarks down! And that goal I most definitely accomplished, at least a good 95% of them&#8230; I&#8217;m still missing a few dates here and there, but overall it was an interesting experience to say the least!<\/p>\n<p>Now to figure out how to GET RID of &#8217;em all now! haha&#8230; It&#8217;s gonna be a bitch carrying over 950 of them to a coin machine and\/or spending them at TJ Maxx ;)<\/p>\n<h2>The Update on My Dead Car:<\/h2>\n<p>1) <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/01\/hits-misses-this-week-wha-wha\/\">It&#8217;s not dead.<\/a><br \/>\n2) It only needed a new battery ;) But how was I supposed to know &#8211; my jump starting didn&#8217;t work??<\/p>\n<p>One fateful afternoon as I was scarfing down lunch though (At 3:30 btw &#8211; one of the only times I was GLAD to have put it off for so long!) I looked out my window and see a parked van across the street with, I kid you not, &#8220;<em><strong>Mobile Battery Van<\/strong><\/em>&#8221; printed on the side :) What are the odds?? I high-tail it outta there leaving my jacket and half-eaten bowl of Raisin Bran in the dust, and politely ask him if he&#8217;d come and check out my car when he was done with the one he was working on.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure! No problem &#8211; let me just check inside to make sure I have your specific type of battery in back&#8230;&#8221; (A few seconds go by) &#8220;Yup! It&#8217;s your lucky day &#8211; I have 1 more left.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>My lucky day indeed!<\/strong> Not only did he come on over about 15 minutes later &#8211; enough time for me to finish my food and get properly dressed in the freakin&#8217; snow &#8211; but he changed it all out 1-2-3 AND hooked me up with a cool little tool in case I wanted to unhook my battery any time I wish. Since I barely drive the thing but once a week &#8211; if that &#8211; &#8216;cuz the winter and non-use will slowly drain it all over again if I don&#8217;t give it enough action over time. So I got a new battery AND advice! Gotta love that. (He also replaced a little bolt and screw for me which he says they usually charge $20 for but he&#8217;d hook me up for free since I flagged him down and he was gonna get a commission on it all anyways :))<\/p>\n<p>The total cost ended up being about $80 &#8211; more than if I had done it myself, of course &#8211; but the time and amount of stress I saved in the process was most definitely worth it. And it all went through AAA as it happened to be a van associated with them, and my wife happened to still have her membership with &#8217;em. Unlike myself who had long canceled it ;)<\/p>\n<h2>The Day Care Dilemma:<\/h2>\n<p>Last I mentioned this I believe we were <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/01\/hits-misses-this-week-wha-wha\/\">declined for part-time care<\/a> because the &#8220;baby demand&#8221; was too high :( So we were forced to either continue doing things as we were (I watch him every Tuesday and Thursday, and the wife watches him M, W, F) or start looking into home care or group care, or whatever else types of care was out there.<\/p>\n<p>Well, long story short we did none of that and ended up getting accepted back into that same day care center who originally rejected us! (Or, shall I say &#8211; accepted us and THEN rejected us when they decided to change their minds and not allow part-time care anymore, those mother bleepers&#8230;) I guess their business-skills were in full force again as they soon realized they could have their baby cake and eat it too ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>It turns out they were willing to let us slip Baby Money in there on days where others called in sick and\/or were off on vacation<\/strong> with their beautiful families. Which means not only do they get paid on THOSE kids (cuz you still have to pay for day care whether you show up there or not! It&#8217;s crazy!), but now they can double dip and take on NEW ones (aka ours) and make some profit there too. Very very <del>sneaky<\/del> creative stuff. And very very good for us! ;)<\/p>\n<p>So now we plop him in there roughly once a week &#8211; allowing both daddy and mommy to work on their stuff for almost an entire day &#8211; and baby Money gets to hang out and meet new friends and toys all the while too. It&#8217;s been awesome! Not so much in the wallet area (it costs us $100 a pop &#8211; expensive for sure, but certainly not the $1,600 a month it costs for full-time care!) but most definitely in the &#8220;life is a bit calmer these days&#8221; department ;) And Money Jr. has been LOVING it so far!! Which makes everything that much better.<\/p>\n<p>(On a side note, I must say it was sooooooo HARD for me to drop that little booger off the first time! I was worried\/sad for him the entire day! Until I picked him up and &#8220;stole the look&#8221; (as my wife put it) when he realized we were back and smiled hugely :) One of the best experiences of my life! haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whew&#8230; that was a lot of typing I just did. Was it a lot of reading for you too? ;)<\/strong> I still owe you some other updates from over the months\/years, but we&#8217;ll get to those bad boys later&#8230; If you ever want to ask me anything &#8211; whether having to do with money or not &#8211; just leave it in the comments and you know I&#8217;ll always answer you.<\/p>\n<p><em>Stay warm this weekend!<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I can really suck sometimes at giving y&#8217;all updates on my doings here and there on this blog, so today&#8217;s post is all about catching&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-half-dollar-dead-car-day-care-update\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[17,200,5],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-31425","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-car-stuff","category-collecting","category-life"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Half Dollar \/ Dead Car \/ Day Care Update ;) | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-half-dollar-dead-car-day-care-update\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"The Half Dollar \/ Dead Car \/ Day Care Update ;) | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I can really suck sometimes at giving y&#8217;all updates on my doings here and there on this blog, so today&#8217;s post is all about catching...
