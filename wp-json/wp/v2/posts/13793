By FAR the best (and quickest) thing I&#8217;ve done in quite some time, I was kinda shocked.\u00a0 Especially since the site does come across as kinda spammy, haha&#8230; but I assure you it&#8217;s definitely not!\u00a0 (I later found out <em>Kiplinger<\/em> has been ranking it as one of the best insurance websites out there for a while).<\/p>\n<p>I literally spent 3 minutes answering the following handful of questions, and 15 seconds later I had over 80 plans to sort through and narrow it down to my favorite &#8211; custom-fit to my specific situation:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Insurance type? <\/strong>(Options: &#8220;Individual &amp; Family,&#8221; &#8220;Small Business,&#8221; &#8220;Short Term,&#8221;Medicare,&#8221; &#8220;Dental,&#8221; and &#8220;Travel.&#8221;\u00a0 I later chose a dental plan &#8211; trying to be a good boy, and all ;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>Zip Code?<\/strong>\u00a0 (Self-explanatory&#8230; though I was tempted to put in 90210)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Start Coverage Date?<\/strong> (I chose September 1st, 2011, but you had the option of backdating it a bit too.\u00a0 I figured if I&#8217;ve already made it a handful of weeks w\/out it, though, I could wait just one more.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sex?<\/strong>\u00a0 (Yes please!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Date of Birth?<\/strong>\u00a0 (Old.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tobacco Use?<\/strong>\u00a0 (Not for me, unless you count a Swisher Sweet every now and then ;)\u00a0 I did not.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>College Student?<\/strong>\u00a0 (No&#8230; *tear*)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now once you hit &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ehealth\">GO<\/a>&#8221; you&#8217;re then presented with alllll the options you want depending on your needs.\u00a0 Like I said, I had about 80+ plans to sort through until I found my top 3 which I then compared side-to-side (You can also compare the list by price, best sellers, deductible, ratings, and company &#8211; it all depends on how important these are to you).\u00a0 This is where it got hard for me, as I&#8217;m not a quick decision-maker.\u00a0 Especially when it comes to a plethora of &#8220;what ifs&#8221; and my brain thinking the worst ;)<\/p>\n<h2>Option #1:\u00a0 The &#8220;Small Business&#8221; Health Insurance Plan<\/h2>\n<p>Originally I had thought &#8220;small business&#8221; would be the way to go, since a few of my friends had mentioned it worked for them (and also so that the Mrs and I could both get in on it (she&#8217;s my proofreader, even though I pay her in hugs ;))), but I quickly came to the conclusion that <em><strong>$1200\/mo<\/strong><\/em> was WAY over budget.\u00a0 And that was the *cheapest*!!\u00a0 You don&#8217;t even wanna know what the highest one was, oh Lord&#8230; I guess if you had a lot of employees it would have been a different story, but either way it was a swift &#8220;hell\u00a0 no&#8221; from the get go. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t know how my friends pulled it off cuz that&#8217;s just insane-balls.\u00a0 And again, REALLY makes me appreciate what I used to have at my 9-5!<\/p>\n<h2>Option #2:\u00a0 The &#8220;Family&#8221; Health Insurance Plan<\/h2>\n<p>After I caught my breath and wiped all the perspiration off my face, I quickly went back and filled out the questions again &#8211; but this time chose the &#8220;Individual &amp; Family&#8221; plan (keeping the Mrs. and I still in it). These results were MUCH much better. Though still a bit to high for what we were looking at.\u00a0 The plans ranged from $400\/mo, to well over $1,000 &#8211; all depending on what deductibles and coverages you wanted.\u00a0 The one we liked the most was <em><strong>$550\/mo<\/strong><\/em>, but was still a bit high considering Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy still had the option of going through her school still w\/ a fairly decent $150\/mo plan.\u00a0 Which ALSO included maternity coverage, which this one did not (I don&#8217;t even wanna know how much that woulda put us over &#8211; it&#8217;s scary going out on your own plan!).\u00a0 Since we&#8217;re now back in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/10\/making-babies-is-easy-but-paying-for\/\">baby consideration<\/a> mode, this one&#8217;s gonna be pretty important shall the even rise at any point&#8230; which could come pretty soon with all that practicing I&#8217;ve been doing ;) Bow chicka wha wha!<\/p>\n<h2>Option #3:\u00a0 The &#8220;Individual&#8221; Health Insurance Plan<\/h2>\n<p>Lastly, I gave the individual plan a shot.\u00a0 And mind you, it&#8217;s literally only taken me about 12 minutes to get to this point, having quickly shot down the previous 2 options within minutes of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ehealth\">eHealth<\/a> spitting &#8217;em out for me.\u00a0 It really is that FAST! (I wanna keep stressing that for all you slackers out there just like me &#8212; I was pleasantly surprised how awesome\/borderline fun it became trying to narrow down the best of the plans for me ;)\u00a0 It became a pretty cool challenge seeing how low I could get it! Haha&#8230;).<\/p>\n<p>After sorting through the dozens of options I\u00a0 had left &#8212; the last of them since now I was totally on my own w\/ these plans here &#8211; I narrowed it down to my top 3 faves:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plan #1 @ $246\/mo:<\/strong> <em>CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield<\/em> PPO &#8211; which had always been my favorite plan over the years.\u00a0 This one comes with a $500 deductible, and covers 80% of the costs, leaving me with 20% after.\u00a0 Max out of pocket is $2,500 for the year.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plan #2 @ $258\/mo:<\/strong> Another <em>CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield<\/em> PPO, but this time with a $300 deductible.\u00a0 The rest is all the same (80\/20 with $2,500 year max)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plan #3 @ $292\/mo:<\/strong> And lastly, the <em>CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield<\/em> PPO at 90\/10 with a $300 deductible and a $2,500 year max.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, you might be wondering why these are still pretty high when I could easily be getting plans in the mid-to-high $100&#8217;s (which is def. true &#8211; there WERE some like that, even as low as $60\/mo!), but for me it all comes down to comfort and ease of mind.\u00a0 And with deductibles at $1,500+, and $20,000 maximum out of pockets for the years, that didn&#8217;t jive well with me.\u00a0 Even though I know the odds are low that it would ever come to that &#8211; being a relatively healthy 31 y\/o (and the fact that I rarely go into the doctors anyways, even IF something is wrong! haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But the other little person on my shoulder kept speaking up and reminding me that if, God forbid, something major occurred any any point in the year &#8211; even just once! &#8211; I need to make sure my sexy little <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/08\/net-worth-update-july\/\">Net Worth<\/a> is as protected as I can comfortably make it.<\/strong>\u00a0 And if all it took was $100 a month extra to make this happen, then to me it&#8217;s worth it :) It may look a lot more expensive now, when everything is peachy keen, but I get in one stupid accident and those 90\/10&#8217;s look a helluva lot better than the 80\/20&#8217;s and $500 deductibles. And worst case I spend $600 this year for nothing&#8230; (except for the fact it means I&#8217;m healthy, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>So if you haven&#8217;t guessed it already, I ended up choosing <em><strong>Plan #3<\/strong><\/em>.\u00a0 The one that cost almost $300\/mo and rated the highest of the plans at <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ehealth\">eHealth<\/a>, but the one that&#8217;ll also allow me to sleep much much better.\u00a0 And hopefully get me to GO TO THE DOCTORS a lot more when needed, than being afraid of what it&#8217;ll cost me (which in itself is huge, cuz I REALLY need to start going in more, and earlier, than waiting until ___ hurts like crazy!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m learning about myself over the years, it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m getting more and more willing to pay for higher quality when there are bigger stakes in the game.<\/strong>\u00a0 I&#8217;m still brand new at all this stuff, so we&#8217;ll see what happens over the year, but for now I&#8217;m going big and fully protected.\u00a0 I just hope I don&#8217;t ever have to prove it&#8217;s the right decision!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"border: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j_signature.gif\" alt=\"j. money signature\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>FYI:<\/strong> After you select the plan you want w\/ eHealth, you then have to get approved.\u00a0 Sometimes it&#8217;s instantaneous right there after submitting it, and others you have to give them more information.\u00a0 Which,\u00a0 for me, happened to be the case. Kinda annoying, but I understand why they have to do it.\u00a0 I had to go back 5 years and try and remember everything that happened &#8211; which is HARD since I can hardly remember what went down last WEEK! Haha&#8230; but I did my best and listed off a few things like ear aches, broken bones in my feet (rough soccer game) and getting prescribed for A.D.H.D. medicine.\u00a0 Which, oddly enough, they classified as a &#8220;Nervous and Medical Condition,&#8221;\u00a0 haha&#8230; after only taking medicine once?\u00a0 Oh well, I just had to sign a doc saying I either can&#8217;t go in for it in 10 months, or prove I haven&#8217;t had an absence in coverage for too long&#8230; and luckily the later is the case (not that I *need* it to survive, when loads of coffee does the trick!).<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>PS:<\/strong> I know this post sounds like an ad for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ehealth\">eHealth Insurance<\/a>, but I assure you it&#8217;s not ;)\u00a0 I just like pimping the products I really really think are awesome &#8211; and these guys are one of them.\u00a0 So all links here are affiliates, which means if you end up using them, I get some bones for referring you over.
