Maybe I&#8217;ve caught one of your own conversations?<\/p>\n<p>And for your own sanity, I&#8217;ve sorted through all the drivel and only included the money-related gems for your enjoyment&#8230; Though I&#8217;m now thinking of starting NonsensePeopleTalkAboutAtCoffeeShops.com too &#8211; you wouldn&#8217;t believe some of the stuff people regurgitate to each other! I often times need to take a quick shower afterwards, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s stuff I&#8217;ve overheard recently:<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;You need to be selling more to the 14 year olds&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ummm&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Saying you believe in God vs. having a relationship with him is like paying me to be your friend. I&#8217;ll sit here and listen to you but you won&#8217;t be getting anything out of it&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Haha&#8230; I had to stop from spitting out my coffee on this one :) And even funnier was the fact this conversation happened at the *same* table the line above w\/the 14\u00a0 year olds occurred, only 30 minutes later. Talk about a difference in conversation topic!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Wet suits cost over $100, and bikinis a lot too, yet cover hardly anything?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hah! So true! :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t launched my dream business because of my girlfriend&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Long story short, this guy put his business on pause to marry his girlfriend so he could be more stable, but it&#8217;s now been over a year and they&#8217;re still not married. Nor engaged, from what I could gather (he got kinda quiet so was hard for me to hear at times ;)). I was trying to make out what type of business he wanted to do,\u00a0 and by the end I came away thinking it had something to do with the mountains and the outdoors &#8211; like maybe giving group tours?<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;She&#8217;s working at a coffee shop instead of using her degree&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ouch! This was said by a wealthier looking woman talking about her very own 20-something daughter. She went on to say she&#8217;s &#8220;so much smarter than that&#8221; and needs to be doing something more in her field of art&#8230; A half an hour the women of the group went to go play tennis and the men of the group golf. Which was what led me to believe they were wealthy &#8211; who does that in the middle of the week?<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;You only need to sell 120 of them to get your 20%&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was trying to figure out *what* it was they were trying to sell, then later in the conversation I heard &#8220;book fair&#8221; and &#8220;cheesecakes.&#8221; Seem to go pretty well together, eh? (Though what\u00a0 happens if you only sell 119 of them? 0%?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;My rates are $200\/hour if we have to go back and forth. But if she accepts right away it&#8217;s only $500.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one was a sad one &#8211; all about divorce :( I literally had to blast the music in my years every now and then just to force myself to stop listening&#8230; This guy loved his wife and his kids so much but for whatever reason they were splitting up and his attorney needed to ask him 1,001 questions which just deflated him even more as time went on&#8230;\u00a0 And for $200 an hour I&#8217;m sure it stung even more!<\/p>\n<p>Here were other snippets by his attorney to give you an idea of how miserable it all sounded:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you guys get sentimental and end up hooking up, it doesn&#8217;t start the clock over&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to be paying $25 for the rest of your life to her.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;The thing saving you is not having kids in daycare. I have clients that use up all their paychecks for child support mainly due to daycare&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;You should probably pay that off now before we present this agreement to her&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And this was the kicker, and when I tuned out completely: &#8220;Also, turns out I have cancer but should be gone now&#8230;&#8221; Ugh, poor guy.<\/p>\n<h2>And here&#8217;s what people have said to ME while sitting there &#8220;minding my own business&#8221; ;)<\/h2>\n<p><strong>&#8220;All you do is write and drink coffee?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On me being a self-employed blogger, of course&#8230; Yup, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/how-make-money-online-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that&#8217;s all I do<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Do you want to buy my CD?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, haha&#8230; I probably would have if I was approached differently and learned more about this guy&#8217;s back story (it was a self-produced album that looked religiousy?), but he was going table to table trying to hawk it without even a smile on\u00a0 his face so I was turned off before I could even get interested&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong> &#8220;Can my friend practice her pitch on you for her charity?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This was by two complete strangers but incredibly fascinating because 1) I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/lovedrop.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ran a charity before<\/a> and I&#8217;m very familiar with how that game goes!, and 2) It was on the same Friday I wrote the post on how <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/can-never-take-it-away\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no one can ever take things way from you<\/a> that you&#8217;ve accomplished. Which specifically mentioned that same charity of Love Drop &#8211; what timing!<\/p>\n<p>I told her she needed to get her *story* across as simply and easily as she could &#8211; because <em>that&#8217;s<\/em> what&#8217;s going to connect with the person on the other end, not necessarily what the charity is doing. I asked her to re-pitch me including her story in it, and 30 seconds later we both had tears in our eyes! It was amazing!! So hopefully she re-works it into her organization to affect a LOT more people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And that ends this round of coffee shop confessions<\/strong>! If you liked it, maybe we&#8217;ll do it again sometime&#8230; There&#8217;s never any shortage of juicy convos going around town, I&#8217;ll tell you that much.<\/p>\n<p>Happy weekend, peeps&#8230; Be careful of what you&#8217;re saying out there ;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> On another financially-related note, it&#8217;s pretty interesting how drastic the prices for coffee are across the different shops too. I can order roughly the same thing (&#8220;large coffee with cream&#8221;) and it&#8217;ll cost anywhere from $1.50 to $3.50 a cup, then $0.00 to $3.50 for a refill. With the most expensive places being the mom and pop shops, and the cheaper (less-potent) coffees coming from the chain stores. At the end of the day though what you&#8217;re really paying for is the atmosphere of it all.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t go out of my way to pay for coffee when I can drink it for free at home, but I do go out to be around people and grab that free wifi. So a small price to pay for an extended work office in my opinion.<\/p>\n<p><em>[&#8220;Coffee Addict&#8221; pic by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/dadevoti\/4530153861\/in\/photostream\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">dadevoti<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For three months now I&#8217;ve been blogging at different coffee shops almost every day of the week.
