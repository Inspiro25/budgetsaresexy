A new record! (And likely to go up even more throughout the day&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>So instead of picking up just one ticket, I picked up two ;) And that last one almost didn&#8217;t make it. I&#8217;d been running low on cash ever since I got into the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/11\/things-learned-at-first-coin-show\/\">coin collecting hobby<\/a> (I try to pick up one new coin a week!), so when I handed the 7-Eleven guy my $2 bucks to pick up the tickets he just laughed at me and said something like &#8220;Where have you been all year? They&#8217;re now $2 a pop!&#8221; Well sorrrrrrrry, Mr. lottery man. <em>Someone<\/em> has been behaving lately and avoiding them! I guess that&#8217;s why the pot keeps getting to these enormous numbers, eh?<\/p>\n<p>Anywho, I ran back out of the store to pester my wife for the dollar I was missing, and then sprinted back in to complete the transaction. I knew I could just skip the 2nd one and stay with only the one ticket, considering they&#8217;re double the cost now, but I&#8217;d be KICKING myself if that 2nd ticket ended up being the winner! It&#8217;s way too much to handle for someone who hates &#8220;what ifs&#8221; ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So we&#8217;ll see what happens tonight when they roll those little white balls!<\/strong> (Ow ow!) And of course we then had to talk about all the things we&#8217;d do if we won, and how it would change our lives for the best AND worst, and that in the end we probably *wouldn&#8217;t* want to win anyways, haha&#8230; So basically we wasted $4 bucks ;)<\/p>\n<p>If it <em>was<\/em> in the cards though, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;d do:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Never ever EVER tell anyone!<\/strong> Not even you guys here on the blog (sorry! I guess you&#8217;ll just never know if we won or not,\u00a0 haha&#8230;). I&#8217;ve watched too many documentaries on what happens to those people who flaunt it, and there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re falling into that trap. I just hope our state doesn&#8217;t REQUIRE that they tell everyone our names and then snap a big goofy picture of us holding that check! It is pretty cool, I&#8217;ll give it that, but I&#8217;d much prefer to stay out of the spotlight if at all possible with that stuff.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hire a financial manager ASAP.<\/strong> I&#8217;m not even gonna pretend I&#8217;ll know exactly what to do with that type of money ;) And I&#8217;ll be sure to pick someone internally like a manager one of my friends or family trusts a lot &#8211; I just won&#8217;t tell them exactly why I need it&#8230; (Actually, I&#8217;d like to edit #1 up there and say I *would* tell our parents about it cuz you really can&#8217;t NOT even if you tried. And since we&#8217;d also help the rest of our direct family out (see #7 below) I guess we&#8217;d\u00a0 have to tell them too, sigh&#8230; Those people better keep a secret! ;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>Probably take the &#8220;all cash&#8221; buy out.<\/strong> Currently at <em><strong>$327.4 Million!<\/strong><\/em> We&#8217;d talk it over with our financial manager we just hired, of course, but my feeling is the &#8220;all cash&#8221; route is the way to go. Just so you&#8217;re in control 100% of it from the get go, and there&#8217;s no weird &#8220;what if it stops coming one day?&#8221; type of thing&#8230; I&#8217;d much rather have it paid out to me like with a salary or whatever (how cool would THAT be?), but you can always set up your investments to do that for you anyways.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Buy myself a pimp-ass SUV!<\/strong> Probably a slick Range Rover or G-Class Benze. Nothing *super* expensive, but still on the tad bit obnoxious side ;) Then probably upgrade my wife&#8217;s car too and leave it at that for now&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pay off our Mortgage completely, and then sell the house.<\/strong> Or maybe sell the house and then pay off <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/net-worth\/\">what&#8217;s left of the mortgage<\/a>? Either way we&#8217;d have no more mortgage anymore and we wouldn&#8217;t be living in our house either. It would help us move a TON faster like we&#8217;ve really been wanting to do lately, and then we&#8217;d buy something super nice but also super un-large. No mansions or anything, but def. something with all the perks on the inside and close distance to wherever our hearts desire.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fund Baby $&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/baby-money-now-has-a-net-worth\/\">college account<\/a>.<\/strong> Just so it&#8217;s good to go no matter what else happens!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give a sizeable (and equal!) chunk to all family members!<\/strong> Which they can do as they please with it&#8230; Except for maybe my uncle who seems to be allergic to money. I&#8217;d just buy him a small house and let him and his girlfriend live happily ever after in it&#8230; they&#8217;re almost in their 60&#8217;s and pretty much live off the government, ugh&#8230; but that&#8217;s for a whole other day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Donate a big chunk to charity and\/or start another one :)<\/strong> This time not having to worry as much about my own personal income while I run it! Haha&#8230; Always a better position to be in.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Save\/Invest the rest.<\/strong> What&#8217;s left of it anyways ;) But I reckon we&#8217;d at least have $100 Mil+ after all the above was said and done&#8230; if not $200M. And that&#8217;s WELL more than the average person will ever need in their lifetime&#8230; I&#8217;d have to set up a ton of ways to grow it too so our legacy can go on &#8211; there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;d be able to spend it all even if we wanted to. We&#8217;re too damn conscious of our money to allow for that. And also frugal :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Continue working and living life as normal as possible!<\/strong> I&#8217;d take a nice vacation and hire someone to do all the stupid stuff I have to do when being self-employed, but you can bet I&#8217;d continue blogging and creating all those random projects and ideas I constantly have in my head! I would be a horrible retiree &#8211; I can&#8217;t sit still. And with tons of money in the bank I bet I&#8217;d come up with some pretty killer ones too! When income is out of the question you magically create things purely for the love of it all, haha&#8230; I&#8217;d finally then be able to use all my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/12-ways-i-dont-set-an-example\/\">500 web domains<\/a> too ;)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do if we won. Errr&#8230; <em>when<\/em> we win. If this blog ever goes blank for a few days in a row, you&#8217;ll know exactly what happened ;) It would be the first time in 4+ years without any posts! Yikes!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now as you probably guessed, it&#8217;s time to ask you what YOU&#8217;D do if you happened accross Lady Luck tonight? <\/strong>Are your lists anywhere as predictable as mine? Or would you do something magnificently different? Let us know below and we can all salivate together :)<\/p>\n<p>Just remember that the only way to win is to play! (And it will now cost you double&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/dawidone\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">byDavvi<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welp, my non-lottery playing record of 7 months in a row has just grinded to a halt!
