For the last 10 years I\u2019ve been saving up money for a replacement vehicle. The Mustang was becoming unsafe to drive, so I finally pulled the trigger.<\/p>\n<p>I bought a 2016 Camry with only about 8K miles for under $18K. I was able to pay with cash!!! I\u2019m so stupid excited to have worked all those years to accomplish this.<\/p>\n<p>Ya, I know all about how I could have invested the money and took a loan, but I did not want to. I wanted a solid car and no payments.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all because of the financial journey I started around the time I found Budgets are Sexy!

Money!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for introducing me to the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/spavings-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spavings<\/a>. I&#8217;ve been tracking just how much I have been spavings on books alone, and it&#8217;s $68!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve discovered Interlibrary Loan and have used it so far this year to read: <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2OOAht5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Path to Wealth<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2vptMVy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Never Eat Alone<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2nipZ7S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4-Hour Work Week<\/a>, and I&#8217;m waiting on <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2KwkyLS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Early Retirement Extreme<\/a>. Prior to doubling down on this, I would have just jumped on Amazon and presto &#8212; book delivered two days later via Prime.<\/p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed it, but there is something a little magical about the delayed gratification of Interlibrary Loans. It&#8217;s as if you almost forget about it and then CHRISTMAS MORNING when I get the email that my book is waiting for me at my local branch.<\/p>\n<p>Any extra money from spavings is getting plowed into my 3-month emergency fund. As of today, I&#8217;m 92% to having that fully funded.

It was amazing to find out how much I was \u201cletting float away through my fingers\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>First thing I did was automate savings \u2013 it was really hard to do at first -but after a short while, you really do adapt.

But after many years on autopilot I thought, wait, let me look at things differently. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this.<\/p>\n<p>Found J$ on a Google search, read through his blog and became INSPIRED! Through him found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mr. Money Mustache<\/a> and started growing a little stubble, and Jacob at <a href=\"http:\/\/earlyretirementextreme.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Early Retirement Extreme<\/a>. Now Jacob is a true savage beast. I won\u2019t ever melt the last bit of my deodorant stick to put in my new deodorant stick so as not to waste it, but damn, who ever would of thought of that. However, I do find his musing on human behavior both fascinating and hilariously spot-on.<\/p>\n<p>I never read Dave Ramsey, however thanks to J, MMM, and ERE I now go to the LIBRARY to borrow the books I\u2019m interested in instead of BUYING the books at Amazon. I no longer buy a luxury vehicle to carry my ass 4 miles to work, cut cable, cut XM radio, cut lawn service, cut gym membership (good old iron at home, bicycle, jog through park), cut out buying a new iPhone every year (oh my God I was so stupid, buy $1,000.00 of your favorite Mutual Fund every year and invest $120.00 a month that you would pay for the service instead of buying that crap.)<\/p>\n<p>I could go on forever here. But basically, these little daily savings which I thought would never add up to pay off any major debt or grow wealth, over time, actually do!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Bryan<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Mortgage Hacker<\/strong><\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>We just cut our 3.75% mortgage interest rate to 1.96%. NO, we did not rob a bank or refinance or pay a penny in extra fees to do it either!<\/p>\n<p>Here are the details: A year ago we bought a house &amp; now have that 30 year ball &amp; chain around our necks paying 3.75% interest. We immediately signed up for bi-weekly payments automatically withdrawn from our checking account every other Friday (so 13 payments are made in 12 months&#8211;one extra payment per year). This reduces our mortgage to 26 years.<\/p>\n<p>Our retired neighbor has a Masters degree in finance &amp; just spent 3 hours with us making suggestions to pay off this debt faster. He showed us website <a href=\"https:\/\/financialmentor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FinancialMentor.com<\/a> which calculated if we pay an extra $300 a month in principal, our mortgage will be paid off in 15 years 7 months.<\/p>\n<p>The BIGGEST EYE OPENER: the equivalent interest rate is reduced from 3.75% to 1.96% !!!! We just made our first extra $300 principal payment &amp; arranged to have the $300 extra payment automatically withdrawn from our checking account &amp; applied to the principal each 1st of the month.<\/p>\n<p>I highly recommend this website to people wanting to pay down their mortgage. It has a unique 4 column format so you can compare scenarios side by side with an amortization schedule too. It shows thousands of dollars saved in interest as well as cutting our mortgage length almost in half!<\/p>\n<p>-Debbi<\/p>\n<p>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: As a personal friend of Financial Mentor&#8217;s, I second Debbi&#8217;s recommendation here.

(Where I live it doesn\u2019t rain between May and November.). And while I live in a high-crime city, I have had exactly zero car break-ins.<\/p>\n<p>We also live in our 1,100 sq. ft basement and we rent out our main floor unit to a family because we would get more income from that unit. We were inspired by real estate investor, Scott Mcgillivray from HGTV, so we followed what he used to do.<\/p>\n<p>Our family, friends, and coworkers question why would we do such a thing. They always tell us that we should be living in the main floor unit. But honestly, we don\u2019t care what they say or think because living in the basement apartment doesn\u2019t change the quality of our life, especially when we\u2019re rarely home (it\u2019s reno\u2019d and cozy too, so we don\u2019t feel deprived).<\/p>\n<p>We just tell everyone \u201cmeh.. times are tough.. we\u2019re poor a$$ bums\u201d hah.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.finsavvypanda.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">fin$avvypanda<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The 5 Year Net Worth Tracker<\/strong><\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>J.
