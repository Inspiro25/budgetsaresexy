And now I get more of my space back too!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it all went down. I&#8217;m sure some of you can relate to some of this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 years ago I REALLY really REALLY wanted a piano cuz I wanted to learn how to play and figured the only way that was to happen was if we had one IN our house. Plus, I&#8217;ve always thought they looked pretty pimp in homes too and added in a bit of elegance ;)<\/li>\n<li>So we researched all over Craigslist and finally found the one that would soon be ours, for only $350.\u00a0 It was old &#8211; like 60 years old &#8211; and antique kinda looking, but everything was in decent shape and we were ready to start playing it!<\/li>\n<li>We paid another $200 for it to be moved professionally (I had originally thought I could save the money and just do it myself with a few friends, but after 10 seconds of even trying to LIFE the dang thing I realized I was a big ol&#8217; idiot.\u00a0 Plus it would probably break the car,\u00a0 haha&#8230;) and 2 weeks later it was ours.<\/li>\n<li>It then sat.<\/li>\n<li>And sat.<\/li>\n<li>And sat.<\/li>\n<li>Until one day I said\u00a0 &#8220;Hey you!\u00a0 Get your ass on it and start learning!&#8221; So I did&#8230; for 20 minutes.<\/li>\n<li>And then it sat again.<\/li>\n<li>And again.<\/li>\n<li>And again.<\/li>\n<li>Then in the first week of getting started on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/02\/j-money-target-diy-library\/\">Operation Pimp Library<\/a>, I decided it was finally time to just let go of it and hopefully find a family that would actually PLAY the darn thing.<\/li>\n<li>So we cleaned it up, double checked the condition of everything (it turned out 2 of the keys were a bit funky and only worked 50% of the time), and then listed it on Craigslist for a solid $300. $50 less than we originally paid for it, and $250 less if you count the $200 it took to move it on over (which we wouldn&#8217;t get back).<\/li>\n<li>And we waited.<\/li>\n<li>And waited and waited, and nothing.\u00a0 Unless you count the dozens of scammer emails all trying to rip you off behind your back (a-holes).<\/li>\n<li>So we went back and dropped it down to $250, and again waited.<\/li>\n<li>Nothing.<\/li>\n<li>Then we moved it to $200 and started getting a few hits here and there.\u00a0 Though if any of you have ever tried to sell something on Craigslist, you know about 50% of the potential buyers end up flaking out and never have the decency to even keep you updated&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Nothing panned out, and we gave up.<\/li>\n<li>2 weeks later I\u00a0 decided I had had enough, and got re-energized to complete the mission once and for all. It was taking up too much space!!<\/li>\n<li>I dropped the price, yet again, to $150, and decided that was the lowest we were gonna go and if\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t sell it at that point, it was going right out into the FREE department.<\/li>\n<li>We then probably went through 6 or 7 buyers humming and hawing about whether to buy it or not (the tricky part were the half-broken keys, of course), and then one family who told us 100% they wanted it and would be back in 3 days to pick it up.\u00a0 We thought for SURE it was a done deal at that point, but the night before they were set to come out, their piano teacher called and ended up giving them her old one for free!\u00a0 D&#8217;oh!<\/li>\n<li>Fast forward 3 more weeks &#8217;till yesterday, and we finally had a winner!!\u00a0 YAY!!!\u00a0 She came right on over &#8211; on schedule &#8211; took 8 minutes to look at it and take a diagnosis, and 10 seconds later I\u00a0 had $150 in cash and the movers planned to come out and pick it up.\u00a0 Mission completed!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The moral of the story?<\/strong>\u00a0 Keep being patient and evaluate things over and over again until you&#8217;ve finally found the winning concoction.\u00a0 Whether it&#8217;s with selling stuff, paying off debt, looking for a new job or whatever.\u00a0 It&#8217;s annoying as hell (believe me!), and you want to give up more often than not, but in the end good things DO come if it&#8217;s important to you and you stick to it :) And then afterwards it all becomes a part of &#8220;the story&#8221; and you move right into the next mission on your list!<\/p>\n<p>Which, for us, is now figuring out what to do with our two dusty guitars sitting around too, haha&#8230; I learned a 3rd moral here that me and instruments just don&#8217;t go together, no matter HOW sexy I think they are in my hands ;) That&#8217;ll save me a lot of money and trouble down the road!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Who else is on a mission to get rid of stuff taking up space in their house? <\/strong><\/em>Anyone just unloading it like a rock star?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Man, only took us THREE months to do!
