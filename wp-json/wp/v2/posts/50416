When I replied that I, too, was a 401(k) Millionaire, he invited me to tell my story and I agreed to do so in complete and transparent detail.<\/p>\n<p>Learn from it, apply the lessons, and you, too, can become a Millionaire!<\/p>\n<h2>The 9 Keys to Becoming a 401(k) Millionaire<\/h2>\n<p>The original story on becoming a 401(k) Millionaire cited 5 keys, of which I followed every last one, as well as 4 others I&#8217;ve learned throughout my life. I will be telling my story using all 9 of these steps, and will show you how they have helped my wife and I become 401(k) Millionaires ourselves.<\/p>\n<h2>Key #1: Start Young<\/h2>\n<p>On July 5, 1985 I started my first \u201ccareer\u201d job. \u00a0At 22 years of age, and just one month out of college, I was pleased with my $21,500 starting salary. \u00a0During my orientation, I signed up for our \u201cnew\u201d 401(k) plan, and contributed from my very first paycheck.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I\u2019ve lost track of my exact 401(k) contribution %\u2019s early in my career. \u00a0I believe I started at 6% (don\u2019t give up that employer match!), and I gradually increased it through the years. \u00a0As I became more knowledgeable about personal finance, I got much more aggressive in my contributions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019ve been contributing 15% or more for at least 2 decades now, and max out my 401(k) every year. \u00a0I\u2019ve never taken any money out of my 401(k). \u00a0Invest it, and forget it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My daughter just started her first \u201creal job\u201d as a police officer, and we taught her these <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theretirementmanifesto.com\/6-steps-financial-wealth\/\">\u201cFirst 6 Steps To Financial Wealth\u201d<\/a> . \u00a0Before she received her first paycheck, we set her up with a Vanguard Roth and a Capital One savings account. \u00a0We\u2019re teaching her the lessons we learned early, and I\u2019ve no doubt she\u2019ll see the benefits of \u201cstarting young\u201d as she goes through life.<\/p>\n<h2>Key #2: Crush It Early<\/h2>\n<p>While a lot of folks focus on \u201cFrugality\u201d as a key to wealth creation, a much bigger lever is to <em>maximize your earning potential<\/em>. \u00a0Early in your career, go \u201cabove and beyond\u201d to create your professional reputation. \u00a0You only get one chance to make a first impression, and it\u2019s never more important to impress the right people than in the first few years of your career. \u00a0When \u201cthe right folks\u201d notice early, you\u2019ll be naturally propelled in the first decade of your career, and much better positioned for lifetime advancement and wealth creation.<\/p>\n<p>I was fortunate to impress some of the \u201cright\u201d folks early in my career, and was offered my first promotion within 18 months. \u00a0A bit of luck always helps, and the reality is that my promotion was driven by the closing of the plant where I was working, and my company\u2019s desire to keep me in their employment. \u00a0I\u2019ll never regret going \u201cabove and beyond\u201d in those first 18 months. \u00a0It saved my job, and I gained a promotion in the process. \u00a0Almost everyone else I worked with found themselves unexpectedly unemployed. \u00a0I was one of the lucky ones, but I also worked hard for that opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Moving from an \u201cinternal\u201d Customer Service role to an \u201cexternal\u201d Sales Role, I saw my salary increase to $29,800 with my first relocation to our Dallas, TX sales office in December 1986. In 1988, I received (earned?) my second promotion, this time from \u201cSales Trainee\u201d to a full fledged \u201cSales Representative\u201d with another relocation (this time to Atlanta, GA) and another salary bump.<\/p>\n<p><strong>To give you a sense of what \u201cCrush It Early\u201d looks from a salary perspective, here\u2019s a history of my first 6 years in Corporate America (FYI: these were the days of stagflation, with high inflation, 15% mortgage rates, and much higher annual salary increases than today):<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 25px;\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"120\"><b>Date<\/b><\/td>\n<td width=\"100\"><b>Salary<\/b><\/td>\n<td width=\"100\"><b>% Increase<\/b><\/td>\n<td width=\"270&quot;\"><b>Comment<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jul, 1985<\/td>\n<td>$21,500<\/td>\n<td>n.a.<\/td>\n<td>Yay, My First Job!<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan, 1986<\/td>\n<td>$23,300<\/td>\n<td>8.4%<\/td>\n<td>My first raise!<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jul, 1986<\/td>\n<td>$25,100<\/td>\n<td>7.7%<\/td>\n<td>My boss, taking care of me<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dec, 2986<\/td>\n<td>$29,800<\/td>\n<td>18.7%<\/td>\n<td>My first promotion!!<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dec, 1987<\/td>\n<td>$32,200<\/td>\n<td>8.1%<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apr, 1988<\/td>\n<td>$35,700<\/td>\n<td>10.9%<\/td>\n<td>My second promotion!<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apr, 1989<\/td>\n<td>$38,500<\/td>\n<td>7.8%<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sep, 1989<\/td>\n<td>$41,500<\/td>\n<td>7.8%<\/td>\n<td>Job grade bump (competitor wanted me)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sep, 1990<\/td>\n<td>$44,100<\/td>\n<td width=\"50\">6.3%<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<p>Within 5 years, I had doubled my salary through hard work, making positive impressions, and having a competitor pursue me (unsolicited, but I listened. \u00a0After careful consideration, I told my boss about the offer, and received a nice \u201cmid-year\u201d retention bump as a result).<\/p>\n<p>Every time my salary increased, my wife and I took a portion of the increase and nudged up our 401(k) contributions before we ever saw the money.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Our Net Worth in 1988: $9,996.73<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Looking through my files for this article, the earliest 401(k) statement I could find was from June 1988. \u00a0At this point, I had been in my career for exactly 3 years. I had been married for less than a year, and my wife and I were $3.27 short of the $10k mark in my 401(k), as demonstrated below:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50425\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/401k-statement-1988.jpg\" alt=\"401k statement 1988\" width=\"624\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/401k-statement-1988.jpg 624w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/401k-statement-1988-300x141.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When we got married in 1987, my wife began work as an Executive Assistant. \u00a0Knowing we wanted her to be able to be a \u201cstay at home\u201d Mom when that time came, we increased my 401(k) and set up some ACH transfers to mutual funds, resulting in us <em><strong>saving the equivalent of 100% of her paycheck<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This allowed us to avoid getting used to her income, as well as the mistake of getting into obligations that required her pay for expense coverage. \u00a0When we adopted our daughter in 1994, \u00a0my wife simply \u201cretired\u201d (at age 31, lucky girl!), and we cut back a bit on our savings to keep our take home pay constant.<\/p>\n<p>From 1987 to 1994, our 401(k) balance increased from $10k to $59k as a result of that decision, and set us on the path toward our eventual \u201c401(k) Millionaire\u201d status.<\/p>\n<h2>Key #3: Seek Opportunities For Exposure<\/h2>\n<p>By 1990, I started getting more involved with a broader communication effort around the organization. \u00a0One of those initiatives was to visit our plants with a \u201ccommercial update\u201d, providing our plant workers a report from the \u201cfront lines\u201d on what was happening with our customers and marketplace. \u00a0I was 27 years old, and giving presentations to a room full of shop floor personnel.<\/p>\n<p>Seek opportunities! \u00a0The effort paid off with even more folks starting to recognize me as a \u201cyoung guy with potential\u201d, and my reputation continued to grow:<\/p>\n<p><b><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50426\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/opportunity-rewarded.jpg\" alt=\"opportunity rewarded\" width=\"624\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/opportunity-rewarded.jpg 624w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/opportunity-rewarded-300x163.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Keys #4 and #5: Get Out Of Your Comfort Zone (and Find A Mentor)<\/h2>\n<p>After 15 years in Sales, I was getting restless. \u00a0I had a strong mentor who ran one of our larger plants, and I had some excellent career discussions with him in my mid-30\u2019s. \u00a0He kept an eye out for me, and within a short amount of time I had moved from a commercial role into my first \u201cplant job\u201d, planning the production &amp; scheduling of a large operation.<\/p>\n<p>That experience later led to opportunities for career advancement into national and global management roles, and I\u2019m sure I would have never made those advancements without breaking out of the \u201csales track\u201d which I had been on for 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, \u00a0looking through my career files for this post, I found a note I had written to myself at the same point in my career when I had decided to \u201cbranch out\u201d. \u00a0Looking back, I had no idea how significant the quote would become:<\/p>\n<p><b><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50427\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/ralph-waldo-emerson-quote.jpg\" alt=\"ralph waldo emerson quote\" width=\"624\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/ralph-waldo-emerson-quote.jpg 624w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/ralph-waldo-emerson-quote-300x237.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Key #6: Watch Out For Fees<\/h2>\n<p>Fortunately, my employer had chosen Vanguard as their 401(k) provider, and I was rewarded with a low cost 401(k) plan that had excellent investment options. \u00a0My employer also continued to improve the plan over the years, with expanded investment choices and continued low fees.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a good plan, I would still encourage you to participate in your plan. \u00a0At a minimum, do not give up the employer match. \u00a0It\u2019s free money, and the 50 &#8211; 100% \u201creturn\u201d you get from your employer\u2019s match offsets any high fees and poor investment choices you may have in your plan.<\/p>\n<p>Review your plan now, and if you\u2019re not maximizing your employer match, increase your contributions before your next paycheck!<\/p>\n<h2>Key #7: Max Out Your Contributions<\/h2>\n<p>As my salary continued to increase, we continued to increase our 401(k) contribution. \u00a0If I received a 3% raise, for example, I\u2019d increase my 401(k) contributions by 2% in the month the raise took effect.<\/p>\n<p>Our take-home pay would increase by 1%, and we\u2019d feel like we had a bit more money. \u00a0More importantly, our 401(k) investments increased on a compounding scale. \u00a0We did that every year, until we hit the limit that I was allowed to contribute to the plan.<\/p>\n<p>We still do the \u201cmental gymnastics\u201d, but we now (since we\u2019re maxing out the 401) use external mutual funds and ACH transfers to capture the increases in annual savings %\u2019s.<\/p>\n<h2>Key #8: Live Frugally<\/h2>\n<p>As my salary increased over the years, the strategy of increasing my contributions at the same time we received a raise helped avoid lifestyle inflation. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen many, many co-workers increase their living expenses as their salaries have increased, and I suspect most of those are not yet 401(k) millionaires (or any millionaires for that matter).<\/p>\n<p>My wife and I have always lived below our means, and I firmly believe that\u2019s played the biggest role in becoming a millionaire. \u00a0We\u2019ve always been generous, and have contributed annually to our church and charities of our choice.
