And all it does is want to play and love and be HAPPY in a cozey warm home!!! CAN WE KEEP HIM??????<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been asking my wife this going on three days now with no luck ;) But let me backtrack a little&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>If any of you <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/budgetsaresexy\">follow me on Twitter<\/a>, you&#8217;ll know exactly what this is about.<\/strong> For those of you who don&#8217;t, here&#8217;s the breakdown of the awesomeness that&#8217;s been happening around here &#8211; a nice change from the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/09\/biggest-idiot-in-the-world\/\">car crashing idiocracy<\/a> a day earlier:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Baby money and I are enjoying some fresh morning air on our steps, when around the corner &#8211; 3 feet away &#8211; we hear these itsy bitsy cries from something that could only be as adorable as a cat.<\/li>\n<li>And it was! This little baby cat, not older than a few weeks, putters right up to us and starts purring around our legs!<\/li>\n<li>We play with him, feed him, and then realize that we may have a problem on our hands &#8211; he has no home :(<\/li>\n<li>Is he stray? Lost? Where&#8217;s his mommy and daddy?? Where are his owners??<\/li>\n<li>We play and check on him every few hours outside while we call around a few places (we can&#8217;t bring him inside because we&#8217;re not sure how our cat will cope with him, and if he&#8217;s a stray we don&#8217;t know what type of diseases\/etc he may have), and then we lose him.<\/li>\n<li>Yes, the lost cat is now lost again!!<\/li>\n<li>Fast forward until the evening when a neighbor comes by and asks if we lost a kitten? &#8220;YES!!! I mean, no &#8211; it&#8217;s not OUR kitten, but YES! We didn&#8217;t know where he went off to!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>It turns out he wondered a few doors down and our nice neighbor brought him into her house to care for him until they could figure out what to do (they have 4 other cats and are no strangers to them). After taking him to a vet down the road, they got confirmation that he is indeed a &#8220;he,&#8221; but sadly has no microchip to point us in the right direction :( They&#8217;ve been going up and down the block looking for his home, but sadly have had no luck.<\/li>\n<li>My wife says we cannot have another cat as we&#8217;re already overloaded with responsibility and our money isn&#8217;t what it used to be any more (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/08\/reasons-im-not-rich\/\">sad, but true<\/a>), and we need to help find him a home.<\/li>\n<li>So we post up a &#8220;lost kitten&#8221; message on Craigslist, and we get two replies back right away.<\/li>\n<li>The first (and I kid you not): &#8220;Is his balls shaven? If so, it&#8217;s ours. We just had him neutered and we&#8217;d like him back please.&#8221; Umm&#8230;.. no, he&#8217;s not shaven there. &#8220;Are you SURE?? You have to really poke around with your fingers around his nuts and look for the tiny incisions&#8221; &#8220;No. No incisions and no shavings &#8211; stop!&#8221; Haha&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>The second: &#8220;We saw a little kitten who was lost just yesterday around your area, and we&#8217;d like to give him a forever home!&#8221; Awwwww!!!!! That&#8217;s fantastic! &#8220;Wait, did you say he was a *boy*? Oh&#8230; the one we saw was a girl. And my husband said it&#8217;s best to have girls as indoor cats&#8221; Ummm&#8230;..<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>And that&#8217;s pretty much where we are today.<\/strong> Waiting to see if we have found him a home as yet (the person hasn&#8217;t committed one way or the other), and we&#8217;re also waiting back to hear from one other person possibly interested.<\/p>\n<p>So as of right now it could go one of three ways:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The CL emailer #2 could give him a home<\/li>\n<li>A friend on Facebook could give him a home<\/li>\n<li>The neighbor who already HAS him can potentially let him stay?<\/li>\n<li>Or we can give him a home as long as I can convince my wife ;)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>And that&#8217;s the tricky part here &#8211; COULD we take on more responsibility right now? And DO we have the money to be able to do so comfortably?<\/strong> The answer might be yes on the 1st one, but the 2nd is far from absolute.<\/p>\n<p>While calling around the shelters and vet earlier in the day, we learned it would <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>cost us around $500<\/strong><\/span> just to get him up on his shots and neutered and all set to go and everything for the first year. A shocking reminder again at <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/biggest-budget-expenses\/\">how expensive cats can be<\/a> :( And that&#8217;s if there&#8217;s nothing wrong with him.<\/p>\n<p>But, interestingly enough, a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/candyarmor\">kind friend<\/a> on Twitter mentioned that sometimes if you tell the vets you found a stray but would like to give &#8217;em a home, they sometimes discount it and so it MAY just be more affordable!<\/p>\n<p><strong>We call a few places back later that afternoon, and each of them say they&#8217;re sorry but can&#8217;t offer any support.<\/strong> &#8220;This is the time of year where kittens come out of the woodwork. The babies are being born from all the strays over the Summer, and then you have the owners of the house cats dropping them off on unexpecting people too. That&#8217;s probably how he landed on your door &#8211; the kittens are everywhere right now!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/found-kitten-2.jpg\" \/><\/center><strong>Wow. Who knew it was such a problem?<\/strong> (Don&#8217;t answer that &#8211; I&#8217;m sure all of you pet lovers do and I&#8217;m the naive turd that doesn&#8217;t). LUCKILY though, she gives us a place to check out online who *does* offer discounts if your application is accepted and they&#8217;re not full. Which of course is a very likely situation considering the &#8220;kittens everywhere!&#8221; epidemic apparently going on right now.<\/p>\n<p>We check out the website, and after adding up all the costs on the list we think there&#8217;s a good chance of it <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>coming out to around $180.00<\/strong> <\/span>if we could pull it off. A MUCH do-able number than <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$500.00<\/strong><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So that&#8217;s the spot we&#8217;re in right now &#8211; a limbo one while waiting if the others will give him a home, or if WE should be the ones to do so.<\/strong> I wish it were black and white to help make the decision easier (&#8220;If you don&#8217;t adopt him, he will go to a kill shelter&#8221;) but at the moment that&#8217;s not the case. And thankfully so ;) I guess the best case scenario is for the CL #2 family to give him that &#8220;forever&#8221; home, followed by the neighbors keeping him if at all possible. Something we haven&#8217;t directly asked them about, but I can&#8217;t imagine them sending him away with a bleak future.<\/p>\n<p>Financially speaking I know it would be dumb to take on the extra expenses. We&#8217;re already trying to recover from this <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/net-worth-update-down-40k-10-percent-loss\/\">perfect storm<\/a> that hit us this Summer, and we need to be MAKING more money and not spending more. But on the flip side, our hearts are saying DO IT!!! Take the poor little guy in &#8211; Baby $ and Money Cat will love playing with a new friend! It will be awesome!!!<\/p>\n<p>Haha&#8230; I think I should stop there &#8211; I&#8217;ve rambled on enough :)<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What would you guys do if you were in this situation? Or maybe you HAVE been in this situation before?<\/strong> <strong>Do any of you Virginia lovers want to come over and love him for us??<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, that&#8217;s all I really want for our new friend &#8211; a loving home. As long as he gets that, I&#8217;ll be fine with however it plays out. He&#8217;s just a baby and still has his whole life ahead of him!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> You really do need to be <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/budgetsaresexy\">following me on Twitter<\/a> already &#8211; you&#8217;re missing out ;)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oh I want this furball soooooooooooo bad!
