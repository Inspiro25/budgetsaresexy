She not only makes some serious points, but she lives and breathes this stuff daily. Enjoy!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>I will never forget the first client who entrusted me with investing her money,<\/strong> and the day that money was delivered into my firm for me to manage. I will never forget it, because that was the day that I stopped sleeping.<\/p>\n<p>Why did I stop sleeping? I felt the weight of hers and other client\u2019s hopes and dreams falling on my investing shoulders, and it felt like the weight of the world. After all, I spent days and weeks getting to know this person, to understand what she wanted from life, to find out about her kids, her job, her retirement goals. And now the decisions that I was making for her could mean that Billy couldn\u2019t go to the college he wanted or Suzie wouldn\u2019t have the wedding of her dreams. Or, worse, Mrs. Smith would now have to work until she was 80 instead of 65 to achieve her goal of retiring to Florida.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I may be exaggerating a little, but I would want a financial advisor who lost sleep at night over my money rather than the alternative.<\/strong> And having worked in one of the largest financial advisory firms in the country, I can assure you that most advisors don\u2019t lose a minute of sleep over your portfolio. In fact, many advisors I worked with told me that I was \u201ctoo emotional\u201d when I would share my fears. I didn\u2019t understand how they <em>couldn\u2019t<\/em> get emotional about money?<\/p>\n<p>In order to better control my emotions, and get some sleep as a financial advisor, my best solution was in my <a href=\"http:\/\/financially-blonde.com\/fear-factor-investing\/\">very own investing strategy<\/a>. I invested my client\u2019s money the same way I invested my own money to varying degrees of asset allocation. And unfortunately that practice is not the norm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Advisors all have what I call their \u201csecret sauce\u201d or their investment portfolio that they utilize for clients.<\/strong> Most advisors guard their secret sauce as much as Bush\u2019s guards the secret to their baked beans. In fact, when I started out and was in the process of developing my own sauce, it was very difficult for me to get any sound advice from the senior advisors. This always surprised me because I wondered why they wouldn\u2019t want to share the secret of their success with others?<\/p>\n<p>After some finagling and threats by my manager, I became privy to the secret sauces of many advisors and what shocked me the most was how different their client\u2019s sauce was compared to their own. <em>How could you invest one way and do something different with client money?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Unfortunately, the basic answer to that question is that you make more money selling some investments over others,<\/strong> and money is a highly motivating factor in investing decisions. However, there are certainly other reasonable responses that are not quite as nefarious as this one. The only way you can really know, though, is to ask.<\/p>\n<p>On just about every financial website available, there are many articles about the questions you should ask your financial advisor. And typical questions include the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is your investment philosophy?<\/li>\n<li>How do you get compensated?<\/li>\n<li>How much money do you have under management?<\/li>\n<li>What services does your firm offer?<\/li>\n<li>How frequently should I expect to hear from you?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And let me let you in on a little secret, most of these questions were created by financial advisory firms and they specifically train their advisors on how to best answer these questions. In fact, we had weekly role-play dialogues where we were trained in the best responses to these questions. So if your advisor has a great answer to your question, it is because he or she has been trained to answer it.<\/p>\n<h2>Here is the question you REALLY need to ask your advisor:<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cHow do you invest YOUR money, and can I see your portfolio?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40396\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/shocked-face.gif\" alt=\"shocked face\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You will get lots of responses, I am sure, and here is how I would respond to some of them:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Advisor Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cMy compliance would not allow me to share that with you.\u201d<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>My Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cBS, that\u2019s a lame excuse and you are just a chicken. What are you hiding?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Advisor Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cI don\u2019t have money invested right now.\u201d<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>My Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cReally? Is it because you don\u2019t have money or you are sitting on the sidelines with cash?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If they don\u2019t have money, run away. I don\u2019t think an advisor has to have millions of dollars but just like I wouldn\u2019t hire a pediatrician who doesn\u2019t have kids, I wouldn\u2019t hire an <a href=\"http:\/\/financially-blonde.com\/beware-financial-dorian-grays\/\">advisor who doesn\u2019t have any money<\/a>. Even a little in a 401k or IRA is better than nothing. If they are sitting on the sidelines with cash, why are they advising you to jump in when they are sitting out?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Advisor Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cAll of my money is tied up in real estate.\u201d<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>My Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cYou just talked about asset allocation for 30 minutes, do you not take your own advice?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Advisor Response<\/span>:<\/strong> \u201cWell I have different goals for my money than you.\u201d<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>My Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cYes, and different goals would just suggest different percentages of asset allocation not completely different assets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Advisor Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cI will gladly provide you with a statement of my holdings and I will white out the dollar amounts.\u201d<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>My Response:<\/strong><\/span> \u201cYou are hired.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hedge fund and private equity investors require that their fund managers have money invested in the fund before they commit to investing in it. If this is a good rule of thumb for people with millions of dollars to invest, why shouldn\u2019t it be a good rule for people with thousands of dollars to invest?<\/p>\n<p>Advisors will tell you that no one should care more about your money than you. These are the advisors you want to invest alongside with because he or she clearly cares for their portfolio the most. Your relationship with your financial advisor is similar to that of your spouse, and if you can\u2019t trust them and feel comfortable knowing you are on the same team together, then why get married to begin with?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep this in mind the next time you sit down with an advisor.<\/strong> It may feel a bit awkward asking at first, but remember &#8211; it&#8217;s your money. And nobody cares about it more than you.<\/p>\n<p>Have any of you ever asked to see <em>your<\/em> advisor\u2019s investments before?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em><strong>Shannon McLay<\/strong> is a financial planner who left a \u201ctraditional\u201d financial services firm to start her own company, NextGen Financial, to help clients in their 20s and 30s get financially fit.
