Even if it\u2019s all just more fluffy advice that may or may not pertain to your specific situation, haha&#8230; but either way, I don&#8217;t think you could go that wrong by following suit. Especially if you like knowing what\u2019s good to do in more general terms with finances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s how <em>Money Mag<\/em> thinks we can stay on track:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age 22:<\/strong> You should be contributing at LEAST 3% of your salary into your company\u2019s 401(k) plan.\u00a0 Even better if you put in more and your employer matches over that 3% line!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 25:<\/strong> Start socking away $150\/mo, and push it up with every raise (I totally agree \u2013 esp to avoid that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/07\/control-lifestyle-inflation-before-it\/\">lifestyle inflation<\/a> AND before you start missing any new money hitting your account ;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 27:<\/strong> Now that you\u2019re probably on to job #3 within the last 5 years (the average according to <em>Money<\/em>), make sure you\u2019re rolling over your original 401(k)s or at least putting them into a main IRA account. \u00a0Whatever you do, DO NOT CASH THEM OUT! Mainly because it hurts your retirement funding in the long run, but also because you\u2019ll then get hit with a TON of penalties and fees for withdrawing too early. Better to avoid the whole thing if possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 30:<\/strong> You should now have <strong>\u00bd<\/strong> your yearly salary saved up through all your retirement accounts.\u00a0 (Looking back to my 30<sup>th<\/sup> birthday <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/01\/net-worth-december-2009-up-120-since\/\">Net Worth Update<\/a> (December of \u201809), looks like I had <strong><em>$137,181<\/em><\/strong> saved up! 2x my-then salary \u2013 woohoo!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 31:<\/strong> Make sure you&#8217;re negotiating your next big promotions that you tend to get around this stage of your career&#8230; something I used to suck at :(<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 34:<\/strong> If you\u2019re thinking of taking time off to raise your kids, keep in mind you\u2019ll need to increase savings to 17% to get back on top once you\u2019re at work again (up from the 13% of salary they say you should be doing at this point).\u00a0 They also recommend maxing out a <em>Spousal IRA<\/em> during these times which comes out to $5k every year you decide to take off.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 35:<\/strong> As you start investing outside of your 401(k), it\u2019s now a good idea to pick up index funds to help limit your fees going forward.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 40:<\/strong> You should now have <strong>2x<\/strong> your annual salary saved up within your retirement funds. (That\u2019s 4x what you needed to have 10 years ago when you were 30 \u2013 yikes!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 42:<\/strong>\u00a0 Stop putting on pounds and start working out (I know \u2013 sounds random here, but I guess in the long term you save more money by staying fit?)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 45:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/05\/we-refinanced-our-mortgage\/\">Refinance your 30-year mortgage<\/a> if you haven\u2019t done so already (And in this day in age, you might have already done it like 3 times! Haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 50:<\/strong> You should now have a good <strong>4.5x<\/strong> your salary saved up (or 3.5x if you plan on working \u2018till you\u2019re 70), and are now eligible to make catch-up contributions of $5,000 into your 401(k) plan (and an <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/roth-traditional-ira-contribution-limits\/\">additional $1k<\/a> in your IRAs).\u00a0 Also apparently now is a good time to start buying used cars over new ones every 5 years and then invest your savings\u2026 but I say do that from day #1!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 58:<\/strong> Discourage kids from moving back home for long \u2013 you need to focus on finances (Not only does that sound a lot easier that it probably is, but why NOW do you need to focus on finances? Haven\u2019t you already been doing that for the past 40 years according to this plan? Jeesh.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 60:<\/strong> You should now have <strong>8.1x<\/strong> your pay saved up. (Why the 0.1 I don\u2019t know ;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 62:<\/strong> Wait to collect Social Security! Your benefit will grow 8% each year you delay up until you hit 70. (IF there\u2019s any money left ;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 63:<\/strong> Downsize to cut housing expenses like taxes, insurance, and upkeep (I plan on doing that wayyyyy sooner than my 60s\u2026 maybe even in the next year?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 65:<\/strong> Try and work 2 more years at a desk, or part-time job. The chances you won\u2019t run out of money in retirement would then get bumped up from 70% to 85%.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 67:<\/strong> If you squeeze in 1 more work year, your odds of money lasting will now increase to 90%.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age 70:<\/strong> Register for a home swap at <a href=\"http:\/\/homeexchange.com\/\">HomeExchange.com<\/a> to save on travel.\u00a0 (I don&#8217;t know why you have to wait until 70 to take advantage of that, though?)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So there you have it.\u00a0 A bunch of milestones to hit over your next XX years depending on how old you are right now :)\u00a0 If this site sticks around for another 40 years, perhaps I\u2019ll make an update with every notch we hit? Haha\u2026 Think the internet will still be around then too? ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are you guys doing according to this timeline?\u00a0 And how OLD are you anyways if you don\u2019t mind me asking?<\/strong>\u00a0 I sometimes forget that a handful of you fall way under (and over) my target audience of 20s and 30s here, so I\u2019m super curious to see the range of ages now reading this site :) The other day we made a Justin Timberlake reference w\/ those new <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/03\/im-bringing-budgets-back-t-shirt-for-sale\/\">budgeting t-shirts<\/a> we made, and it never occurred to me that some of y\u2019all wouldn\u2019t get it!\u00a0 Which is actually kinda cool too, in that so many DIFFERENT ages and people come to this site &#8211; I like it. Money doesn\u2019t discriminate between ages anyways, so if you\u2019re good at it at 16, you can be good at it at 60! And I think all of y&#8217;all are headed into that right direction just by following finance blogs already :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So give yourself a hearty pat on the back, even if you don\u2019t feel like telling me how old you are today :)<\/strong>\u00a0 I&#8217;ve got nothing but love for ya as long as you keep on paying attention to that money!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/8047705@N02\/\">LifeSupercharger<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019ve ever wondered how much money you should have saved up at certain points of your life, the new issue of Money Mag gives&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/50-year-financial-game-plan-by-age\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[105,12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-24168","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-money-management","category-saving"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>A 50 Year Financial Game Plan | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/50-year-financial-game-plan-by-age\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"A 50 Year Financial Game Plan | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"If you\u2019ve ever wondered how much money you should have saved up at certain points of your life, the new issue of Money Mag gives...
