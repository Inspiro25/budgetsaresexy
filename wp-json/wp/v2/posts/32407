Nothing incredibly Earth shattering or anything, but nonetheless something to keep in mind if you&#8217;re debating between some serious decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the email that started it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I bought my house a couple years ago, and I love it. It is dated and moving into the the need-replacing stage, but with some TLC, it could be my dream home. Given the market timing of my purchase and unfortunately the rush into buying that I had to do &#8211; life happens, sometimes, doesn&#8217;t it? &#8211; I am about 10% upside down.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been wrestling with myself lately whether I should be putting my extra bits of money into the mortgage to both get right-side up and remove PMI, or if I should save up for home improvements, like renovating the bathrooms and kitchen and repairing the HVAC system. At this point, everything is usable and safe, but it&#8217;s dated\/ugly and there is existing damage from previously leaky faucets.<\/p>\n<p>I will put in sweat equity, but I am still looking at a couple thousand per renovation, and the only ROI I see is personal &#8211; my joy when I see it and no embarrassment when having people over. I have no plans on moving anytime soon &#8211; assuming life cooperates &#8211; and while the renovations would increase home value, I know it&#8217;d be a small fraction of what I put into it.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughts?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>GREAT question indeed &#8211; and one I ponder just about 3 times a day, haha&#8230;<\/strong> We, too, are in some need of minor repairs and especially cosmetic ones (our cupboards are from the 80&#8217;s and are all a nasty yellow, including counter tops) and I go back and forth between <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/mortgage-payoff-plan\/\">killing our mortgages<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/update-mortgage-payoff-plan\/\">making improvements<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But yeah, tough call and pros\/cons either way. I think what it really comes down to is personal preference and what excites you the most. If that means a nicer inside both for everyday pleasure and when guests come over (and of course future selling\/renting one day), then I&#8217;d go that route. But if you&#8217;re like me and just hate those damn mortgages, I&#8217;d switch to that one instead &#8211; esp if it saves you more money continuously each month too by ridding the PMI.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The good part here is that you can&#8217;t really lose with either route<\/strong> as they both pay dividends going forward, ya know? So my advice (which is limited since I don&#8217;t know you or how you think\/operate much, or at all, haha&#8230;) is to do <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/03\/books-make-me-feel-warm-and-cozy\/\">whatever makes you happy right NOW<\/a>. <em>And if that switches in a few months, then switch where your money&#8217;s going too!<\/em> I firmly believe you can&#8217;t go wrong when doing what&#8217;s the most exciting at the given point in time, and in cases like these it&#8217;s easy to keep switching where your money&#8217;s routing too.<\/p>\n<p>I do it all the time with my mortgage plan I linked to up there &#8211; some months I&#8217;m dead on w\/ paying $2k extra, and others I&#8217;m not in the mood and would rather use it towards saving or investing, or the dreaded home repairs that happen out of the blue like our water heater dying :( Which is the worst cuz those aren&#8217;t cosmetic at all! So def. make sure you have an emergency fund set up too for all that kinda stuff, regardless of where you&#8217;re putting your future money &#8211; that&#8217;s important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then this was her response back :)<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Thanks so much for responding. This is going to sound really silly, but I never really thought that I could re-purpose the money! For some reason, I&#8217;ve thought that I *have* to stick with whatever choice I make. Although, if I did put money directly into the mortgage or a home improvement, I am stuck with that choice, but if the money is sitting in an account, I can change my mind whenever. And of course, I change up future money&#8217;s direction. I don&#8217;t know why that never occurred to me. Weird!<\/p>\n<p>I completely understand the cabinet disgust &#8211; I have the original 70s brown cabinetry in the kitchen and baths, complete with scratches and dings from decades of use. My parents own a cabinet shop, and when my dad helps me repair one of the cabinets, he razzes me about having such crappy cabinets when I <em>know people.<\/em> I remind him that I have to save for the upgrade.<\/p>\n<p>Way to go on the extra mortgage payments, you&#8217;re an inspiration! I round up to the nearest hundred each month but haven&#8217;t had a chance to do more. I whole-heartedly agree with the house emergency fund. I had a home warranty for the first 3 years and they replaced the main breakers and the water heater, repaired the furnace, and did some plumbing repairs to both tubs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now that the &#8220;major&#8221; stuff is out of the way, I am my own home warranty, paying a savings account<\/strong> the same amount as I was paying the home warranty company. Unfortunately, I still have to come up with money for stuff that a home warranty wouldn&#8217;t cover, like the roof I replaced last year, the attic insulation I had blown in, and Solatubes that I had installed when the roof was replaced. (Randomness: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=solatube&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Asolatube&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps\">Solatubes<\/a> are amazing! I have natural (and free!) sunlight in my windowless bathroom and dark hallways. I love them!) I did some hardcore cringing when I looked at how much money went into the house last year, but I remind myself that I love my house, and renting a comparable place would cost a couple hundred more.<\/p>\n<p>As much as I despise the looming cloud of debt, I think the home renovations would yield more personal happiness &#8211; I&#8217;d have the pride of sweat equity and a house matched perfectly to my tastes. So to compromise with the rational side of the brain, I&#8217;ll probably divvy up the bits of money with a little more towards the mortgage and the rest set aside for home improvements.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again. If I get to any of the renovations in a reasonable time, I&#8217;ll send you an update on whether it was worth it or not :D<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>That first line up there is key: &#8220;I never really thought that I could re-purpose the money.&#8221;<\/strong> Most of us DON&#8217;T when we&#8217;re in the thick of the decision-making like that, especially the bigger picture things. Or at least I don&#8217;t. I always think that whatever&#8217;s happening right this instant will continue on forever like a big ol&#8217; dummy :) Which is actually pretty amazing that I can plan for the future\u00a0<em>financially<\/em> no problem, but am at a total loss when it comes to anything else!<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, good food for thought. Again, nothing too new here, but do know it&#8217;s okay to change your mind as time and life presents themselves to you. You can only fully understand what&#8217;s going on *today* since we don&#8217;t have any crystal balls for later, ya know? And it&#8217;s not like anyone&#8217;s going to tell on you anyways &#8211; most people are too wrapped up in their own problems to even notice ;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/76657755@N04\/\">Tax Credits<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about this for quite some time, and then over the weekend a fellow reader got it out of me in&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/you-can-always-change-where-your-moneys-going\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[98,8,105,134],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-32407","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-debt","category-home-ownership","category-money-management","category-reader-mail"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>You Can Always Switch Where Your Money&#039;s Going. | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/you-can-always-change-where-your-moneys-going\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"You Can Always Switch Where Your Money&#039;s Going. | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about this for quite some time, and then over the weekend a fellow reader got it out of me in...
