And it could also be a cheap-ish adventure of a lifetime that you can plan for your kids! (Or in my case &#8212; future kids!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story starts about 30 years ago, back when my friend was ~10 years old\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Backstory &#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend\u2019s Dad came home from work one day and said there was a rumor floating around town: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere might be some old hidden treasure buried in this area from pirates way back in the day.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was in rural Montana, so the idea of buried treasure isn\u2019t that far-fetched. People find old weird stuff in the woods all the time up there. Plus, kids are excited to believe any fun story &#8212; especially if it involves pirates and treasure! &#x1f3f4;&#x200d; &#x2620;&#xfe0f;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few days later, the Dad came back from the pub and said there was an old man there who had his tongue cut out! Apparently his tongue had been removed because he knew the location of the secret treasure, and the pirates didn\u2019t want him running his mouth. My friend\u2019s Dad warned his sons not to tell any of their school friends about the treasure, or their lives might be in danger, too\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few more days passed and the Dad laid on the story even thicker \u2026 He said he might have discovered the general location of the treasure! And that maybe he and the boys should go camping that weekend and search the area for any clues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weekend came and they went camping at a remote lake in the middle of nowhere. They brought flashlights, shovels, a compass \u2026 You know, all the tools they had seen people use in the movies when treasure hunting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After setting up camp and looking around, one of the boys found a large rock with some strange markings. The Dad told the kids to start digging, and lo and behold, there was a map hidden in the ground! (Actually, it was one-third of a treasure map, with clues to the other missing pieces.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took the entire weekend for the kids to decipher the clues, find the various map pieces, and finally locate and dig up the treasure. The treasure itself was a bunch of foreign coins, old jewelry, and other antique trinkets that you could imagine would be inside an old treasure chest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was one of the most memorable weekends of my friend\u2019s life. And the Dad never told the kids he had set the whole thing up. I think at some point in high school my friend figured out it was all rigged &#8212; but he didn\u2019t care. It was still one of the best memories from his childhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Burying Treasure for Our Future Kids<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when my friend first told me this story, we started joking about doing something similar one day for our kids. We weren\u2019t even married yet, but we always dreamed of giving our kids the same fun childhoods we had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one of us came up with the idea to bury treasure *now,* even though we didn\u2019t have kids yet. Also, since we had many years to plan, maybe we could set up a *global* treasure hunt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little while later (this was back in early 2014), my wife and I got engaged and planned a trip down to Australia to visit my family. We invited a handful of friends to join us and thought this would be the perfect time to find a remote location, bury some treasure, and maybe return one day with our kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Treasure We Buried<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were about 8 of us, and we all chipped in various items. Coins, fool\u2019s gold, gemstones and silver jewelry. Some of our parents threw in stuff like old rings, bracelets, watches &#8230; I specifically remember my Mum adding a special ring that her Grandma passed down. Not sure if it\u2019s worth much, but kind of cool knowing that it&#8217;s there (and that maybe MY kid will dig it up one day).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a photo from the night before we buried the box. We were swapping stories, memories, and making sure all the items inside looked \u201ccool\u201d for kids to find.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64174 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IMG_1321-scaled-e1629426863736.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The box itself wasn\u2019t too big. Maybe the size of a small shoe box. From memory, we wrapped it up in a garbage bag so the elements wouldn\u2019t eat and rot the wood. Here\u2019s a peek inside&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64173 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IMG_1322-scaled-e1629426874764.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Where We Buried the Treasure<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not so fast! You didn\u2019t think I was going to reveal the exact location of the treasure, did you? If I were to tell anyone, I think my friends would have my tongue cut out. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I can tell you is this: It is buried somewhere inside the state of South Australia. (Map below if you don\u2019t know where that is.) We went hiking deep inside a nature reserve and buried the treasure off-trail, in the middle of nowhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64175 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-12-at-12.04.07-PM-e1629426853946.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"402\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, maybe it\u2019s a little too well hidden. My friends and I joke about not being able to find it with the crappy notes and vague maps we have. I think one of us was smart enough to snap the GPS coordinates with our iPhone, but don\u2019t know how accurate they are. There\u2019s only one way to find out &#8212; to take the trip again with our kids one day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>So \u2026 When Are We Going to Dig It Up?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend has 2 kids, and the oldest one is 5. Our nephews are about that age too, so I think we\u2019re about 5 years away from planning a big family trip to dig it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I still don\u2019t have kids yet. We got introduced to our foster\/adopt social worker this month and are in the matching process. We\u2019re requesting kids in the 2-6 age range, so if this ends up happening, all our kids will be about the same age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, it looks like 2026 or so is when we\u2019ll head back down &#8212; when the older kids are 10ish. Until then, we are still coming up with a narrative for our treasure story to tell the kids. Also, we are thinking of burying <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> treasure &#8212; on another continent maybe &#8212; and making this truly a worldwide hunt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty cool, hey?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have any of you done something like this? Time capsules or adventures you had growing up that you plan to relive with your kids?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a great weekend,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love, Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy Friday, everyone!
