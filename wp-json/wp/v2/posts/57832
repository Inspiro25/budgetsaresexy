Got a juicy guest post for you today by fellow blogger and money coach, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.christineluken.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christine Luken<\/a>. Is Dave Ramsey right when it comes paying off debt? In this article, Christine Luken challenges some of his baby steps. I know many of you have opinions on Dave Ramsey, so make sure to stop by the comments after and share them with us ;) I couldn&#8217;t help but interject my own thoughts throughout as well &#8211; so hopefully you come away with some better insights after reading this! Enjoy!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sixteen years ago, I facilitated my first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.daveramsey.com\/fpu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Peace University<\/a> (FPU) class.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of it, Financial Peace University is money guru, Dave Ramsey\u2019s, cornerstone financial literacy course. Having been to financial rock bottom myself, I appreciated his no-nonsense, tough love approach to money management. In fact, I facilitated FPU for ten years, sometimes teaching the class multiple times a year at my church as an unpaid volunteer.<\/p>\n<p>I was a such hardcore Dave Ramsey devotee, that I paid $2,500 to take the training that would qualify me to become one of his Certified Financial Counselors in 2008. I honestly didn\u2019t plan on turning it into my full-time business, but here I am, almost seven years into my entrepreneurial adventure as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineluken.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Lifeguard<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I started out taking everything Dave Ramsey said as gospel truth, but after a decade of coaching hundreds of people on their finances, I not only started to ask the question, &#8220;Is Dave Ramsey right?&#8221; but I realized he\u2019s simply wrong about a few things.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The late success expert, Jim Rohn, said something very profound regarding mentors:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don\u2019t be follower; be a student. Make sure your actions are the product of your own conclusions.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Based on my own experience and that of my coaching clients, I believe Dave Ramsey is wrong about the following six things:<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Using Cash Envelopes<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s true that spending cash hurts (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/17\/business\/paying-with-cash-hurts-thats-also-why-it-feels-so-good.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you literally experience it as pain in your brain<\/a>), which makes it an effective budgeting tool. However, I don\u2019t suggest that my coaching clients use cash for everything.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, it\u2019s inconvenient to do so when you want to make purchases online or you have to drag all three of your little kids into the gas station to pre-pay at the pump. And, depending on the neighborhood you live in, carrying around large amounts of cash might be asking for trouble!<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I recommend instead: <em><strong>only use cash for your spending categories that are out of control.<\/strong><\/em> For many of my clients, this includes eating out, groceries, and entertainment. Sometimes just having those on cash for a few months is enough to rope them back into the land of reasonable spending.<\/p>\n<p>For my clients who are nervous about carrying around large amounts of cash, I propose a non-cash alternative. Open a separate checking accounting with a debit card for your discretionary spending money. This is the route I use myself. I have a certain debit card that\u2019s used strictly for my splurge purchases.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. Cutting Up Your Credit Cards<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, there are some of you who shouldn\u2019t be allowed within 500 feet of plastic. But most people can learn how to use a credit card responsibly even if they\u2019ve misbehaved in the past. When I\u2019m coaching clients with credit card debt, I suggest they temporarily \u201cput them on ice,\u201d and stop charging on plastic. We\u2019ll move most spending to debit or automatic bill pay, and move their few out-of-control categories to cash.<\/p>\n<p>Once my clients have reclaimed their financial dignity, I suggest they keep one credit card with a low limit. They can charge a few items they\u2019re not tempted to overspend on, like gas for their car or their cell phone bill, to keep their credit score in a healthy range. (Your credit score affects your insurance premiums and is frequently checked by potential employers, so it affects more than just your mortgage interest rate.)<\/p>\n<p>Then, there are people like my husband, the engineers and CPAs of the world, who are rarely tempted to spend more than they planned, no matter what payment method they\u2019re using. Like Dave, I am firmly against carrying credit card debt, but I\u2019m not opposed to using credit cards as a payment method.<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Paying Off Your Smallest Debt First<\/h2>\n<p>In many cases, this is a great idea. Having a quick victory gives you a shot of success and spurs you on to attack the rest of your debt.<\/p>\n<p>However, when you have a debt with a massively high interest rate, you might be better off attacking it first, even if it\u2019s number three or four on your list. Your smallest debt might be a medical bill with zero percent interest, but your third or fourth smallest debt might be a store credit card with 22% interest.<\/p>\n<p>Another example of when it pays to deviate from the \u201cpay off the smallest one first\u201d philosophy is when you have a particular debt with \u201cbad mojo.\u201d When I broke off the wedding to my ex-fianc\u00e9 18 years ago, I <i>hated<\/i> making the payment on my Dillard\u2019s account. Why? Because my ex racked up the majority of the charges (including my Valentine\u2019s Day present) when he was an authorized user on the account. I paid that bill in full first and it felt so damn good to have it gone!<\/p>\n<p><em>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: My personal opinion here is to do the route that actually <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/answer-financial-debates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">excites you the most<\/a> &#8211; whether that&#8217;s the smallest balance or largest interest rate or any other variables, such as the ex-fianc\u00e9 one. The last thing you want to do is *burn out* on paying off your debts, so if going one route motives you to the finish line faster even if it&#8217;s not the &#8220;financially smartest&#8221; option &#8211; who cares! Do it anyways!! It doesn&#8217;t matter how you get there, just so long as you do!]<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>#4. Never Buying a New Car Unless You\u2019re a Millionaire<\/h2>\n<p>Far too many people are overpaying for their transportation needs, so I totally understand where Dave Ramsey is coming from regarding car loans and leases. But, I don\u2019t think you need to reach millionaire status to buy a new car, especially if you pay cash for it and intend to drive it for a good long while.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point &#8211; four years ago I purchased my second brand new Hyundai Sonata for cash. The first one I bought back in 2004 for $15,000 when the next year\u2019s model came out, and I kept it for ten years. With 90,000 miles on it, I sold my first Sonata to a couple I knew from church for $5,000. When I walked into the dealership to purchase my next Sonata in 2014, I had $20,000 saved plus the $5,000 from the sale of my previous car. I paid $20,800 with taxes for my dream car, which left $4,200 in my new car fund.<\/p>\n<p>If I keep my current car for 10 years, the average cost of my car ownership over 20 years will be $1,540 per year or $129 per month. You don\u2019t need to be a millionaire to afford that!<\/p>\n<p><em>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m a used car snob myself, but there is something to knowing the full history of cars and having some decent warranties come along with it. I&#8217;ve never bought a new car before, but I&#8217;ve also never paid cash money for one either &#8211; so if you can rock that and it&#8217;s a high priority for you, then more power to you! :)]<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>#5. Putting Your 401(k) Contributions on Hold While You&#8217;re Paying Off Debt<\/h2>\n<p>I have really strong objections to this piece of advice! Unless you are in a dire situation, most people can and should continue to sock money away for retirement, even while they\u2019re paying off debt and building up an emergency fund.<\/p>\n<p>For most of my coaching clients, income isn\u2019t the problem; mindless spending is the culprit. Most Americans are way behind on saving for retirement, so I encourage my clients to take full advantage of their employers\u2019 retirement plan, especially if there\u2019s a match.<\/p>\n<p>If cash flow is super-tight, I might suggest they decrease their 401(k) contribution temporarily, but keep it at or above the level necessary to qualify for the match. That\u2019s free money, so it\u2019s foolish to give that up, even for a little while.<\/p>\n<p><em>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Yes!!! Even if you were to get the 100% FREE MONEY and then cash it out and take all the penalties that come with it, you&#8217;d *still* come out ahead by contributing to your 401(k)! Not that I&#8217;m suggesting you do that, but that&#8217;s how crazy leaving free money on the table is&#8230; I didn&#8217;t know Ramsey was pushing this one, talk about a one-track mind! Haha&#8230;]<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>#6. Pursuing Your Financial Goals With Maximum Intensity<\/h2>\n<p>You can\u2019t sprint indefinitely, but you can keep up a marathoner\u2019s pace for the long haul.<\/p>\n<p>About two or three years after I started teaching Financial Peace University, former students would come to me for financial coaching. They\u2019d say, &#8220;We did great for a year (eighteen months, or two years), but then we just fell off the wagon.&#8221; Sometimes they\u2019d be in even worse shape than before they\u2019d taken the class. What the heck was going on?<\/p>\n<p>Runners know that trying to sprint for long periods of time is reckless and unwise. I prefer to take a more moderate approach with my financial coaching clients. There is room for portion-controlled fun in your spending plan!<\/p>\n<p>I firmly believe that people can move towards their preferred financial future at a brisk pace while still enjoying life on the journey. Unless your income is very low, you probably don\u2019t have to eat beans and rice or only wear clothes from the local thrift store, unless that\u2019s your thing, of course!<\/p>\n<p><em>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: What helps me is thinking about these sprints in terms of &#8220;seasons&#8221;, as my friend Cait Flanders would say. The &#8220;season for debt killing&#8221;, the &#8220;season of hustling&#8221;, or even the &#8220;season for living more and relaxing.&#8221; I&#8217;m grateful for my seasons of hustling before the kids came, and now I&#8217;m grateful for being able to scale back more and watch them grow up. Intensity is great for short periods of time, but I agree with Christine that you can&#8217;t last forever turned up all the way.]<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>In Summary&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Is Dave Ramsey right?<\/p>\n<p>I agree with most of Dave Ramsey\u2019s money management philosophy. I consider him a mentor and he\u2019s definitely taught me a great deal about personal finance.<\/p>\n<p>However, like Jim Rohn suggested, I\u2019m a student of many money gurus (including J. Money!) but I form my own conclusions. And I suggest you do the same!<\/p>\n<p>As for me, I love it when my fans and followers disagree with me. My response is, \u201cGood, you see things differently! Let\u2019s discuss this so I understand your point of view.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s with me on these?
