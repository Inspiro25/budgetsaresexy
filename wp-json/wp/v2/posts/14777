Just within the past 2-3 years too &#8211; it&#8217;s kinda hard to believe.\u00a0 Though I&#8217;m sure if you polled people before the crash they&#8217;d have some pretty sad situations then too.\u00a0 It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s ever *perfect* right? Anyways though, here were my thoughts on it.\u00a0 Or rather &#8211; me comparing myself to it cuz I think it&#8217;s interesting.\u00a0 Feel free to to do the same afterward!<\/p>\n<p><strong>VACATIONS:<\/strong> \u00a0 I don&#8217;t really fall into this category lately, as my traveling is starting to get a bit ridiculous, haha&#8230; though it is, actually, &#8220;work.&#8221;\u00a0 I just happen to think that&#8217;s the same thing as vacation sometimes ;)\u00a0 I do think if I ran the numers though, that I HAVE cut down a lot on my outside vacations and\/or entertainment over the years.\u00a0 Not really an effect from the economy, but rather cuz I got addicted to this so called personal finance bizness.\u00a0 And once you go finance, you never go back! (Bah dum-ching.\u00a0 Would have been better if it rhymed, huh?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>COLLEGE $$:<\/strong> This one REALLY shocks me.\u00a0 That&#8217;s almost HALF the people surveyed!\u00a0 Digging into their retirement to pay bills!!

Back in the day I prob. would have done that cuz I wasn&#8217;t too good on holding on to my money much outside of a $500 or so in my savings account, but jeez.\u00a0 Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, eh? If only we had these epiphanies much earlier on in our lives before the madness hits :(<\/p>\n<p><strong>UNEMPLOYED:<\/strong> Another scary tidbit!\u00a0 Even I was scared when I got laid off, and I WANTED to be out of that place when it was happening!\u00a0 Haha&#8230; it def. does a number on your mind, alright.
