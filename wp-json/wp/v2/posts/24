I&#8217;ve always known I had money saved in different places here and there, but up to 3 months ago I had never put it all together and focused on any type of real &#8220;net worth&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I suggest conjuring one up yourself if you haven&#8217;t already, it&#8217;s quite empowering!<\/p>\n<p>So, now that i&#8217;m done patting myself on the back (you have to right?), here it is &#8211; my <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">official<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\">net worth<\/a> as of the end of January. I&#8217;m sure my format and calculations will change over time, but as it stands today this a great measurement of my overall financial picture. Daddy&#8217;s proud, daddy&#8217;s proud.<\/p>\n<p>Now that I have it organized, I am ready to begin this year&#8217;s net worth goal &#8211; to reach $100,000 by the end of December! I can&#8217;t believe i&#8217;m actually setting something so high (cuz my GOODNESS that&#8217;s a lot of money), but you know what? Sometimes you gotta <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">just do it<\/span> like Nike. I mean I&#8217;m young, nubile, and by golly it&#8217;s time to make something of myself! haha&#8230; W-O-W, talk about some motivation.<\/p>\n<p>Moving along, here&#8217;s what we got:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Cash Savings:<\/u><\/span> I&#8217;m hoping to add an additional $1,530.97 to reach my goal $5,250. Once this is accomplished, I will leave it alone 100% as it will act as my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/06\/emergency-funds-are-not-funbut-theyre\/\">Emergency Fund<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Roth IRA:<\/u><\/span> As of today, I am not planning on adding any more funds to this *unless* I end up with extra money after my cash savings goal. In this case, I would def. add it into my Roth.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>401k:<\/u><\/span> My favorite category of all time :) What&#8217;s not to love about company matches, direct deposits, and tax benefits? If all goes as planned, this will be my 3rd year of maxing out my 401k! I have been more than blessed w\/ generous company matches, so it would be absolutely asinine not to participate.<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> I expect this category to go up at least $2,375 each month, markets willing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If there was just one piece of financial advise I would give anyone, it would be to put in AT LEAST (very important) the same % as your company matches. This means from the start you are D-O-U-B-L-I-N-G your return from day 1. Now, i&#8217;m not a financial pro or CPA by any means, but with the good graces of the stock market, this $ should increase fruitfully until the day comes for retirement. Of course if you could add in more each paycheck, more power to you.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Condo Investment:<\/u><\/span> I am helping my brother out with a personal loan, which will help him with his new condo purchase. I give him $123 a month, and the interest is locked at 5%. Either of us can bail out at any time if needed, and it&#8217;s written in a simple contract just in case (this was forced by my dad, and I&#8217;m thinking rightfully so). Initially I thought of loaning the money interest-free (since it IS a family member), but I wanted him to think of it as a real loan and that it will need to be payed back at a later date. Unfort. i&#8217;m not in the position to say, &#8220;ahh, just forget about it bro&#8221;. Well, not yet anyways :) <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I expect this category to go up $1,353 by year&#8217;s end, and <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">put this into the Assets category as I count it as an investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Home Equity:<\/u><\/span> This is the difference between the price we PAID for our house, and the MORTGAGES left on them. Actually, it&#8217;s 1\/2 of the total equity as I&#8217;m only including my portion, not my fianc\u00e9e&#8217;s yet until we&#8217;re married. I&#8217;m also heavily thinking of taking this out as housing prices are fluctuating like crazy these days. Plus since houses actually sell for what someone&#8217;s willing to pay for it, who knows what the sales price will be by that point.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Auto Worth (kbb)<\/u>:<\/span> This is the value the Kelly Blue Book puts on my car at the time I pull it. Normally I wouldn&#8217;t put this here, but i need to help balance my car loan w\/ something right? <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This category will def. go down each month&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Credit Cards<\/u>:<\/span> For net worth accounting, this includes my personal credit card + 1\/2 of all outstanding store <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/our-store-credit-cards-are-back\">credit cards<\/a>. All cards are either paid off in full each month, or at 0% financing. I am hoping we don&#8217;t add a lot more because of our upcoming wedding!<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> The current plan is to have all cards wiped out to $0.00 by year&#8217;s end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Auto Loan<\/u>:<\/span> My auto loan :) My plan is to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/to-sell-or-not-to-sell\">sell my current car<\/a>, however, and pick up an oldie but goody. This should def. help out the numbers.<\/p>\n<p>So there we have it &#8211; my 2008 Net Worth goal. It suuuure looks sweet, now let&#8217;s see if I can make it a reality!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have to say it feels really good getting all this stuff out there.
