A real-life poll by some of the best real-life people on this Earth &#8211; you guys ;) Who needs scientific polls around here??<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to ask you 2 questions now, and your job is to answer them as REAL and HONESTLY as you can. Even if it means swapping your name with the infamous &#8220;anonymous&#8221; ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here they are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have you ever worn clothes\/accessories\/bags and then returned them?<\/li>\n<li>Do you think it&#8217;s in bad taste to do so?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Remember, be honest ;) And of course it wouldn&#8217;t be fair for me to make you guys do this without doing it myself, so I&#8217;ll start this little game here&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have I ever worn clothes\/etc and then returned them &#8211;&gt; yes.<\/strong> A few times when I was young (see below), but now only when I realized they didn&#8217;t fit right or had holes in them or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/are-you-good-at-returning-things\/\">something else<\/a> that I didn&#8217;t know prior to purchasing them. I don&#8217;t ever buy something with <em>the intention<\/em> of wearing it out and then returning it later. Even though it is fun to think about, as most frugal people will attest to ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do I think it&#8217;s in bad form to do this?<\/strong> Yes. Only one person gets anything out of this (the &#8220;shopper&#8221;), and it only screws over the company. The company, mind you, that you happen to <em>like<\/em> if you&#8217;re wanting to rock out their stuff on the town! Now it&#8217;s not even close to being as bad as actually *stealing* the item from the store, of course &#8211; more like shadily renting? &#8211; but you wouldn&#8217;t want it dug up the next time you run for office anytime soon&#8230; Which I&#8217;m sure you deal with on the regular ;)<\/p>\n<h2>Going down memory lane&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>This reminds me of a time I still feel bad about years ago during my college days. I needed a new stereo cuz my old one had broken and we were set to throw a couple killer parties over the next few months (this was back before the invention of the iPod, mind you), so I headed out to Walmart and picked up the best one I could afford under my budget. Which, looking back, was funny because a) I didn&#8217;t have a budget back then! And b) I paid 50% more than I had wanted &#8211; $75.00 instead of $50.00. I never said I was good at money my ENTIRE life :)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, I found the one that gave us the best chance of <del>picking up girls<\/del> throwing a great dance party, and went on my way expecting everything to work out just fine. And it did, for exactly 88 days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then I completely ran out of money, couldn&#8217;t pick up any extra hours at my TWO side jobs<\/strong> (I was always a hustler, but rarely a saver), and was scared out of my boots to report home and ask the Bank of Mom and Dad to cover me for the rest of the month. So I sat there on my bed racking my brain for a way to come up with $50, and right there across the room from me was that beast of a machine we called my stereo staring back. You now, those chromed-out, 5 cd-changer, big honkin&#8217; pieces of plastic with 18 subwoofers popping out all alien-like type ones? They were never pretty, but they sure did the trick.<\/p>\n<p>An idea then hit me like a lightning bolt. How long ago did I pick up that thing? Is it possible that I could still return it and get my $75 back?? I rushed around like a mad man hunting for my receipt &#8211; flipping beer cups and pushing half-written essays around (we did have computers back then &#8211; I&#8217;m not THAT old &#8211; but some of my teachers preferred we sketched them out first by hand to get the creative juices flowing), and lo and behind I found that magical piece of paper! It had been exactly 88 days since the purchase, with a return-policy of 90 days for all electronics. Whew.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I jumped in my zebra-painted ride (true story), hauled it back to Walmart,<\/strong> blew the dust off and rubbed it down for approximately 15 seconds, and made my way through the customer service line. I felt like the smartest person around!!<\/p>\n<p>Until I got to the manager behind the register&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>I explained as much of the situation as I could without getting myself into trouble<\/strong> (&#8220;I really liked it, but I need the money,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll come back later and buy it again, I promise&#8221;), and the guy just stared back in both disbelief and &#8211; quite frankly &#8211; utter disgust.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Are you kidding me?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(My face turns red)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been USING this for almost 3 whole months now, and you now want to give it back? Because you made a wrong decision?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Well&#8230;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Forget it&#8230; mumble mumble&#8230;.ridiculous college kids&#8230;. mumble mumble&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your gift card &#8211; go nuts.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>I felt like the biggest asshole in the world.<\/strong> Everything he said was true. I DID use it for all those months. I DID make a bad decision. I WAS a ridiculous college student!! What was wrong with me??<\/p>\n<p>As small and insignificant as that event was, it&#8217;s quite obviously stuck with me all these years later. I wasn&#8217;t proud of what I did &#8211; even though I laughed and told all my friends how creative I was at the time (dummy) &#8211; but I definitely learned my lesson. Which, rather simply, was this: &#8220;Don&#8217;t take advantage of policies when it screws people over.&#8221; The &#8220;people&#8221; in this case, being Walmart. There was no way they were going to be able to turn around and sell that thing &#8211; it was clearly worn.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whew&#8230; Guess that story was just bubbling to come out :) <\/strong>An extreme measure of using stuff and then returning it later of course &#8211; and I doubt it would work nowadays with companies being smarter and changing rules all around &#8211; but still. The point is, doing this stuff doesn&#8217;t help anyone except yourself. Do I still buy things and return them? <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/are-you-good-at-returning-things\/\">All the time. <\/a>But I don&#8217;t *go into it* with the plan of coming back later and returning stuff after getting what I needed from it. For what it&#8217;s worth&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But enough about me. <em><strong>What do YOU guys say about this? Have you ever intentionally bought stuff and then returned them?<\/strong><\/em> Please leave your thoughts below either way so we can read the different perspectives out there. I won&#8217;t judge you at all, I promise :) My hands are still dirty!<\/p>\n<p>Happy Friday, y&#8217;all.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Thanks again to <a href=\"http:\/\/skintinthecity.com\/\">Skint in The City<\/a> for awaking my brain today.
