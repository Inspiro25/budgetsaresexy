Direct Roth IRA Contributions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest and most common way to fund a Roth IRA is to transfer money into it directly. It is funded with after-tax dollars and there are annual limits to direct contributions. <\/span><b>For 2021, the limit is $6,000.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This limit applies across both Roth IRAs and Regular IRAs as a *total* each year. (You can contribute to both, as long as the total doesn\u2019t exceed $6k.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why I wish I knew about Roths earlier in life. If I started funding my Roth every year since I started working at age 14, I\u2019d have about ~$500k in tax-free money in that account right now. Even if I never put another dollar in, that would grow to over $2M in tax-free money by the time I\u2019m 60.

Backdoor Roth IRA Conversions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who exceed the income limit for direct Roth contributions, this \u201cbackdoor\u201d method lets you move money into a Roth IRA <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indirectly<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, via a regular IRA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It starts by funding a regular IRA, which has no income limit. The maximum contribution is still $6,000, and you will be making non-deductible contributions (using post-tax money).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the traditional IRA is funded, contact your broker and simply ask to convert the Traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA. For most brokers, this is a pretty easy and quick process. It\u2019s important that you request this Roth transfer ASAP after funding the regular IRA. (Wait maybe 1 business day). The reason you want an immediate transfer is because if the money accrues any interest or growth, that tiny portion becomes taxable and it will also put you over the strict $6k contribution limit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Important things to note about Backdoor Roth Conversions:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an existing traditional IRA in your name with deductible contributions and tax deferred growth, there are different tax consequences because of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IRS pro-rata rule<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The easiest way to avoid weird tax rules is to not have any traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs or SIMPLE IRAs in your name.

MEGA Backdoor Roth IRA Conversions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most complex way to get money into your Roth IRA. But, it\u2019s worth it because of the higher contribution limit. It\u2019s best suited for high income earners who not only max out their regular 401(k) contributions, but also have additional money to save\/invest over and above that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this process to work, your employer must have the correct type of 401(k) plan. The plan must a) allow after-tax contributions (not *Roth* 401k) and b) allow for in-plan distributions or in-plan Roth conversions (many 401(k) plans only let you withdraw money when you terminate employment).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a high level overview of the process:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, contribute the maximum to your regular 401(k) plan. For 2021, the limit is $19,500, or $26,000 if you turn 50 before Dec 31 this year.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, work out how much your employer will match.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then make after-tax contributions up to make up a *total* of $58,000 for all contribution types (or $64,500 for the 50 and older crowd!). For example, if your employer doesn\u2019t do any matching, the after-tax portion max can be $38,500 ($58k minus $19.5k).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, withdraw the after-tax portion into your Roth IRA account. This might be a manual request by calling your 401k provider, or working with your benefits administrator at work.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Important things to note about Mega Backdoor Roth Conversions:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same as the regular Backdoor Roth process, the IRS pro-rata rule <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may apply<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you have an existing IRA\/SEP\/SIMPLE in your name.

But, some employers offer this, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly popular for Solo 401k plan providers to offer them too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Roth 401k is an employee sponsored plan that allows for post-tax contributions. It\u2019s very similar to a regular 401k plan, except you are paying tax on your contributions now, and none in retirement. The max you can contribute to a 401(k) (aggregate limit across regular 401k and Roth 401k) is $19,500 (or $26,000 if you turn 50 before Dec 31 this year). This is ideal for those who think they will be in a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tax bracket later in life vs. now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roth 401(k)\u2019s can be easily rolled over into Roth IRA\u2019s. Since you\u2019ve already paid taxes on the contributions, there are no tax consequences for this rollover if made directly from account \u2192 account. The process is very similar to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/401k-rollover-ira-why\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regular 401k to IRA rollover<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Important things to know about Roth 401k Rollovers to Roth IRAs:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no rush to rollover funds from a Roth 401k to a Roth IRA. Both accounts grow tax free over time. 401k accounts do come with some legal protection built in, but IRAs typically have lower fees and better investment options. That being said, Roth 401(k)s are subject to required minimum distributions. You can bypass them by transferring the money to a Roth IRA that ideally has been open for five years (see below).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you do make a rollover to a Roth IRA, the rolled over funds are subject to the 5 year withdrawal rule, but with a slight twist. The 5 years begins from the date when the Roth IRA account was first established, not when the funds were rolled over. This is great for people who have opened Roth IRA\u2019s earlier in life and have already had them open for more than 5 years. Rollovers are available immediately. On the other hand, if you didn&#8217;t have any Roth IRAs, and then create a Roth IRA in which to roll over a Roth 401(k), you have to follow a new five-year clock &#8212; regardless of how long the Roth 401(k) had been in existence.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are no income limits for contributing to a Rollover 401k.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a cool <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/roth-comparison-chart\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IRS comparison chart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> showing differences between Roth 401k, Roth IRA and regular pre-tax 401k.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>5. Regular 401(k) or IRA Conversion to Roth<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, all the methods we&#8217;ve covered have been moving after-tax dollars between accounts. This last way involves converting <\/span><b>pre-tax<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dollars to your Roth IRA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this conversion, moving money from a regular IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA is a taxable event. You will owe taxes on any amount that you convert. There are no income limits or conversion limits, but keep in mind that if you have a very large IRA or 401k balance and convert the entire amount, your tax burden could be huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process is quite simple. You contact the old 401k or IRA provider and ask them to perform a rollover to your Roth IRA. If both accounts are with the same broker, this is called a trustee \u2192 trustee or direct rollover, and the money is transferred internally. If you are changing brokers, they might mail you a check, and then you\u2019ve got 60 days to move the funds to your Roth IRA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Important things to know about converting 401ks or IRAs to Roth IRA:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you will owe taxes on the converted amount, it\u2019s a good idea to convert in small amounts within low-income years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the money converted is subject to the 5 year rule for withdrawals. In fact, each conversion has its own 5 year clock once the conversion takes place. So make sure you\u2019ve got CASH to pay the taxes owed, because there will be a penalty if you try to deduct it from your converted amount early.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have to convert ALL your IRA or 401k to the Roth IRA at one time. In fact, it can be advantageous to set up a smaller and regular annual conversion schedule &#8211; some people call this the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.choosefi.com\/how-and-why-to-set-up-a-roth-ira-conversion-ladder\/#:~:text=A%20Roth%20IRA%20conversion%20ladder%20entails%20moving%20your%20money%20from,IRA%20after%20only%20five%20years.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roth Conversion Ladder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of conversion is a way to access your pre-tax 401k or IRA funds, penalty free, well before retirement age. It\u2019s awesome for early retirees, as long as you can wait out the 5 year rule.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Which Method to Fund Your Roth IRA Is Right for You?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have no clue! Every person has to figure it out for themselves because there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to Roth contributions. It depends on your age, income, existing investments, employer, and how much effort you want to put in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, it\u2019s worth at least taking a look at your available options, because as each year passes, so do your opportunities to contribute to this wonderful tax free account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a great week!<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Roth IRAs are the sexiest tax-advantaged account IMO, and I wish I\u2019d discovered them earlier in life.
