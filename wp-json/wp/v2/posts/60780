Money, my life would look pretty different.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because I\u2019ve been a regular Budgets are Sexy lurker since around <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/interview-me-on-me_12\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when he started the site<\/a>, all the way back in 2008. At the time, his net worth updates were unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen. After several years of following along, I was inspired enough to start my own blog, where I now publish my own net worth updates every month.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mymoneywizard.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-60782\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/money-wizard-logo.jpg\" alt=\"money wizard logo\" width=\"483\" height=\"116\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/money-wizard-logo.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/money-wizard-logo-300x72.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>So, how does regular reading of Budgets are Sexy since you were a teenager impact your finances?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, in my case, it means a $100,000 net worth by the time you\u2019re 25. And then $300,000 while you\u2019re still in your 20s.<\/p>\n<p>(As of this writing, I\u2019m 29 years old with a net worth of $300,329.24. <a href=\"https:\/\/mymoneywizard.com\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">But who\u2019s counting?<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>When I saw J\u2019s request for readers to divulge the nitty and gritty of their financial history, I thought it\u2019d be great to tip my cap to a role model in the best way I know how \u2013 getting nerdy with money!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Money Wizard\u2019s Balance Sheet:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s the breakdown of my net worth, as of last month\u2019s update:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brokerage Account: $143,597<\/li>\n<li>401k: $119,602<\/li>\n<li>Roth IRA: $35,601<\/li>\n<li>Cash: $5,338<\/li>\n<li>Liabilities: $3,809 between monthly rent and credit cards that I always pay in full.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Which, in the spirit of this series, doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot. We want to know *HOW* I got there. Time to spill the juicy details!<\/p>\n<h2>#1. I started investing as a teenager<\/h2>\n<p>Between the ages of 0-23, I probably invested $15-20,000 from teenage jobs and college side hustles. Nothing glamorous here. Mostly summer construction jobs, although at one point I did run a small baseball\/softball bat flipping hustle. This gave my savings a nice head start and plenty of time to get the compound interest snowball started.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. I gave up on stock trading (and instead went with index investing)<\/h2>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t perfect in my teenage investing though. Like most teenagers\/early 20s, I was young and na\u00efve and thought I could show the world who\u2019s boss.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, I managed to contain those teenage dreams to a few bone-headed stock investments. (I thought for sure my Buffett-like value pick of Uranium stocks after the Fukushima nuclear disaster would make me a millionaire. It didn\u2019t. I lost thousands.)<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, I learned this lesson early. Since then, I decided to move to a pretty simple <a href=\"https:\/\/mymoneywizard.com\/3-fund-portfolio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3 fund portfolio of index funds<\/a>. It\u2019s a decision that\u2019s helped me earn over 7% in the stock market for the past several years, and more importantly, free up my time to do stuff a whole lot more fun than combing through financial statements.<\/p>\n<h2>#3. I avoided student loan debt<\/h2>\n<p>This was a mixture of a couple thousand dollars\u2019 worth of GPA-related scholarships, part-time jobs, generous help from parents, and choosing a (relatively) affordable in-state public school.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. I took a well-paying job out of college<\/h2>\n<p>I was also fortunate to score a lucrative career out of college, although this wasn\u2019t totally by accident.<\/p>\n<p>I double majored in Finance and Economics, specifically because I knew they were some of the highest paying degrees. I\u2019d have loved to major in something like English, but instead I decided to put that passion on the back-burner until I\u2019d saved enough cash to retire early and do whatever I wanted. If I followed the money, I figured that date would come sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>The result? Coming out of school, I scored a $50,000 a year job in finance. And over the past few years, I\u2019ve played the office politics game and worked like a dog, which scored two more meaningful promotions. I landed the first promotion after about 3 years, and it bumped my salary to around $70,000 a year. The second occurred more recently, as I approach my 6-year anniversary, and has me sitting around $90,000 in annual income moving forward.<\/p>\n<h2>#5. I took advantage of my above-average 401k match<\/h2>\n<p>Not quite an INSANE match, like J\u2019s <i>ridiculous<\/i> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-we-grew-our-net-worth-to-over-900k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free $16,500<\/a>. But, solidly above average \u2013 my employer matches 7% of my salary at 100%. In other words, at my current pay, the first $6,300 I contribute is matched with an identical $6,300 contribution from my employer.<\/p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t by accident either! During my second round of interviews, The Money Wizard, as a fresh-faced, not-yet college graduate, grilled the interviewers about the company\u2019s 401k plan. They looked at me like I was a 60-year-old trapped in a 23-year-old\u2019s body, and then relayed the news that ended up being a big factor in my job choice.<\/p>\n<h2>#6. I kept living like a college student for years<\/h2>\n<p>And I sort of still do&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>For the first few years at my career, I spent no more than about $22-24,000 a year.<\/p>\n<p>In part, that\u2019s because I scrutinized every single expense I took on. If it was a monthly or annual subscription, it probably got cancelled, slashed, or at least negotiated. I also rented a modest 1-bedroom apartment away from downtown Denver. The way I saw it, all the Ubers in the world couldn\u2019t match the increased cost of a trendy downtown place.<\/p>\n<p>A few years ago, I moved in with my long-term girlfriend, and we now live in Minneapolis. The house is in her name, although I pay half of the mortgage, utilities, and maintenance every month.\u00a0 Another key fact, and this is definitely key, is that the house cost a whopping $180,000\u2026 a full 1\/3 the price that Mint.com said we could afford.<\/p>\n<p>That said, I do tend to splurge on dining out, entertainment, and travel. (What a typical millennial\u2026)<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, my goal is to spend less than $2,250 a month. If I manage that, I should save over $40,000 between my 401k, employer matching, IRA contributions, and <a href=\"https:\/\/mymoneywizard.com\/vanguard-vs-fidelity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanguard or Fidelity index funds<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>One last thing I\u2019d like to say, before J. Money realizes he accidentally let me on stage. ;)<\/p>\n<p>I recognize my money situation is kind of weird. My inbox is filled with emails from readers at a different stage in this money journey, wondering how on earth a snot-nosed 20-something with $300,000 relates at all to their situation.<\/p>\n<p>But consider this \u2013 with my current rate of savings, I\u2019m on pace to reach complete <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at\/\">financial freedom<\/a> by the time I\u2019m 35. Most likely, my corporate career won\u2019t last a day longer than 12 short years, total. That\u2019s a blip in the timeline of a normal working career, even if you\u2019re starting entirely from zero.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So if you\u2019re older, younger, or even still in debt, I hope my story shows the awesome possibilities for anyone who kicks debt to the curb, lives modestly, and invests heavily.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thanks for having me J.
