Haha\u2026<\/p>\n<p>And WOW do things come up that you\u2019ve suppressed for many a years! I\u2019m only in month #6 or 7 and had to take a break when I was sick, but when I\u2019m there and pouring it out it\u2019s amazing the things you find out about yourself\u2026<\/p>\n<p>For example, I noticed that many of my poems are about wanting to be \u201cgood\u201d all the time but occasionally saying \u201cscrew it\u201d and purposefully doing the opposite, even though it\u2019s against my nature. And then there\u2019s the turning point in my life where I realized you can basically do or wear whatever you want in life and it really doesn&#8217;t matter because there are no &#8220;rules&#8221; &#8211; only perceived standards!

I finally sold my basketball card collection! <\/b>Remember that from an old blog post where I wondered <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-i-learned-from-collecting-basketball-cards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">if it was still worth anything<\/a>? :) Well it is\/was! Not as much as they once were, but def. more than \u201cthe cardboard they\u2019re printed on\u201d that you hear all the time\u2026 At least if your collection is somewhat decent.<\/p>\n<p>Towards the end of my collecting days (1995-1997) I decided it\u2019s probably better to focus on one or two good players vs a smattering of them, so I chose the GOAT at the time &#8211; Michael Jordan &#8211; and traded\/sold away everything else to just bank as many Jordan cards as I could\u2026 Better to have a focused collection than a random one, right?<\/p>\n<p>I eventually ended up with around 200 cards I wanna say, including some extra items like magazines and newspaper clippings and even Wheaties boxes of Jordan to round it out, and then I had a dozen or two other rookies from other sports like Shaqs and Ken Griffey Jrs and even some less valuable older baseball cards from the 1950s I kept around for good measure.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.omgmymoney.com\/sports-cards\/how-to-inventory-appraise-and-sell-your-sports-cards-collection-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65564\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-baseball-basketball-cards.jpg\" alt=\"old baseball basketball cards\" width=\"662\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-baseball-basketball-cards.jpg 700w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-baseball-basketball-cards-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-baseball-basketball-cards-550x307.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can see the pictures of all of them at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omgmymoney.com\/sports-cards\/how-to-inventory-appraise-and-sell-your-sports-cards-collection-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OMG My Money<\/a> if you&#8217;d like, which is another financial blogger who I learned hustles in sports cards and eventually accepted my proposal of taking them off my hands and selling for me!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.omgmymoney.com\/sports-cards\/how-to-inventory-appraise-and-sell-your-sports-cards-collection-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sports Cards Collection How To Inventory, Appraise, and Sell To Make Money<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The plan was for him &#8211; and me &#8211; to blog about the process since cards are similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/jmoney.biz\/coin-help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">liquidating coins that I do for people<\/a>, but life kinda got in the way and he ended up just buying the lot from me so we could wrap it up and then kept some of them and planned to sell the others&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We estimated them at around <strong>$500 retail<\/strong>, and he paid me a flat <strong>$350<\/strong> which we both considered a win. And more importantly, they were now out of my basement and in the hands of others who could appreciate them!! Can&#8217;t ask for a better ending than that!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Some things that didn\u2019t go so well the past couple of years&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><b>#14. Covid. Ugh\u2026<\/b> We weathered the storm fairly well all things considered &#8211; no one got seriously sick! &#8211;\u00a0 but I quickly learned that staying at home for long periods of time did not do any favors to my mental state as an extrovert. I lasted an impressive year and a half staying away from shops and crowds and coffee shops (!!!), but eventually came back to them and now can&#8217;t even imagine doing it all over again?! Which I would if I had to, of course, but what a difference in mood and happiness now that we can venture out again!<\/p>\n<p>And what a great reminder of how <em><strong>resilient<\/strong><\/em> and <em><strong>adaptable<\/strong><\/em> we are as humans too when we need to be. My kids were absolutely FANTASTIC throughout it, barely even complaining or noticing after a while (I complained more than they did!) and made it through a whole school year and then some virtually and still did relatively okay&#8230; They were much happier going back IN school again and seeing their friends, but still &#8211; couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better situation looking back.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and our big yard proved massively helpful too! Despite my (still) <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/homeowners-again-but-struggling\/\">not really wanting our house,<\/a> haha&#8230; (that&#8217;s for those of you who asked if I&#8217;ve come to enjoy home ownership yet &#8211; NOPE!! :))<\/p>\n<p><b>#15. My sickness\u2026<\/b> I won&#8217;t go too into this as I already <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/allow-me-to-re-introduce-myself-my-name-is-j-money-oh-j-to-the-moneyyy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brain dumped on you last week<\/a>, but since it is a part of my ongoing life now I do have to include it and it def. falls into sucky territory&#8230; There&#8217;s absolutely NO CURE for it (Pemphigus Vulgaris) and you literally just have to live with it and do your best to maintain your entire life!<\/p>\n<p>But I *did* finally get on the schedule to start real treatments for it (a set of infusions called Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody medication that cancer patients also use) so that&#8217;s made me feel more at peace after waiting a month or so for insurance to approve it&#8230; It costs in the tens of thousands of dollars too, so thank GOD for insurance!! I&#8217;ll have to repeat this process every 1-4 years for the rest of my life &#x1f643;<\/p>\n<p><b>#16. Lastly, we lost some beloved family members and friends over the past couple of years as I&#8217;m sure y&#8217;all did too&#8230;<\/b> My beautiful mother-in-law was a biggie who fought the good fight right to the end, and then recently some wonderful coin club members ended up passing which unfortunately is becoming more of the norm lately as it&#8217;s not a club for the young :(<\/p>\n<p>Always so weird talking to someone one day about coins or something normal, and then literally the next day they&#8217;re gone as if it were all a mirage&#8230; Really reminds you how fragile life is no matter how much we don&#8217;t want to accept it!!
