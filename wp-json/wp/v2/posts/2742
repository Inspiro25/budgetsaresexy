Who DOESN&#8217;T want to know who&#8217;s influencing us these days? Is it Mel Gibson? &#8220;The Situation&#8221;? Tell us!!! ;)<\/p>\n<p>And that I will&#8230;after a few more sentences. You see, at first you thought this was going to be a negative list, right? Like, a &#8220;Justin Bieber bought these $300 pair of jeans and now I need them too!&#8221; kinda list, right?\u00a0 Well nope! It&#8217;s a handful of people that Andrew Benett&#8217;s company, Arnold Worldwide, says is positively influencing society (Andrew being the author of this new book).\u00a0 Which is pretty cool if you ask me &#8211; I&#8217;m tired of 24\/7 negativity.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <em><strong>Mr. Benett&#8217;s<\/strong><\/em> take on the state of our consumption-ness:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For the last two decades, Americans believed bigger was better &#8211; from the size of our houses to our cars to the amount of food on our dinner plates. But the economic recession, coupled with other factors like the green movement, is fundamentally changing American attitudes. Instead of super-sizing, we&#8217;re &#8216;right-sizing&#8217; and re-evaluating what&#8217;s important in life. We&#8217;re saving more, wasting less, and giving back.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This list below showcases the celebrities who are embracing these qualities of the &#8220;mindful consumer.&#8221;\u00a0 Some are obvious, and others are not ;) Copied and pasted:<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #006699;\">Top 10 people who (positively) Influence what Americans buy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>10) Ludacris<\/strong> &#8211; Rappers are not always known for their humility, generosity and environmentally conscious attitudes; Ludacris isn\u2019t your average rapper. Through The Ludacris Foundation, he has donated $1.5 million to support youth-oriented, grassroots organizations and devoted more than 5,000 hours of service, all while paying special attention to his hometown of Atlanta. Did we mention that Ludacris owns a hybrid and is installing solar panels on his home?<\/p>\n<p><strong>9) Suze Orman<\/strong> &#8211; While the financial market collapsed, Orman\u2019s stock rose as she convinced people what NOT to buy during the economic recession. She is viewed as a trusted financial expert, helping Americans become fiscally responsible through her television show, eight consecutive <em>New York Times<\/em> bestsellers, and frequent guest spots on a range of programs from <em>Oprah<\/em> to <em>The Biggest Loser.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>8) Indra K. Nooyi<\/strong> &#8211; As the CEO of PepsiCo, Nooyi wants those of us who indulge in sugary beverages to feel a little better about it. She\u2019s championing \u201cperformance with a purpose\u201d within the organization, which is focused on creating more wholesome products and increasing sustainability practices. As part of this effort, the company has launched The Pepsi Refresh Project. The socially driven campaign allows individuals and organizations to post their philanthropic ideas on <a href=\"http:\/\/refresheverything.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">refresheverything.com<\/a>, where the general public votes for their favorite initiatives to be funded. To help support the project, which will give away more than $20 million this year, the company passed on airing a Super Bowl ad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7) Ellen DeGeneres<\/strong> &#8211; Comedienne, actress, author, CoverGirl spokesmodel, <em>American Idol<\/em> judge, talk-show host, and wife. . . Ellen DeGeneres does it all. Using her large media presence, she exposes audience members to different charities including Feeding America and the American Red Cross. DeGeneres conceals her wealth with ordinary clothes and a gracious attitude, influencing a legion of supporters through her television shows and brand sponsorships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6) Taylor Swift<\/strong> &#8211; Unlike her flashy counterparts, such as Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga, there\u2019s something genuine and down-to-earth about Swift that makes her stand out among the tween, teenage and young adult set. With her poised demeanor, saccharine pop-country crossover songs, humanitarian efforts for numerous charities, and penchant for affordable clothing\u2014including her line of Walmart-sold sundresses that start at $14\u2014this young superstar personifies the mindset of a new generation who want to feel good, look good and do good with (age-appropriate) style.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5) Warren Buffett<\/strong> &#8211; The world\u2019s third-wealthiest person, Buffet is famously known for both his <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/04\/warren-buffett-manor-possibly-100-of.html\">mindful spending and philanthropy<\/a>. America\u2019s foremost investor still owns the modest home bought in 1958, receives a salary of approximately $100,000 and rarely makes extravagant purchases. Most recently, Buffet auctioned off a lunch with himself that sold for $2.63 million, which will support Glide Foundation, a homeless organization based in San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Oprah Winfrey<\/strong> &#8211; As proven time and again, the mere mention of a product by Oprah will make it a bestseller. Her personal integrity, philanthropic efforts and ability to connect with the masses will help her stay one of America\u2019s favorite trendsetters long after her talk show ends in 2011. Up next: Oprah will start the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), further exploring issues surrounding empowerment, spirit, human relationships and giving back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Stephen F. Quinn<\/strong> &#8211; More than three-quarters of Americans shop at Walmart every year, so whether you\u2019re a fan or not, the retailer <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/03\/wow-wal-mart-is-almost-as-big-as-my\">has influence<\/a> <em>(I dare you to click that)<\/em>. As Walmart\u2019s CMO, Quinn\u2019s leadership on sustainability efforts has a huge impact. He helped initiate strict environmental standards including high efficiency store designs, reusable bags, recycling programs and the installation of solar panels. In addition, Walmart is helping shoppers go green by introducing more energy-efficient products; locally grown produce; and the Sustainability Index, an initiative that, in the company\u2019s own words, is \u201chelping to create a more transparent supply chain, driving product innovation and ultimately providing our customers with information they need to assess products\u2019 sustainability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Mark Zuckerberg<\/strong> &#8211; Zuckerberg makes the list not because <em>he<\/em> is particularly mindful, but because the platform he created is making savvier shoppers out of all of us. With more than 400 million active users worldwide, Facebook has become an interactive consumer haven. With the simple update of a status feed, users can get product recommendations from the most trusted source: friends and family. Plus, the platform provides a voice to grassroots organizations that want to galvanize people around the world quickly and efficiently. Brands like Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Disney are realizing the platform\u2019s potential by generating huge fan followings, making it a marketer\u2019s paradise. And with Zuckerberg\u2019s influence over Internet privacy policies, he is literally changing the way we shop.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Michelle Obama<\/strong> &#8211; With the grace of Jackie and the aspirations of Eleanor, Michelle has captivated Americans. When the First Lady donned J.Crew fashions at public appearances such as <em>The Jay Leno Show,<\/em> it spiked the retailer\u2019s clothing sales, website traffic and brand awareness. However, it is Obama\u2019s efforts to end childhood obesity with initiatives like &#8220;Let\u2019s Move&#8221; and the White House vegetable garden that are inspiring a nation. She is influencing (and, in some cases, incentivizing) politicians, business leaders, nonprofits, parents and the rest of us to think about what we consume.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\nFor more info on this book: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/023010178X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=023010178X\">Consumed: Rethinking Business in the Era of Mindful Spending<\/a><br \/>\nFor more info on Arnold Worldwide: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arnoldworldwide.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">ArnoldWorldwide.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/shlomif\/\">shlomif<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saw this press release come through for a new book coming out &#8211; &#8220;Consumed: Rethinking Business in the Era of Mindful Spending&#8221; and couldn&#8217;t help&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-celebrities-who-influence-what-we-buy\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[166,21,14],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2742","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-get-motivated","category-resources","category-shopping"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>10 Celebrities Who Influence What We Buy | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-celebrities-who-influence-what-we-buy\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"10 Celebrities Who Influence What We Buy | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Saw this press release come through for a new book coming out &#8211; &#8220;Consumed: Rethinking Business in the Era of Mindful Spending&#8221; and couldn&#8217;t help...
