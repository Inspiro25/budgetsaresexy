Today\u2019s post is from a longtime Budgets reader, Shane H, who has implemented a weekly allowance for his kids and is teaching them how to budget, save, and give to charity!]<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">****<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money is a powerful tool.\u00a0 In fact, you could argue that money is the most powerful tool in the world if you know how to use it correctly. As adults we read <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/blogroll\/\">finance blogs<\/a> and books to increase our knowledge, but what about our children?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you teach kids about money? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is the journey that my wife and I currently find ourselves on. Drawing heavily from the ideas laid out in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/First-National-Bank-Dad-Foolproof\/dp\/1416534253\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The First National Bank of Dad<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we have put together a system to begin the process of teaching our 5 and 6 year olds about personal finance at a young age.\u00a0 It all starts with the allowance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why give kids an allowance?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know, I know.\u00a0 Allowances can be divisive in the FI community.\u00a0 However, we have chosen to give our children weekly pocket money for one simple reason: It is the easiest way I can think of to begin giving them real interaction with money.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Is the money linked to chores?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My kids\u2019 allowance is not linked to doing chores at home.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t do chores in our household (they do).\u00a0 It simply means that they aren\u2019t paid to do chores around the house.\u00a0 They do chores around the house because they are a <\/span><b>part of our family and everyone is expected to chip in<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and help out around the house.\u00a0 They also receive an allowance, given for the purpose of beginning to teach them how to think about and use money.\u00a0 Those 2 things (chores and allowance) are not linked.\u00a0 This will also keep them from deciding when they are older that they don\u2019t think what they are being paid is worth it and refusing to do chores.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How much allowance to give?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was one of the trickiest questions about the whole process of teaching kids.\u00a0 How much money is the appropriate amount to give to a child?\u00a0 If you give them too much, you don\u2019t teach them that money is a scarce resource.\u00a0 But give them too little, and they will be frustrated because they can never afford to buy anything.\u00a0 They should get enough that they can save up to purchase something that they would want in a reasonable amount of time.\u00a0 Delayed gratification is good, but not too delayed!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we have settled on is 1 quarter per week for each year of age, and since they are so close in age we just pay them both at the rate of the younger child .<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>So, how does this work exactly?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We give our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/whatcha-know-about-kids-allowances\/\">kids their allowance<\/a> once a week.\u00a0 Monthly seemed to be too long to make them wait for it at their age, and doing it every week allows us to have small conversations about money management more frequently.\u00a0 We have chosen to do the allowance every Sunday morning for two reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every Sunday morning I cook a special breakfast (egg in a hole), so it was easy to stack the money habit of an allowance on top of an already existing habit of a special breakfast.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An important component of handling money in our family is generosity, so getting their weekly allowance right before we go to church gives them an easy pathway to be generous with it.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The kids have three different things that they can do with their money once it is given to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put at least 1 quarter in their church bag to give to the church.\u00a0 This is the only thing that I tell them they have to do.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put quarters into the spending piggy bank<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put quarters into their savings piggy bank<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How they divide their money between their spending\u00a0 and savings accounts is up to them.\u00a0 Money they put into their savings piggy bank (an M&amp;M minis container that holds quarters in a perfect stack) is earmarked for a special savings goal that they select.\u00a0 Once they pick a goal, they are told which line on the piggy bank they have to save up to before they can reap the reward.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>A few example savings goals they have chosen so far:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dinner at Sonic &#8211; $5<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going to the movies &#8211; $20<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoo trip &#8211; $20<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mini-golf &#8211; $20<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting nails done &#8211; $10<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To encourage saving, <strong>every quarter the kids put into their savings piggy bank is matched by a quarter from me.<\/strong>\u00a0 This is to help <strong>reinforce the idea that saved money is worth more than spent money.<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might have guessed that going to the movies costs more than $20 for a family, and you would be right.\u00a0 And that is fine.\u00a0 What is important is that they are saving money for a tangible reward.\u00a0 Once they reach any financial goals, we try to celebrate that same week if possible.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know this part yet, but the rewards are paid out of our pockets while the money they saved is deposited into a bank account in their name for later in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, any money that they choose to put into the spending bank is theirs to spend on whatever they would like.\u00a0 This bank stays in their room so they know that they have full ownership of it.\u00a0 Thus far I haven\u2019t had to step in and overrule any of their purchases, but I do reserve the right to do so in certain rare situations.\u00a0 But for the most part, this money is theirs to spend as they please.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>An allowance opens the door to teach kids about money<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handling money this way has opened the door to lots of conversations about money with my children.\u00a0 It turns requests to buy candy at the grocery store into a money lesson about how many quarters it costs.\u00a0 It turns that dollar store toy that they just had to have, purchased with their own money, and broke before they got home experience into a valuable lesson about saving a little longer to buy quality things.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they get older, the system will go through changes as they begin to learn about investing, debt, compound interest and other elements of financial responsibility.\u00a0 But for now this approach has begun to teach them about work ethic, saving, spending, and generosity, and that is good enough for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shane is married and has three young children.
