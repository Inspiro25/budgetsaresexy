I\u2019m a big fitness guy and I\u2019ve been obsessing over these new smart watches that track just about everything I could wish for (they won\u2019t track any of my budgets though ;).)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been really into one in particular: the Garmin Fenix 3 HR. Unfortunately it runs at about $350 currently and I can\u2019t justify spending that much on a little screen that wraps around my wrist (even when I find sales going on for nearly $75 off that price.)<\/p>\n<p>So to find out if I truly wanted this watch, I made a deal to Tip myself <em><strong>$1 every day for a year<\/strong><\/em> starting back in January. If I still want that watch come Christmas time, then I\u2019ve proved to myself that it was not a passing want for a slick overpriced watch as well as spaved up enough to buy the watch outright!<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s $1 a day going to hurt, right?!&#8221; &#8211; Chris L.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The $20+\/Week Trick!<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I upped my weekly contribution to my FFF Account &#8211; Financial Freedom Fund. At the beginning of the year, you challenged readers to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-i-want-for-my-birthday\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">put aside $20 per month<\/a>. Well, I went one better, and made it weekly. Then upped it to $21, now it\u2019s up to $25. My theory is, save until it hurts. Not hurting too bad yet&#8230; Thanks for making my FI journey a little shorter and a little more interesting!&#8221; &#8211; Karin<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Secret Stash<\/strong><\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I put $20 folded neatly and stashed in my &#8220;secret&#8221; wallet compartment.\u00a0\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 because I promised myself I would &#8220;start paying me first.&#8221;\u00a0 I&#8217;m a single grandma raising my 7-year-old granddaughter (born to my daughter while she was still in high school) as my own and soooo I had been paying for everything else and thought I would start paying myself $20 with each check (I&#8217;m self-employed so never really know how much those checks will be, so this is a start).&#8221; &#8211; Lisa D.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Money Jar<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just sold an old canoe for $200 and put the money in my &#8220;money jar&#8221;.\u00a0 This money jar is just for me, when I want to do something out of our budget.\u00a0 Like when the kids come home from college and we want to take them out to eat and a movie, etc.\u00a0 Basically, it is money that I have no guilt in spending, because it doesn&#8217;t count towards our budget.&#8221; &#8211; Becky<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Smoker Fund<\/strong><\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I\u2019ve recently found this process to be very effective in reaching my goals of quitting smoking. I put away $4 each day into a glass jar while I was quitting as that was how much I was spending each day (on average) on my smoking habit.<\/p>\n<p>It was so rewarding hearing the \u2018clink\u2019 of my two $2 dollar coins splashing into the bottom of the jar at the end of every day. At the end of my first month, I put it toward a bottle of scotch I&#8217;d been drooling, I mean, dreaming about (Glen Fiddich 15yr old). I\u2019ve kept up the practice for the past 3 months but moved to a digital savings each day and have a new pair of golf clubs I\u2019m now saving for.<\/p>\n<p>Highly effective practice, feeling like I\u2019m putting wasted money toward goals and things I really truly value.&#8221; &#8211; James W.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The $5.00 Bill Trick<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whenever I get a $5 bill I put it aside and it becomes part of my vacation fund. It\u2019s amazing how fast a $5 bill here and a $5 bill there can add up. I\u2019ve saved hundreds of dollars each year doing this trick. Great way to stash away some vacation money without feeling like you are taking a hit out of savings. Of course it\u2019s rough when you pay for something under $5 with a $20 and get three $5 bills back in change \u2013 nice for the vacation fund but makes the weekly spending budget a bit tighter!
