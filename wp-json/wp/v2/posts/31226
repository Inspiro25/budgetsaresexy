Maybe someone else is in this current situation? Or needs some re-motivating again? (Pretty clever title for today&#8217;s post btw, eh? ;))<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s our emails copied and pasted below&#8230; I don&#8217;t know why I want to call him Elmo, haha.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From <em>Elmo<\/em>:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a year out of college and have a cool job I&#8217;m happy with. I had a much less cool job which I was much less happy doing, although the financial benefits were much better. I got 7 months into that job, said screw this, and got an awesome job I love instead of the financially rewarding corporate ladder climber I had before.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is at my last job they set up a 401k, matched up to 6%, and all that fun stuff. I never saw a match but I did put a small chunk (maybe 3%?) into it.<\/p>\n<p>My new job doesn&#8217;t do any kind of retirement stuff. I have my past job 401k still in the past companies 401k account. They said I could leave it there or move it. I was lazy (rather more not sure) of what to do so I left it there and about a grand sits there.<\/p>\n<p>My main problems now are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>My retirement is in a random 401k and I feel like I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing there<\/li>\n<li>I am not saving now because the job I have now didn&#8217;t make itreally easy<\/li>\n<li>I want to be saving!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Your blog is awesome, easy to read, and fun. Thanks for being a good blogger. Can you help!?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hey Elmo, congrats on the sweet move!\u00a0 It&#8217;s always tough moving over to a place w\/ less money but MAN I bet you feel a ton better yeah?\u00a0 I&#8217;d have done the same thing in your shoes, so well done :)\u00a0 And thanks for reading my blog too!<\/p>\n<p>To answer your questions:<\/p>\n<p><b>1) My retirement is in a random 401k and I feel like I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing there<\/b> &#8212; That&#8217;s cuz you don&#8217;t! Haha&#8230; I would spend the time moving it over to an account fully owned by YOU and then stay on top of it from this point going forward. I&#8217;m not an expert in this area, but most people recommend moving it to a Traditional IRA where you can then invest the $1,000 into whatever stuff you want: stocks, mutual funds, cds, etc. That&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-401k-ira-test\/\">what I did<\/a> when I went to self-employment, and I&#8217;d just call up your financial institution (or Google for a good one that fits your style) and then just have them walk you through the process of getting it all over.\u00a0 It&#8217;s super easy to do, just really annoying. Luckily you only have to move it once though :)\u00a0 And then for the future you&#8217;ll always have 1 main account for additional 401k xfers or more retirement funds, etc etc.\u00a0 It&#8217;s all YOURS to do as you wish.<\/p>\n<p><b>2) I am not saving now because the job I have now didn&#8217;t make it really easy<\/b> &#8212; I would set up either <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/08\/automation-and-forgetting-to-brush-my\/\">automatic xfers<\/a> from your paycheck (if HR has that where you are now), OR set up auto xfers from your banking account a few days after your paycheck hits. If you&#8217;re one that likes everything being done for you so you don&#8217;t have to think or worry about it anymore, that&#8217;s your best best. You could always xfer the money into a retirement account (like that traditional IRA or even beter, a separate ROTH IRA), which will then make it harder for you to touch too since you know you&#8217;ll then get dinged\/etc since it&#8217;s for retirement :)\u00a0 I have to trick myself sometimes like that too&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><b>3) I want to be saving! &#8212; <\/b>Then start! :)\u00a0 Do those auto. xfers I just mentioned, or pull money out every time you get your paycheck yourself and put it somewhere safe that you won&#8217;t touch.\u00a0 Or think about picking up a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">side hustle<\/a> and earning some extra money at nights or weekends, and then put 100% of THAT away and to considered savings.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of stuff you can do once you know what you WANT, so now the tricky part is acting on it :) But better to think about all this stuff NOW than later when you&#8217;re old and wrinkly!\u00a0 And the fact you&#8217;re only 1 year out of college is even better &#8211; you&#8217;ve got plenty of time to let all these savings work for you over your lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>=========================================================<br \/>\nROUND TWO:<br \/>\n=========================================================<\/p>\n<p><strong>Elmo hollers back:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Just wanted to check in with you again and let you know that your advice has helped me continue to move along in my financial journey.<\/p>\n<p>Since I last emailed you I&#8217;ve rolled my old mega-corporation\u00a0401(k) into a traditional IRA that I now control (per your advice). I kicked my current\u00a0employer in the shin and found out they match up to 3%! I just need to get the paperwork lined up and I&#8217;m making free money, something I know you love.<\/p>\n<p>Oh and I got engaged &#8211; super awesome but it adds a crazy amount of financial stuff into the picture. I&#8217;m addicted to planning and budgeting though, so that only makes it more interesting :).<\/p>\n<p>My main question right now I&#8217;m actually stumped on is how the *heck* I pick the right stocks\/mutual funds\/etc for the $ that is just sitting in the IRA?? What I would like to do now, being that the account is small, is set up this account as my <i>conservative<\/i>\u00a0account which will just play it safe. I will make other accounts later that will be more fun but for now I want to set up a nice little nest egg for when I&#8217;m old and wrinkly and hitting golf courses up and down the east coast ;).<\/p>\n<p><em><b>How do you go about picking mutual funds?<\/b><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Congrats on your engagement &#8211; soak it all in bud! It goes by super fast and then you have a most wonderful day of your life and then it&#8217;s all over, haha&#8230; not the fun or love or anything &#8211; that continues! &#8211; but just the excitement of the wedding and all that :) It&#8217;ll suck planning and your fiance will probably worry her sweet little tush off, but just make sure to keep reminding her to pause and breathe it all in too. It&#8217;s a fun time in your guys&#8217; lives!<\/p>\n<p><strong>RE: Stocks\/funds\/etc &#8211;<\/strong> First off, congrats on now having full control AND working on that free 401(k) match &#8211; that&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve heard all night :)\u00a0 As far as what I pick myself, I&#8217;ve never been too good at it I&#8217;m afraid. I do have my &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/11\/companies-i-love-stock-investment-strategy-update\/\">fun fund<\/a>&#8216; as you know, but really for the bulk of my investments I always just call up the institution it&#8217;s at (in my case, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa\">USAA<\/a>) and tell them what I&#8217;m going for and ask what they suggest.<\/p>\n<p>For people young in their 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s the &#8220;pros&#8221; usually recommend a more aggressive fund (or funds) because we have 20, 30, 40 years to take advantage of all the growth, as well as recoup from any crazy losses. And even the &#8220;aggressive&#8221; funds aren&#8217;t hardcore like one or two tech stocks or anything. These mutual funds are still 50-100+ filled with stocks, and then a chunk for cash too &#8211; so I wouldn&#8217;t get too scared, unless you&#8217;re SUPER conservative and that&#8217;s fine too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In that case just ask what they recommend then for your situation and they&#8217;d happily advise there.<\/strong> The only thing I know that people like a lot is to invest in &#8220;index funds&#8221; which basically follow the stock market. When it goes up, your funds go up. When it goes down, yours goes down\/etc. But it follows it and the theory is over time it&#8217;s always more beneficial&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m no expert in that area so I&#8217;d def. search around more&#8230;I&#8217;ve heard <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fool.com\/\">The Fool<\/a> is a good place to check out, as well as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bogleheads.org\/forum\/index.php\">Boglehead community<\/a>, but outside of them I haven&#8217;t heard of killer sites on stocks and funds&#8230; I feel like if someone was brilliant at it they&#8217;d be billionaires by now! ;)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Maybe someone else here knows of a great investing site\/blog that they enjoy?<\/strong> Or any other advice\/thoughts for Elmo and others in similar situations? <\/em>All I know is that saving and investing *something* on a consistent basis is key for long term success&#8230; it&#8217;s just a matter of figuring out how to do so without wanting to punch yourself in the face ;)<\/p>\n<p>Happy Wednesday!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>[Clever photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/86530412@N02\/\">StockMonkeys.com<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had a great convo back and forth with a reader of this site on saving and investing &#8211; we&#8217;ll call him Elmo &#8211; and&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/questions-saving-investing-iras\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[74,147,12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-31226","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-advice","category-investing","category-saving"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Chats on Saving and Investing... | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/questions-saving-investing-iras\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Chats on Saving and Investing... | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I had a great convo back and forth with a reader of this site on saving and investing &#8211; we&#8217;ll call him Elmo &#8211; and...
