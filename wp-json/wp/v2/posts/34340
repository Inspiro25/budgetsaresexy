With a much less exciting story, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Like Jacob, I, too, did not know or care about budgeting back in the college days.<\/strong> I was constantly watching my accounts to make sure I had enough for beer and pizza money every week (priorities!) and rarely had over $500 in it. The rule with my parents was that they&#8217;d help <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-pay-for-college-without-loans\/\">pay for college<\/a> and books, but I was on my own for everything &#8220;extra&#8221; &#8211; a fair deal to say the least.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;d work my ass off during the summers to fill up my spending account, and then drain it entirely by the time the semesters ended :) Floating by with some <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/all-30-jobs-ive-ever-done\/\">part-time jobs<\/a> I&#8217;d take in school too &#8211; like working at the bookstore to <del>pick up girls<\/del> help people find books, helping out at the local mall, and working for our university paper (I was a budding photographer for a bit).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anywho, at graduation I got all kinds of gifts and checks as one usually does from their loving family,<\/strong> and I was dead set on moving into my own place by my own beach with my own very best friend. We had found a room in a house for only $500\/mo (we were going to put in bunk beds, haha&#8230;) and I figured my lump of graduation winnings would tide me over for quite some time while I &#8220;did the responsible thing&#8221; and look for a full-time job ;)<\/p>\n<p>This lump sum was $1,000.<\/p>\n<p>Right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, being the non-future-planner I was back then,<\/strong> I signed the lease, packed up my stuff, and drove Eastward towards the salty waters of my new dream locale. It was summer time, I had cash in my pocket, a new degree, and I&#8217;d soon be sitting at my cushy job designing logos with a view of the ocean in my office. &#8216;Cuz I was *that* good to get my own office for my first job, haha&#8230; Life was good!<\/p>\n<p>Until it wasn&#8217;t&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward 3 weeks and I was out of cash (who knew you had to pay for rent in advance?), out of roommates (my friend bailed the week before moving in), and I had a grand total of 0 jobs lined up. It was pretty embarrassing to say the least &#8211; especially after I mouthed off about how awesome and famous I was gonna be living my dream a the beach ;) Oops.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Days later I was back and moved in with parents where I got the &#8220;real world&#8221; talk.<\/strong> I&#8217;m pretty certain they knew what the outcome was going to be &#8211; and probably had my bed at home all made up just waiting for my return &#8211; but being the loving and brilliant parents they are, they allowed me to go out and fail on my own so I&#8217;d come away with some life learning lessons. And there <em>was<\/em> a small chance of me succeeding too since I do get lucky every now and then&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, I went from $1,000 in cash to broke in a matter of weeks and learned an important lesson along the way: <em>You have to plan ahead, no matter how much it bores you.<\/em> Maybe not 12 months, or 12 years, but definitely at least 3 weeks :) At least when it comes to your finances.<\/p>\n<p>Now Jacob learned an entire other set of lessons along his adventure &#8211; and has the humor to realize how much of a bonehead he was (which I hope <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iheartbudgets.net\/2012\/06\/how-i-blew-through-100000-before-i-turned-21\/\">you&#8217;ll read about and enjoy<\/a> when you get a sec), but I think it&#8217;s important to look back at these times of ours every now and then and appreciate how far we&#8217;ve come. We&#8217;ve all done some pretty stupid things in our lifetimes &#8211; especially while young!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m proud to say that just one year later I got my act back together too :)<\/strong> I set out on job\/life excursion #2 to New York City with just a few suitcases and some cash (double what I brought to the beach), and lasted a whole 2 and a half years all by myself with a new set of friends and adventures. And more parties and trips around the world than I knew what to do with! (It turns out <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/wanna-know-the-cheapest-way-to-travel-the-world\/\">working for the airlines<\/a> has some advantages :))<\/p>\n<p>We live and we learn, right?<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What are some of the ways YOU blew through some money back in the day?
