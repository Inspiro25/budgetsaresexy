Well, Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy just had one such situation, and I believe she made the right decision even though it pained her to do so ;)<\/p>\n<p>The situation: We were out shopping at TJ Maxx for some birthday gifts yesterday, and right before she went to check out I found an AWESOME hoodie that at the last minute asked if she could throw in her cart and buy for me (she was in line, but I wasn&#8217;t). She gladly accepted it, and then mentioned it could be a future Christmas gift to me to look forward to later :) Which is great &#8216;cuz I ALWAYS forget when we do stuff like that, and then get re-excited again when I go to open it later! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So she plops it in her cart, moves right on up to the check-out, and 3 minutes later we&#8217;re out the door and putting everything into the car we\u00a0 just picked up. And that&#8217;s where the dilemma pops up:<\/p>\n<p><strong>The cashier forgot to ring her up for the $20 hoodie!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Which meant either: A) Woohoo! Their loss = our gain! or B) Dammit &#8211; Now I have to go all the way back there, wait in line, and then pay for the stupid thing and rush right back before the baby starts crying again! They just caused us more headache :(<\/p>\n<p>Now, I already told you what she ended up doing in the end (she went back and then paid for it), but for a few seconds there we had a nice little debate :) It wasn&#8217;t so much whether or not it was the right thing to do or not &#8211; we both agreed it <em>was<\/em> &#8211; but we were trying to figure out if it was WORTH even going through the trouble or not? Which is when I then found out Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy had her own little rule in cases like these. Maybe you guys do too?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what she tries to do:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re still in the parking lot, I&#8217;ll go back and pay for the thing no matter what the cost &#8211; even if it&#8217;s only a dollar. If we&#8217;re already in the car though, or I don&#8217;t notice it until we&#8217;re already home, then it has to be at least $30 in that case for me to go back and mess with it.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Haha&#8230; So pretty much a <em>mostly<\/em> Good Samaritan ;) And honestly, as much as I wish I could say I&#8217;d be better myself, I also fall along pretty similar to those guidelines there. Only maybe I&#8217;d drive back if the item was $10 or $20 instead of $30, not that the money should matter all the way anyways &#8211; technically it would still be stealing, right? Or does that fall into that gray area since there was no intent involved? (Any lawyers out there? :))<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another thought that usually crosses our minds? &#8211;&gt; <\/strong>&#8220;Could the cashier get fired for this?&#8221; Yeah it sucks for a company to lose product and all that stuff, but on a more direct and personal level would be the fate of that cashier that just slipped up. If we all knew they&#8217;d get let go or reprimanded in\u00a0 severe way, that alone would probably change our actions too, eh? Though I guess in this specific case there&#8217;s no way to even tie it back to them anyways since it never got documented through *anyone&#8217;s* hands, but still&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, I thought it would make for a good blog post today and promptly told the Mrs. so too after she had made her decision ;) I said it was a good thing she went back and paid that money or else all my blog readers would know she didn&#8217;t! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Speaking of which&#8230; How would you have handled the situation here?<\/strong><\/em> Anyone deal with this recently too? Do you have your own set of rules yourself? I know it&#8217;s always easier to do the &#8220;right thing&#8221; when you&#8217;re not smack dab in the middle of things, but do your best to put yourself in the situation here and let us know what you <em>think<\/em> you&#8217;d do. Maybe it&#8217;ll help you decide quicker if it ever happens to you in the future? I know I always need the extra reminders! ;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Here&#8217;s another similar post we did a while back too if you like this kinda stuff: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/01\/20-discount-that-shouldnt-have-been\/\">The $20 Discount that Shouldn\u2019t Have Been<\/a>.
