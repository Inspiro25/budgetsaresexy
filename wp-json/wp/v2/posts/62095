How would I want to split it up? Here is how I think I would split it this month. I think it&#8217;s an interesting exercise to see what my current priorities are.<\/p>\n<p>If I received $1,000 what would I do with it?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think if $1,000 dropped in my lap I would want to save at least $500 immediately. I think that would all go into my Roth IRA so I can easily forget about it.<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $500? I think I would want to put some towards ski\/snowboard season. So lets say $150 goes towards that (gear, gas etc)<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $350? I would want to take my girl out somewhere nice so lets say that\u2019s $75.<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $275? Some towards knowledge, lets say a low $30 because books are cheap.<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $245? Let\u2019s say $45 towards <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chain_mail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chain mail<\/a> stuff (I started creating chain mail after visiting a ren fest for the first time)<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $200? New socks, let\u2019s say $20 (I really like socks and I like to wear crazy socks during my sporting events)<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $180? Gifts, lets call it $50 (gifts for no one in particular, but probably just family and friends. Maybe something for GF&#8217;s cats)<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $130? Here\u2019s where charity can come in. I\u2019ll call it $100<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining $30? Goofy juice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m going to continue to do this exercise every time I do my net worth calculations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Matthew<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A few things about this:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Always fun to play with imaginary money!<\/strong> Helps bring out our inhibitions more, which some of us (tight-fisted budgeters) can use!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Our priorities\/goals<em> are<\/em> always changing.<\/strong> And you&#8217;d def. see that occurring the longer you do this exercise (though maybe better doing quarterly or bi-yearly since not that much changes on a monthly basis?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) That 50\/50 balance of &#8220;pleasure&#8221; vs &#8220;responsibility&#8221; up there is great.<\/strong> You sock away a chunk up front to help you feel better about what&#8217;s to come, and then you splurge away, haha&#8230; And even better when it involves other people too, like Matthew&#8217;s girlfriend and the charities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Though did you notice all the <em>I thinks<\/em> there in the beginning?<\/strong> He was probably just writing in the flow, but it&#8217;s always interesting to see how you *think* you&#8217;d spend new money coming in vs how you would *actually* spend it. Unless you&#8217;re the complete opposite of me and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/do-you-treat-your-money-differently-depending-on-how-you-get-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feelings don&#8217;t get in the way at all<\/a> ;) A much <em>better<\/em> indication of how you&#8217;d spend an extra $1,000 would be looking at how you just spent your LAST $1,000! Haha&#8230; Though I know that kills the thrill of the game&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>and then lastly, 5) What if this prompted you to actually go out and EARN AN EXTRA $1,000?!<\/strong> Turning these &#8220;what ifs&#8221; into reality? Seeing all that fun stuff it could bring would certainly motivate <em>me<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to hustle more<\/a> than a vague wad of cash would&#8230; You never want to chase money just for the sake of &#8220;having more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So yeah &#8211; I approve of this! Anything you can implement to try and trick yourself into being better with money is always a win in my books :) So thanks Matthew. Would love to hear if it sparks any new changes for you over the next handful of months?<\/p>\n<p>As for what I&#8217;d do with an extra $1,000 right now? I&#8217;d probably apply it towards furniture for two rooms in our house which are still completely empty despite moving in over 4 months ago, haha&#8230; I hardly have the desire &#8211; or energy &#8211; to go shopping these days, but maybe it would buy me a magical fairy that could do it all for us so we don&#8217;t feel like failed adults? On the plus side, my kids sure love using them as soccer fields and wrestling mats, so at least <em>they&#8217;re<\/em> getting something out of them :)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What would you do with an extra $1,000?
