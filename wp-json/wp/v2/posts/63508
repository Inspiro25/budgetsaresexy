It could be a great tool if you are currently building up an emergency fund, saving up a down payment for a house, OR, if you want to earn a decent interest rate on an existing pile of cash!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hmbradley.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HMBradley<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offer a 3% interest rate on a regular checking account (increased to 3.5% if you carry\/use their credit card also!). Pretty dang good in today&#8217;s climate where the average high yield savings account get&#8217;s you ~0.5%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BUT, to qualify for the incentive, <\/span><b>you gotta have at least a 20% savings rate.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, what I love most is that this is the first time I\u2019ve seen a bank link their incentive program to a \u201csavings rate,\u201d which as you probably know, is one of the most important factors in calculating your time to financial independence!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of my friends (actually I\u2019m guessing most people in the U.S.) still don\u2019t know what a savings rate is! So it\u2019s exciting to see financial institutions start using the same language us FIRE peeps use, and actually encouraging good personal finance practices. I hope other new fintech banks will start following suit, and continue spreading the &#x1f525;&#x1f525;&#x1f525;&#x1f525;&#x1f525;&#x1f525;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**By the way&#8230; I\u2019m not getting compensated to write this HM Bradley review, or to recommend any HMBradley services. I\u2019m just sharing cool info that I come across. In fact, I learned about this bank from a random guy I met surfing who works there!**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I\u2019ll explain how the bank works and how the savings rate is calculated. Then I\u2019ll talk about some good use case scenarios to take advantage of the 3% interest on your cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>HMBradley Review<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent some time on the HMB website (and I even signed up for an account to start playing around). The savings account has no monthly fees, no account minimum, and no min\/max number of transactions. They don&#8217;t have separate \u201csavings\u201d and \u201cchecking\u201d accounts&#8230; It\u2019s all the same stuff just bundled into 1 single account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the fee schedule from their user agreement:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63594 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1__HM_Bradley_fees_jpeg_8nFHWdaw-e1607920784965.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Couple other things to note:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All accounts are FDIC insured, so it\u2019s a legit bank. There\u2019s no risk storing money there (up to $250k)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get a debit card, and can do digital transfers, but there are no physical checkbooks or checks available.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have a mobile app, which seems easy to use and you can manage all your stuff from the app.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was easily able to link them to my <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mint.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mint.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> account for translation tracking. I assume it\u2019s available for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal Capital<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Savings Tier and Interest Rate %<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you can set up a direct deposit to have your work paycheck deposited there. (If you are self employed, or have other income sources, that seems OK too, as long as you flag these transactions as income deposits with customer service.) You gotta have at least 1 direct deposit per month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank adds up all your monthly deposits, then minuses all the withdrawals. The leftover figure is used to determine your overall savings tier, based on the rate you are saving at. This analysis is done on a quarterly basis, and the interest rate you qualify for is applied to the following quarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the interest rate tiers, which apply to the <strong>entire account balance<\/strong>:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63593 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2__HM_Bradley_Savings_Tiers_jpg_bTunOmpD-e1607920793119.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"270\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hmbradley.com\/blog\/savings-tiers-explained\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full details here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the bank website)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saving 20% of income gets you earning 3% interest. Saving 15% gets you 2%, etc. etc\u2026\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for example: Someone depositing $5,000 per month, then withdrawing $4,000 per month, would qualify for Savings Tier 1 (3%APY) based on saving 20% of their income. Woohoo!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to understand though, that <\/span><b>the bank only sees the money coming in\/out of this specific account<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; not your overall financial profile. So they don\u2019t take into account taxes, pre-tax paycheck withdrawals, or other earnings\/spending outside of this bank account. The savings tier is solely determined on the transactions it processes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a smart move by HMBradley, because it means the account has to keep growing and growing in size. (But, it also gives room for a loophole, which I\u2019ll explain more below in use case #3 below!)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Saving Rate vs. Investing Rate<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/richard-branson-over-sharing-and-how-to-talk-about-fire\/\">FIRE world<\/a> when we talk about our savings rate, we are really referring to our <i>investment rate <\/i>. Any money we \u201csave\u201d each month, we usually transfer right away to our investment accounts, putting the money to work for us immediately. Our savings are rarely kept all in cash if we already have a full emergency fund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in the case that someone invests all of their saved money, HMBradley would see an equal amount of incoming deposits as outgoing withdrawals. The system would assess this as 0% savings, because there\u2019s no *new* money leftover in the account each month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BUT, there are a couple of scenarios where people are building up their cash pile, and in these situations HMB could be a great account. Here are the use cases I can see being a good fit:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Use Case #1: Someone Building an Emergency Fund<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re starting a new emergency fund, or growing an existing one, HMB could be a great option instead of a regular savings account. As long as you\u2019re planning to keep the savings in cash, you may as well try to earn as much interest as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earning 3% is rare for a checking account! Most of the big banks and money market accounts right now offer less than 1%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a comparison, here\u2019s a list of \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highest APY interest accounts<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d I found on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/banking\/savings\/rates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bankrate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (as of Nov 2020). There are other outliers out there that pay a higher interest rate, but most cap the amount you can save.**<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63592 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/3__Savings_Account_Interst_jpeg_q1P1pdt_-e1607920801168.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"374\" height=\"278\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have your paycheck deposited into an account at HMBradley, and only withdraw 80% of the funds, you\u2019ll qualify for earning 3% interest on the entire account balance. As you keep saving and saving, you can rest knowing your money is earning a great interest rate while saving up your emergency fund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Earlier this year I opened an account with Chime. These guys right now <\/span><\/i><b><i>offer 1% interest on savings accounts with no hoops to jump through, and no annual fee<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

I saved about $60k, and it took me 7 years to accumulate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this 7 year period, I made a total of $0 in bonus interest. In fact, my money was <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">losing value<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to inflation each year!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, if I had the option to earn 3% interest on my savings (provided I qualified for the rate), my $60k in savings over the years could have earned an additional ~$5,000 in interest! Oh, how I\u2019d love an extra 5k right now &#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember checking\/savings accounts are federally insured, so there\u2019s no risk you\u2019ll lose your savings contributions. This is one of the reasons people prefer to save housing down payments in cash vs. investing in the stock market for a short term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**The 3% interest is available on amounts up to $100,000 at this bank. So if you\u2019re saving more than that for your house downpayment, you gotta work something else out :)**<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Use Case #3: Earn 3% on Your Existing Cash (Using an Artificial Savings Rate)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As some of you know from my <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-3-cup-of-tea\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last net worth report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I have about $40k sitting in cash right now, which is our emergency fund. I\u2019m earning next to 0% interest on this money (well, that\u2019s not entirely true because I\u2019m using it for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/churning-bank-accounts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">churning bank accounts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but if the money did just sit there it would be earning 0%).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, my wife and I don\u2019t have a 20% after tax savings rate currently. So transferring this $40k over to HMBradley wouldn\u2019t do me much good because I wouldn\u2019t qualify for even their lowest tier incentive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here\u2019s where the loophole could help\u2026 Since HMBradly only looks at the incoming deposits and outgoing withdrawals <\/span><b>from their accounts only<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I could create my own savings rate. I would do this by using my regular bank for all my usual transactions just like I do today, and only deposit or withdraw money to the new HMBradley account that meets the savings rate qualifications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example: Let\u2019s say I asked my work payroll to divide my paycheck up into 2 separate deposits, sending $100 every month to HMBradley, and the remainder to my regular bank as usual. Then, let\u2019s say I just left the new account untouched, making no withdrawals\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system would see $100 in deposits, $0 in withdrawals, and treat this as a 100% savings rate. I could leave this set up for years, and the account would just grow slowly staying at the highest 3% interest rate tier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since they give 3% interest <strong>*on your entire account balance*<\/strong>, as long as I have my $40k sitting there from the get go, I would earn a 3% return going forward. That\u2019s over $1,200 in interest I\u2019d be earning a year, vs. the $0 I get now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually, this trick could be used with the other 2 use cases if you don\u2019t qualify for the highest tier. Just treat the account like a 1-way street. Only direct deposit small amounts of money in and never take any out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realize the bank probably didn\u2019t create the account to be used this way, but there\u2019s nothing that prevents it. &#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f; And, if I took this route I wouldn\u2019t feel too bad, knowing that HMBradley is probably lending my money out somewhere and making a higher return for themselves!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>One last note:<\/strong> HMBank also offers a credit card &#8211; only for existing clients. Using the HMBradly credit card adds another 0.5% onto your checking account earnings. So potentially, you can earn 3.5% APY total! But, they use your total monthly deposits to determine your credit card approval (as well as your credit score obviously), so if you\u2019re using the smaller deposits trick you might not get approved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The HMBradly credit card has a $60 annual fee (waived for the first year) and you have to use it for at least $100 of spending each month to qualify for the higher rate.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts on HMBradley<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m excited about the traditional banking industry getting shaken up by new fintech companies. It seems that new banks like HMBradley are offering better and better incentives for savers, as well as making things quicker and easier to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this bank might not suit everyone\u2019s situation, you can\u2019t deny that earning 3% interest on a checking account is hard to beat! And the fact that they\u2019re helping people better understand savings rates and encourage improvement \u2026 I\u2019m a fan &#x1f60d;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What cool new banks and fintech offerings are you coming across?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just learned about a cool new bank called HMBradley.
