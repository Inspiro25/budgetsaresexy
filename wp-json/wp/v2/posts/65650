The ability to stop what you&#8217;re doing and help others right on the spot without having to worry about your job or money holding you back. True freedom at its best, harnessing the power of your *time* over the power of your money!<\/p>\n<p>These words hit me hard, and after I got over myself for feeling bad for <em>also<\/em> not thinking of the greater good first!, haha, I realized I&#8217;m actually not doing too bad in that department either&#8230; In fact, my generosity has increased approx. 37x compared to the Old J$ who was once as stingy as he was good looking, if you can believe that ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>A great example of this is what went down last week when I ran into a skater friend at the coffee shop who was looking particularly low\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He explained that he had just put brand new wheels on his skateboard after scrounging for the money, and then a mere 24 hours later it was stolen from him after stashing it at the skate park.<\/p>\n<p>Now just the fact he had to <em>hide it there<\/em> added to my hypothesis that he may be homeless or transitory or something as I\u2019ve also seen him brush his teeth at the coffee shop before as well as make some makeshift soup with his cup, but regardless it&#8217;s a blow to your wallet and mood either way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And it broke me.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Losing a board sucks on its own, but to lose something that gives you such a great mental and physical outlet too for someone who needs it the most? Which also probably doubles as your transportation at times? Damn.<\/p>\n<p>I immediately started racking my brain on how I could help, and at first thought maybe I could just leave some money at the local skate shop or something so that whenever he\u2019s there next he\u2019ll be alerted someone comped it for him, but <em>when<\/em> and <em>how long<\/em> that would take was anyone&#8217;s guess (probably too long since he doesn&#8217;t have money to spend, so why would he even step foot in it?) so I scrapped that idea and kept thinking\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then it dawned on me &#8211; I have a board in the back of my trunk! Which I always keep for emergencies!<\/strong> Lol\u2026 And if this doesn&#8217;t constitute an emergency, what does? :) So without thinking a second more I slipped out of the coffee shop, scooped it from the back of my trunk, and then skated back as I recorded a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/N9BWPAr3LkM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">final &#8220;goodbye&#8221; ride<\/a> with her before we departed &#x1f606;<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/N9BWPAr3LkM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><strong>The look on his face when I handed it to him was all I needed to see.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He refused it a couple of times &#8211; only re-enforcing the fact that he deserved it! &#8211; and then finally accepted it graciously and promised me he&#8217;d &#8220;ride the $hit out of it&#8221; which was exactly what I wanted to hear.<\/p>\n<p>What a feeling!<\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;ll admit a few minutes later I <em>did<\/em> have pangs of regret as it was actually one of my favorite boards and cost me $200, haha, but just the fact that I <em>had multiple boards <\/em>was exactly why I needed to step up and help. <strong>Because *I could*.<\/strong> And because a 3rd board to someone is nothing compared to NO board, particularly if you don&#8217;t even have a home or place to store it in (!)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, long story I probably could have made shorter, but another example of how having your money straight can help you &#8220;show up&#8221; for others just like Kate and her presence. <em>And another reminder that opportunities are all around us too if we keep our eyes open enough to see them! <\/em>Something I&#8217;ve personally been working hard to improve on in my own life, as again, past J$ was way too into himself and his money to have even noticed, sigh&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So thanks for the reminders Kate!
