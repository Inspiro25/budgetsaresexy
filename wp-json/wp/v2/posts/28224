We are saving 15% of gross income between the three IRAs, and the leftover amount each month is applied toward the mortgage ~$2,000. We are shooting for a payoff date of December 2014, but this is dependent on many factors, such as overtime hours and the possibility of getting a roommate to rent out our 2nd bedroom. \u00a0We have wills and\u00a0Term Life Insurance for each of us at $400k. \u00a0We have many other areas where we could be spending and aren&#8217;t, such as vacationing and tithing, which we have chosen to pause until the mortgage is gone.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I am looking for objective feedback here&#8230; \u00a0Are we crazy? (All of our friends think so.)<\/p>\n<h2>J. Money Thoughts:<\/h2>\n<p>First, it depends on your definition of &#8220;crazy&#8221; ;) Many people who go against the crowds are considered geniuses! And in my professional opinion, you guys are def. amongst them ;) Although it does look like it took you a while to get on a good game plan there with your retirement accounts, yeah? At least with your husband? Did something happen to get you guys to honker down and start killing it, or did you just start making a bit more money now? Overall I&#8217;m pretty impressed though.<\/p>\n<p>Here are my thoughts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The obvious one first: Your mortgage plan<\/strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s not that shocking that I think your plan here is simply fantastic :) I&#8217;ve been a HUGE fan of getting all debts down to $0.00 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/mortgage-payoff-plan\/\">for almost a year now<\/a>, and it looks like you guy are doing a much better job than myself considering my motivation is <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/hard-to-pay-off-mortgages\/\">slowly waning<\/a> in recent months&#8230; even though I KNOW it&#8217;s such an incredible feat!!\u00a0 Not many people can pull this off even if they wanted to (esp. in YOUR timeline here) so you guys are on a damn good path of making this happen. You already have over $60,000 in equity!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your Assets:\u00a0<\/strong> A little low for your ages as I pointed out, but from the looks of your budget you&#8217;re done playing around and ready to amp things up :) Your future IRA plans look dope, and you&#8217;ve got a ton of savings between your emergency fund and your &#8220;other savings&#8221; account &#8211; giving you a solid 9 months of padding in the even you both lost your jobs or something equally tragic (excluding &#8220;extra&#8221; investments\/savings) And luckily you have a lot left over every month too in the event you want to feel even MORE secure later down the road! Well done.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Liabilities:\u00a0<\/strong> AWESOME!!\u00a0 Wow, just your mortgage?\u00a0 Good for you guys.\u00a0 Mortgage arms usually scare me too much, but since your plan is to nix it out entirely over the next two+ years it really doesn&#8217;t matter by then now does it?\u00a0 You&#8217;ll be home-free quite literally by then!\u00a0 Loving this!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Income:<\/strong> I&#8217;d say that looks pretty decent for your ages, though not sure where you live or what you do :) But numbers wise, nothing looks glaring to me. As long as it rises over the years steadily&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expenses:<\/strong> MAN you guys are frugal! Haha&#8230; $200ish on food every month? $50 on entertainment? Y&#8217;all blow me out of the water like woah here, nicely done :)\u00a0 Even with Internet &#8211; we subscribe to all sorts of services that total around $150 a mo! Digging the &#8220;Car Replacement Fund&#8221; too &#8211; very smart.\u00a0 As well as with your monthly IRA contributions &#8211; looks like you&#8217;ve divided it all up so that at the end of the year you both will max them each out, congrats :)\u00a0 As I mentioned yesterday, maxing out is <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/the-twenty-thousand-dollar-investment-answer\/\">one of my favorite and most important goals<\/a>! And since you don&#8217;t get any matching with your 401(k), it makes sense to keep that category lower.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your leftover money each month:<\/strong> Incredible. That&#8217;s almost 35% of your NET take home pay &#8211; you can do some serious damage with that! (And already are). It&#8217;s great to have options, isn&#8217;t it?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>My overall score: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">A<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>I should probably give you an A+ here, but I&#8217;ve been told I&#8217;m too easy on people with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/inside-look-at-other-budgets-finances\/\">this stuff<\/a> ;) And I would like to see a bit more in your retirement accounts than what the current levels are showing, although your future plans WILL show a nice increase as the months truck by. So I can&#8217;t really fault you for that from this point forward, now can I?<\/p>\n<p>All in all I REALLY think you&#8217;re on a great path here, Sam. And at any point you can always divert some of that $2k another direction if you guys want to change routes down the road &#8211; it&#8217;s a huge padding to have every month and you guys should def. be proud! Congrats! :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So that&#8217;s my humble opinion anyways.<\/strong><em><strong>\u00a0 What do YOU ALL think?\u00a0 Pros? Cons?<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 Would you do anything differently?\u00a0 Spill the beans and help Samantha and Chad get better!\u00a0 Thanks guys&#8230; freakin&#8217; awesome community we&#8217;ve got brewing here :) We&#8217;re one lucky family&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Like this series?
