The book is called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3uA3D4J\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time Smart: How to reclaim your time, &amp; live a happier life<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Cheers to Ben Miller over at <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chronifi.com\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chronifi<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for recommending it to me. Great book!)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right from the first page I found myself scribbling notes, ideas, and things I want to try changing in my life&#8230; So I figured I\u2019d share some of the stuff with you in case it\u2019s helpful in your life, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, I\u2019ll note 6 common time traps most people fall into. Recognizing these and combating them will make you more time-rich and lead to more peace and happiness in life!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if you want to check out the full book yourself, here\u2019s a link to grab it on Amazon<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u2014-&gt; <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3uA3D4J\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time Smart<\/span><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 (Or you should definitely see if the local library has it in stock &#8211; and borrow for free like I did!)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3uA3D4J\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-64308\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Time-smart-book-e1638163715553.jpg\" alt=\"Time smart time traps\" width=\"227\" height=\"342\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6 Common Time Traps<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like bad finance decisions, most humans naturally make poor time decisions. This leads to people feeling unhappy, time poor, and discontent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So check out these 6 of the most common time traps&#8230; Identify the ones you fall into \u2192 do less of them \u2192 be more time rich and live happily ever after!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Technology Interruptions &amp; the Autonomy Paradox<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most new technology is invented to save us time and money. But, if we\u2019re not careful it can actually rob us of our time and money. This is called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/the-autonomy-paradox\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the autonomy paradox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example: Checking email on your cell phone \u2192 this awesome technology helps you work <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anywhere, anytime<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But, somehow this has encouraged people to work <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everywhere, all the time. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpful if used in the right way, but harmful if used in the wrong way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interruptions are also extremely harmful. It\u2019s not just the amount of time we spend on something, it\u2019s the intermittent distractions that screw us up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example: Instead of checking social media for 30 mins in the morning and 30 mins at night (60 mins total), people check it for only 30 seconds at 120 different times during the day (still 60 mins total). Same 1 hour spent on social media, but the sporadic checking during the day completely interrupts and robs time from other tasks &#8212; <\/span><b>including much needed leisure time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on weeknights\/weekends!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insta, Facebook, Tweets, texts, emails, activity alerts, shopping notifications, stock price checking, etc. can be like <\/span><b>death by 1,000 invisible papercuts.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. We Are Too Focused on Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons people feel time-poor is because they trade too much of their non-refundable minutes in life trying to get richer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>While money can protect against sadness, it can\u2019t purchase joy.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**This is one of my fav things to discuss on the blog. Money is an important cornerstone in life!&#8230; But, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/money-lessons-learned-while-traveling-around-the-world\/\">once you have \u201cenough\u201d<\/a> (when your basic needs are covered), excess money starts to have diminishing returns on happiness.**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. We Don\u2019t Value Our Personal Time Very Well<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people misunderstand what their time is worth. Or, they don\u2019t account for it at all when planning or doing activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>We also protect our money in ways that are counterproductive to time affluence.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example: While booking a vacation, Sally finds flights and hotel deals that save $200 on the overall vacation cost. But, she forgets to account for her <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The flights she booked mean 4 hours of vacation time were cut out of the first and last day of the trip, and the hotel is an extra 10 min walk from nearby attractions, etc. All in all, she might have saved $200, but at the cost of 10 hours total vacation time. Worth it?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. \u201cBusy\u201d Is Becoming a Status Symbol<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When most people see someone driving a Ferrari with fancy clothes and jewelry, they think, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDang! That person must be rich! I better go out and buy me some fancy clothes and jewelry too, because that\u2019s how rich people live!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is, conspicuous consumption is typically done by people with low wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, it\u2019s the same when we see people who are very busy. We think most busy people are important and probably successful. Then we try to search for \u201cbusy work\u201d ourselves, thinking it will bring us success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the truth is <\/span><b>many busy people are actually very time poor<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcr\/article\/44\/1\/118\/2736404\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research shows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that employees who boast about working a lot and not having any free time are seen as better workers with more prestige and wealth &#8212; even if they are not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beware of conspicuous <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> consumption! It\u2019s a trap. And practice <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/living-a-stealth-wealth-lifestyle\/\">Stealth Wealth<\/a> with your money ;)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Inability to Sit and Do Nothing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have a really hard time switching off their brain. Sitting idle is extremely hard for most people, because they feel the need to be productive or stressed about something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the best example of this is sitting and eating your lunch. Most people can\u2019t sit for even 15 minutes and enjoy their meal by themselves without pulling out their phone, consuming media, thinking about work, stressing about tomorrow, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of a full mind, try to be mindful!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/full-mind-or-mindful\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-64307\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/full-mind-or-mindful-e1638163724845.jpg\" alt=\"full mind vs mindful\" width=\"600\" height=\"438\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. We Say Yes Too Much<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to hang out on Saturday?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2192 Yes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you read this new book? It\u2019s great.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2192 Sure, I\u2019ll check it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you help me move this weekend?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2192 Yep!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to be on my podcast?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2192 Sure, how \u2018bout next week!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason we say yes to most future commitments is because <\/span><b>we believe that we\u2019ll be less busy in the future.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But, in reality this isn\u2019t true. The best way to determine how busy you will be next week is to look at how busy you are this week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saying No more places a higher value on your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Recognizing and Avoiding Time Traps!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is, most of these time traps are relatively easy to avoid. Just knowing which ones you regularly fall into is half the battle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone\u2019s schedule and life is different, so some of these might not be applicable to you specifically, but here are my notes and things I\u2019m thinking of working on:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, document your time and recognize which traps you fall into most. Also, note *how you feel* after specific activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was xyz activity productive\/unproductive?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was it for simple pleasure or true meaning?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is kind of like tracking your finances. Figuring out where your money has been spent is the easiest way to project the best budget moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Find Spare Time<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put; do less of the things that don\u2019t provide you value, to make room for more of the things that do provide you value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means <\/span><b>transforming bad time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: like removing an hour of TV to play guitar or go to bed early instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also <\/span><b>augmenting good time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: leaving your cell phone in the car while playing with your kids at the park.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, <\/span><b>buying spare time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: like outsourcing tasks to free up time and then spend that time on higher value activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Few Work Hacks to Save Time<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably know about these, or even use them already, but here are a few underrated hacks to try at work:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set 10 minute meetings instead of 30 min meetings. Or skip unnecessary meetings altogether and ask for an email summary from another attendee instead. If you host a meeting, set and stick to an agenda.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guard your time by showing unavailable IM status, blocking your calendar, and not letting people interrupt you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put your phone on airplane mode for large chunks of the day to focus. Or at least turn off all notifications.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negotiate coming in 2 hours early or leaving 2 hours late (just an example) to avoid heavy traffic. Or, negotiate working from home. Or, try asking for 4 x 10-hour shifts instead of 5 x 8\u2019s.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These little changes might seem uncomfortable at first. But in the long run you\u2019ll feel more in control of your time and less time-strapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">******<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last thing I\u2019ll say is that <\/span><b>small daily habits have HUGE ripple effects in life.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even just getting up 10 minutes earlier each morning (and going to bed 10 mins earlier at night) can have massive positive effects on your time affluence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wishing you all a lovely week ahead! And thank you for spending some of your time reading this article.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love, Joel<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>PS: Amazon links to the book above are affiliate links.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, sunshines! &#x2600;&#xfe0f;&#x1f33b; How y\u2019all doing this fine day?
