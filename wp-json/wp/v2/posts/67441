One less task for me, and more cash for them &#8211; which should literally only take like 15 seconds. And where can you find an hourly rate like that as a kid?! You&#8217;d think this would have motivated them, but no. After two weeks and approximately 0 scoops my genius idea was proven to be not that genius at all &#x1f643;<\/p>\n<p>So I did what any good problem solver would do &#8211; I upped it to $1.00 a clump (DOUBLE the reward!!!). But sadly that didn\u2019t fair much better either, clocking in with a total of just *1* scoop out of about 130 opportunities given&#8230; And that was only after me <em>hinting<\/em> there was a golden prize right next to their feet where they were playing!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So back to the beginning we were, with me in the fields again scooping away, and them very much still in want of money&#8230;<\/strong> Though if you ask me, if you can&#8217;t even bend over for a few seconds to earn some quick cash, do you actually really want it <em>that<\/em> bad? ;)<\/p>\n<p>(As an aside, I\u2019m writing all this on my phone right now in the middle of the gastrointestinal office awaiting my own colonoscopy results, haha\u2026 Poo is on the mind today!! UPDATE: I\u2019m in the clear!\u00a0 They found a polyp in there during the procedure, but apparently it was \u201cthe good kind\u201d so I&#8217;m set to go for another 5 years &#8211; #Adulting)<\/p>\n<p>After marinating on it for a while and trying to come up with a more enticing offer, we realized we&#8217;ve never officially implemented any type of &#8220;allowance&#8221; deal yet with our family. And perhaps now was just the time to enact one? <em><strong>Maybe the incorporation of\u00a0 *timelines* and getting weekly paychecks would motivate them more?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Or maybe they just really don&#8217;t like poop, I dunno, but either way at 10, 9 and 5 it was high-time they start appreciating where money came from more. Especially if they&#8217;re gonna take over this blog one day ;)<\/p>\n<p>I remember how important allowances were for ME growing up, even if I was only getting paid $1.00\/week and all my friends made fun of me (!!!), but it was enough to give me a little freedom and push in the right direction. So I dug up an old wipey board from the basement and got to work&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67432\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/chore-chart.jpg\" alt=\"chore chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/chore-chart.jpg 640w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/chore-chart-300x207.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/chore-chart-550x380.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each kid has one daily task to complete, and if they accomplish it &#8211; AND &#8211; keep up with their other general responsibilities like making their bed and cleaning up after themselves, they&#8217;ll be entitled to an allowance at the end of the week.<\/p>\n<p>If, however, they only do a partial job in any area, they&#8217;ll then get a 1\/2 check and too many 1\/2 checks will result in <em>less<\/em> of an allowance at the week&#8217;s end. You&#8217;ll see Baby Dime up there already got one after a couple of days rockin&#8217; it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As for their pay? $3.00\/week.<\/strong> BUT! This isn&#8217;t just any ordinary allowance, oh no. As recommended by my oldest son, Baby Penny, we&#8217;ll be following the concept from the book <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3r4rcnC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Three Cups<\/a> by Tony Townsley*. A fantastic read that surprisingly all three of my kids love! And one that recommends splitting allowances into 3 equal parts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup for spending<\/li>\n<li>1 cup for savings<\/li>\n<li>and 1 cup for giving<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thereby teaching kids the importance of all THREE, and getting those habits started early. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/angelina-jolie-budget-methods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Even stars like Angeline Jolie does this<\/a>!! Though perhaps filling up their <em>houses<\/em> with cash instead of plastic cups &#x1f602; And since my kids will be *manually* receiving and divvying up their cash each week vs digitally on a screen, hopefully it&#8217;ll all sink in even more too. I&#8217;ve already headed to the bank to get stacks of ones now that I&#8217;ll be turning into an ATM!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67418\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/cash-gif.gif\" alt=\"cash gif\" width=\"320\" height=\"405\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[live shot of me flipping through a stack]<\/p>\n<p><strong>I gotta give my oldest boy mad credit again for this.<\/strong> We were originally going to start their allowances at $2.00\/week which they could do whatever they want with, but it was him who brought up the book and said he&#8217;d like to get a little more involved and give back. I almost cried and immediately changed it.<\/p>\n<p>And as you can see, we&#8217;re off to a great start! Everyone is more or less doing their part each day, and I can already tell they&#8217;re taking it seriously and excited for what they can now do with their extra money. We&#8217;ll see how long it lasts, but for now I&#8217;m a proud dad, and I&#8217;d like to think a *smart* one too ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hopefully the $$$ teachings of your kids are going well for you over there! If any of them are interested in scooping up poop, my $1.00\/offer is still on the table!<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yours in daddying,<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64642\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-money-signature.jpg\" alt=\"j. money signature\" width=\"186\" height=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>*I first read <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3r4rcnC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Three Cups<\/a> when we did a giveaway for it here on the blog over 13 years ago &#8211; way before any of my kids were born or I even had to think about allowances!
