And do a mighty fine job of it too, I might add.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But, it ALSO turns out that we have a healthy group of new millionaires off our Millionaire&#8217;s Club here on BudgetsAreSexy too!<\/strong> Yup! You might remember <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/first-millionaire-in-the-club\/\">our very 1st member<\/a> crossing over the $1,000,000 mark back in May of this year &#8211; Big Chris B, member #62 &#8211; and since then we&#8217;ve\u00a0 had TWO others hit the finish line too. Increasing our grand total of millionaire friends to 3 :) 3 out of 115 current members &#8211; not bad odds if you were a betting man! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But the number itself isn&#8217;t that important. What *counts* is <em><strong>HOW they got to reach these million dollar levels<\/strong><\/em>. Did they get lucky? Win a jackpot? Work their asses off 24\/7? Or just do what everyone already KNOWS what needs to get done to have lots of money? Cut expenses, make more money, and save\/invest all money?<\/p>\n<p>Here are the answers:<\/p>\n<h2>Millionaire #1: Stock Market and Retirement Accounts<\/h2>\n<p>The fist person to reach a million dollar net worth from our club was Big Chris B, as recently mentioned. His blog is now closed off to the general public so unfortunately we can&#8217;t read his post all the way (hope he&#8217;s okay!), BUT since <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/first-millionaire-in-the-club\/\">I already blogged about it<\/a> I can tell you how he got to this millionaire goal: by heavily investing in the stock market and maxing out his retirement accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Two things we all know how to do, right? We may not know exactly *what* to invest in, or have as much as we wished we did to invest and max out those accounts, but no real big secret here in pumping up that net worth. You just invest your money.<\/p>\n<h2>Millionaire #2: High Salary and Stock Market<\/h2>\n<p>Millionaire #2 from our club is member #42, Anon Lawyer. Who&#8217;s, as you can guess, an anonymous lawyer ;) For this guy it was all about his high salary and ALSO the stock market.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s clip from his announcement:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>About 3 1\/2 years ago, I participated in J. Money\u2019s Million Dollar Club. At that time, I estimated that I would become a millionaire by 2016. Turns out I beat that estimate by almost 3 years. This is due in large part to a continuous increase in my income.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, I was a 4th year associate making $210K a year plus bonus. Now, I\u2019m making much more than that, not including my wife\u2019s income. Another contributing factor was starting to invest in the market late last year. In the last week, we probably made $20K in the market. &#8220;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So this route required a big honkin&#8217; salary on top of jumping into the stock market. Also things we know, but one being a LOT harder than any other way to get your hands on money, haha&#8230; $200k+ salary and now making even MORE than that??? Damn. That&#8217;s big pimpin&#8217; right there.<\/p>\n<p>But we can&#8217;t of course forget all the time and effort and probably lack of a social life to even *get* to that point. Becoming a lawyer is no easy feat. Nor is a *successful* one. But, such is one way to get you to a million dollars should you want to go down that path.<\/p>\n<h2>Millionaire #3: Real Estate and Retirement Accounts<\/h2>\n<p>Millionaire #3 on our list today is my favorite, but only because I&#8217;ve been good blogging friends with James and his wife, Miel (from DinksFinance.com) going on almost 6 years now. James was <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/04\/beer-chicken-pf-meeting-tasty\/\">one of the first pf bloggers I ever met in &#8220;real life,&#8221;<\/a> and coincidentally enough the first one to sign up to our Millionaire Club too! Woo!<\/p>\n<p>Neither of us could have guessed we&#8217;d still be in the game all these years later, but here we are and one of us has finally crossed that $1 Mil mark. And it wasn&#8217;t me ;) Congrats buddy!<\/p>\n<p><strong>You can read more about it over on his announcement <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dinksfinance.com\/2013\/10\/dinks-october-net-worth-busted-1000000\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>,<\/strong> but it grew out of mostly investment properties and, again, maxing out retirement accounts. And it helps that bot him AND his wife are doing it &#8211; something that should be noted, of course.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a snapshot of the details I stole from his site:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dinksfinance.com\/2013\/10\/dinks-october-net-worth-busted-1000000\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-36496\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/million-dollar-net-worth-dinks.png\" alt=\"million dollar net worth\" width=\"540\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/million-dollar-net-worth-dinks.png 645w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/million-dollar-net-worth-dinks-300x207.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Pretty neat stuff. And look at him putting that cherry on top with an extra $32,000 &#8211; overachiever! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The point of all this? Just like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/11\/proof-getting-out-of-debt-possible\/\">paying off all your debt<\/a> over time, the same strategies can be used to do the opposite: Pay YOURSELF over time.<\/strong> You may not have grand dreams of reaching that million dollar mark (or maybe you want 10 Mil!), but regardless it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that it is, without a doubt, POSSIBLE.<\/p>\n<p>And just like with all that debt squashing, the same words can be used to describe this journey as well: Hustling, prioritizing, and &#8220;not being easy&#8221; ;) Possible, but not easy.<\/p>\n<p>Also &#8211; people tend to forget to *track* their net worth vs their debt &#8211; which is of course easier to see since the numbers stare you in the face 24\/7. So to even be able to tell us you&#8217;ve crossed this mark, you&#8217;ll have to start <em>tracking<\/em> it first. Possibly even today (*gasp*). But it&#8217;s really easy: add up your assets and subtract your liabilities &#8211; BAM. There are some <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/11\/stealth-wealth-hiding-net-worth\/\">gray areas<\/a> to this, but that&#8217;s all you really need to know to get you going&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\">Want to join our Millionaire Club?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/04\/my-millionaire-to-do-list\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/million_dollar_club_180x172.gif\" alt=\"million dollar club\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>If you&#8217;d like to become a member of the sexy elite (aka our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/04\/my-millionaire-to-do-list\/\">Millionaire Club<\/a> ;)), pass me a note and let me know how YOU plan on reaching that incredible number.<\/p>\n<p>Will you be cutting back major expenses?
