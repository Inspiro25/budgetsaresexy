It wasn&#8217;t much at the time &#8212; like 10 cents here or there &#8212; because I was only earning pocket money doing odd chores around the house.<\/p>\n<p>When I turned 14 and started <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/crappy-jobs-on-my-path-to-fire\/\">working at McDonald&#8217;s<\/a>, 10% of my income seemed like a much bigger amount. Working 4 shifts a week would earn me about $100, so I&#8217;d have about $10 to give to church each Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>Around age 16, I started working on the weekends and stopped attending church on Sundays. I still siphoned off 10% of my income and just let the money build up until I had a few hundred dollars in my &#8220;charity&#8221; account.<\/p>\n<p>I remember asking my Mum one day, <i>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to give to church anymore &#8230; where else can I do charitable donations?&#8221;<\/i>\u00a0My Mum told me that some of our family friends were buying a house and were going through a tough financial situation. We ended up giving them an envelope full of cash one day, and it was the biggest gift I had ever given as a teenager. It felt great.<\/p>\n<h2>Put charity in your budget, and donating time instead of money<\/h2>\n<p>I wish I could say I kept giving 10% of my income through adulthood, but I&#8217;d be lying. As my income rose, I found it harder and harder to give <i>money<\/i> away. It wasn&#8217;t really about the dollar amount &#8230; It was more difficult finding charitable causes that I was personally passionate about and could see the impact of my charity directly. Or maybe that\u2019s just the excuse I told myself?<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, I do love claiming charity and donations as a tax deduction! The higher your income, the better the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.charitynavigator.org\/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax benefit<\/a>. :)<\/p>\n<p>Yet charity isn\u2019t just giving money to a nonprofit and then putting it as an itemized deduction on your next tax form.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years I\u2019ve found a TON of different ways to be generous &#8212; donating time, helping friends or strangers, paying it forward, volunteering, etc. I like to think any type of selfless giving is a charitable activity.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for different ways to make a charitable contribution to your community, check out some of the following strategies :)<\/p>\n<p><i>*Keep in mind&#8230; Whether you give $1 or $1 million, I believe charity should be a FUN budget item &#8212; something that makes you feel good! There should be no guilt or shame associated with the money you give or don&#8217;t give, no matter your annual income!<\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Add charity to your budget process slowly, or include it in your \u201cgifts\u201d budget line item<\/h2>\n<p>For me, I include charity in my \u201cgiving\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">line item in my budget<\/a>. <span data-slate-leaf=\"true\">For 2020 my wife and I have $5,000 budgeted, which includes birthday gifts, Christmas stuff, favors for people, sponsoring friend&#8217;s <\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span class=\"getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic\">charity<\/span><\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"> events, and setting up a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/giving-stock-ugma-custodial-account\/\">UGMA gift account<\/a> (<\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span class=\"getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic\">stock <\/span><\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span class=\"getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic\">donation<\/span><\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\" data-slate-fragment=\"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\">) for my new baby nephew!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Throughout the year, it feels easier for us to donate small chunks of money here and there, simply because we\u2019ve already budgeted and accounted for it.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not in the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/aspiring-goal-to-shoot-for-spending-more-on-donations-than-wants\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">habit of giving money regularly<\/a> &#8212; and want to be &#8212; try adding a small amount to your budget for charity, and increasing your monthly donations very gradually.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you start with $1 for 1 month, $2 the next month, $3 the month after, and keep growing by just $1 additional per month &#8230; then in 5 short years you&#8217;ll be giving $60 per month to charity (that&#8217;s a $720 line item in your annual budget! Woo!). This is a slow strategy that will build a <i>habit<\/i> of giving without shocking your current annual spend.<\/p>\n<h2>Cut a subscription, donate the money instead<\/h2>\n<p>A friend of mine recently cancelled her Hulu Premium streaming service. She&#8217;s keeping the $12 per month line item in her budget, and just moving it over to a &#8220;gift fund.&#8221;\u00a0 She hasn&#8217;t quite made up her mind about how she\u2019ll give this money yet, but it&#8217;s being kept aside ready for when she finds a good cause.<\/p>\n<p>My friend says, <i>&#8220;It&#8217;s sort of a win-win because I give up something I feel guilty about, and replace it with something I feel great about!&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Pay it forward<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re finding it hard to justify giving to charity, think about all the blessings and advantages you have been given in life. Consider paying it forward, just as someone helped you. Like for like, or in different ways, here are some examples of paying it forward:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone gives you a lift and saves you $5 in gas? \u2192 You tip your server $5 extra that night.<\/li>\n<li>Your boss picks up the tab for your lunch? \u2192 You make an extra dinner for your neighbors.<\/li>\n<li>Your grandma leaves you $5,000 in inheritance money? \u2192 You set aside some gift funds for someone else in your family one day.<\/li>\n<li>You get $1,200 in stimulus payment that you weren\u2019t expecting \u2192 You help local businesses and those who are less fortunate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Next month I\u2019ll share some of the financial gifts my wife and I have been given and our plans to pay it forward to our younger relatives.<\/p>\n<h2>Volunteer or donate your time instead of money<\/h2>\n<p>When I left my job in 2018, my income was reduced to zero. I found it hard to give away much money because I wasn\u2019t earning any. However, I had an abundance of <i>time<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>I stumbled across a flyer for a local Meals on Wheels organization and started volunteering there just 1 day per week. Sometimes I feel my <i>time is more valuable than money<\/i>, and I definitely feel happier volunteering than I thought I would.<\/p>\n<p>Animal shelters, national parks, veterans associations, local chambers of commerce, food pantries and delivery services, Habitat for Humanity, museums, the YMCA, emergency preparedness outreach programs, etc. &#8212; chances are, they ALL need help. Find an area you think will be fun and see how you can help!<\/p>\n<h2>Attend a fundraising event!<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve only been to a few fancy fundraisers (when my past employers covered the ticket sales or sponsored a table). And while sometimes they were very over the top or expensive, it was always fun and supported a good cause.<\/p>\n<p>Also, fundraising events are a great date night! It\u2019s fun dressing up, pretending to be fancy, <span data-slate-leaf=\"true\">throwing around the word &#8220;<\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span class=\"getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic\">philanthropy<\/span><\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\" data-slate-fragment=\"JTVCJTdCJTIyY2hpbGRyZW4lMjIlM0ElNUIlN0IlMjJ0ZXh0JTIyJTNBJTIydGhyb3dpbmclMjBhcm91bmQlMjB0aGUlMjB3b3JkJTIwJTVDJTIycGhpbGFudGhyb3B5JTVDJTIyJTIyJTdEJTVEJTJDJTIydHlwZSUyMiUzQSUyMnBhcmFncmFwaCUyMiU3RCU1RA==\">&#8220;, <\/span>and rubbing shoulders with the uber-wealthy people who attend.

Seeing and hearing first-hand the impact that our donations made was really cool.<\/p>\n<p>Some Compassion programs start at $7 per month &#8212; a small amount for you could mean a huge amount to someone else!<\/p>\n<h2>Write to a prisoner<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of writing letters, last year while listening to a podcast called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.earhustlesq.com\/\">Ear Hustle<\/a>, I learned about a website called <a href=\"https:\/\/writeaprisoner.com\/\">Write A Prisoner<\/a>. This site connects you directly with people serving time behind bars. I signed up (it\u2019s free) and now I have 2 pen pals who are in different California prison systems.<\/p>\n<p>Although this isn&#8217;t really considered a traditional form of charity, I <i>am<\/i> giving of my time here. I truly believe it\u2019s a great cause and I\u2019m making a small difference in people\u2019s lives. The more that prison inmates learn and interact with the outside world, the less likely they are to resort back to crime when they are released!<\/p>\n<p><i>*Side note: The last few inmate letters I\u2019ve sent have gone unanswered due to Covid lockdowns at the prisons.
