They mark the exact date when you stop being the old you, and <\/span><b>start being the new you!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They encourage forward-thinking activities, instead of past habits and happenings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 is almost over. Byeeeee &#x1f44b; . 2021 is nearly here. Woohoo! &#x1f389; It\u2019s time to set some goals using Jan 1st as our landmark date!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I know, New Years goal setting is kinda cliche. But, goals are necessary. And, if you don\u2019t set goals now, when <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you gonna set them?)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My 2020 Mid-Year Goals Recap<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six months ago, I shared some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2020-money-goals-mid-year-review-revise-remove\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goals for this past year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here are some cool things we accomplished this year&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Roth IRAs funded! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wife and I funded our favorite flexible tax-free accounts in January 2020. We contributed the max amount ($6k into each Roth), and we\u2019ll be prioritizing this again in 2021.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>I got a job!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And not just any job &#8211; a fun one that lets me work when and where I please :). I\u2019m extremely thankful to find work and remain gainfully employed through one of the toughest job years in history.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>We gifted $2,500 to a new baby nephew.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My wife and I set up a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/giving-stock-ugma-custodial-account\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unified Gift to Minors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> brokerage account for our newest family member. This money is invested in a total stock market index fund and will hopefully grow to be 5 figures when the kid turns 18!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>We sold our spare car!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was sitting and collecting dust for too long! The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/selling-our-car-online-are-people-even-buying-cars-right-now\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$7,700 cash we sold it for<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> went straight into the stock market. Not only has this investment increased about 10% since then, we\u2019ve also saved $160 per month in car expenses since August.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Made more than $3k in sign-up bonuses!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We ended up making $2,200 from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/churning-bank-accounts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">churning bank accounts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and $1,200 from opening 3 new credit cards. Pretty dang good!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>I got some health insurance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This was on, off, then back on my list throughout the year. After a bit of luck, I was able to score some benefits through my employer starting in October.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And some goals we didn\u2019t accomplish &#x1f614;&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Buying people stocks instead of birthday\/Christmas gifts: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My plan was instead of giving people physical presents for birthday\/Christmas, to buy them stock in various companies instead. I did this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/4-great-ways-to-spread-investments-around\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for my Dad in the past<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who loved it! But, as it turns out, other members of my family think stocks are boring\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(And apparently gift giving is supposed to be about the receiver, not the giver &#8211; who woulda thought?)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Anyway, my family all got physical presents this year.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Sell a rental, refinance the duplex &amp; invest in another real estate partnership: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all my real estate goals were squashed in 2020. And, I\u2019m fine with it! I don\u2019t think waiting is a bad thing&#8230; Patience is important in volatile years and opportunities in real estate will come and go like buses throughout my life. I\u2019m in no rush.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Foster\/adopt a kid: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We did make some small progress toward becoming an approved resource family. It\u2019s a long process, and we\u2019ll continue this through 2021.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A million other little good and bad things happened this year, most of which we didn\u2019t really plan for. So it feels weird listing them as \u201caccomplishments\u201d because some were out of our control\u2026 Things like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-3-cup-of-tea\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">passing $500k in net worth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the assets we\u2019re tracking, receiving a government stimulus handout, spending only $332 this year on restaurants (our budgeted amount was $2,400), losing 5 figures on some of my rentals from missing rent and vacancies &#x1f633;, etc.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year was really hard to predict. I think you will all agree! <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did you go on your 2020 goals this year?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My 2021 Goals &amp; Stuff to Figure Out<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what my wife and I are planning for next year\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial stuff:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Roth, Roth, Roth!: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I were late to the Roth game and have been trying to play catch up ever since we opened our accounts in 2016. They are one of the most flexible accounts for early retirees, and we plan to invest as much as we can each year, as early as we can each year. Even if it means selling other assets to fund them, Roth IRAs are our No. 1 priority.\u00a0 $6k is the limit for 2021 to invest in each Roth account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>100% contributions to 401(k) (until it goes away): <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My workplace notified me that my benefits plan (healthcare and 401(k)) will be terminated at the end of March 2021. It is yet to be determined whether alternatives will be offered, but my guess is no.&#x1f62a;\u00a0 So I want to stuff as much money in my 401(k) as possible early in the year. I don\u2019t earn a huge amount from this job, so 100% contributions in Jan\/Feb\/March might only be ~$7k or so added to this account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Sell a rental property:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I still owe y\u2019all a post on why I\u2019m slowly transitioning away from rental properties. Anyway, our plan is to sell 1 property this coming year and transition the money to our brokerage account. This might be $25-50k depending on the property we sell and price we get after fees.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Build a donation machine!: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been thinking about setting up a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fidelitycharitable.org\/guidance\/philanthropy\/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">donor advised fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Fidelity. It\u2019ll allow us to invest our donations, and direct them to charities when we see fit later in life. Starting probably very small, like $2k, we can add to this each year and possibly grow it into a self-sufficient foundation!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family, fun &amp; community stuff:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Continue the foster\/adopt process:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 It\u2019s still weird talking about this publicly, because my wife and I are a little unclear about where this road will actually take us. What if we get all the way to the end and realize we\u2019ve bitten off more than we can chew? What if we try it and decide fostering isn\u2019t for us after all? I\u2019m guessing all new parents have feelings like this no matter how kids come into their life. Anyway, I\u2019m happy to share more info about this if you guys agree to not hold it against us if we decide not to end up adopting anyone. Deal?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Travel while working remotely:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Due to covid, my wife and I cancelled a 10-day trip to Hawaii, and a 9-day all-inclusive trip to Mexico in 2020. We\u2019re planning to re-book these trips this coming summer&#8230; And now that I work 100% remotely, we want to try working while traveling. This is kind of a test &#8212; working while traveling is easier said than done :)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Buy\/sell more stuff online &#8212; earn $1k cash: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I\u2019m really having fun hawking random items when I find them out and about. The reason I haven\u2019t set a $ goal around this activity thus far is because it\u2019s kind of unpredictable, and I treat it more like a hobby vs. a side hustle. That being said, who knows, maybe I can try and shoot for making an extra $1,000 this year? I\u2019ll start keeping track!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Podcast guest spots: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0This year I was a guest on 3 podcasts, and have a few offers to be on shows in 2021. I\u2019m not a huge fan of having my voice recorded, but doing uncomfortable things keeps me on my toes. I\u2019m shooting for another 3 speaking spots this year.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Create a short writing course for beginners:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Last year I created and hosted a short writing course, teaching people some basics I\u2019ve learned over the past few years. I\u2019m planning to launch a V2 course and offer it to more people who want to start writing or blogging!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Your 2021 Goals?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People say goals should be specific, measurable, have deadlines, etc. I agree, though I don\u2019t think annual goal-setting is a single activity that can be done in one sitting. For me it\u2019s an evolution; a constant process throughout the year\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generate ideas \u2192 list them in order of priority \u2192 clarify goals \u2192 determine steps \u2192 action \u2192 tracking \u2192 adjustments \u2192 more action \u2192 success.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably noticed some of my goals aren\u2019t very specific. That\u2019s cool with me and I\u2019ll be fleshing them out over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t put much thought into your financial goals yet, here are a few common ones to get your juices flowing:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay down x amount in debt<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save and invest xxx\u00a0 (don\u2019t know how much to save?
