Haha&#8230; At least when it comes to college tuition *for their kids* :)<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And depending on how much we&#8217;re talking about here ($20,000? $40,000?) I&#8217;d probably consider it too. It&#8217;s kinda like the <em>opposite<\/em> of prostitution &#8211; getting paid to NOT have sex &#8211; hah!<\/p>\n<p>There were some other interesting stats in this survey by <a href=\"https:\/\/u-nest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U-Nest<\/a> too (an app where you can create, and manage, a 529 College Savings Plan for your kids super easily):<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Parents prioritize saving for their children over saving for retirement, paying off a mortgage, taking a vacation, and paying off their own student debt.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a father I can 100% relate to this, but as a financial &#8220;professional&#8221; my job is to remind people it&#8217;s important to look after yourself too so you can help your loved ones even MORE over time!\u00a0 Similar to the whole &#8220;put your mask on first and <em>then<\/em> put others&#8217; on&#8221; airplane rule. Since after all, you&#8217;re of much more help to people when you&#8217;re alive than when you&#8217;re not! (Although saving for retirement\/college is not nearly as drastic, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;While 75 percent of parents believe a debt-free college education will increase their kid\u2019s chances for success in life, nearly 40 percent aren&#8217;t saving anything for their kids\u2019 education.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all guilty of not doing things we know is in our best interest :( There&#8217;s a stash of Halloween candy right across from me in this room right now and I very much should put it into the trash but cannot!!! And will in fact go and eat some of it right now because CHOCOLATE!!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59625\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/spongebob-chocolate-gif.gif\" alt=\"spongebob chocolate gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Of the parents who are saving for their child\u2019s education, the majority are using a checking or savings account, and only 18 percent are using a tax-free 529 college savings plan.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to hate on savings because that&#8217;s the toughest part of the whole equation, but yes\u00a0 &#8211; there are other ways to put that money harder at work so there&#8217;s *more of it* later for sure (and at least conserved vs losing $$$ due to inflation!).<\/p>\n<p>Similar to U-Nest, I&#8217;m also a fan of 529s and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/a-bunch-of-qas-on-529s-cell-phones-money-coaching-minimalism-blogging-life-and-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use them for all 3 of my boys<\/a>, though I prefer going through our <em>state&#8217;s<\/em> plan in order to snag some yummy tax benefits <em>on top<\/em> of the compounding growth over time. You&#8217;d have to check with your state to see if they offer it, but similar to retirement the more you can put you stash in *investments* the more you&#8217;ll have later when it&#8217;s time to start pulling from it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;All of this is leading to parents willing to sacrifice their own needs, with over 60 percent stating they would give up sex for one year in exchange for one year of of free college tuition for their kids.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(I totally wish I could be at the brainstorming sessions for these surveys btw&#8230; &#8220;Hey &#8211; how can we somehow include something about SEX in this?? You know it&#8217;ll go viral if we do! And at the very least J. Money will cover it &#8216;cuz he can never turn down anything to do with sex and money!!!&#8221; Haha&#8230; All very much true! This blog ain&#8217;t called <a href=\"http:\/\/BudgetsAreBoring.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BudgetsAreBoring.com<\/a>, is it? ;))<\/p>\n<p>I will say though that as much as this stat here on college savings is good, what would be even MORE interesting would be to see how many people could give up sex to have a full year&#8217;s worth of <em><strong>STUDENT LOAN DEBT<\/strong><\/em> paid off! Since that&#8217;s much more of an urgency these days vs something so far off in the future&#8230; (though still of course intertwined).<\/p>\n<p><strong>I was going to wait and see what you&#8217;d chime in here, but my curiosity got the better of me yesterday and I decided to do <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BudgetsAreSexy\/status\/1100414920967909377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my own official poll<\/a> through Twitter ;)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here are the results so far (click the picture to see all the comments, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BudgetsAreSexy\/status\/1100414920967909377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-59640  aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/give-up-sex-poll.jpg\" alt=\"give up sex poll\" width=\"576\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/give-up-sex-poll.jpg 867w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/give-up-sex-poll-300x98.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/give-up-sex-poll-768x251.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Surprisingly, the numbers were flopped from what I thought they&#8217;d be &#8211; especially for a group of finance people!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So either there were lots of people taking the poll without *any* student loan debt at all, OR, y&#8217;all are much better about enjoying your lives than I give you credit for ;) And well done in either case!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a nifty infographic that highlights many of these stats above, and more, if you want to please your eyeballs: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/college-savings-crisis-u-nest.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The College Savings Crisis: How Parents Feel, Think, And Save<\/a>.
