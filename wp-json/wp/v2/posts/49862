I&#8217;m a minimalist, and have wanted to live tiny for a long time now.\u00a0But, let&#8217;s face it, tiny house living is no longer unusual and there are already\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/category\/minimalism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tons\u00a0of articles and resources<\/a> regarding tiny living.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So today I will specifically talk about the personal, and financial aspects, of what it&#8217;s like to buy a hotel room vs a similar studio condo.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I will not get into specifics about\u00a0the challenges and benefits of tiny living, or condo living\u00a0versus single family home living. And, if you are <em>not <\/em>prone to living in a tiny space or\u00a0even high density living (i.e. have a family, like to entertain, or want a yard), then <i>living<\/i> in\u00a0a condotel is not for you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49881\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/condotel-main-room.jpg\" alt=\"condotel main room\" width=\"500\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/condotel-main-room.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/condotel-main-room-300x230.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>However, if you are a real estate investor, this is a great option. <\/strong>It can also always serve as a vacation home, weekend home\u00a0or a retirement home after the nest is empty.<\/p>\n<p>Since this is a money blog, we&#8217;ll start with the juicy details of the finances first&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>The Personal Finances of Owning a Hotel Room<\/h2>\n<p>I am a real estate investor first, homeowner second. So,\u00a0my properties all\u00a0serve the purpose of making me money first, then provide a home base second. We bought this condo in a very happening, upscale urban area, with bike paths and parks galore\u00a0for $41,000.<\/p>\n<p>Yup, $41,000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We made a cash offer and paid half with our own cash, while financing the remainder.<\/strong> It&#8217;s since been paid off in full, free and clear. We also pay about $425 every month to the hotel, <em>ALL inclusive<\/em>. This covers gym,\u00a0heat, electricity,\u00a0water, trash, HOAs, high speed internet\u00a0and cable, including\u00a0about 600 channels with a <i>full<\/i> sports package and\u00a0<i>all<\/i> the movie channels.<\/p>\n<p>Our taxes are\u00a0about\u00a0$1,400 per year, and we buy homeowner&#8217;s insurance for $120 per year. Street parking is free to full time residents.\u00a0So, amortizing those costs, our TOTAL housing costs are <em><strong>$550 per month<\/strong><\/em>. That&#8217;s it. Oh, and did I mention it is on the lakefront?<\/p>\n<h2>Investor Finances of Owning a Hotel Room<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my experience with buying a hotel room. The unit had been on the market for awhile because it was overpriced at $55k. Then it dropped to $49k and entered my radar, because it was now within the range of where we could make a cash offer.<\/p>\n<p>I performed a comp search with my Realtor first and foremost, and I was happy to see that the units do move on the market. That was a\u00a0good sign since I was originally skittish about the whole &#8216;condotel&#8217; investment. I then saw that the non-remodeled unit\u00a0comps placed this property at a value of\u00a0around $43k. So, we negotiated a couple of times\u00a0and ended up on $41k because one of the windows is inoperable and there is no A\/C, so that leaves us $2k to cover those costs down the road.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In addition to doing my due diligence for the purchase price, I also had to figure out if this would even cash flow down the line.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have two options for this. Our first option is that we can rent the unit out ourselves, &#8220;as-is&#8221;,\u00a0on AirBNB, or we can get a more long term tenant. If we get a long term tenant, we can probably get close to $800 per month, which will mean a cash flow of only $250 per month. Not great at only about a 7% ROI, but since this is our main residence, it is not bad to have the\u00a0option of\u00a0temporary rental income.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our second option is that we can put it into the hotel &#8220;pool&#8221;.<\/strong> This is where it gets tricky because the hotel needs to keep certain standards, so\u00a0we would need to put more money into it. At a minimum, we would need to replace the window and A\/C mentioned earlier for $2k, and\u00a0buy a furniture package from the hotel for $3k. Otherwise, the hotel won&#8217;t rent it out for us.<\/p>\n<p>That brings us to an equivalent of a\u00a0$46k total investment purchase price to get it\u00a0into the hotel pool. From there, there are three tiers of rentals. The hotel takes 30% of rents and requires a 2 year lease, which we can break on certain conditions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tier 4<\/span> &#8211;<\/strong> These units are not accepted into the hotel pool because they either don&#8217;t have the $3k package furniture, or the unit is in too bad of shape to meet the hotel standards.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tier 3<\/span> &#8211;<\/strong> These are usually clean, but outdated units.\u00a0With the furniture package, the hotel will rent these units, but they will be the\u00a0last units rented, so they will only be rented during high season. This will bring in an average yearly rental of $9k. After taking off 30%, we would\u00a0be pushing it to break even. This is where our current condo stands.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tier 2<\/span> &#8211;<\/strong> These are units that are more updated than tier 3, but not fully remodeled. It would probably be about another $4-5k to do minor upgrades like flooring, painting, fixtures and appliances. This puts us around $50k or so as a total investment purchase price. Yearly rents average $18k for these, so we would cash flow around $500 per month. Not bad at a 12% ROI.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tier\u00a01<\/span> &#8211;<\/strong> These units are rented out first and must be remodeled to the hotel standards. The remodeling\u00a0for our unit, as done by the hotel, costs $11k. This would put us at a $57k investment purchase price. Yearly rents average $22k-$23k, so we would cash flow around $750 per month, putting us close to a\u00a016% ROI.\u00a0Pretty darn good!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our goal for the short term is to not put any money into the unit, and rent it out the best we can while we do 2-3 month travel trips and then come\u00a0back home for awhile. We can use it to home swap around the world also, and you can read below about our philanthropic dreams.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In the long term, when (or if)\u00a0we move out permanently, we will probably\u00a0go for the Tier 1 option and the 2 year lease, to maximize our ROI.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Fun Facts: <\/em>About 50 units are owner occupied, another 50 are rented out to long term tenants and 80 units are in the hotel pool. They also have larger 1 and 2 bedroom units\u00a0that people live in, but they are pricier (up to $200k for the penthouse).<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Benefit of Condotel Living #1: Travel<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I am a free-spirit and a vagabond, so this is where the decision to buy a hotel room benefits me rather than a condo.<\/p>\n<p>Condos can usually be rented, but sometimes not. If they can be rented, there may be an HOA requirement for a minimum of a one year lease. Plus, most tenants don&#8217;t want furnished condos, they want to bring their own stuff. So, if you want to rent out a condo\u00a0for extended\u00a0travel, you\u00a0may have to put everything\u00a0into storage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>However, with a hotel, it is set up perfectly to travel for a few months and rent it out nightly, or for longer corporate\u00a0stays, and make money while on the road.<\/strong> All of which is our intent in the near future. When we decide to do this, we will put all our belongings into the small closet and install a dead bolt lock on the door and leave the large walk in closet and dresser drawers for the guests. Linens will be available for guest use also.<\/p>\n<p>I know a lot of people would still be weary about having strangers around their stuff. But I&#8217;m a minimalist by nature and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/08\/your-own-fault-owning-expensive-stuff\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not all that attached to my stuff<\/a>. We have a very small\u00a0fire rated\/flood proof,\u00a0lockable safe for important documents that we would leave in the locked closet. Then, when we\u00a0are done traveling, we can\u00a0come right back to a place with furniture, dishes, linens and our\u00a0own stuff!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Benefit of Condotel Living #2: Cleaning<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-49882 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/condotel-bed-living-room.jpg\" alt=\"buy a hotel room\" width=\"500\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/condotel-bed-living-room.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/condotel-bed-living-room-300x208.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Like any tiny dwelling, it is a snap to clean.<\/strong> However, I still don&#8217;t like certain tasks like scrubbing floors and shower stalls. So, (cover your ears,<a href=\"http:\/\/mrmoneymustache.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> MMM<\/a>)\u00a0we\u00a0pay for\u00a0cleaning services\u00a0once every few months. It is nice because the cleaning crew\u00a0is right there in the building and we can usually\u00a0request cleaning at almost a moment&#8217;s notice.<\/p>\n<p>[Out of\u00a0curiosity, obviously not financial acumen,\u00a0I did ask the hotel if there was a &#8216;package&#8217; available where we could use their sheets and towels and get weekly or bi-weekly\u00a0cleaning to change the bed and bathroom\u00a0linens. It turns out that\u00a0they don&#8217;t do this for\u00a0tenants who reside here permanently. So, alas, we are left to\u00a0change, launder\u00a0and store our own linens&#8230; and no pillow mints. Woe is us. :)]<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Benefit of Condotel Living #3: Visitors<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Putting up overnight guests in <em>most<\/em> tiny living situations is challenging. However, in a hotel, they can stay right next door!<\/p>\n<p>While obviously that means shelling out dough occasionally (at least if you want to be generous), it is\u00a0usually still a heck of a lot cheaper than the year long expenses you&#8217;d accrue from owning or renting\u00a0a multi-bedroom, stand-alone\u00a0house, especially\u00a0if you live in an urban area. Though many guests when visiting from out of town will pay for their own hotel rooms anyway, making this a great way to be close to your\u00a0visitors instead of a car ride away&#8230; And you get to keep your privacy!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Benefit of Condotel Living #4: Socializing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is a prime building for corporate stays because of the kitchenettes and location.\u00a0In the summer it is packed with out-of-towners and tourists. While many people\u00a0may find this annoying, we are very social and\u00a0<i>love<\/i> talking to new\u00a0people. Every elevator ride is an opportunity for a\u00a0fun conversation.<\/p>\n<p>I also\u00a0love telling people that (supposedly) the building is haunted and watching their expressions. :)<\/p>\n<p>[I&#8217;m not sure if I believe in ghosts or not, but while living here one really weird thing happened. I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth and the lights just went out all of a sudden. It wasn&#8217;t a power outage, and the switch had actually moved to the down, &#8216;off&#8217; position! That was really eerie because it doesn&#8217;t toggle easily, nor was it loose. But so far that is the only thing I have experienced here.]<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Benefit of Condotel Living #5: Amenities<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Some condos have these same\u00a0amenities, but\u00a0they are usually in pricier buildings. Our building has a full service spa with massage, hair cut\/color, makeup, facials, etc&#8230; It also has\u00a0a gym,\u00a0tailor\u00a0and a\u00a0restaurant\/bar. This makes winter living more enjoyable. There is also 24 hour concierge and everyone is super friendly.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing it is missing, in my\u00a0opinion,\u00a0is a coffee shop, but there are plenty others in the area within a few blocks walking distance. It would also be nice to have a pool, or even just\u00a0a\u00a0public lounge or exterior space to hang out in and be social. But, again, that would\u00a0probably hike up costs to the owners, and there is a huge park literally across the street.<\/p>\n<p><strong>J. Money asked me if we end up spending more money since we have all these amenities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fortunately we have good self control to\u00a0not\u00a0get\u00a0lured into the restaurant and bar\u00a0too often, but it is nice to know it is there and they do have good weekly specials and friendly people.\u00a0I enjoy having the salon\u00a0so close for my highlights, but I cut my own hair, so the costs don&#8217;t add up too much. I do, however,\u00a0plan to spend more money\u00a0at the\u00a0spa\u00a0in the winter getting massages when it is too cold to enjoy the outdoors.\u00a0:)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Another Cool Use For Your Condotel&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We live near a major hospital and when we travel, we\u00a0would like to occasionally offer out\u00a0our room for free to people who might be visiting\u00a0for\u00a0an illness or a sick child. This is much harder to do with traditional real estate investing!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Condotels &amp; Pets?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Like many high density buildings, dogs are not allowed, but cats are. I have to say that I was surprised to hear that cats are allowed in a hotel building. Pretty cool. We want to travel though, so no cats in the near future for us.<\/p>\n<p>So, that&#8217;s it!<\/p>\n<p><b><em>What do you think?
