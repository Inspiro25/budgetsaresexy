This is where people tend to disagree with me out there, but since I&#8217;m the one getting emailed the questions I get to give out the opinions ;)<\/p>\n<p>I then sit back and enjoy seeing which route people end up choosing. Sometimes they go back and forth and end up doing a nice balance of both (50% debt paying and 50% saving), but usually one side wins out over the other. I think because it&#8217;s easier to focus solely on one and KILL IT rather than half it on both and take double the time. But again, either route is awesome and better than doing <em>none<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I often wonder afterwards, though, which side &#8211; indeed &#8211;  <em>IS<\/em> the easiest to accomplish?<\/strong> If you were forced to choose? Is it debt cuz you hate it so much and there&#8217;s an absolute number attached to it? Or is it savings cuz having tons of money in the bank is sexy as hell?? And it&#8217;s more fun to watch money pile up than go away??<\/p>\n<p>My personal answer usually goes back and forth all depending on my mood and stage of life at the time, but I have been seeing a common denominator that usually sways me: <em><strong>The number that&#8217;s attached to the goal<\/strong><\/em>. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily matter how big or small it is (although it does help &#8211; I&#8217;m much more likely to pick the tinier one than a large gargantuan one no matter which side of the debt\/savings fence it&#8217;s on!), but it&#8217;s more about the fact that it DOES have a number at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if someone told me I had to either &#8220;save for a rainy day&#8221; or pay off that $800 car bill, I&#8217;m choosing that $800 car bill all day long. I know the amount that it&#8217;s going to take and I can then figure out the best way to get there. Who knows how much that rain would cost? It could be $500 or it could be $5,000!  And without any solid number being clarified it&#8217;s hard as $hit to choose. At least for me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>I NEED NUMBERS!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s how I usually pick the side to shoot for. The goals that have an end point that I can understand and work towards. All those vague ones go out the window and I just never know where &#8211; or how &#8211; to start! Which means <strong><em>Savings is usually harder to do for me<\/em><\/strong> since Debt almost always has an ending number.<\/p>\n<p>Now if BOTH sides had a number attached, and it was the same number, then we have a ballgame ;) And in which case I revert back to my trusty &#8220;which makes me feel better?&#8221; deciding factor assuming most of the interest percentages weren&#8217;t drastically different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Knowing that I can be an odd ball out, though, I decided to dig in deeper and do some extra research<\/strong> for once to see what others think about this. And by &#8220;research&#8221; I mean &#8220;post the question on <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/budgetsaresexy\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Budgets-Are-Sexy\/68302201559\">Facebook<\/a>&#8221; haha&#8230; How can you beat real-time thoughts from real-life people?? :) I don&#8217;t need no stinkin&#8217; scientific polls to solve this debate for me &#8211; they&#8217;re always skewed anyways!<\/p>\n<h2>Here are what the people of Twitter chimed in with:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@tammycrowley: saving money<\/li>\n<li>@mrsmoneym:  &#8230;I think saving money is harder. It&#8217;s no longer an emergency.<\/li>\n<li>@iHeartBudgets: Paying off debt for me. I can save and save, but actually pulling the trigger to put that money on debt is TOUGH!<\/li>\n<li>@lelandstrott: Since I have debt, saving money is harder. I want to put every extra penny toward paying that off.<\/li>\n<li>@MsWalton: Saving money.<\/li>\n<li>@kelligrant: Saving. Debt, you have min monthly due, being in red freakier. No forced savings and easy to see $ as waiting to be spent.<\/li>\n<li>@jjeffrose: paying off debt was harder for me. Mostly because I was in denial that the debt I had was wrong<\/li>\n<li>@BryanMarsden: Paying off debt. I have all my savings automated to avoid the stupid side of my brain. :P<\/li>\n<li>@MyFinancialRoad: definitely saving money. You can be motivated to break debt but saving $100 feels like saving $1 whereas spending $100=death<\/li>\n<li>@HassleFreeSaver: Saving money for sure. I think saving is seen as optional whereas paying off debt is seen as required.<\/li>\n<li>@EmpoweredDollar: Saving money is harder while I&#8217;m paying off debt. I end up dipping into my savings to get rid of my loans faster!<\/li>\n<li>@alexproaps: Saving money, &#8220;paying myself&#8221; monthly for a future purchase is harder. I want to be debt free &amp; see that 0 balance!<\/li>\n<li>@Sustainlifeblog: saving b\/c interest rates are so low. debt is scary, not having savings is not AS scary.<\/li>\n<li>@meimur: Saving $! I don&#8217;t carry a balance on my CC, but still don&#8217;t have enough at the end of the month to put into savings.<\/li>\n<li>@RamblingsbyRach: Debt! My student loans are endless and the interest really makes progress difficult.<\/li>\n<li>@ontargetcoach: I believe it&#8217;s the same muscle, just flexed differently.<\/li>\n<li>@RedDebted: Definitely saving. Once you submit a payment, it&#8217;s done! With saving you need more self control&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>@Howieinqiri: for me it is saving money. Especially since what I want to save usually goes towards student loans.<\/li>\n<li>@moteviolence: Saving money is harder!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So it looks like my friends from Twitter think <em><strong>saving money is harder too<\/strong><\/em>. Tons of GREAT points up there yeah? I especially like the ones on being scary and how savings isn&#8217;t a &#8220;requirement,&#8221; even though we all know it should be.<\/p>\n<h2>Now here is what Facebook said:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Agatha Kulesza &#8212; Hmmmm&#8230;.for me the hardest part was the mental shift I had to go through to make saving money a priority over paying off debt. So when I was really obsessed with paying off debt it was hard to save money, but when I shifted focus to paying myself first &amp; making it a priority saving money became easy. Does this solve the debate for all eternity? Probably not. But&#8230;..<\/li>\n<li>Eric Rosenberg &#8212; Saving money is tougher, particularly when you don&#8217;t have a specific goal. When you are paying off debt, there is always an end in sight. When saving, you are dealing with a lifelong task.<\/li>\n<li>Leigh Morlock &#8212; Saving money.<\/li>\n<li>Dawn Allcot &#8212; Saving for sure, mostly for the reasons Eric stated above. Also, seeing that nice lump sum in my bank account just makes me want to SPEND it, whereas seeing a zero balance on my credit card makes me NOT want to use it.<\/li>\n<li>Jennie LeAnne &#8212; I think it is the type of dept. For me the dept part is harder but that is because my only dept is my mortgage and the goal of paying it off seems so far away at the moment. On the other hands, saving with specific goals in mind has me much more motivated.<\/li>\n<li>Trinnie Schley &#8212; Saving money! Paying off debt was easy for us&#8230;but now with no debt, it&#8217;s hard to not use the extra moeny as disposable income. I need to set it aside<\/li>\n<li>Jill Cohen Heineck &#8212; Saving money!

When you&#8217;re paying off debt, you know what finite number you have to hit. Savings is a bit more difficult for people to plan. Depending on what you&#8217;re saving for, it can be more difficult to pick a nice, round number to save. So when you have a monthly payment for student loans, you know what you need to pay. When you decide it&#8217;s time to save for retirement, well, you have to do some math.
