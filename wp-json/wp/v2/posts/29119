Most bloggers write because they want to make money, or are embarking on a journey to get out of debt, and they are passionate enough about their finances to share their own experiences.<\/p>\n<p>I write because I have already made my money (I made <em><strong>$7 million in just 7 years<\/strong><\/em>, starting $30,000 in debt) but found, as I was on my own\u00a0financial\u00a0journey, that most of the advice in the books and blogs on offer was either wrong or\u00a0outright\u00a0dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>Wrong, because most personal\u00a0finance\u00a0advice is designed to make you frugal and debt free \u2013 not wealthy. Dangerous, because you need to amass a much larger fortune than most bloggers and authors will have you believe is necessary, if you want to enjoy life beyond work. Aim too low and you\u2019ll end up working for 40 years or more, only to live the rest of your life in virtual poverty, relying on government handouts to supplement your meager retirement income.<\/p>\n<p>So, here are some of the more popular myths of personal finance that I resolved to bust:<\/p>\n<h2>The Millionaire Myth<\/h2>\n<p>Fortunately, the myth that you can retire comfortably on a million dollars is a fairly easy one to discredit with some simple mathematics (stick with me on this). In fact, becoming a millionaire in your lifetime is going to be easy &#8230; too easy:<\/p>\n<p>If you start off earning $25,000 a year and work for 40 years (earning around $80k in your last pre-retirement year), and save just 10% of your annual salary (earning 8% on your money), you will have exactly $1,000,000 when you retire.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you will be used to living on $72k p.a. ($80k less 10% set aside for savings) by then, but &#8211; assuming a 4% &#8216;safe&#8217;\u00a0withdrawal\u00a0rate &#8211; $1 million will only give you half of that to live off.<\/p>\n<p>Now, $36,000 a year without working may sound tempting, until you factor in the effects of inflation which tends to double the cost of living every 20 years. This means that your $36k retirement salary is worth less then $9,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars!<\/p>\n<p>So, you\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">will<\/span>\u00a0be a millionaire in your lifetime, but that is hardly the point!<\/p>\n<h2>The &#8216;Bad Debt&#8217; Myth<\/h2>\n<p>The most common and costly mistake that personal finance bloggers make is confusing <em>good<\/em> and <em>bad<\/em> debt with <em>cheap<\/em> and <em>expensive<\/em> debt.<\/p>\n<p>Because so many people have trapped themselves into credit card debt, which they\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">should<\/span>\u00a0pay off as quickly as possible because it\u2019s just so expensive, they have been lead to believe by so many financial pundits that they should pay off\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">all<\/span>\u00a0of their debt, including their mortgages.<\/p>\n<p>For most people, this is actually a huge mistake.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, they should first pay off\u00a0<em>expensive<\/em>\u00a0debt (such as credit cards, and auto loans) as quickly as possible. But, as soon as their remaining loans (such as student loans and home mortgages) are at a lower after-tax interest rate than, say, the cost of an investment loan (such as you might get to buy an investment property), why pay it off just to take out a bigger, more expensive investment loan later?<\/p>\n<h2>The &#8216;Emergency Fund&#8217; Myth<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s become popular for personal finance authors to promote the idea of putting cash aside to deal with life&#8217;s little emergencies &#8211; 3 months salary or $10,000 seems to be popular choices amongst bloggers.<\/p>\n<p>But does putting aside $10,000 cash make financial sense? First, let&#8217;s assume that this fund is big enough to cover all likely emergencies.<\/p>\n<p>Haven\u2019t you just created your worst case outcome? Haven\u2019t you just depleted your investment fund by $10k? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to instead invest that $10k so that it is always working for you, earning a return, whether there is an emergency (very unlikely) or no emergency (very likely)?<\/p>\n<p>To protect yourself in the unlikely event of an emergency, you could simply create a source of money that you can tap into\u00a0only when needed\u00a0(e.g. a line of credit against your home; a redraw facility against your 401k; a 0% APR credit card, sitting there \u2013 unused \u2013 just for this purpose).<\/p>\n<h2>A 2-Step Plan For Wealth<\/h2>\n<p>If these myths &#8211; and, others &#8211; need to be broken, what should you put in their place? Well, it starts with understanding &#8211; if retiring with $1 million isn&#8217;t sufficient &#8211; just how much is enough?<\/p>\n<p>That answer will differ for everybody, but I\u2019m guessing that if you are just starting your working life, you will want many times the $9,000 per year in today\u2019s spending power that $1 million in 40 years actually delivers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And, the only way that you will amass that kind of wealth is to:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Increase Your Income<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Actively<\/em>\u00a0<em>Invest<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Saving money is far less important than <strong>increasing your income<\/strong>, simply because &#8211; as your income increases &#8211; you will have more to save. For example, you should be able to save 10% of your current income, but saving 50% is almost impossible without making dramatic sacrifices to your lifestyle. Yet, continuing to save 10% (or, whatever your current rate of saving is) and saving 50% of any future <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">increase in income<\/span> should be far less traumatic, yet your overall savings will increase dramatically.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And, you should also be\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">actively<\/span>\u00a0working on your investments:<\/strong> my rule of thumb is that<strong>\u00a0<em>75% of your net worth<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0should always be working for you, at the best possible after tax interest rate.<\/p>\n<p>For example, why put your money into a CD at 2% (or less) or an Index Fund at 7% (over a long enough timeframe) when $10,000 invested at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>15% (direct stocks) grows to $35,000 after just 10 years<\/li>\n<li>30% (real-estate) grows to $106,000 after just 10 years<\/li>\n<li>50% (business) grows to $384,000 after just 10 years<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, you will need to learn a lot and work hard to get anywhere close to these kinds of returns, but if you increase\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">both<\/span>\u00a0the amount that you invest\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and<\/span>\u00a0the rate of return, over a 20 to 40 year working life, you can safely expect far more than the typical financial blogger will have you ever believe is possible.<\/p>\n<h2>**Giving Away 2 Copies of Adrian&#8217;s New Book!**<\/h2>\n<p>Like what Adrian had to say?

Which most people also can&#8217;t do &#8211; myself included (though it would certainly be financially smarter to do so). So yeah, by all means shoot for hitting $7 million+ and follow these steps when you&#8217;re ready to up your game, but in the beginning at least I still think it&#8217;s smart to pay attention to your emergency funds and mortgage debts\/etc. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with going for the gold once you have a great foundation down, and you don&#8217;t want to get overwhelmed before you even get started! Overall an interesting take on things though, and I greatly appreciate the fresh perspective here. Thanks again Adrian, and congrats on the book!]<\/p>\n<p><strong>PS:<\/strong> Also?
