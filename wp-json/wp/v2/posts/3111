Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So when you&#8217;re done reading, maybe you can chime in and offer some words of wisdom yourself?\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure our reader would appreciate it &#8211; always good to get varying ideas on this stuff, esp since it&#8217;s a major decision!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the question from Mr. Future Homeowner, followed by my response below:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of questions like this lately, so I thought I&#8217;d share my thoughts on it via this &#8220;Help a reader&#8221; post<\/p>\n<p>I have a full time job as a video editor, working for a professional  football team. My salary is low 30&#8217;s, but they pay for great  health\/dental\/vision insurance, my cell phone, and I basically eat two  out of the three meals of the day there. I contribute 5% of my income  into my 401k and recently I started an emergency fund with a high yield  savings account online (1.30%). My car is paid for (I got it when I was  16 as a gift from my parents) and it is in pretty decent shape.<\/p>\n<p>The things I pay for include rent, some utilities, gas, and the  occasional trip to the grocery store. I have about $8,000 in college  loans and that is the only &#8220;debt&#8221; I have. Of course, when I&#8217;m not  working crazy hours, I do try to have some fun. :)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m single, I&#8217;m 25, and I&#8217;ve been pondering the idea of purchasing my  own home. The main reason is because I hate the fact that I&#8217;m basically  throwing my hard earned money away paying a quarter of my monthly  earnings for rent. I feel that I would much rather be putting that money  into something I can OWN and build credit and of course, own my own  home!<\/p>\n<p>My question is this: According to my budget, I should have my college  loans paid off in about 2.5 years. Do you think it would be wise to wait  until I pay off my college loans, build up a savings account, and then  buy a place of my own? Or&#8230; do you think it would be possible to  purchase my own home and still pay the mortgage and college loans at the  same time.<\/p>\n<p>In April, I finally paid off two large credit cards that I had from  college and now I am saving that money that I would be paying for a  credit card.<\/p>\n<p>I have read so many different things on this subject and it makes my head spin!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I agree &#8211; it makes my head spin  too! And unfortunately there&#8217;s\u00a0 no &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer here &#8211; just the one  that YOU are comfortable with, ya know?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros to buying now:<\/strong> Prices are CHEAP!\u00a0 Mortgage rates are CHEAP! So  if you know you want to live in an area for at least 3-5 years, then  it&#8217;s a most excellent time to buy. <em>Update: <\/em>Can also deduct all that interest!\u00a0 Which is a biggie, can&#8217;t believe I forgot about that one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cons to buying now:<\/strong> Credit is MUCH  tighter, you&#8217;re now in $xxx,xxx amount of more debt, you have to fix  everything yourself (lots of $$), and you&#8217;re &#8220;stuck&#8221; in one place.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are plenty more variables out there as you know, but those are  the ones that go through MY mind when I think of this stuff.\u00a0 Personally, I want nothing more than to sell mine and go back to  renting :)\u00a0 But then again <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/02\/its-official-our-house-is-upside-down\/\">I overpaid<\/a> and bought way too much space when all I  needed was 1\/3 of it.\u00a0 I also have a problem staying in one spot  in general, but that&#8217;s a totally different story (military brat).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sooooooo, I&#8217;m probably the wrong person to ask about this cuz I&#8217;ll  try and convince you NOT to buy one yet ;) <\/strong> I&#8217;d also probably tell you to  save at least $10,000 in an emergency fund first too cuz houses are  mad expensive!\u00a0 And you&#8217;re on the hook for it all by yourself too. BUT, if you&#8217;re asking me for a financially factual answer, I say go for it.\u00a0 The  time is great for buying a house (esp your 1st since you don&#8217;t have to  worry about offloading one either), and it seems you have your head on  straight.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to find a realtor first, though, and get pre-approved so you know  *exactly* how much house you can afford (within your budget!!!)). And also so you know what your average monthly payments will be around. Be sure to  add in extra for homeowner&#8217;s insurance, a few hundred for maintenance,  and also condo\/home association fees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then try pretending  paying this mortgage for 3-6 months so you know what it&#8217;ll be like!<\/strong> If you&#8217;re  spending $500 renting, and your mortgage is $1,000, send an extra $500  every month into your savings account.\u00a0 After a few months you&#8217;ll see if  it&#8217;s worth it or not and if you can handle it :)<\/p>\n<p>So basically, follow your heart. I couldn&#8217;t get convinced  NOT to buy when I really wanted to, but if i had to go back I would have  paid more attention and bought a place at least 1\/2 as much.\u00a0 There&#8217;s no rush &#8211; better to get it straight the first time and be 100%  comfortable with it.\u00a0 The more you spend on a house, the more you now  have to be on the hook for which cramps your lifestyle &#8211; esp as a single  gent such as yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a couple other posts sorta relating to this if you need more:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/01\/pay-off-student-loans-or-save-for-house\/\">Pay off student loans, or save for a house?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/02\/we-got-milked-for-24000-last-year-how\/\">We got milked for $24,000 last year. How about you?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em><strong>And remember, nothing&#8217;s permanent.<\/strong><\/em> If you change your mind either  way  later, that&#8217;s OK!!!\u00a0 Mistakes are much easier to overcome when you&#8217;re young.<\/p>\n<p>-J$<br \/>\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/danielsphotography\/\">Daniel Leininger<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time to help a reader out!
