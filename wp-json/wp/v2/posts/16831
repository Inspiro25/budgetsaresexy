Money\" width=\"500\" height=\"217\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Yeah, as suspected we won&#8217;t be seeing any of that money I&#8217;m afraid.<\/strong> Turns out <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/03\/update-on-jackal-ex-employer\/\">the company<\/a> went bust and all the money in their accounts magically disappeared around the same time <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-court-has-spoken-j-money-wins\/\">we won the suit<\/a> (imagine that?). Not that there was much in there anyways from what my sources say, but when the court order takes 6 WEEKS to push through, it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re doing anyone favors by giving the accused PLENTY OF TIME to move it all out and away from you. Freakin&#8217; crazy man&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So it just goes to show that even when you WIN sometimes, you&#8217;re still never guaranteed your payouts. Which luckily we all kinda knew in our heads anyways throughout this whole process, so it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s too much of a surprise for any of us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But you know what? I still felt DAMN GOOD to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-court-has-spoken-j-money-wins\/\">stick it to them<\/a>!!<\/strong> The $100 I put into fighting the case (and the joy of standing my ground on the court stand &#8211; something I&#8217;ve always wanted to try one day! Haha&#8230;) was well worth the time and effort put into it all. I may not have come away w\/ my $6,000 owed to me ($3k from my last paycheck, and $3k for all the fines for illegally not paying me) but at least it&#8217;s down there in the record books and I can now move forward knowing it&#8217;s all over.<\/p>\n<p>And honestly, I got away with a LOT less hurt than some of my older colleagues that stuck around after I got laid off. I was fortunate enough to only lose <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/01\/its-official-my-ex-employer-is-bananas\/\">ONE paycheck<\/a>, but some of the rest that continued on were out 2-4 MONTHS worth! Can you imagine that $hit?? We&#8217;re talking thousands and thousands of dollars there &#8211; One exec is out over $75k herself (when commissions and fines were all calculated in). That&#8217;s just insane balls. But even crazier that you would stick AROUND that long after all the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/01\/its-official-my-ex-employer-is-bananas\/\">nonsense<\/a> that had been going down. I put up with a lot at that place, but I&#8217;ve never gone 3 weeks w\/out getting paid &#8212; I think that was my limit. But then again when you&#8217;re dealing with sociopaths (and I don&#8217;t use that term lightly), it&#8217;s pretty easy to be convinced everything&#8217;s going to be fine after a while. I was tricked for a while too! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So anyways, that&#8217;s the update on that guy.<\/strong> Almost 10 months on the dot when this nonsense <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\">first started<\/a>, and here we are with a win under our belt but a loss in our pockets. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything else we could have done to affect the outcome though, so at least that&#8217;s comforting. Just goes to show life&#8217;s not fair sometimes. And even the simplest things, like getting your paycheck, are never guaranteed. Not to scare you or anything :) Just remember to always keep your eyes open as you never know what those loony companies are up to&#8230; even the good ones can turn on their people.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>FYI:<\/strong> The company I worked for was a startup &#8211; which is always way more unstable than &#8220;normal&#8221; jobs. Not to say the larger guys are way more better or anything, but just that there are a lot more risks (and rewards!) with smaller off the ground companies. At least the big ones usually follow the law ;)<\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/vxla\/\">vxla<\/a> &#8211; design by J$)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yeah, as suspected we won&#8217;t be seeing any of that money I&#8217;m afraid.
