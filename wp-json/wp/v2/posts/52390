Obviously not going to be for everyone, so if you&#8217;re already hating this and\/or offended, please avert your eyes now and wait for our normal posts come Monday! There&#8217;s nothing graphic here, but of course it&#8217;s a post on having sex for money and will most definitely turn people off :) If you&#8217;re curious about other lifestyles though, and ever wondered how people end up down paths like these as well as how much they get paid (!), then keep reading as it&#8217;ll def. accomplish that.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>As told by my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Lance_Finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lance<\/a> who volunteers his time working at local prisons.<\/em> <em>You might remember him from the first confessional we did on that guy who <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/financial-confessions-i-became-so-obsessed-with-being-rich-that-im-now-sitting-in-prison\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">became a millionaire embezzling money from his company<\/a>, only to eventually get caught in the end as well. Once again proving time and again how powerful money can be, for the better or the worse!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***********<\/p>\n<p><strong>My life radically changed one and a half years ago while a sophomore in college.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was studying to get a communications degree in marketing and sales, but to be honest I wasn\u2019t really sure what I wanted to do yet in life. I grew up in Riverside, California and moved to Colorado to go to school. Little did I know that one night and one conversation would change so much of my life.<\/p>\n<p>I stopped working for $11 an hour at the school book store and started \u201cworking\u201d for hundreds of dollars an hour\u2026 as an escort.<\/p>\n<h2>How It All Started<\/h2>\n<p>My friends and I would meet up at my house just off campus each Friday night after class. We would hang out and have dinner and then go out to dance and play. On occasion we would run into another group of girls and hang out together. They were a lot of fun and we all became friends. I noticed time and time again that one of the girls always had a new outfit and handbag.<\/p>\n<p>I sat down next to her on the couch and joked around with her one night and said, \u201cI want to go shopping with you sometime!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She replied to me, \u201cLet\u2019s do it, I go every single week!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYour credit card bill must be insane!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo credit cards, no daddy, just cash,\u201d she told me and off she went back to dance leaving me to wonder how she had so much money as a college student.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the night, as we headed home, I tried to catch up to her and asked her where she worked and she said, \u201cAll over the place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>She smiled and got into the car with her friends. A little later that night she texted me and said to come by her place Sunday afternoon.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I showed up to her house and her roommates said that they thought she was still asleep. I went upstairs to her room and knocked on her door and actually woke her up. It was 3 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>She sat up in bed and said that she had been working all night long and got home just after breakfast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo you work nights?\u201d I asked.<\/p>\n<p>She crawled out of bed and went over to her laptop and told me to come over.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI made $2,100 last night,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>She then pulled up a website and there she was in multiple selfies posing in lingerie and showing off her body and long blonde hair. She called herself Nickie in her ad and said that she was ready to help guys release the stress from their lives and could discretely make their worries disappear, or something to that manner. It said to call or text her, but no free pictures and no dirty talk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>She said she was strictly an escort and charged $200 for a half-hour or $300 for an hour for her \u201ccompanionship.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was shocked.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a prostitute?\u201d I remember questioning loudly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an escort and I met up with three guys last night. Two businessmen in town at their hotels, and then stayed overnight with one of my regulars at his vacation home,\u201d Nickie said. \u201cI get $,1500 for staying overnight.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She walked over to her drawer and opened it up and pulled out a pile of cash.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just last night; we should go and buy something.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We went to Nordstrom (always my weakness) and she picked up a new Michael Kors hand bag.<\/p>\n<h2>Never In My Dreams<\/h2>\n<p>I left Nickie after we grabbed a bite to eat, and just sat there on my bed not being able to get our conversation out of my head. I remember thinking about all the money she had and how easy it seemed for her, but most of all how it didn\u2019t seem to bother her at all. She made more in a night than I did part-time in months. I had bombarded her with questions while shopping and at dinner.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you get into this?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have you been doing this?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDoes anyone else know?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you grossed out by the old guys?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you scared when you show up?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of picking up an STD?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAre you afraid of getting arrested?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow much money have you made?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nickie said that she had all the same questions as well. It was a former roommate of hers that introduced her to it when she was invited to go along as a second woman on a \u201cdate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She said that she had met up with dozens of men and even a few couples. She said at this point she had many regulars that she saw once a week or once a month. Most of them were businessmen who would text her during the day and ask if they could meet up on their way home from work. On occasion it was just a lonely guy who had no chance at bars. A quick rendezvous and she had a couple hundred bucks. Nickie figured she had made over six-figures the last two years.<\/p>\n<h2>Making the Jump<\/h2>\n<p>I didn\u2019t get into it right away. My biggest concern was about who would be on the other side of the door. I didn\u2019t want to go out one night and never be heard of ever again.<\/p>\n<p>Nickie said that it was ultimately up to me who I would meet with and I could be independent or work with an agency.\u00a0 She was independent, but got called all the time by agencies and pimps trying to get her to work for them. They promised her more money and a driver to take her around to clients while protecting her. She decided to go it alone after talking to others.<\/p>\n<p>Nickie only met up with guys 40 and older. She said young guys are largely punks (and they are) whereas there are a lot of older guys who just need some company who are divorced or guys that just want a break from their life. She also said that there are tons of guys that travel into town for conventions and work that look for a quick hook-up while they are away from home.<\/p>\n<p>After a couple more conversations with her I finally decided to give it a shot. I wanted to make thousands of dollars just like her.<\/p>\n<h2>My First Ad<\/h2>\n<p>I took so many pictures and spent so much time writing my first ad. I love taking pictures of myself, but it is awkward to take pictures half naked and then post them online. What if my mom saw it or my little brother? Even more awkward was trying to figure out a price of what your body is worth. I called myself Monica.<\/p>\n<p>I got a burner phone and set up a message like Nickie had recommended \u201cHi boys, I\u2019ve been waiting for your call, I\u2019m excited to see you soon. Keep calling.\u201d You can\u2019t go and meet with clients and have your phone buzzing and ringing all night so I just tell them to keep calling and I can answer in between visits.<\/p>\n<p>I quickly found out that guys don\u2019t read the ads as much as they look at pictures. I changed my hair color to blonde because Nickie said that blondes generally can charge more money and they are in more demand. I put the same price as Nickie for my time with $200 for a half-hour and $300 for an hour. I also upsell them as well once I\u2019m in the room with them, especially young guys.<\/p>\n<p>I got arrested during a sting about seven months into it at a hotel because I got sloppy and didn\u2019t verify a guy who said he was just in town on business. But stings don\u2019t happen too often because police simply don\u2019t have the time and resources to keep up. It\u2019s just a class B misdemeanor for prostitution and a $1,000 fine, but when you make twice that on a Friday or Saturday night it\u2019s not enough to stop the business.<\/p>\n<h2>The Tricks of the Trade<\/h2>\n<p>You can\u2019t just call and show up and drop your pants. For some girls there is a two-step verification process to protect ourselves from psychos. We give you an address to show up to, and then once you arrive we give you the <em>real<\/em> address.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer to only verify guys online or from references from other girls they have been with. Some guys freak out that we want their real name and where they work or even their LinkedIn profile, but we have to watch out for ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>When you show up to our place that is called an &#8220;in&#8221; call. I used to do that for a while when I got my own apartment, but got tired of changing out the sheets four or five times a day and showering four or five times a day and doing my hair and makeup over and over again. I wasn\u2019t making as much money working that way.<\/p>\n<p>I found I made more money with less clients on &#8220;out&#8221; calls, which meant going to hotels where I could get bigger money and bigger tips or gifts from my regular clients. Business guys just had more money, and often wanted to spend less time together. They had no drama and didn\u2019t cling to me, just sex and back out the door.<\/p>\n<p>Some guys did request for me to show up to their house and I never like walking down the hall past the family pictures or seeing the happy couple\u2019s pictures staring back at me right next to the bed, but it\u2019s the man\u2019s decision to cheat and not mine and I am not picky over money. It\u2019s all cash in my hand at the end of the night.<\/p>\n<h2>My First Time<\/h2>\n<p>My first client was a divorced man in his 50\u2019s. He was a lot older than anyone I had ever been with before. He called just an hour or so after I posted my first ad on BackPage.com (which has recently been shut down \u2013 like other national escort ads places), but there are plenty of other local sites to advertise, plus most of my business comes from regulars after a few months, so I didn\u2019t need to always advertise. Some girls run their own escort web sites.<\/p>\n<p>He called me and said he was in town on business for a few days and wanted me to come to his hotel downtown. He gave me some times to see what worked for me and I verified who he was online and I got ready and headed downtown. My heart pounded so hard after the phone call. Was I really going to go through with this? I nearly passed out from anxiety as I headed up the elevator. I walked down the hallway and stood in front of the door. I just stood there and couldn\u2019t bring myself to knock on the door. Finally \u201cJim\u201d opened the door without me knocking.<\/p>\n<p>He was a quiet, balding man who looked older than my dad. He invited me in and I asked him where the money was at (Nickie always said to ask right away and if you didn\u2019t see it to walk out). He pointed over by the TV and I went to count the money and there was $300 in twenties. I placed it in my bag and asked Jim to go get in the shower and to brush his teeth. That\u2019s all I share about my first time or any other time other than most older guys are really hairy and kind of gross, but like Nickie mentioned they are more polite and respectful than younger guys. I can deal with a fatter bald guy than a total a-hole with rock hard abs. Like Nickie, I don\u2019t meet with anyone younger than 40 anymore.<\/p>\n<h2>The Money<\/h2>\n<p>The money is amazing. It has to be for putting yourself through the mental and physical anguish a couple nights a week. I\u2019ve never had so much money so fast. If it was harder to get, I would have quit a long time ago. I spent it just as fast I brought it in the first few months. I was in the mall a few times a week picking up anything I wanted. I splurged going on vacations and ski trips. I felt like I could do anything I wanted and that I deserved it because of what I had to go through to get it.<\/p>\n<p>On occasion some men would ask for me to stay the weekend with them for a ski trip or work convention, and I would stay at the hotel and they would pay for spa and massages and I could order room service while they were off in their meetings. Sometimes they would leave cash to go shopping as well.<\/p>\n<p>I charged thousands of dollars for a weekend getaway. Sometimes it was actually fun to go out of town and be treated well and come away with so much money. Sometimes it was boring as hell getting stuck with someone with no personality and pretending to like them for a few days, but the money made it tolerable. I dreaded going to dinner for their work parties because a barely 20 year old girl with an old guy makes people assume I was being paid to be there. And even though I was, I still didn\u2019t like being dressed down by the other women.<\/p>\n<h2>The A-Holes<\/h2>\n<p>On occasion some men treat you like $hit. I\u2019m not here to say that being an escort is an amazing job and everything goes great because it doesn\u2019t. I know others who have been physically assaulted and come home with bruises everywhere. I\u2019ve been lucky for the most part. But on occasion there are a-holes who think because they pay you they can do whatever they want to you and threaten to call the police if you don\u2019t do what they want. I don\u2019t have many bad experiences, but have been abused a few times, more emotionally and verbally than physically.<\/p>\n<p>There are nights I have come back home wondering what I am doing and saying I\u2019m never going to do it again. I didn\u2019t want to do this forever and lately I find there are a lot more girls getting into the business which has created a lot of competition, at least in my area. Younger, taller and bigger boobs are tough to compete with. I\u2019ve lost a few of my regulars who want to try someone new, and I\u2019ve lost out on some other big money that used to come in each month too. The better the economy the more money there is to be made, especially in big cities, and the more folks are jumping in the escort business.<\/p>\n<h2>Tons of Fake Pictures Online \/ Girls That Rob<\/h2>\n<p>The interesting thing about the business of escorting is that most of the girls online are total fakes. If you see a super-hot girl in Denver, chances are that her pictures also show up on sites in Vegas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and more.<\/p>\n<p>Girls post hot pictures and often times someone else shows up. Bait and switch happens all the time, or the pictures are a few years old when they were 15-20 pounds lighter.<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned upselling as well. Be aware that girls will come in and drop our clothes, and then tell you if you want more than a nice look you\u2019re going to have to pay extra. We\u2019re sales people, and if you want more then you have to pay for it.<\/p>\n<p>Also be aware that you shouldn\u2019t have any other cash lying around or a wallet in the open, because when you are told to get in the shower, that girl might just go through your room and clean it out and be out the door before you know it. I\u2019ve had several guys tell me stories of them being ripped off. I don\u2019t feel sorry for them, but it is what it is, we all take our chances with strangers.<\/p>\n<p>I was flirty and pretended to like all the guys, but the sex is rarely good and I\u2019ve had guys ask me to run away with them and tell me they are in love. Really? You don\u2019t love me, you love my body, how can you love when you are likely cheating? I play along because I just care about your cash and not you. I am using you as well. Most of you are out of shape, old and not overly attractive, and yes you have money but besides that our relationship when you think about it is just ugly.<\/p>\n<p>All in all I have over $35,000 saved in the bank. While I splurged the first few months, I started to get smart and save so I wouldn\u2019t have to do this all through school. I liked the money, I liked the lifestyle when pampered, but it had to end at some point. I lose out on time with friends because the best nights for money are the weekends. I\u2019d like to think I could have a normal relationship someday as well.<\/p>\n<h2>The Rest of the Story<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;Monica&#8221; is currently out of the business and out of school, having just been released from prison (again) for prostitution, and this time cocaine distribution as well. (This is where I met her, since my wife and I work as volunteers in the prison system).<\/p>\n<p>One client, who Monica wouldn\u2019t get into details about, invited her to do cocaine with him. She had never done major drugs, and after more visits with this same client started offering cocaine to other clients as an upsell option. She was caught during a sting operation with police, and picked up her second misdemeanor charge of prostitution and a 2nd degree felony distribution charge for the cocaine. She was fined $3,500 and faced up to one-year in prison, but was released after 60 days.<\/p>\n<p><span id=\"m_7093495942307575165gmail-docs-internal-guid-472681e4-e617-25e2-5087-068c9d3c7409\">Shortly upon her release, Monica moved into a house with two other women. After entering the house they were confronted by eight men, several of which pulled out guns and said they were taking them to Arizona &#8220;to work for them.&#8221; One of the women texted a friend and police arrived a few minutes later. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span id=\"m_7093495942307575165gmail-docs-internal-guid-472681e4-e617-25e2-5087-068c9d3c7409\">The men attempted to run away, and one of them fired off a shot as he ran out the door. The bullet missed everyone, but lodged into the drywall about a foot away from Monica.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"m_7093495942307575165gmail-docs-internal-guid-472681e4-e617-25e2-5087-068c9d3c7409\">She immediately went back to her place, packed up her things, and drove home to her parents where she is hoping to start her life completely over.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>*****<br \/>\n<em>Lance is a former blogger who loves to talk about money, but hates running a blog.
