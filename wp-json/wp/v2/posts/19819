Money was supposed to have this guest post by mid-summer.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>I quickly learned that the first hurdle to being an extreme couponer is having a life.<\/strong>\u00a0 I am not a stay at home mom who can devote 40 hours a week to clipping, comparing ads, and writing meticulous shopping spreadsheets.\u00a0 I also have lots of non-coupony interests I enjoy doing in my off-work hours, such as blogging, seeing my friends, and occasionally getting some sleep.\u00a0 I refused to neglect these things because, well, they\u2019re kind of part of my life.\u00a0 That was my first mistake.<\/p>\n<p>Every time I <em>almost<\/em> got caught up organizing my coupons, another freakin\u2019 week of inserts arrived.\u00a0 This may not seem like much, but since I was dealing with several sets of inserts (see next section), things got out of hand fast.\u00a0 Every surface in my living room became covered with stacks of coupons (neatly grouped by category, of course) that just kept multiplying like Gremlins in a rainstorm.\u00a0 I began to loathe the sight of them.\u00a0 I still haven\u2019t quite gotten over it.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">END RESULT:<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0 Success, eventually, but a <em>huge<\/em> time-suck.\u00a0 Plus now a lingering sense of resentment towards Bertha and her contents.\u00a0 Not a good place to be in for a couponer.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: -7px;
