Listeners or readers would write in, guests would come on, and the same information was recycled and the same jargon extensively used. I heard questions like how to ask for a raise, advice on talking to your HR rep about your 401k option, tips on how millennials should cut out their daily latte, and questions like how to ask your parents for help with your six figure student loans.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>At no point did I see myself in any of the readers or listeners\u2019 questions, at no point did the guests offer actionable advice for someone like me, someone who had a career in the service industry.<\/strong> <\/em>At no point did a financial advisor ever give me their card and ask to sit down with me to discuss my investment strategy. Personal finance is personal, but in a space as large as this one, why wasn\u2019t I seeing any persons like me? As people we connect to the stories of other, and we do better when we understand what is possible in the context of our own worlds.<\/p>\n<p>Tipped, is my response to this void in the personal finance space \u2013 because your career is real, your money is real, and your future is real. Through real stories and service industry related analogies, Tipped will teach you how to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get started investing today\u2014and actually understand the world of investing<\/li>\n<li>Avoid industry specific pitfalls<\/li>\n<li>Budget while on a fluctuating income<\/li>\n<li>Develop creative ways to build an emergency fund<\/li>\n<li>Take your financial temperature<\/li>\n<li>Build your path to financial freedom<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>You can learn more\/buy here:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3WlSxwJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tipped<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;After the Death of Your Spouse&#8221;<br \/>\nNext Financial Steps for Surviving Spouses<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3FMDshI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66915\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book.png\" alt=\"after the death of your spouse\" width=\"338\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book.png 398w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book-187x300.png 187w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book-312x500.png 312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This book comes from <strong>Mike Piper<\/strong> over at the (incredibly helpful!) website, <a href=\"https:\/\/obliviousinvestor.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Oblivious Investor<\/a>, and was brought to my attention by a fellow reader, KT.

It&#8217;s a really helpful, tactical guide for getting through all the estate stuff and seems like a great companion for a legacy binder &#8211; I feel like you posted about those at some point??? Anyway, morbid subject, but I thought you might find it interesting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Indeed I had, and indeed I agree!<\/strong> You knock out this book AND a legacy binder and you are straight &#x1f525;&#x1f525;&#x1f525;.

Nothing could be more helpful during times of crisis, so if not now, at least put it on your radar to start working on later&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where you can find a few of these Legacy Binders:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ice-binder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Family Emergency Binder<\/a> ($39, robust, pretty)<\/li>\n<li>Free Legacy Binder (FREE, simple)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.erikdewey.com\/bigbookmkIV.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Big Book of Everything<\/a> (FREE, simple)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then here&#8217;s more about the book itself, via Mike&#8217;s website:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many surviving spouses find themselves overwhelmed by all the administrative and financial to-do items that have to be handled in the months after their spouse\u2019s death. There\u2019s a lot to do, and they\u2019re supposed to get it all done while grieving. And in many cases, the situation is made more difficult by the fact that the surviving spouse is not the one who regularly handled the household finances.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote this book to walk people through it, in plain language.

Robison<\/a> who was kind enough to ship me a copy! Bless her heart&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I asked her what she thought of it so far as I&#8217;m in the middle of three other books and don&#8217;t dare crack open a fourth yet!, and here&#8217;s what she responded with:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>The book is fabulous, like I thought it would be.<\/strong> It\u2019s also upsetting because the level of deceit and wrongdoing from corporations is staggering. The first section on the Big Four \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple \u2014 is particularly disturbing. How much they control our data is deeply troubling.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of what your FIRE readers might be interested in, Tellado gives information on how to protect yourself and your data. On the Financial Fairness chapter, your readers might be interested in hidden fees. They already know about avoiding payday loans, keeping up with student debt payments, and checking their credit report.<\/p>\n<p>Then, there\u2019s consumer action. Not normally in your wheelhouse, but, I\u2019d argue, something your readers need to know more about and participate in. The book also has something I\u2019ve never seen before: QR codes that take you to web pages. Amazing. Consumer Reports is such a large organization they can develop web materials based on her book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then here&#8217;s more about the book from Amazon:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve been getting ripped off.<\/p>\n<p>The rules that have protected consumers for decades are failing. Companies are spying on us. Many of the products we once trusted are dangerous and failing at alarming rates. Whether we are buying a crib, a small appliance, an iPhone app, or shopping for car insurance, it&#8217;s become harder than ever to know whether the choices we make in the marketplace are putting us at risk-either from physical harm or the abuse of our personal data by hackers or corporations.<\/p>\n<p>This is intolerable. It&#8217;s wrong. And we don&#8217;t have to put up with it anymore. Marta L. Tellado, the president and CEO of Consumer Reports, has been an advocate for consumers for decades. In Buyer Aware, Tellado shows you the steps you can take to protect yourself from predatory business practices, and how to exert your inherent power as a consumer to spur politicians and businesses to clean up their act. Only then can we ensure that we have an economy that is fair, safe, and transparent for all, and puts consumers first.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You can learn more\/pick up here:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3NweAN6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buyer Aware<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;Financial Feminist&#8221;<br \/>\nOvercome the Patriarchy&#8217;s Bullsh*t to Master Your Money and Build a Life You Love<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3DTqUDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66917\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-feminist-book.jpg\" alt=\"financial feminist book\" width=\"361\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-feminist-book.jpg 410w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-feminist-book-201x300.jpg 201w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-feminist-book-335x500.jpg 335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we got <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3DTqUDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Financial Feminism<\/a> from <strong>Tori Dunlap<\/strong> who&#8217;s freakin&#8217; EXPLODED on the scene these days and will probably not be slowing down anytime soon&#8230; (her company just crossed 7 figures in revenue &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/herfirst100K\/status\/1588288389304168448\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">in one month<\/a>!!).

As a kid, she watched her prudent parents balance their checkbook every month and learned to save for musical tickets by gathering pennies in an Altoids tin. But she quickly discovered that her experience with money was pretty unusual, especially among her female friends.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t our fault. Investigating this financial literacy and wealth gap, Tori found that girls are significantly less likely to receive a holistic financial education; we\u2019re taught to restrain our spending, while boys are taught about investing and rewarded for pursuing wealth. In adulthood, women are hounded by the unfounded stereotype of the frivolous spenders whose lattes are to blame for the wealth gap. And when something like, say, a global pandemic happens, we\u2019re the first to have jobs cut and the last to re-enter the workforce. It&#8217;s no wonder money is a source of anxiety and a barrier to equality for so many of us.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>But what if money didn&#8217;t mean restriction, and instead, choice? The ability to luxuriously travel, quit toxic jobs, donate to important organizations, retire early?
