This is based on a situation someone I know is dealing with currently&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Would you cosign a loan for your best friend so she can freeze her eggs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now before you say <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHell no!\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like I yelled immediately when I heard the question, listen to the full story first\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, here is the situation. Picture this&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your best friend calls you up one day asking for your help\u2026 She is 41 years old, super smart, has a great job, but hasn\u2019t been a great money saver in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than anything in the world, your friend wants to have a baby. But she hasn\u2019t met the right partner in life yet and is worried that her chances of getting pregnant naturally are shrinking as she gets older.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, she wants to have elective surgery to freeze her eggs, which costs about $30k.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, she has about $10k from savings and from her parents chipping in money, but she needs to borrow the additional $20k to have the surgery and whatnot paid for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few loan options available for the $20k\u2026 The first is just a personal loan from a bank, with interest rates around 7+%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, even better, there\u2019s a non-profit organization she found that will loan her $20k *interest free* on a 4-year term. This specific nonprofit was set up to help people with these types of charitable situations, so the $20k would be interest free and repayments would be $416 per month for 48 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is one problem though\u2026 This nonprofit does not take collateral for their loans. They REQUIRE someone else to cosign for every loan. That\u2019s the only way your friend can get the money interest free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, your friend is asking YOU to cosign for the $20k loan &#8211; so it will be interest free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Other relevant information<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason she can\u2019t have her parents cosign is because they don\u2019t have a strong relationship, and she was brought up to never discuss money with family.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she goes through with surgery, there is still no guarantee that it will result in a successful pregnancy later in life. Not to mention meeting the right partner and beginning a family.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freezing eggs not only has an upfront cost for surgery, there\u2019s also an ongoing fee for safe storage (about $1000 per year).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her car is paid off, and she has no other personal debts. From what I understand about her annual income\/expenses, $500 per month payments is completely doable.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did I mention this is your BEST friend? Like, as in, you grew up with her together and she means more to you than anyone else in the world. Deep down inside, you trust her.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soooo\u2026\u00a0 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given all this information, would you cosign for the $20k loan?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I look forward to hearing all your opinions and whatnot in the comments below. Here is what is going through my head&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Reasons to not cosign a loan for your best friend<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My default answer to cosigning a loan would be NO! Here are a few reasons why\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>She might default!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Obviously, if my friend doesn\u2019t make payments, I\u2019d be on the hook for paying the $20k! (or monthly payments of $416 for however long the loan has left). The fact that she\u2019s over 40 and can\u2019t scratch together $30k concerns me.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Potentially ruin the friendship:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Whether it works out or not, things can get weird cosigning or lending money to friends.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Future expenses:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Let\u2019s say 2 years from now she actually wants to have the baby\u2026 If she can\u2019t afford $20k now, how is she going to afford future surgeries, baby delivery, and upfront child costs later? A favor now could be a slippery slope for giving more money later.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>It\u2019s just outside of my comfort zone.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019ve done well in life by following a specific set of money principles. Cosigning loans is NOT one of them and is not great financial advice.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Reasons to say YES<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before shutting my friend down completely, let\u2019s look at the opposite side of things&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>The gift of a baby! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe my emotions are running high because my wife and I are exploring the idea of children ourselves right now&#8230; Personally, I would love nothing more than to help a friend have a kid, in whatever manner they feel is best for them. Family in life is more important than money.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019m financially stable:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Although $20k is a shitload of money, losing it wouldn\u2019t break me. What\u2019s the point of accumulating all this money if I can\u2019t use it to help family and friends?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>It might cost me nothing.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If my friend makes all payments on time, this situation would cost me zero.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>If I say no, she\u2019ll do it somehow anyway:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She\u2019s probably going to get a loan regardless, so I want her to get the interest free one as it\u2019ll be cheaper for her.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Meet-in-the middle options<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that I\u2019m thinking about this more, here are a few other out of the box ideas&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One idea could be to ask my friend for collateral somehow. I could cosign the loan, but if she could give me something of value then I have some security. For example, she could write a promissory note for her car. Not sure how that would hold up if things got ugly, but just the fact that I have some leverage might incentivize her more to make all the payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another idea would be to tell my friend to get a $20k personal loan from the bank\u2026 But, as a gift, I could cover all of the interest payments. If she was charged 7% over a 4 year term, interest would total about $3k. She would end up with a $20k \u201cinterest free\u201d loan and I would pay $3k to help a friend. That\u2019s not a bad idea. I\u2019d give $3k to my best friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe I could encourage her to wait 1-2 years and try helping her save up the money in cash?\u00a0 (She\u2019d be 43 at that point, and I know age can be an issue).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, I\u2019m not 100% opposed to the idea. But I still think at this stage in my life, I would still probably say no. As sad as it is\u2026 I just wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about you? Tell me what you\u2019d do in this situation\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy Friday,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good mornin\u2019, wealth builders!\u00a0 I have an absolute DOOZY of a topic for discussion today.
