Which approach is needed depends on the specific situation.\u00a0 He suggests that viewing the world both by living in the moment and using classical rationality can lead to a higher quality of life. <em>(<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I see the two different types applied to couples:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The <\/strong><strong>\u201clive-in-the-moment\u201d romantics<\/strong> &#8211; who pool all their income into one account and yet (incredibly) live together in perfect harmony<\/li>\n<li><strong>And the classical couples<\/strong> &#8211; who selectively pool resources to pay for shared expenses, and yet retain some funds to spend independently.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I admire those couples that are able to just throw everything together in one pot and have it just \u201cwork\u201d for them.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s great (It boggles my mind a bit, but I respect it).\u00a0 However, I do have to roll my eyes and sigh when I read comments that suggest that couples that don\u2019t share every last penny are inferior in some way. The comments tend to go something like this: \u201cIf you have separate bank accounts, you\u2019re just roommates. Why get married?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>My theory is that couples who are able to pool money harmoniously <em>over long periods<\/em> of time have very (extremely) similar values and goals.<\/strong>\u00a0 With such minor differences they are able to intuitively agree with each other most or all of the time \u2013 so no conflicts arise.\u00a0\u00a0 Similar views and\/or enough individual flexibility allow these couples to come to joint decisions organically \u2013 thus \u201clive-in-the-moment\u201d romantics.<\/p>\n<p>But sometimes it is our differences that attract us to each other.\u00a0 And although I might predict problems if someone with a 580 credit rating got together with a 780, I think that discussion and agreements beforehand can do a lot to offset those differences.\u00a0 <strong>Couples with differing fiscal views can have relationships that are just as stable as those that seem to be like two $100 bills stamped from the same set of engraving plates.<\/strong> For the classical couples, delving into the details and making plans and agreements beforehand allows them to live in the same harmonious state of bliss as the romantics.<\/p>\n<p>I specified \u201cover long periods of time\u201d earlier because my ex and I started out by pooling all our resources.\u00a0 We put all our money into one account because that\u2019s how we thought you were supposed to do it.\u00a0 Who knew you had choices?\u00a0 (I know, I know, you saw the word \u201cex\u201d back there and are now thinking \u201cWhat\u2019s a freaking divorced guy doing trying to give me advice about couples budgeting?!\u201d Ok, that\u2019s a fair question.\u00a0 Well, I have 14 years of married financial experience.\u00a0 And once we resolved our differences we never had a fight over money again. (Hallelujah!)\u00a0 When we did get divorced it had absolutely nothing to do with finances.\u00a0 In fact, we are still good friends.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the story of how we resolved those differences that I hope will help others step around the piles of dog crap that we stomped right through.) <em>[Ex-wife\u2019s note: \u201cYup, it\u2019s true we\u2019re still friends. He asked me look this over for accuracy.\u201d]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>With us, pooling everything worked fine &#8211; for a while.<\/strong>\u00a0 We made it about five or six years before it started taking its toll on our relationship.\u00a0 We had some consumer debt (about$6k \u2013 seemed like a lot at the time) and she would want to pay it down.\u00a0 Which was fine but I still wanted to be able to do and get things I wanted sometimes.\u00a0 <strong>It started putting us at odds.<\/strong>\u00a0 I began to feel that if I wanted to be able get something I wanted, I had to go out and get it right away when we had the money. Otherwise the money would be gone and I would feel I missed out.\u00a0 Needless to say this didn\u2019t do good things for my saving habits.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure that she felt very frustrated that I was ruining her plans to pay ahead on our bills.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a good time for either of us. Voices were raised, feelings were hurt, and tears were shed. Something had to change.<\/p>\n<p>We sat down and talked it all out.\u00a0 We needed to agree about what we were going to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/07\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\">budget<\/a> (including accelerated paying off of debt).\u00a0 And we needed to each have money that we weren\u2019t accountable for to the other.\u00a0 After our talk, I sat down and drew up a budget.\u00a0 I figured up everything we had agreed on, and compared it to what we made in a year.\u00a0 Hooray!\u00a0 We had disposable income left over.\u00a0\u00a0 Now we just had to divvy it up fairly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s where it can get touchy<\/strong>.\u00a0 It is unlikely that both individuals will make the same amount of money.\u00a0\u00a0 So what do you do?\u00a0 If you split up the discretionary money 50-50 then the person that has a higher income can feel that they are paying a disproportionately higher amount of the budget.\u00a0 On the other hand if you split the budget 50-50 and have each person keep what they have left over after they pay their half, the person with the smaller paycheck might walk away with nothing!\u00a0 That dog won\u2019t hunt, Monsignor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I decided the fairest way to share expenses and bills was to have each of us contribute the same percentage of our income towards the budget.\u00a0<\/strong> If I got to keep 25% of my income, then she kept 25% of her income.\u00a0 The amounts were different, but we were each contributing the same % of our work effort to our joint expenses.\u00a0 We each deposited the agreed upon amount into the joint account each time we got paid and the rest went into each of our personal accounts.\u00a0 And we didn\u2019t have to get buy-in from each other for whatever we spent out of our personal accounts.\u00a0 Once I wasn\u2019t afraid it would disappear, I started actually saving money up for bigger things I wanted in the future instead of spending it on crap.We both thought that the plan was fair.\u00a0 And for the rest of the time we were together we didn\u2019t have any issues with money.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, I was very proud of myself for coming up with this grand scheme \u2013 especially after it worked out so well for us.\u00a0 In my defense, I did come up with the idea of each putting in the same percentage of our income independently.\u00a0 But I know now that all I did was re-invent the same wheel that had already been invented many times over (and to my chagrin I also found a sizeable chuck of it in the comments from May\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/05\/married-3-years-still-havent-combined-finances\/\">Married 3 Years &amp; Still Haven\u2019t Combined Finances<\/a>\u201d).\u00a0 Hey, if you actually come up with something new under the sun in this day and age you\u2019re a phenomena. So if you think that this method might help you out, here are all the steps:<\/p>\n<h2>5 Steps to sharing this couples budgeting method:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Make up a budget of agreed expenses\/investment that is less than your income.<\/li>\n<li>Calculate the % of your income that must go to your budget. (divide total budget by total income)<\/li>\n<li>Every time you get paid, deposit that percentage into a joint account that you will pay bills out of.<\/li>\n<li>Deposit the remainder into each individual\u2019s personal account.<\/li>\n<li>Live happily ever after \u2013 Lather, Rinse, and repeat.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This plan isn\u2019t the right one for everyone, but it worked great for us for many years.\u00a0 I hope that a few couples might find it useful without having to go through the pain we did to figure out the solution.<\/p>\n<p>There are more ways than one to skin a cat.\u00a0 As long as you can come to an agreement you both approve of everyone can be happy (with the possible exception of the cat). No one approach is right or wrong for every couple.\u00a0 The right approach is the one that works for you.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>So, how do you share with your mate?<\/strong>\u00a0 Does it work all the time or do problems come up?\u00a0 How do you handle them?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Guest post<\/strong> by <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/financial-planning-needs-balance\">Gene Roberts<\/a> &#8211; a 40 year old machinery technician working in the semiconductor industry (BUM, , , bum, BUM, bum, BUM) and lives in Chandler, AZ.
