CGW! (Crowd goes wild) OTM! (over the moon) TGIS! (thank goodness it&#8217;s September)<\/p>\n<p>I know I know, you waited all year for this month to come and now that it&#8217;s here you don&#8217;t know how to control yourself. Join the club. The club of BEING INSURED, baby &#8211; yeah! (okay okay, I&#8217;ll stop)<\/p>\n<p><strong>In all seriousness though, life insurance is pretty important.<\/strong> (Important if you&#8217;re BORING! Okay for real this time &#8211; no more yokes. I mean Jokes.)<\/p>\n<p>It really is important :) Especially if you&#8217;re married, have kids, buying\/own a home or assets, or pretty much just don&#8217;t want to get screwed in the off change that you die one day. Which, surprise! Will happen. Hopefully not until all debts are paid off though and you&#8217;re living the good life down at the beach with 16 of your grand kids burying you into the sand. (Another reason to retire early, right?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But here&#8217;s the thing. You already KNOW all this.<\/strong> Some of you smarties have already sucked it up and covered yourself and your family, but a good majority of you have not.\u00a0 According to this minfo-graphic (&#8220;mini info graphic&#8221; &#8211; coined first here!) by goodneighbors.com via State Farm Insurance, only one in four of us are picking up life insurance by one of these main events:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40854\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/why-get-life-insurance.jpg\" alt=\"why get life insurance\" width=\"600\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/why-get-life-insurance.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/why-get-life-insurance-300x105.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>All four of those check marks are mine because they&#8217;re exactly the reason we picked up life insurance for each other ourselves.<\/strong> We had <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/10\/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">just bought a house<\/a> in the summer of 2007 (real estate could never go down, right?) prompting us right out the gate, and then by the next Spring we&#8217;d be getting married (prompt #2) and shortly thereafter working on our new beautiful family (prompt #3). So we each picked up enough coverage to wipe out our entire mortgage and keep the future of the Money household safe and secure &#8211; at least financially.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny to think about how much money we spend on something that we hope will never come, but it&#8217;s one of the best ways to protect your wealth and make sure you&#8217;re not leaving behind a trail of mess for your loved ones to clean up. The last thing they want to be doing is figuring out how to pay off all those large debts you&#8217;ve left behind while they&#8217;re grieving for your loss. I like to think of it as one last gift to bestow upon them as you make your way up to Candy Land ;) And what a great financial lesson to leave with them too! (Do you think there&#8217;s blogging in the after-life?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now, I&#8217;m not gonna be your mother and tell you to stop what you&#8217;re doing and go buy yourself some coverage,<\/strong> but I am going to channel your dad and hand you an eBeer while sternly telling you &#8220;it would be wise&#8221; to look into this today, son\/daughter. Don&#8217;t rush out and buy something you&#8217;re confused about or not even sure you need (contrary to popular belief not everyone technically <em>does<\/em> need life insurance, though it is always beneficial!), but do spend a few moments today &#8211; 15 minutes? &#8211; reviewing your current situation and whether it&#8217;s worth looking into more or not.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s changed over the past few years? What&#8217;s changed since the last time you GOT insurance? What would happen if you vanished into thin air like that fateful day on <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/rKtgMEKMoiU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Leftovers<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rKtgMEKMoiU?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><br \/>\n<strong>This goes very much for myself, too.<\/strong> Since picking up coverage those 7 years ago we&#8217;ve <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/05\/drum-roll-pleasewere-married\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tied the knott<\/a>, started an online business, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">grew our net worth by hundreds of thousands<\/a>, and of course welcomed 2.3 new kids into our world (cats count, right?). What we picked up then might not match what we need today, so I&#8217;ll be chatting with the wife about this as well :)<\/p>\n<p>In fact, here&#8217;s what we have now to give you a better idea:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>J. Money:<\/strong>\u00a0$350,000 of Term Life Insurance (30 years @ $30.99\/mo, via USAA)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mrs. J. Money:<\/strong> $350,000 of Term Life Insurance (30 years @ $24.57\/mo, via USAA)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>(Why do women always pay less for insurance? Those beautiful creatures&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s literally been two years since I last paid attention to this &#8211; ever since my last riveting post on Life Insurance Month, where I changed it to M.M.L.P. Insurance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/time-to-get-a-life-insurance-movement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mo&#8217; Money, Less Problems!<\/a> Haha&#8230; &#8211; so the timing couldn&#8217;t be better. Even us money bloggers need to suck it up&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s a refresher from that post on why life insurance is so important:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>When you die, it\u2019s going to cost money. Who, will depend on you.<\/li>\n<li>The money can be used to pay off mortgages, debts, full rides to college!<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s good to give your family complete peace of mind.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s good to give YOU complete peace of mind! While you\u2019re still alive!<\/li>\n<li>And more importantly, you can forever ward off all questions from your nosey financial blogger\/parents going forward. Possibly the best reason :)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>So. What are you going to do as soon as you finish reading this most exciting article I&#8217;ve served up for you today? <\/strong>Drink some coffee? Okay, sure. Leave a comment about how brilliant and funny I am? Fine, I&#8217;ll allow that. Oh oh! How about <em>taking 15 minutes to review my wonderful life and whether or not I&#8217;m happy with my insurance coverage?<\/em> Ding Ding Ding! We have a winner!<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to make a big deal of it, but I do urge you to put down The Facebook for a few and mull it over. You kids have it easy these days&#8230; Back in my day I had to walk uphill &#8211; both ways &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodfinancialcents.com\/insurance-quotes\/life\/companies\/\">to the life insurance company<\/a> to talk about my options. All while barefoot, and in the snow!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-40856\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dad-signature.jpg\" alt=\"dad signature\" width=\"96\" height=\"37\" \/>&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> If you have no idea what amounts of coverage you&#8217;d need, check out this handy calculater from State Farm: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statefarm.com\/insurance\/life\/resources\/life-needs-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Life Needs Calculator<\/a>. It&#8217;ll help put things in perspective more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong> Got a great message on Facebook about *Disability* insurance too: &#8220;Also worth mentioning, it&#8217;s super important to have disability insurance. I&#8217;ve read that it&#8217;s actually more common for people to need that but yet far less people have it. If you can&#8217;t work for an extended period of time (like a year or more), disability insurance is a lifesaver&#8230; Years ago, I knew someone who was in a terrible car crash &amp; couldn&#8217;t work for 6 or 7 months. He didn&#8217;t have long term disability insurance, &amp; it really messed him up financially. The small premium is worth the peace of mind, if you ask me!&#8221; ANOTHER GOOD THING TO CONSIDER!<\/p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: This blog post was written as part of a sponsored program for State Farm to raise awareness about the importance of life insurance.
