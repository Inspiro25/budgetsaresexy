It&#8217;s like the perfect concoction for me right now, and we&#8217;ve already been blessed with over 10 awesome clients so far. Not a bad way to start a project :)<\/p>\n<p>And honestly, 3 weeks ago it wasn&#8217;t even on our minds&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>The Back Story<\/h2>\n<p>A while ago I had played around with the idea of doing <em><strong>1 hour call sessions<\/strong><\/em> as a side gig, but back then I was more joking around about it than I was serious. And I knew it wouldn&#8217;t have been a good time anyways as I needed a lot more experience (and failures!) under my belt to really be able to bring some value and make it worth people&#8217;s money.\u00a0 Something I still, to this day, have a hard problem with actually &#8211; charging people for something I can easily give away for free! (But then so can plumbers and dentists and other service professionals too, eh? It&#8217;s hard to remember *time&#8221; is just as valuable!)<\/p>\n<p>So when my good friend and business partner, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/natestpierre.me\/about\/\">Nate St. Pierre<\/a><\/em>, called me up the other week (The same <em>Nate St. Pierre<\/em> who fooled the internet this week that <a href=\"http:\/\/natestpierre.me\/2012\/05\/08\/abraham-lincoln-patent-facebook\/\">Abraham Lincoln invented Facebook!<\/a>*) asking me about new projects we keep pushing to the side &#8211; and what it&#8217;ll take to get them off the ground &#8211; I kept thinking that the real reason we hadn&#8217;t was just cuz I wasn&#8217;t all too excited about them much. I mean, I think they&#8217;re great, and we WILL launch them at some point in the future, but at the moment my heart just wasn&#8217;t into them as yet. He then asked me what my &#8220;perfect&#8221; gig WOULD be, then, like if all my sites exploded and I had to come up with something totally new right away, and the first thing that came to mind again was that &#8220;1 hour call&#8221; idea.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do that!!&#8221; I said.\u00a0 <strong>&#8220;It captures a bulk of everything I enjoy!\u00a0 Blogging, projects, brainstorming, helping people, working AWAY from the computer, meeting new people, talking on the phone, AND getting paid!&#8221; <\/strong> I could tell he was still as leery about it as he was when I brought it up the first time, so I said &#8220;F it &#8211; I&#8217;m just gonna tweet it out there and see what happens&#8221; &#8211; even though it was like 5pm on a Friday night, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And guess what??\u00a0 People responded!\u00a0 Positively! :)\u00a0 Now of course we were giving away a FREE hour so we can test it out and all that, but still &#8211; it meant that there could be a market for what we were offering out there. So we quickly did our first two or so free sessions to see how the process would work (Nate gave away some too to further help our testing), and the more we went along, the more we realized it was a good fit. We were having FUN talking to people and sharing our ideas and insight, and they were getting pages and pages of notes at the same time :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So we decided to start charging and building out the site.<\/strong>\u00a0 And you know what?\u00a0 That worked too. People were just as happy to pay as those who got our time for free\u00a0 &#8211; pretty incredible.\u00a0 And that&#8217;s where we are today.\u00a0 Spilling the beans of our last 3 weeks of being all giddy offline ;)<\/p>\n<h2>What we&#8217;re offering<\/h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, Nate and I jump on a 1 hour phone call to help people grow and monetize their blog, project, or product. It can be as focused, or general as they wish, and the entire time it&#8217;s just us and them talking and figuring stuff out (we spend 30 minutes before each call prepping and going over all site info beforehand to reduce any wasted time).<\/p>\n<p>And I think what makes it work the most is that there are TWO of us on the call, with our own set of opinions and experiences to share. Allowing us to give a much bigger variety of ideas and successes the entire time &#8211; it&#8217;s great. Then afterwards we connect them with our own personal network of professionals who can further help them along depending on their own areas needing improvement (say, with SEO or graphic design). It&#8217;s all rather fun :) And Nate pretty much becomes the &#8220;bad cop&#8221; of the duo, dishing out harder (but true) critiques, and I&#8217;m more of the &#8220;good cop&#8221; focusing on the potential as well as ways to improve stuff once it&#8217;s all laid out on the table.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s one of our latest testimonials:<\/strong> (you can see more here too)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nate and Jay are incredibly knowledgeable, intuitive and helpful. When they\u2019re working with you, your project is theirs \u2013 they care about it as it if were their own, and they don\u2019t pull any punches to make sure it\u2019s successful. Good or bad, they\u2019re going to tell you the truth, and you\u2019ll be glad they did. I highly recommend Nate and Jay as consultants and advisors on any project you really want to make an impact with.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>What we charge<\/h2>\n<p>You can read more about everything here, in our work with us page, but we pretty much have 3 packages right now ranging from $150 an hour to more bulk stuff with multiple calls and correspondences. And so far our feedback has shown we&#8217;re right about on the money &#8211; especially since there&#8217;s two of us. In fact, a couple of our clients have said they&#8217;d have paid anywhere up to $400\/hr!!\u00a0 So who knows, maybe we&#8217;ll increase it later ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But as I mentioned before, this is the hardest part for me.<\/strong> Charging people when I&#8217;m so used to giving away everything for free.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll still continue to do so on this blog, and in emails y&#8217;all send, etc, etc &#8211; especially since those are more money-related questions than businessy anyways &#8211; but now it&#8217;ll feel good having a main place for all those who REALLY want to step it up a notch with their own hustles. And those that are more excited about too.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve spent 2-3 hours a PIECE on an email helping someone strategize, only to have them never write me back or even say a quick &#8220;thank you.&#8221;\u00a0 Most people are good and appreciate your time, but I can tell you that when you PAY for something you&#8217;re a lot more focused and &#8220;into it&#8221; than when it&#8217;s free. It&#8217;s all rather fascinating ;)<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons learned so far<\/h2>\n<p>For those of you who are already bored with this post, or who would never take us up on our offer anyways (not that I&#8217;m trying to sell you on it or anything), there are a handful of takeaways here that could be applied to many things in life &#8211; even money:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You have to ASK for what you want.<\/strong>\u00a0 Until you do that, you&#8217;ll never get an answer!\u00a0 In our case here we threw it out on Twitter and Facebook to gauge interest, but my wife just did something similar with asking her library to cancel her late fees she felt wasn&#8217;t her fault. She was charged $8 bucks for an overdue book that she didn&#8217;t know about (long story), but she called up and asked nicely (the key!!) to please have it removed.\u00a0 90 seconds later, they did!\u00a0 So ask for stuff. It&#8217;ll automatically be a &#8220;NO&#8221; if you don&#8217;t&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follow your dreams every now and then!<\/strong>\u00a0 I know we all *think* about some of this stuff, especially making lots of money and nabbing that ultimate job of yours, but just like with asking you also have to TAKE STEPS towards them if you ever want &#8217;em to come true.\u00a0 Anyone can dream, but it&#8217;s much harder to take action.\u00a0 Which is why the rewards are so high when you do!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consider marketing a project\/company\/etc before it&#8217;s built.<\/strong>\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know where I first saw it (some book?), but I once read that you can market a product two totally different ways:\u00a0 1)\u00a0 By making it and THEN offering it out for the world to consume, or 2)\u00a0 By sharing it as if it&#8217;s already made (when it&#8217;s not), and seeing what happens.\u00a0 The latter doesn&#8217;t work for *all* products, of course, but the takeaway here is that you can test things in REAL LIFE right now to see if you have a winner on your hand, rather than 6 months later after you&#8217;ve already build the whole thing &#8211; and\/or spent hundreds of hours of time on it &#8211; *hoping* to have a winner on your hand. Two different mindsets that could make or break an idea, depending on what it is (you also don&#8217;t want anyone to steal an idea before it&#8217;s made too, so pros and cons to either route).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your time is worth money!<\/strong>\u00a0 I&#8217;ve already touched on this a little bit, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with offering a service or product out there and asking to get paid for it.\u00a0 Even though it&#8217;s hard and you&#8217;ll feel bad like me ;)\u00a0 Not *everyone* will be willing to pay for what you&#8217;re offering, but there might be an audience who WILL.\u00a0 And those are the types you&#8217;re catering too. Your &#8220;target audience.&#8221;\u00a0 We&#8217;re all skilled in different things, and just because you&#8217;re an expert in something (or it comes naturally), doesn&#8217;t mean everyone else is. And that&#8217;s exactly why they&#8217;re paying YOU &#8211; to learn and get better (and avoid all the heartaches you came across in the process! haha&#8230;). So if you have a skill that someone can use, be open about allowing them to pay you for it if they want. It&#8217;s a free market out there, and if there&#8217;s a demand try supplying it!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>In Summary<\/h2>\n<p>In summary, we launched a new service, and we hope it&#8217;s successful :)\u00a0 If you want to check it out, you can go to it here: NateAndJay.com, and then hopefully tell me what you think.
