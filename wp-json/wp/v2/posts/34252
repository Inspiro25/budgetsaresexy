Who apparently enjoys stirring up trouble ;))<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hi, friends. I\u2019m Kathleen, and my corner of the internet is way across town, at <a href=\"http:\/\/FrugalPortland.com\">FrugalPortland.com<\/a>. I have admired J$ from afar (and got a little star struck when I met him at FinCon last year!) for a few years now. His writing is funny, and his advice is sound.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s just one thing, though. I don\u2019t think budgets are sexy at all. In fact, I was thinking about the least sexy thing I could think of, and yes, Warren Buffett in a speedo came to mind. Sorry about that!<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t budget, at all. I think it\u2019s the wrong way to get in control of your money.<\/p>\n<h2>The Problem with Budgeting<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing. When a person finally decides to get their head out of the sand and stop spending more money than they\u2019re earning, we want to capture that enthusiasm. Instead, general wisdom comes along and says,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cYou want to stop financing your lifestyle? Kudos to you, sir or madam! Now, track every single dollar that goes out, stop doing all the things you\u2019re doing with your money (have we told you how bad Starbucks is yet?) and change your lifestyle completely. Tomorrow. No! Today.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Then, the person decides that it\u2019s too hard, that maybe they\u2019ll try something else, and holy cow do they need a drink.<\/p>\n<h2>There Has to be a Better Way<\/h2>\n<p>If someone came to me, ready to change their financial lives, I\u2019d tell them,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI am so proud of you for realizing that this way of life isn\u2019t sustainable. Here, sweetheart. Have a seat. Get comfortable. You\u2019re going to have to change a lot of things, but the first thing you\u2019ll have to change is your mind. Understand that you can do this.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Change your attitude about the kind of person you are.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I think you are great. Spectacular, even. You made mistakes in the past, but no judgement here. Credit card debt sucks, but that doesn\u2019t mean you suck for carrying credit card debt. I promise. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. Let\u2019s get this sorted out.<\/p>\n<h2>The No-Budget Way to Get Your Finances in Order<\/h2>\n<p>Instead of focusing on spending, let\u2019s take a look at how much money you\u2019re bringing in each month. Are you thinking of a number?<\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s look at all your bills, including debts. Like I said, this is a judgement-free zone. You don\u2019t need to make excuses or be embarrassed. Just list them out.<\/p>\n<p>What are you left with when you pay all your bills, plus the minimum payments on your loans?<\/p>\n<p>Great. Let\u2019s work with that.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re not going to budget. We\u2019re just going to pay your bills, pay your minimums, then, see what we can do with the rest.<\/p>\n<p>In this stage, it\u2019s important to just STOP using credit cards, even for incidentals. That is what your debit card is for, okay? It\u2019ll keep you from spending more than you have. And that\u2019s an important step.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Beyond Treading Water<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Spending less than you earn is the key to getting out of debt, and getting out of debt is the first step toward being in charge of your financial life. You can do this any way you choose. There are shelves of books regarding the \u201cright\u201d way to pay off debt, but the bottom line is this: the math hardly matters.<\/p>\n<p>If getting out of debt were a simple mathematical problem, then we wouldn\u2019t need the experts! Don\u2019t worry about the interest rates. Hey, you weren\u2019t worrying before, why start now? Think about what I like to call the \u201cdebt of highest pain\u201d &#8212; that one that you are most ashamed of. The one that you continually kick yourself for having. That could be a personal loan to a parent. A medical loan. Anything. For me, it was a credit card. I hated that I had credit card debt. I knew I wasn\u2019t the kind of person who carried a balance (I also had to change my attitude!). I just had to prove it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I spent my time, and all of my extra money, making the credit card debt go away.<\/strong> There was a time where both the balance and the interest on my credit cards were lower than my other loans, but that didn\u2019t matter. I wasn\u2019t the kind of person who had credit card debt.<\/p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t have a budget then. I still don\u2019t. I do keep a very close eye on all of my accounts (and would recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/mint\">Mint<\/a> above any other tool out there, just don\u2019t use the \u201cbudget\u201d section!) and have a plan for each.<\/p>\n<p>Budgets aren\u2019t sexy to me.<em><strong> What\u2019s sexy is being in control of my money, not having my money control me.<\/strong><\/em> And if a budget helps you get in control, then it makes you sexier.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s what we all want, right? To be sexier.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>Kathleen writes at <a title=\"Frugal Portland\" href=\"http:\/\/frugalportland.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">FrugalPortland<\/a> about her path to financial independence as well as ways to save money, live simply, and enjoy the fun things that Portland has to offer.
