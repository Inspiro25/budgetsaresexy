She spent a lot of one-on-one time with dying people and helped them deal with emotions, reflections, and making peace before passing away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, these dying people were asked about <\/span><b>regrets<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span><b> things they would do differently<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if they were given a second chance at life. Bonnie recorded the five most common answers she heard from everyone. They were&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I wish I\u2019d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I wish I hadn\u2019t worked so hard.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I wish I\u2019d had the courage to express my feelings.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I wish that I had let myself be happier.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first read these top five regrets I thought, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wonder if I\u2019ll be saying the same things when I\u2019m on my deathbed? &#8230; Maybe if I take this life advice and start to implement changes in the way I live NOW, I could avoid some of these regrets later?\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f914;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever since then, I started thinking and doing things differently with the hopes of living the *least* regrettable life possible. Here\u2019s some specific stuff I\u2019m doing and actions I\u2019m taking&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My First and Biggest Takeaway: No One Had Money Regrets<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you notice that none of the top regrets have anything to do with \u201cmore money\u201d or \u201cmore stuff\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was my first big takeaway: <\/span><b>Stop prioritizing money and consumer crap. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not what truly matters or what you\u2019ll cherish in the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Regret #1: &#8220;I wish I\u2019d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would have never guessed this to be the No. 1 life regret. But the more I think about it, the more I can relate. I\u2019ve spent A LOT of my life trying to impress other people and suppressing my dreams in order to fit in and feel \u201caccepted.\u201d My old career path, the way I used to dress, talk, and act\u2026 Most of this I was doing because that\u2019s the way others were doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to hear something really embarrassing? When I quit my job in 2018, I typed into Google, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cwhat should I do on a sabbatical?\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t have my own list of things to pursue, it\u2019s that my natural instinct was to check what everyone else was doing before making my own life decisions. Kind of sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not all bad though, because the decisions I\u2019ve made in my life have led me to become who I am today. And since discovering the FIRE community and reading more empowering books like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3oJ6xAf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Art of Non-Conformity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I am starting to dance to the beat of my own drum more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some other things I\u2019m doing to live a truer and more authentic life:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I talk about our life goals, regularly. We have clear priorities and due dates, making sure we actually do the things we\u2019re dreaming about.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are working toward financial independence! In the meantime, we\u2019re taking advantage of any freedoms we\u2019ve already earned or have been blessed with.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started a massive \u201csomeday maybe\u201d list. Anytime I get bored I check out the list for ideas. These are <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ideas, not other people\u2019s.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m cautious of how much social media I intake. Checking out other people&#8217;s lives is fun, but it can be dangerous and addictive.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I ask for someone\u2019s advice or opinion, I take it as optional, not mandatory.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Regret #2: &#8220;I wish I hadn\u2019t worked so hard.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonnie says people <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDeeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready for another embarrassing personal story? In 2016 my parents came out to visit me from Australia. I welcomed them by working 60 hours that week and making other people show them around LA. I even got a little snappy at them for \u201cvisiting me when it was my busy season at work.\u201d I was an asshole, and it brings me to tears just thinking about it. Sorry, Mum and Dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working too hard was 100% my fault. Even my boss told me to take time off to hang with my family. But I didn\u2019t because a) fear of being called a slacker by coworkers and b) I wanted to make more sales so I could earn more money. Two really dumb reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, my workaholic days are behind me now. Let\u2019s hear it for Financial Independence! That\u2019s why we\u2019re all here &#8211; to build a solid money foundation so that work becomes optional, not mandatory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even well before hitting your FI number, there are a bunch of ways to have a better work\/life balance. Better yet, a lot of companies these days are embracing and promoting a healthier work lifestyle and environment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, here are some things I\u2019m trying to balance my work\/life better:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pursue work that\u2019s in line with my values.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of remote working! (no commute, different workplaces, travel while working)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a lot of time off, especially for big family occasions and life events.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work smarter, not harder &#8212; maximizing my most efficient times of the day.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn off phone\/computer more regularly, being more present during off time.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Regret #3: &#8220;I wish I\u2019d had the courage to express my feelings.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have I told you readers lately that I love you? &#x1f60d; And how beautiful and handsome you all are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kidding aside, I really am trying to express my feelings a lot more. Here\u2019s a few examples of stuff I\u2019m trying to do more:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Express appreciation when people help me. I\u2019ve begun emailing authors after reading their books, writing thank you letters, and telling people the impact they\u2019ve had on me.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling people instead of texting\/emailing. Voice gets my *feelings* across, text does not.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sticking up for myself when I\u2019m being crapped on. (Previously I\u2019d just let my wife fight my battles for me &#x1f923; but now I\u2019m learning to be a big boy)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Journaling and blogging has really helped me share more feelings. Stuff that would otherwise never have been released.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asking better and *deeper* questions when having conversations with friends. This brings a deeper connection vs. just surface level topics.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Regret #4: &#8220;I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess it\u2019s a lot easier these days with Facebook and other online platforms. (Bonnie\u2019s article came out in 2009, Facebook was invented in 2004, and most of her patients were of the older generation and probably didn\u2019t use social media).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, I think \u201cstaying in touch\u201d is a lot more than just having a ton of FB friends or wishing an old pal happy birthday once a year. It\u2019s making the effort to reach out, re-connect, reminisce about past shared events, and support each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the pandemic brought many old friends back together (virtually). I certainly reconnected with more old friends this past year than in prior years. Checking in and visiting old friends regularly is high on my priority list going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Regret #5: &#8220;I wish that I had let myself be happier.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The earlier in life you realize that <\/span><b>happiness is a choice<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the sooner you can take ownership and start building systems to improve your experience and memories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve spent the last 3 years studying happiness. It\u2019s an ongoing process, not an overnight switch.\u00a0 Here are the quickest and simplest routes I use to boost my happiness. I do these consistently, building a habit of happiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Doing good deeds for others.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I believe the quickest route to happiness is making others happy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Daily appreciation. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply focusing on all the things you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have, vs. all the things you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Constant celebration.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It doesn\u2019t matter how big or small the occasion, I\u2019m going to celebrate it. Every day is a celebration. &#x1f973;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Beware of negative people.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019ve become hyper sensitive about who I surround myself with. I\u2019ve got no problem sharing my happiness with others (it\u2019s unlimited!), but I do have a problem with people trying to share their negativity with me.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Get outside more.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The sun shines on those who are outside.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sleep well, eat healthy, exercise and have plenty of sex. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hahaha! Oops, that was an overshare. But seriously, taking care of your basic human needs is key to happiness.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Cheers to Fewer Regrets in Life!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, there you have it!\u00a0 Live true to yourself, don\u2019t overwork, express your feelings, call your old friends, and work on your happiness. Easy peasy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and I will probably have <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regrets on our deathbed, but they aren\u2019t going to be the common ones!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any of you readers spent time with people at the end of their life?
