And welcome to another installment of our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Side Hustle Series<\/a>! Where our guest, <strong>Jim<\/strong>, over at Investment Soup digs in and shares a passion gig of his&#8230; Perfect for all those who love nature and gardening! I guess money really *can* grow on trees &#8211; heyo!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>The biggest challenge with starting a side hustle today, is navigating the sea of opportunities.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Anyone can come up with a better \u201cmouse-trap\u201d and improve on something, then successfully and inexpensively bring it to market.\u00a0 Today\u2019s market is global, buyers are savvy, and up until the recent stock market crash, buyers were flush with cash. The internet has been a \u2018game changer\u2019 when it comes to product marketing, product acquisition, and education.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the sheer scale of people you&#8217;re able to reach, the ability to find someone who will buy your product or use your service is nothing short of astounding.\u00a0 Truly, the only thing standing in the way of your success when starting a side hustle is that person smirking at you as you stand in front of the mirror.<\/p>\n<p>Now, there are side hustles which require a longer learning curve such as building and growing a website, or starting a drop-shipping business.\u00a0 And, there are others which call for having a network of contacts, such as a bookkeeping service, but the success of these still requires the person in that mirror to be wholly committed and motivated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There is however, a fantastic side hustle for those keen on working with their hands, and interested in enjoying one of Mother Nature&#8217;s Wonders, known as photosynthesis.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This side hustle, like most others, takes patience, but unlike others is bound to leave your fingernails dirty. This side hustle is also very scalable, and people will literally line up on any Saturday in Spring to trade copious amounts of paper containing the faces of dead presidents for your entire inventory.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s called <em><strong>Plant Propagation<\/strong><\/em>, and can be done on a very small scale in your garage, basement, or backyard. Or you can become a massive wholesaler who provides inventory to the big box stores. <i>It\u2019s your decision, you get to steer this ship, mate!<\/i><\/p>\n<p>So, what is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plant_propagation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plant propagation<\/a>? According to Wikipedia:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Plant Propagation is the process by which new plants grow from a variety of sources: seeds, cuttings, and other plant parts.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Or, if you prefer the layman&#8217;s interpretation: It\u2019s the act of tossing a seed into a container of nutritious soil, consistently watering and occasionally fertilizing said container, until the seed propagates into a sellable plant. Talk about Growing Dollar Bills; this is it, brotha!<\/p>\n<p>There are 3 types of plant propagation I recommend using.<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Starting plants from seeds<\/h2>\n<p>Seeds are cheap. Heck, you can get 50 Japanese Maple seeds for $9.99 from Amazon that grow up to look like this!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66876\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-maple-tree.jpg\" alt=\"red maple tree\" width=\"449\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-maple-tree.jpg 521w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-maple-tree-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-maple-tree-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-maple-tree-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-maple-tree-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not even 2 dimes per seed!\u00a0 Good Golly!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, a $10 investment, some fertilized soil, a small pot and a little time, you could sell each plant for $6;\u00a0 All. Day. Long.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If each seed germinated and grew to a sellable size, (at least 8-10 inches) you\u2019d have very little problem selling for $6 each.\u00a0 This equates to a return on investment of 29.9%.<\/p>\n<p>Look here:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66877\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-and-green-japanese-maples.jpg\" alt=\"red and green japanese maples\" width=\"438\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-and-green-japanese-maples.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-and-green-japanese-maples-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-and-green-japanese-maples-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-and-green-japanese-maples-550x553.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-and-green-japanese-maples-498x500.jpg 498w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/red-and-green-japanese-maples-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I just potted up these Red and Green Japanese Maples 2 weeks ago, and plan on selling them next Fall for $6 each.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s best to pot them up now, so they\u2019re not stressed by the heat of summer, and with some warm days left before this year&#8217;s winter solstice, they should have time to germinate.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>They will go dormant in the winter, so don&#8217;t worry &#8211; they\u2019re still alive. But once the temperature of the soil increases in the spring, they will thaw and continue growing.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I\u2019ll admit this doesn&#8217;t happen overnight &#8211; seeds grow slow. And the likelihood of all 50 seeds turning into a 10 inch sellable plant are remote. But business is all about risk management, and the level of risk in plant propagation is virtually non-existent.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. Buying Rooted Plant Cuttings<\/h2>\n<p>So you\u2019re not the most patient individual, I get it. Minute rice takes 45 seconds too long for you, I\u2019m with ya. I\u2019ve got a solution for your kind..<\/p>\n<h4>Fast-track plant propagation<\/h4>\n<p>Instead of seeds, you can buy rooted plant cuttings in bulk and grow them into a sellable plant. Which is exactly what I did with these plants:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66878\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/arborvitaes.jpg\" alt=\"arborvitaes\" width=\"505\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/arborvitaes.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/arborvitaes-300x218.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/arborvitaes-550x400.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These are a mix of arborvitaes;\u00a0 Green Giant, Emerald Green, and Japanese, which are the perfect plant to build your plant propagation business around.<\/p>\n<h4>Why arborvitaes are the the perfect plant to start with<\/h4>\n<p>They\u2019re hearty, they grow fast, and grow well in even the most challenging soil.\u00a0 And, people will buy these by the 100s.\u00a0 Literally, by the 100s!<\/p>\n<p>Arborvitaes, and really most evergreen plants, are in such demand because people buy a lot of them at once. They\u2019re perfect as a screen for noise reduction, a property divider, and <i>*bonus perk*<\/i> &#8211; they will stay green all year long!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some other plants I would focus your plant propagation business on are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sprieas and Hostas.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66881\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-propagation-starter-trees.png\" alt=\"plant propagation starter trees\" width=\"658\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-propagation-starter-trees.png 700w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-propagation-starter-trees-300x240.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-propagation-starter-trees-550x440.png 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-propagation-starter-trees-625x500.png 625w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are so many varieties of hostas, you could almost focus your entire plant propagation business solely on them. Not to mention they\u2019re extremely scalable because you can take one mature plant, divide it into 4-5 other plants, pot them up, and then sell each one of them for $6.<\/p>\n<p>Spireas are also a &#8216;best seller&#8217; due to their long flowering period which can last from early summer until the first frost. Spireas are not overly picky about soil type and PH either, but they do prefer a well-drained soil. People rave about their decorative flower colors and the pollinating insects they attract, especially butterflies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are plenty of nurseries where you can order rooted cuttings online and they will ship them directly to your door.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/chiefrivernursery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chief River Nursery<\/a> will sell you 1,000 rooted arborvitaes for only $3.93 each!<\/p>\n<p>Arborvitaes have one of the highest success rates too, so if you bought 1,000 of them and 950 matured to a sellable plant at $6 each, you&#8217;d pocket a cool $5,700. Of course, you have to figure in the price of soil, pots, water, and fertilizer, but it\u2019s still a fabulous return on investment.<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Grafting your own plants<\/h2>\n<p>Grafting plants is an ancient practice of taking two plants and joining their tissues together to create a new plant.<\/p>\n<p>A proper grafted plant involves joining a rootstock (the mature plant), and the plant below the graft, with the scion (the young shoot), which is the plant above the Graft, and creating one new plant.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66882\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/scion-rootstock-grafting.jpg\" alt=\"scion rootstock grafting\" width=\"339\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/scion-rootstock-grafting.jpg 593w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/scion-rootstock-grafting-222x300.jpg 222w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/scion-rootstock-grafting-550x742.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/scion-rootstock-grafting-371x500.jpg 371w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Grafting is often used with fruit trees, as a way of improving the plants hardiness and yield. You\u2019re likely going to have the best results in plant grafting when you use the same species of plant.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Case in point &#8211; you\u2019re going to have more success grafting two species of apple trees together rather than a plum and an apple tree. That is, unless you\u2019re trying to create the world&#8217;s first \u2018Plapple Tree\u2019. And, who knows, a Plapple Tree may be a best-seller, so I\u2019m not trying to talk you out of that!<\/p>\n<p>Plant grafting is cool and scientific, but it&#8217;s also very labor intensive and as such not overly cost effective.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re looking to start a successful plant propagation business, you\u2019re going to need to sell large quantities of plants. In order to do this, you need to concentrate on building up a large inventory.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would suggest building an inventory of just a few types of plants in the beginning, until you learn what your buyers are really interested in.\u00a0 This is the beauty of plant propagation, you only need to grow a small variety of plant species, but on a large scale, and every last one of them will sell.<\/p>\n<h2>Where can you sell your plants<\/h2>\n<p>People are always looking for deals on plants. You can use Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or even your local paper, but these may involve loading up plants and meeting the buyer at some neutral site.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s much better if they <em><strong>come to you<\/strong><\/em>, that way you create an environment where people can impulse buy. Not to mention providing some nice scenery for them to look at! All plant buyers just love looking at plants, and they\u2019d love another opportunity to do so outside of big box stores.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One idea is having a Saturday Plant Sale.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Set a date for a \u2018Gargantuan Plant Sale\u2019 in May, and give yourself enough time to properly get the word out.\u00a0 Generate interest beforehand by posting pictures on social media of plants you\u2019ll be selling, and mention the date of this \u2018Gargantuan Plant Sale\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>You will have people <em>begging<\/em> to let them come by before the sale, I promise.\u00a0 And if so, you\u2019ll now have the option to charge these folks a premium for early viewing!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh and, don\u2019t forget to include a tag (like the one below) on every species of plant to give the buyer a way to visualize where the plant will best fit in their yard:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66885\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-species-tag.png\" alt=\"plant species tag\" width=\"527\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-species-tag.png 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-species-tag-300x211.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/plant-species-tag-550x386.png 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These pots work really well too, and you can order them in bulk. I use the ones below myself and they\u2019re durable, look good, and will stand the test of time.<\/p>\n<p>You can pick up <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3FAHV7h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">110 of them off Amazon<\/a> for $25.95 (or 24 cents each).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3FAHV7h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66886\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/amazon-black-plant-pots.png\" alt=\"amazon black plant pots\" width=\"478\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/amazon-black-plant-pots.png 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/amazon-black-plant-pots-300x264.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/amazon-black-plant-pots-550x484.png 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/amazon-black-plant-pots-568x500.png 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Plant Propagation Business ROI<\/h2>\n<p>A $5,000 investment in various species of arborvitaes, hostas, and spireas will easily yield a 5x multiple the first year.\u00a0 The second year, when you can divide your hostas and take rooted cuttings from your initial stock, you will easily 10-15xX your initial investment.<\/p>\n<p>With each passing year your initial investment amortizes until the value of your plants far exceeds the $5,000 you originally spent. It\u2019s similar to a DRIP program for dividend stocks, but with plants :-)<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion, while starting a plant propagation business does take a little time to ramp up, it\u2019s profit margins are fantastic. It also has one of the lowest barriers of entry, and scaling up is super easy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Worst case &#8211; you grow a bunch of plants that don&#8217;t sell well, and now you have some to give away as gifts or decorate your yard with!
