I don&#8217;t know what it is, but we&#8217;re now onto our THIRD one since we moved in last year!  I know they don&#8217;t last forever, but man hook a brother up for at least an entire year, ya know?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick synopsis of our pain so far:<\/p>\n<p><b>1st dryer<\/b> &#8211; inherited when purchased house. seemed normal, until it started taking longer&#8230;and longer&#8230;and longer to dry. we replaced w\/ sister&#8217;s dryer after she picked up brand new ones. (yay for free!)<\/p>\n<p><b> Sister&#8217;s dryer <\/b>&#8211; worked perfectly for a good 6 months or so.  then all of a sudden started making this horribly awful screeching noise as it dried. it was so bad you could hear it on the 3rd floor! This is even w\/ our doors closes and it being in our basement. i&#8217;m sure our neighbors love us.<\/p>\n<p><b>And now we&#8217;re onto our 3rd dryer.<\/b>  This part could get me REAL fired up, so i&#8217;ll try and get through it quickly before i start slamming these keyboard keys&#8230;.after many weeks of failed Craigslist searching, we decided to use our home warranty again and pay the $100 to have someone come out and fix it.  I mean, it REALLY dries well, it&#8217;s just the awful noise that comes out of it.<\/p>\n<p>We got the standard, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have someone out there between 4-7&#8221; and roll with it. And although the company they source out to looks pretty damn sketchy  (took me 6 calls to get a live person, their voicemail isn&#8217;t set up, and their website is shoddy), they were willing to come out on a saturday!<\/p>\n<p>Sooo&#8230;off we go:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we rush home after Mrs. Budgetsaresexy&#8217;s wedding shower, to hurry up and get it done, so we can go back and hang out with her nephews up from NC.<\/li>\n<li>4 rolls by &#8211; nothing.<\/li>\n<li>  5 rolls by &#8211; nothing.<\/li>\n<li>5:30 we get a call!  &#8220;we&#8217;re on our way, be there in 35-40 mins&#8221;.  Not the best news, but at least they&#8217;ll be here shortly,and we can run back to have dinner w\/ everyone.<\/li>\n<li>6 rolls by &#8211; nothing<\/li>\n<li>7 rolls by &#8211; nothing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>This goes on, and on, and on&#8230;NOTHING!<\/b>  why the F do you call saying your&#8217;e on the way, and then NOT show up, NOT call back, and NOT answer your damn phone?  I was fired up.  I left them a calm,  yet very stern message every hour on the dot until 10.  And to this day?  nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I called back our home warranty people and asked for a new company, but they don&#8217;t do weekends or evening hours.  we were stuck.  And then, as if a flash of light appeared through the clouds and the Almighty one himself looked down upon us, we catch a HUGE break on Craigslist!<\/p>\n<p><b>A perfectly working dryer for only $45!<\/b>  I call this one the &#8220;Richie Rich&#8221; dryer, as the place we picked it up last night was fairly richie rich, and the thing looks brand freakin&#8217; new.  Mrs. Richie Rich had just replaced her set with some new super duper futuristic ones, and couldn&#8217;t get herself to haul it way.  Fine by me!<\/p>\n<p>So now we have our third dryer in less than a year. And i swear, if this one doesn&#8217;t last at LEAST 6 months, i will consider washing everything by hand.  i mean it, don&#8217;t tempt me!  &#8230;.haha&#8230;nah, that&#8217;s a bit extreme.  plus i&#8217;m too lazy :) but i WILL blog about it!  so take that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So we are having some pretty bad luck w\/ dryers lately.
