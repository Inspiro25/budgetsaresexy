It included a bunch of worksheets and questionnaires to help us identify our priorities in life, and then create specific actions to make sure we\u2019re spending money intentionally on things we truly value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We now refer to this as our <em><strong>\u201cvalue based budget.\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is a Value Based Budget?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Value based budgeting is the simple process of right-sizing your budget categories so that they better align with your priorities and values in life. It can also be called value based spending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means spending more money on the things that make your life richer and happier, and spending less money on things that don\u2019t add true value to your life. If you do it correctly, you\u2019ll feel much better about your money situation, where your money is going, and the lifestyle that you are living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For example, one of the things that brings me and my wife joy is <i>giving to others<\/i>. This is a priority for us in life. And one of the things that <i>doesn\u2019t<\/i> really provide us joy is eating at dine-in restaurants&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years ago when we did traditional budgeting, we might have allocated $50 for a date night at a restaurant. This would be about $40 of food, and a $10 tip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now that we\u2019ve got a values based budget, we might still spend $50 on a date night out&#8230; But $20 would be for food (2 x $10 burritos at a street meat stand) and a $30 tip to the guy who makes it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In both budget cases, we spend the same amount of money &#8211; $50&#8230;\u00a0 But, working with a value based budget and having intentional spending, we walk away happier because we\u2019ve fulfilled a higher priority activity for us \u2192 giving.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Figure Out Your Values<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest key to a values based budget is establishing your personal values and priorities in life. This is way harder than it sounds! It requires some deep questioning of yourself!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Don\u2019t be fooled into skipping this step\u2026 If your budget is based on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">someone else\u2019s priorities<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (eg. what the Internet tells you to do, or tips from your extremely frugal friend) then you might be robbing yourself. The point is to match your spending habits to YOUR true joys in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has different values. To help figure out yours, answer some of these questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who do you admire most? Why? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Generally, when we admire a quality in others, it\u2019s something we value ourselves.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>What are some of your proudest moments? Why were you so proud?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The feelings you identify here uncover true values in life.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Picture the 70-year-old YOU. What are the most important things in that person\u2019s life? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps you determine what is most meaningful to you in the long term.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>If you were given only 48 hours to live, how would you spend your last few days? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a money question, this is a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> question. It reveals who\/what\/where is most important to you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Have a look at this <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/core-values\"><b>Core Values list<\/b><\/a><b>. Which ones stand out most to you?\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now comes another hard part&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With your list of core values, try to prioritize them. Try and cut the list down to about 5 or 6 &#8212; the values that are absolutely most important to you. (Another thing you could do is group them into similar categories).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**A funny side note\u2026 My wife and I did this exercise separately and came out with slightly different lists. This is why it\u2019s important to communicate and plan together as a couple. You need to make sure you are BOTH seeing value from your budget, so include what\u2019s important to both of you.**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Merge Your Values With Your Budget<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I went through every single category in our budget and questioned what we were getting the most value from vs. things we didn\u2019t really feel great about. We allocated more money to some categories and shrunk the budget for others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is kind of like J$\u2019s \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">challenge everything<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d he wrote about years ago. But, instead of focusing on money savings, the goal is to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">question the value<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you are getting from things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, we increased our grocery budget from $500 per month to $600 per month. This was based on our personal value of <\/span><b>community<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. My wife and I love to host parties and cook for large groups, and many of our best memories in the past 10 years have been centered around meals with others. We also increased our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/alcohol-budget\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alcohol budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending MORE on stuff like this feels great! It gives us room to spring for fancy or expensive meats once in a while, or perhaps send our guests home with delicious leftovers. We can do this without having to worry about \u201cspending too much money on food\u201d because there is extra room in our budget for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other areas, we decreased spending or removed expenses completely. One example of this was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/dumping-amazon-prime\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dumping Amazon Prime<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We realized the value we got from a Prime subscription was very low. (Free\/fast shipping is available from many retailers without a prime membership. TV streaming is a low priority for us, and so is buying books compared with borrowing from the library). Deleting our Amazon membership has saved us money while having zero effect on our happiness in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other categories we decreased our spending in were restaurants, car costs, clothing, and insurance. Our goal is to reduce costs down to our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/i-found-3-cents-on-the-ground-woohoo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happiness tipping point<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If we can get the same amount of happiness for fewer dollars, that\u2019s a win for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Values Change Over Time, and So Should Budgets<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we grow older and our lifestyle changes, so do our priorities in life. For this reason, value based budgeting isn\u2019t a once-off activity. It\u2019s more of an evolution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a home renter, I\u2019ve never really prioritized home improvement or having nice furniture or appliances. Back in my 20\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t fathom spending $20-50k remodeling a kitchen or landscaping a backyard\u2026 But, as I grow older I\u2019m realizing that my kitchen and backyard is where I spend 90% of my time. I would happily allocate larger amounts of money into these areas today, because I would reap more value from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s the same with health care and family\/child costs. These will most likely increase in time as my wife and I prioritize them more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think values change as your wealth grows, too&#8230; When I was younger I placed a high value on savings and investments. It was extremely important for me to build wealth early in life &#8212; I am reaping life-long value from dollars I saved 20 years ago. But today, I have reduced the importance of wealth building and would rather prioritize travel and experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Every person does it differently. I encourage you to make budgeting unique and custom to your life. Make it fun.
