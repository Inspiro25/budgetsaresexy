The final two, Structural Motivation\u00a0 and Ability, encompass the role\u00a0 of nonhuman factors, such as compensation systems, space, and technology.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>This picture may be easier to understand :)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/files\/Influencer-Research-Report.pdf\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-45082 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-sources-influence.jpg\" alt=\"6 sources influence\" width=\"538\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-sources-influence.jpg 538w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-sources-influence-292x300.jpg 292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" \/><\/a><em>[credit: How to 10x Your Influence report by Grenny and team]<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What this looks like in the real world&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To better illustrate this (and what&#8217;s partially shown in the video), Joseph and team ran a test with kids.<\/p>\n<p>They put a handful in a room for 10 minutes, gave each one $40.00, and then tempted them with outrageously priced candy (like $6.00 for M&amp;Ms!) and were told they could keep whatever they had at the end of it. They even asked them what they&#8217;d do with $40.00 before starting (which is a TON of money for a kid, btw) so they could hopefully lock onto their goals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think they did? :)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, spoiler alert, they did not. The average amount of money each kid had left by the end of the ten minutes was $13.00. Just thirteen!! Out of forty! And when they were asked what happened, none of them could really explain why.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what happened? The 6 powers of influence happened.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this first experiment, they skewed the influences to tempt them more:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They were given a taste test of the candy (personal motivation)<\/li>\n<li>They weren&#8217;t prepared to handle such a new\/weird situation (personal ability)<\/li>\n<li>They were influenced by a couple of kids who went around (by design) saying things like, &#8220;You know, there&#8217;s a lot of awesome candy over there.&#8221; and &#8220;Dude, you should get a lot. As much as you can.&#8221; (social motivation)<\/li>\n<li>They caved into peer pressure (social ability)<\/li>\n<li>They were given an invisible credit card instead of cash (structural motivation)<\/li>\n<li>They were surrounded by large visual cues of kids gawking over candy (structural ability)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Of course kids aren&#8217;t able to turn down that temptation!<\/strong> Haha&#8230; But guess what? Us adults aren&#8217;t the greatest at it either :) How many of these things have we probably experienced this week alone? Taste testing at Costco or Trader Joes? Friends buying up cool $hit or planning to party hard this weekend? Using credit cards over cash? And what about running into ads everywhere we look?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Round II of the experiment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After showing us that first experiment, they did another &#8211; only this time skewed more helpfully. The same parameters were in place, but the influences changed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No free taste tests<\/li>\n<li>Had them practice writing down earnings and expenses for 30 seconds<\/li>\n<li>Changed the messages for the influencer kids: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to save my money. How about you?&#8221; and &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to save my money. I think it&#8217;d probably be a good idea.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Gave them cash instead of credit<\/li>\n<li>Took down all the tormenting pictures<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Think they saved more?<\/strong> Hell yeah they did! The average these kids held onto was a whopping $34.00. 270% more than the $13 from the other group! How incredible is that?<\/p>\n<p>The point of all this, of course, is that we need to <em>be aware<\/em> that all these influences are hitting us in the face EVERY &#8211; SINGLE &#8211; DAY, and to be as prepared as we can when facing them. Most we can&#8217;t ignore even if we wanted to, but we can be vigilant on which ones pierce our wallets and which don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT!<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a lot harder earning our money than it is to give away :(<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> If you want to learn more about these influences, here&#8217;s the full research paper on it (PDF): <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/files\/Influencer-Research-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Influencer Research Report<\/a>. It was named The Change Management Approach of the Year by MIT Sloan Management Review. And then here&#8217;s the talk again too:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6T9TYz5Uxl0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Change Behavior- Change the World<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve given you the spoilers on the kids and $$$ part, but the rest of the video is equally powerful. It focuses on a woman (and prostitute) born into the Mathare Slum of Nairobi, Kenya, and how these influences have changed her life over the years. It&#8217;ll give you plenty to be thankful for the next time you address your own Powerful Goodness! ;)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been two days since following in the footsteps of sir Benjamin Franklin, and I must admit I&#8217;m loving these 5 am wake ups a&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-sources-of-influence\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":45090,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[5,105],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-45078","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-life","category-money-management"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The 6 Sources Influencing Your Money | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-sources-of-influence\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"The 6 Sources Influencing Your Money | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"It&#8217;s been two days since following in the footsteps of sir Benjamin Franklin, and I must admit I&#8217;m loving these 5 am wake ups a...
