In theory you&#8217;d only need a set number of jobs to break even until you wanted to bring on something new, or perhaps start saving for something specific (at which point you&#8217;d have to add in a new hustle to account for it).<\/p>\n<p><strong>You could have a whole line-by-line list that kinda looks like this:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/gigs-for-goals-mindset.jpg\" alt=\"gigs for goals\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65811\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/gigs-for-goals-mindset.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/gigs-for-goals-mindset-300x229.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Etc. etc.\u00a0 Your 9-5 of course would cover all of this in a perfect world<\/strong> (and your &#8220;main job&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even have to BE a 9-5, it could just be the one you spend the most time on out of the handful of jobs you have) but breaking it down as to WHY, exactly, we need to be making $XX really gets your brain thinking more in depth.\u00a0 Why do we want a job making $40,000 or $60,000?\u00a0 Do those numbers themselves really get you fired up?\u00a0 Or would the idea that your house\u00a0 and car(s), and vacations and savings and play money and everything else that it GETS YOU be more exciting than the actual salary number itself? For me it&#8217;s def. the latter.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you another example:\u00a0 When I was blogging 40 hours a week and working 40 hours a week at a 9-5 at the same time, my income was pretty much doubled.\u00a0 But do you know what that meant to me whenever I said it out loud or talked it over w\/ the wife?\u00a0 Pretty much nothing. I mean &#8211; I UNDERSTOOD that $130,000 was a lot more than, say, $70,000, but if you don&#8217;t spell out what that REALLY means as far as what it gets you, it doesn&#8217;t really soak in as much.\u00a0 Do you know what DID, though?\u00a0 When I started realizing that all this <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/my-new-savings-goal\/\">extra money<\/a> meant I could one day <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/full-time-blogger-goal\/\">BLOG FULL-TIME<\/a> for myself!\u00a0 It was something that I could almost touch, and really feel like it was actually *worth something* to me. And it could have been anything else too &#8211; A new home, a new Benz, a trip around the world, whatever.\u00a0 <em><strong>It&#8217;s the &#8220;attaching&#8221; part that really hits home for a lot of us.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I remember as a kid wanting a newer car than the one my parents handed down to me, and whenever I brought it up to them or complained about how boring the car was or whatever (looking back I wish I was more grateful!), they&#8217;d always say <em>&#8220;you want a new car?\u00a0 go get a job,&#8221;<\/em> haha&#8230; it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m sure all of us has experienced growing up at some point, but the message was loud and clear:\u00a0 <strong>If you want X, you had to go out and earn $X to make it possible.<\/strong>\u00a0 It&#8217;s so simple and clear, yet I don&#8217; t think we&#8217;re used to thinking along those lines anymore as we&#8217;ve gotten to become much much older (some of us more than others ;)).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Breaking down our &#8220;wants&#8221; or &#8220;needs&#8221; so simply like this REALLY adds a whole new perspective to things.<\/strong>\u00a0 You should try it out if you haven&#8217;t done it before!\u00a0 And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m starting to separate out my own streams of money, and attaching certain jobs to specific bills and goals of mine so I can easily determine what&#8217;s WORTH doing so, and what&#8217;s not!\u00a0 Breaking it down really helps cut out the crap and junk that easily adds up in our lives too, I feel like.\u00a0 Imagine saying &#8220;You know what? I don&#8217;t want that expensive car payment anymore. I&#8217;m gonna sell it and start using my boring one again and cut out those 10 hours a week I spend upkeeping it all.&#8221;\u00a0 SEXY huh?!\u00a0 Or better yet, you could even substitute it out and apply those 10 hours of work towards something even better you&#8217;re excited about! In this way, it&#8217;s always a conscious decision you&#8217;re making.<\/p>\n<p>I think my friend is definitely on to something here. And I think we need to go back to the basics sometimes and remind ourselves as to WHY it is we&#8217;re actually working, and if the money we&#8217;re spending on things really IS worth it and aligned with our current goals at the moment.\u00a0 If I ever buy up someone&#8217;s site any time soon, I&#8217;m totally gonna use that money to start knocking off those upgrades on our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/update-mortgage-payoff-plan\/\">home improvement wish list<\/a> I giddily divulged the other week.\u00a0 I can&#8217;t justify taking out the money from any of my other &#8220;funds&#8221; going on right now, but you better believe I could apply any *extra* hustles I got going on towards it!\u00a0 And the beauty of it all is I can stop at any time and still be just fine ;)\u00a0 That&#8217;s the power of gigs for goals, baby!\u00a0 It all lies on YOUR efforts!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What would you take on an extra job for if you could right now?<\/strong>\u00a0 Would the extra hours put in *really* be worth the goal at the end?<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember how the other week I was asking if anyone had any blogs that were up for sale by any chance?\u00a0 Well the reason for&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/gigs-for-goals-my-new-favorite-mindset\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":65811,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[178,105],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-18459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-entrepreneurship","category-money-management"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Gigs for Goals - My New Favorite Mindset! | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/gigs-for-goals-my-new-favorite-mindset\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Gigs for Goals - My New Favorite Mindset! | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Remember how the other week I was asking if anyone had any blogs that were up for sale by any chance?\u00a0 Well the reason for...
