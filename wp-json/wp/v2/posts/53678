I was born in a poor family so I will never be rich, blah blah, excuse after excuse. Didn\u2019t save the whole of 2015.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2016 I looked at my account and I had -$20 in my checking and $200 in my savings. I then became serious and religiously read your articles. I was making $34k at the time. I signed up for my work 401k and IRA. Started working hard, got a raise and now I\u2019m making $37k\/year before taxes (which is not a lot of money in Chicago).<\/p>\n<p>Last year I saved $10k. This year I\u2019m targeting $20k in savings. I started side hustles and right now I also work as a dishwasher on weekends (I use the dishwashing money for utilities, transport and food). For my rent I use money from my 9-5 job. I now have 18k in savings after 15 months.<\/p>\n<p>(Hope I make sense, English is my second language.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Multi-Millionaire<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>I have been a long-time fan of your website and your monthly &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Net Worth Tracker<\/a>&#8221; posts inspired me to start calculating my own\u2026.<\/p>\n<p>I finished medical school in 2008 and resolved to have a 7-figure net worth by the time I hit 40 (which will be in 2024). This was no small goal, given the debt level I accumulated at that time (~$100,000).<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2009 when I started tracking my net worth at a grand total of $0. I worked diligently during residency (advanced training after medical school) to moonlight and retire all of my student loans. I managed to do that by the time I finished in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward again to August of 2014 and I hit my goal of a 7-figure net worth 10 years early. Finally, this brings us to my most recent net worth calculation which doubled from 3 years ago to just over $2 million (woohoo, multimillionaire status!!) at age 33.<\/p>\n<p>All of this to say that I did not accomplish this with a get-rich-quick scheme or investing everything in Google&#8217;s IPO. Low expense ratio ETF&#8217;s, healthy savings in tax-advantaged 401(k)&#8217;s and IRAs and an absolute fear and loathing of debt truly are the paths to wealth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Change Saver<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>I have been reading your fine blog for roughly a year, and first took notice after reading an article on your blog about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/money-saving-challenges-new-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saving spare change<\/a>. I had just begun the endeavor and kind of made it an experiment to see how much I could save in a year.<\/p>\n<p>Lo and behold it amounted to over $1,600.00!! I don&#8217;t intend to ever stop my coin saving now! Saving has become addictive for me!<\/p>\n<p>Next I read your article on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/find-unclaimed-money-property\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unclaimed property<\/a>, and BOOM! &#8211; I have two claims totaling $3,500.00!!!!!&#8230;.. man, it gives me pause because its SO GRATIFYING!&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>I also have another trick to save money which is also like a little hobby too &#8211; I save and collect $2 bills. [Editor&#8217;s Note: me too &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-use-2-dollar-bills-and-why\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they make great gifts\/tips<\/a>!]<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Conscious Spender<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>For years I have been telling myself that since I can\u2019t afford big ticket items right now, I may as well make myself happier in the short term by spending whatever amount of discretionary income I have.<\/p>\n<p>When it dawned on me that I could save most of that money instead \u2013 albeit in small amounts at a time \u2013 the thought actually terrified me. I felt like I was just pissing in the wind whenever I turned down some kind of instant gratification (eg. picking up lunch, drinks after work, seeing a movie) in favor of the big picture. Tbh I didn\u2019t even know if there was a big picture, putting $5 and $10 dollars into savings at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Funny how the big picture suddenly looked a lot clearer when I saw my savings hit the thousand dollar mark for the first time! I realized I wanted to do a lot of things I had told myself I could never do: own my own home being the biggie. I still have times when I doubt what\u2019s possible, but I\u2019m too scared to give up now as I never want to go back to how I did things before.<\/p>\n<p>Another spinoff? I am now way better at managing my income overall, have trimmed the budget on everything, and find myself being a lot more creative with the small amount of personal expenses I do still allow myself. I actually think I have more fun and get more stuff I want\u2026 because I am forced to think consciously about things!<\/p>\n<p>(I\u2019ve also gotten better at saying No to things like social events that I don\u2019t really want to attend. I\u2019m learning how to put my own needs first, and I enjoy it more when I do want to go out now, as I know I\u2019ve chosen to and can afford it (instead of resenting it, which was too often the case: not a great basis for one\u2019s social life!))<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>The takeaways today?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First, you have to BELIEVE IN YOURSELF<\/li>\n<li>Then you need to just *start*<\/li>\n<li>Then hustle<\/li>\n<li>And have patience<\/li>\n<li>And stay motivated<\/li>\n<li>And record your milestones<\/li>\n<li>And, ultimately, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-bad-do-you-want-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">want it bad enough<\/a> to keep going<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Almost all of these people starting with nothing, and in a matter of time completely changed things around &#8211; both in their wallets, and more importantly, in their minds.
