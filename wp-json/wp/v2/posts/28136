I poked around a bit, talked it over w\/ the wife, and settled on a solid (maybe TOO solid) plan with CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then we had a baby ;)<\/strong> <strong><\/strong>All great things emotionally, but not so much w\/ money (as you can tell from my continuously updated <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/ultimate-baby-child-costs-tracker\/\">Baby Money Tracker<\/a>! Which will be the subject of a new post here shortly&#8230;)\u00a0 And since we can&#8217;t add him to the Mrs&#8217; plan as I just mentioned, it means he had to be added to mine instead.\u00a0 Which is fine in the long run since it makes things nice and easy &#8211; and portable! &#8211; for wherever we end up moving to and all that, but getting over the initial shock of seeing my new rates were pretty frightening&#8230; you&#8217;re about to see them below, jeez&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The crazy part too is that I RARELY even used my insurance at all last year. You wanna know the total number of times I went to see a doctor? One. That&#8217;s it. Yeah it&#8217;s good I didn&#8217;t get all that sick and end up in the hospital any time last year (really good!), and that I&#8217;m super covered for the future as well especially now that I&#8217;m a parent, but it still pains me to know I spent over $3,000 in total for one simple visit to a CVS <a href=\"http:\/\/www.minuteclinic.com\/\">Minute Clinic<\/a> (which are GREAT btw). The whole insurance game is just crazy to me. I know we get jealous of all those countries who have &#8220;free&#8221; universal health care, even if they&#8217;re not 100% top notch as many are quick to point out (I don&#8217;t know anything about anything, so I just stay out of the arguments), but I will say it must be nice to at least not have to worry about it all the time.\u00a0 It&#8217;s there whenever you need it and it&#8217;s not changing every other month&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, as you can tell I hate dealing with health insurance.\u00a0<\/strong> Life insurance is fine &#8211; you rarely have to go in and make a ton of changes, as we talked about last week during the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/time-to-get-a-life-insurance-movement\/\">Life Insurance Movement<\/a> &#8211; but this one just drives me bananas. And I know I&#8217;m not alone here ;0<\/p>\n<p>Check out my payments over the past 10 or so years, and look how it&#8217;s starting to trend. Ugh.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$200\/mo<\/strong><\/span> &#8211; what I was paying 10\u00a0 years ago at my old company<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$150\/mo<\/strong><\/span> &#8211; what I was paying over the next couple of years through a different company<\/li>\n<li><strong>$0.00\/mo<\/strong> &#8211; what I was paying for at the height of the last start-up I worked for! To say we\u00a0 had some pretty killer benefits would be an understatement :)<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$280\/mo<\/strong><\/span> &#8211; what I ended up paying at the end of 2010 when all those benefits got cut and the company <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/won-lawsuit-lost-money\/\">eventually went under<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$292\/mo<\/strong><\/span> &#8211; what I started paying last year when I went out on my own through <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ehealth\">eHealth<\/a> (I ended up picking a sturdy Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, even though there were plenty of cheaper ones)<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$573\/mo<\/strong><\/span> &#8211; what the additional cost was to add Baby $ to the mix (!!!), starting last month.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$643\/mo<\/strong><\/span> &#8211; what it will cost going forward starting October 1st!\u00a0 Ugh&#8230;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>A 100% increase in the past two months!!!<\/strong> One for the baby, and one for what I can only assume is a normal yearly adjustment? Which will now cost me an additional 75 boners every month I&#8217;m insured, freakin&#8217; crazy. And a good reminder of some of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/biggest-con-working-for-yourself-work-hours\/\">the cons of working for yourself <\/a>to all you out there who&#8217;s considering the same! We enjoy a helluva lot of other <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/06\/the-6-month-anniversary-of-my-awesome-termination\/\">great benefits<\/a> like me sitting here in my boxers right now typing this (tmi?), but financially you can really get a foot up your a$$ every now and then. It&#8217;s not fun (although sometimes tax deductible).<\/p>\n<p>The only thing I enjoy out of this is the fact I&#8217;m providing for my family and supporting my wee one in all future doctor visits going forward :) That does feel awesome.\u00a0 And that I&#8217;m being a good dad to him right from the start &#8211; so I can&#8217;t complain all the way. And as I already alluded to, we ALSO have a pretty damn solid plan &#8211; the reason for such high premiums.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We have a PPO with a $600 family deductible and only 10% co-payments after that.<\/strong>\u00a0 Along with $25 office visits, and up to a yearly max of $5,000 (total) out of our pockets. So I could easily increase the deductibles and co-payments to save a good chunk every month (roughly $100 for two levels up), but knowing how often babies go to the doctors I&#8217;m gonna lay low for a bit and see what happens. Apparently your kid gets whatever terms YOUR plan provides, so if I up all my stuff to save some money, it increases the payouts for the baby too. Which scares me to death&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Now on the PLUS side, I can add as many more babies to the plan as I want without paying a penny more! Haha&#8230; WOOT. They screw you for that 1st one, but any others after they can care less ;)\u00a0 I hope they mean it cuz I&#8217;ll be gladly taking them up on that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/one-year-from-now-goals\/\">in the future<\/a>! You better believe it!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Anyone else dealing with health insurance headaches?<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 Anyone have some awesome (or even worse) plans than myself? Someone make me feel better! Haha&#8230; just kidding :) Kinda&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> To add my wife to our plan? $150 more and *doesn&#8217;t* include maternity coverage.
