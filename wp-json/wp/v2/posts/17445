Wagner<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m going in for surgery followed by a 6-week convalescence this month and I believe in the old adage, \u201cplan for the worst, hope for the best.\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0 The best case is I enjoy the awesome post-surgical drugs, guilt my family into doing all the cooking and cleaning for 6 weeks, and kick back with a pile of bon bons and trashy romance novels.\u00a0 The worst case is I die on the table and my husband liquidates my estate to buy a trophy wife.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll have to admit I haven\u2019t really planned for the worst and my husband will have a tough time implementing the trophy wife scenario due to our longstanding division of labor:\u00a0 <em><strong>I handle all the finances and my husband handles emptying the cat box.\u00a0<\/strong><\/em> This works really well for us, as I loathe cat box duty as much as my husband loathes paying the bills.\u00a0 That, btw, is a useful yardstick for many aspects of a strong marriage:\u00a0 equal loathing.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we\u2019ve been working too separately for too long&#8211;I have no idea where we keep the thingy you use to scoop poop.\u00a0 Likewise, my husband won\u2019t be able to find my will and life insurance policies.\u00a0 Although I\u2019m more than happy to remain clueless about the cat box, this lack of knowledge is likely to put a crimp in my husband\u2019s style, vis a vis the trophy wife.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Our Finances Organized and Accessible<\/h2>\n<p>So, because I love my husband and want him to have the trophy wife over my dead body, I had to get our finances organized and accessible, just in case.\u00a0 Of course I\u2019m kicking myself because it\u2019s a hassle to do this at the last minute.\u00a0 I really don\u2019t want you to have to kick yourself, and I\u2019m certainly not going to kick you (but if you want someone to kick you in the privacy of your own home I won\u2019t judge), so I thought I\u2019d share what I\u2019ve been up to.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of caveats up front:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I\u2019m assuming you have financial affairs and legal documents to organize.<\/strong> If you don\u2019t have a will, advance medical directive, appropriate powers of attorney, and appropriate life and health insurance, please don\u2019t allow yourself to become incapacitated no matter how organized you are.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be happy to nag you about this more forcefully in a future post.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Also, I am not a professional financial organizer.<\/strong>\u00a0 You would be smart to look elsewhere for tips and tools for financial organization.\u00a0 I do like to think of myself as a professional \u201clazy bones.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t spend much time, brain activity, or technology doing things the hard way.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I\u2019ve boiled my financial life down to a few simple lists and you\u2019re welcome to be even lazier and steal these lists from me.<\/p>\n<h2>List #1: Contacts<\/h2>\n<p>Make a list of important contacts a friend\/family member might want to notify in an emergency.\u00a0 Sure, you\u2019ve got all this in your cell, e-mail contacts, or an old-school address book, but how easy would it be for someone else to access the info?\u00a0\u00a0 Any of the on-line stuff is likely to be password-protected and not easy to get at.\u00a0 Your data entry system may not be as obvious as you think&#8211;how many of your loved ones will know that the Contacts entry \u201cMiserable SOB\u201d is your boss and not your ex-boyfriend?\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, even the best system may not have provide all necessary information\u2014do you want your mom to call all the doctors in your address book because she can\u2019t tell which one is your dentist, and have a lovely chat with the receptionist at the free clinic for STDs?<\/p>\n<p>Make it easy for others to help you, without knowing any more than they have to, by making a list of key contacts.\u00a0 In my list, I included my boss, my primary care doctor, my financial advisor and a few key friends\/family.\u00a0 As appropriate, I listed office\/home\/cell phone numbers, and e-mail\/web\/street addresses. \u00a0I typed this because I type faster than I write, but the information will be just as useful if you write in on the back of a napkin.\u00a0 If you have business cards for any of these folks, tape them to the list and you\u2019re done.<\/p>\n<h2>List #2:\u00a0 Accounts<\/h2>\n<p>If someone needed to help you pay your bills for a while, what would they need to know?\u00a0 Make a list of all bills including credit cards, loans, utility bills, etc.\u00a0 List the name, account number, and how you receive the bill each month (snail mail, e-mail, automatic withdrawal, etc) so they\u2019ll know what to look for.\u00a0 If you pay bills online with the vendor or through your bank, give a short explanation so they\u2019ll know where to look for that too.\u00a0 If you have the last statement for a monthly bill, you could just attach that to the list and you wouldn\u2019t have to write the info out at all.<\/p>\n<h2>List #3:\u00a0 Investments<\/h2>\n<p>If you have these, list account numbers, phone\/address, and purpose of the investment (retirement or European vacation?) on a piece of paper, or collect the last statements and label them, \u201cmy investments.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Explain how these are funded (automatic withdrawal or send them a check every month?) in case someone needs to act on your behalf for a while.<\/p>\n<h2>List #4:\u00a0 Insurance<\/h2>\n<p>Collect all your policies and label them \u201cmy insurance\u201d or write everything down.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got the idea by now.<\/p>\n<h2>List #5:\u00a0 Document locator<\/h2>\n<p>This is the Rosetta stone of your lists.\u00a0 If you\u2019re like me, your financial stuff may be in several places:\u00a0 bills in a shoebox by the bed, insurance policies in the kitchen junk drawer, and investment records in the hall closet next to the extra rolls of toilet paper.\u00a0 Or possibly filed neatly in your office.\u00a0 Either way, don\u2019t assume anyone can find your stuff without a map.\u00a0 Tell them where lists #1-4 and their associated documents are.\u00a0 Also list the location for legal items like wills and powers of attorney.\u00a0 Send this list to whoever should have it.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019ve got everything together, you\u2019ll want to store some of this stuff in a safe place.\u00a0 You could literally put it all in one sock and I for one would salute you, but there are other options.\u00a0 Safe deposit boxes are the gold standard, but banks are pretty strict about who can get into your box.\u00a0 In an emergency, you want to make it easy for others to get your stuff and the whole point of a bank is to make it hard for others to get your stuff.\u00a0 A home safe is a good option, as long as someone else has a key and you the money to spend on a safe. The easiest option of all is to put everything in a folder labeled, \u201cImportant financial documents\u201d and leave it on the top of your desk, but that also makes it easy for identity thieves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s the best idea of all<\/strong>:\u00a0 store everything in your fridge!\u00a0 Refrigerators are so sturdy and well-insulated they can withstand most fire and natural disasters.\u00a0 Identity thieves would never think to look in your fridge.\u00a0 (Note to identity thieves reading BAS: of course this is a joke; move along now, nothing to see in my refrigerator).\u00a0 Do make sure you list your storage location on #5, because your friends won\u2019t think to look in the fridge either.\u00a0 I wish I could take credit for this awesome idea, but I got it from the lawyer who prepared my will.\u00a0 It was almost worth thinking about my future mortality to get this tip.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It took me a couple of hours to get my stuff together,<\/strong> and an hour with my husband to show him around and convince him on-line bill paying was not as \u201cnew-fangled\u201d as he thought. \u00a0It should take no more than 30 minutes to review the lists once a year to keep them current.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a flashy system, but it\u2019s worth the time I spent on it.\u00a0 <strong><em>How organized are YOU guys for an emergency?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/08\/what-old-people-know-money\/\">Barbara \u201cBabs\u201d Wagner<\/a> is a former poster child for financial misadventure, who learned most of what she knows the hard way.\u00a0 With all her $tuff in one sock in the fridge, she is happily laying in a big supply of bon bons and trashy romance novels.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:<\/strong>\u00a0 Get well soon friend!!
