Simple&#8230;we wanted to spend less time working and needed a cheaper location in order to accomplish that. Easily done? Not exactly. Here\u2019s the gist of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m a former executive producer\/business owner and spent many years and LOTS of\u00a0 hours climbing to success in the advertising and entertainment industries. My wife (a former film\/tv editor) and I created multiple successful businesses (with our close friends and business partners), which provided an \u201cenviable\u201d big city lifestyle. We even won a couple Emmys, which pleasantly validated all our hard work!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63347 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2_Emym_photo__jpg_LixWlMbw.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2_Emym_photo__jpg_LixWlMbw.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2_Emym_photo__jpg_LixWlMbw-300x147.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(The Sonic Highways billboard on Sunset Blvd. And our audio team with their Emmys for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">THEN\u2026.we kissed it all goodbye to start a new life. At the ages of 38 (Kristin) and 43 (Joe), we left our stressful big city careers and (eventually) relocated to a charming Florida beach town where we knew no one, but were able to raise our 3-year-old son full time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We traded in time spent on work, for time spent together (such a cute tagline. I literally tear up every time I read that. Ok, not every time). Now we refer to ourselves as \u201csemi-retired\u201d, and living \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.playlouder.com\/early-financial-independence-life-in-4-acts-not-just-3\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Act 3 of a 4 Act Life<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The (Hot) Financial Details\u2026.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being that this website thinks budgets are sexy, I&#8217;m going to just get to the sexy part, and save the rest of the story for pillow talk (creepy yes, but funny).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you who fantasize about a good \u201cbelt-tightening,\u201d you\u2019ll be happy to know that moving to Florida has reduced our overall monthly expenses by about 60%. Really. It went from an average of $21,060 per month to $8,420!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little background on the data: These numbers are not a \u201cguesstimate,\u201d they are <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actual expenditures<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For LA we used a monthly average of 2017, and for FL we used a monthly average of 2019. We didn&#8217;t use 2018 because we moved three times and lived in LA, Austin and FL. It was not a consistent comparison.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most every area of our life is cheaper here, but not all by 60%. And we do spend more on discretionary because we have more free time..yah! The biggest reductions in spending are our housing payment and child care costs. Plus we also have <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tried<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to corral our spending a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Here\u2019s Some Info on the Main Areas Where We Are Saving&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Child care costs are way less because we went from a full-time nanny to a full-time mom with some preschool. We would have eventually switched to school in LA, but not as soon. With Kristin working full-time, we would not have been able to do that until kindergarten, and then still would have needed after school care. It\u2019s also likely that our son\u2019s amazing Waldorf school here would cost 2x more in LA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other major reduction is housing. With the sale of our LA home and some other real estate, we are able to own our house outright here, so the out-of-pocket expense is only taxes and insurance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taxes are higher here, on a percentage basis, but house prices are significantly lower. Insurance is also higher here because hurricane coverage is mandatory and you really need flood insurance as well. In LA, earthquake was not mandatory, but we had it&#8230;so insurance is about the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We switched to getting groceries at Walmart instead of Whole Foods and Amazon. Walmart has nearly every organic item we want and it\u2019s all cheaper&#8230;and they deliver. There is the moral dilemma of Walmart having low-paid employees and using a deplorable amount of plastic bags (among other things I\u2019m sure), but it\u2019s definitely cheaper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t have a housekeeper anymore (which sucks). We really liked having a housekeeper, and we needed it in LA because of our schedules. But it cost us over $500 a month. Now we clean our house and do our own laundry (it&#8217;s tough&#8230;hahaha). Honestly, we may get a housekeeper again, but it would only be once a month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We only have one car now. This is possible because I work from home and Kristin is mostly with our son or blogging while he\u2019s at school (three half-days per week). When we end up in the rare car bind, I just Uber. With the invention of ride services, many people could go down to one car and save money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other smaller ways we are saving a bit include buying less new clothing, ditching regular cable, switching to a cheaper mobile phone plan, buying fewer toys and skipping nail salons.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Take a Look at the Full Expense Comparison Below\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(FYI&#8230;You can download this data (along with a budget version), and get a walk-thru video, by signing up for this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.playlouder.com\/courses\/personal-budgeting-basics-free\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Personal Budgeting Basics Course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63351\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/New-budget-Joe-Disanto.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1660\" height=\"1686\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/New-budget-Joe-Disanto.png 1660w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/New-budget-Joe-Disanto-295x300.png 295w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/New-budget-Joe-Disanto-1008x1024.png 1008w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/New-budget-Joe-Disanto-768x780.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/New-budget-Joe-Disanto-1512x1536.png 1512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1660px) 100vw, 1660px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Some Additional Thoughts Beyond the Numbers&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we\u2019re very diligent about tracking our spending, we\u2019ll be the first to admit we are not the most <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">frugal<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> people. We (luckily) made enough money in LA to prioritize convenience over extreme frugality (which will cost you a lot).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We often didn&#8217;t have too much choice however, with our demanding work schedules. Plus, when we had free time we didn&#8217;t always feel like employing \u201cfrugal restraint!\u201d But now that we are living less hectic and excessive lives, it\u2019s easier to save.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>So How Did We Pull This Big Change Off?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of financial planning, many good investments (mostly real estate), and a healthy fear of life passing us by before we actually got a chance to live it. But even with most of our financial ducks in a row, I will admit that it\u2019s not an <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> thing to do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also worth mentioning that it took about 1.5 years from when we fully committed to this idea, to the actual departure from the airport on July 31, 2018. Extracting yourself from your life of 20 years involves a lot of functional planning and \u201cuntangling\u201d of yourself from the web you have built around you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, I will admit that we really didn&#8217;t have groundbreaking ideas about how we were going to make money after we left LA. We had a vague plan to \u201cstart a blog.\u201d (Hey&#8230;you have to tell yourself something.) Our hope was that whatever we did for work, it would at best be more passive and at least be mobile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We did, however, have enough savings that we were comfortable kind of winging it for a year and figuring it out. I realize this may sound irresponsible, but because I keep detailed accounts of our finances, I knew exactly how much money we had to work with.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Forcing Change Can Create New Opportunities<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, when I initially discussed my departure with my business partners, they were interested in having me continue to do financial management from afar, for a monthly consulting fee.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was welcome news and something I was more than excited to keep doing (because it gave me a little income to start).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then (more) luckily, after leaving, other friends (who owned similar companies) asked me if I would be interested in doing similar work for them. Now I have 5 businesses and 2 individual clients in this capacity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Some Passive(ish) Income<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have a handful of rental properties which produce some <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/get-your-cash-flow-up-baby\/\">cash flow<\/a>. It\u2019s been a crap shoot every year on how much cash that is, but it provides a bit. Around $1200\/month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, we have realized some revenue from real estate this past year selling existing properties, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.playlouder.com\/case-study-9610-newberry\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in Austin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.playlouder.com\/case-study-8100-e-91st-ter\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another in Kansas City<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-vs-stocks-a-real-life-look-at-returns\/\">reality that the equity in our remaining real estate<\/a>, and the money in our retirement accounts, is growing. So we figure if we\u2019re only breaking even on our life in general, then we should be ok in the long run. Time will tell of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Throwing in a Little Long Game<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, while blogging (or what I prefer to call the \u201cbusiness of education by individuals\u201d) on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.playlouder.com\/blog\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Play Louder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may have great income possibilities, it seems to be a pretty serious long game.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing informed and valuable lessons takes time, and I\u2019m not working 70 hours per week right now. But, I\u2019m really enjoying working on some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.playlouder.com\/courses-page\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">killer finance and real estate courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will hopefully add knowledge and value to people\u2019s lives. I believe, in time, the blog will definitely produce some additional income.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Did We Choose Our Small Town?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a very weird way&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our initial plan for this life changing journey was to move to Austin TX. Here\u2019s a funny (not really) story about how we initially moved to Austin&#8230;promptly had an existential meltdown&#8230;and \u201cchanged our life\u201d again just 88 days later. Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the idea with going to Austin was that there was a market for our work experience there, if we needed it (but we were also hoping to make a work-from-home scenario happen). We also had a rental property there that we thought we could fix up and then live in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long story medium, WE PICKED THE WRONG TOWN! The live music scene in Austin was really the only thing we liked about it (and the cheap Lonestar beer.) So after we completed our renovation, we put the house up for sale, packed up the family and moved halfway across the country&#8230;AGAIN!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(By the way, I wouldn\u2019t at ALL recommend moving across the country twice&#8230;in three months&#8230;WITH A TODDLER! But if you DO find this ever happens to you, I highly recommend the book <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3pH9Jw9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201clife\u2019s purpose,\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this insight timer course on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/insighttimer.com\/meditation-courses\/course_the-power-of-gratitude-to-enrich-your-life\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cgratitude,\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Happy-Dalai-Lama\/dp\/B00BRA7GI6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">documentary about happiness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So where did we find our new small town dream? Well, that&#8217;s a very unusual story involving the internet. We really didn&#8217;t know where to go. When you\u2019re not driven to a place by either family or work, it\u2019s actually surprisingly hard to \u201cknow where to go.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We knew we wanted to be near the water and that we wanted a town with a charming main street.

Reasonably priced homes, lower <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/annual-property-tax-bill\/\">property tax<\/a>, hopefully no income tax, walkable, decent schools, etc etc. It\u2019s hard to get all these things in one town!\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then we said to ourselves, \u201cWell we need to go visit these places!\u201d Problem was that at that time we only had about 1.5 months left on our Airbnb, and we still had a renovation to complete before that date arrived.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, we picked the town that seemed the most promising, and went for 5 days&#8230;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.visitstpeteclearwater.com\/video\/exploring-delightful-dunedin\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dunedin, FL<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty hard to decide if you want to move somewhere in a few days, but we were not staying in Austin&#8230;and we didn&#8217;t have time to visit anywhere else on the list so&#8230; Dunedin it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63348 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5_Dunedin_jpg_MhquZjC4-e1601601078123.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"356\" height=\"512\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, Dunedin turned out to be a wonderful place to live.

When you do, you begin to feel a weight lifted off your shoulders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my favorite stories to tell is how back in LA, I didn\u2019t have as much time to spend with my son.

It brought tears to my eyes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what he was saying was that I actually spent quality time with him now, and he was able to form a real relationship with me. Before, I was so scattered, and always thinking about work. Now I\u2019m actually being present with my son, and we have a legit relationship.
