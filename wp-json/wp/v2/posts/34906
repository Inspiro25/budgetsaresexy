And that&#8217;s not a good place to be when you need to be hustlin&#8217; up a storm and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/net-worth-update-down-40k-10-percent-loss\/\">bringing back up that income<\/a> :)<\/p>\n<p>So lately I&#8217;ve been throwing around ways I could fix this, even if temporarily, and so far these are the ones that have come to mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start working away from home &#8211; like at a coffee shop or shared office space<\/li>\n<li>Find a project I can work on with OTHER people, preferably face-to-face<\/li>\n<li>Find a fun &#8220;real&#8221; job chock full of office gossip and new challenges (of which you don&#8217;t bring home!)<\/li>\n<li>Start working down my list of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/03\/10-awesome-jobs-to-try-some-day\/\">top 10 jobs to try one day<\/a> :)<\/li>\n<li>Pitch companies to *create* a job for me and\/or hire me as a consultant. Places like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa\">USAA<\/a>, but perhaps a bit less corporate so I don&#8217;t get in trouble &#8220;being me&#8221;?<\/li>\n<li>Take a vacation and don&#8217;t do anything drastic<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m sure the answer is that last one<\/strong>, but I gotta admit I&#8217;m starting to like the idea of maybe working for someone else again too. While still rockin&#8217; BudgetsAreSexy of course like back in the good ol&#8217; days :) A weird reversal of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">side hustles<\/a>! Haha&#8230; It would probably feel like going backwards a little in the career department, but really who cares in the end if it makes you happy.<\/p>\n<p>Truth is, I suffer from the effects of growing up in a military household. My brain still works like this: &#8220;Bored? Move!&#8221; &#8220;Already moved? Get a new job!&#8221; &#8220;Already have a new job? Get a new ____!&#8221; :) That ____, btw, used to be &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; but for good measure that&#8217;s now out of the options, haha&#8230;. There&#8217;s a reason why I used to change jobs every 2 years and go from wanting to live in a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/think-you-could-live-in-a-houseboat\/\">Houseboat<\/a> to a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/10\/think-could-live-in-hotel-pros-cons-living\/\">Hotel<\/a>, and then recently, an <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/02\/pros-cons-rving-across-country-how-to-do-it\/\">RV<\/a>. Change = excitement!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Just for $hits and giggles, though, I spent 2 hours last night scouring the job boards for stuff I found interesting.<\/strong> I started with &#8220;etc&#8221; jobs on Craigslist just cuz there&#8217;s always hilarious ways to make some side money there, then moved on to bartender gigs open in the area (which I have no experience in, but figured there&#8217;s gotta be a way to wiggle in?), and then stumbled across some social media opportunities. Which a) never existed 10 years ago when I last job searched, and b) would probably be the best use of my time and assets if I was being smart about the whole thing :)<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t want to waste anyone&#8217;s time so I didn&#8217;t apply to any of them or anything, but it was a fun way to pass the time and get my brain to be *open* again and not so adamant that working for yourself is the ultimate end all be all. Yeah self-employment has a ton of great perks, but it also has its set of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/biggest-con-working-for-yourself-work-hours\/\">drawbacks<\/a> too. And I&#8217;ve been just as happy working for other people as I have myself (just maybe not as well compensated or given as much freedom as I please ;)) It&#8217;s not for everyone, that&#8217;s for sure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think the trick is just figuring out *what* in life actually makes you happy, and then working to achieve it no matter how many times it changes.<\/strong> Remember that post I did on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/game-boys-and-401ks\/\">how I really wanted a Nintendo Game Boy<\/a> back in the day, but then once I had the money to get one I wanted something else different? I feel like it&#8217;s a lot like that. One day you want X and another you can want Y. It&#8217;s when you *don&#8217;t go after it* that you start having problems.<\/p>\n<p>Anywho, another thought I had &#8211; which I alluded to above &#8211; was maybe reaching out to companies I like or whom I think I could help, and then pitching my own job or consulting their way. And starting it off with some sort of lunch or taking them out for beers\/coffee to get to know each other more :) I was never one to get a job by merely submitting a resume anyways, and since I don&#8217;t think the &#8220;perfect job&#8221; exists online (mainly cuz I don&#8217;t even know what that is! Haha&#8230; other than blogging, of course), it may be a fun test to try. Worst case they ignore you or you even meet some cool people. Who may or may not keep you in mind for the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reminds me of the time I wanted to intern at an Advertising agency back in the college days<\/strong>, but everyone said the only way to get their attention is to be creative. (Which makes sense, right? Being that you&#8217;re reaching out to ad folks?). Well, the best thing I could think of was shooting a note to all the presidents of the agencies on my list (ranging from LA to NYC), that went something along the lines of a Mission Impossible theme:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[Subject:] Your mission, if you choose to accept it.<\/p>\n<p>Who: J. Money (not what I really put)<br \/>\nWhat: An internship this Summer at your agency<br \/>\nWhere: Your agency<br \/>\nWhen: This Summer<\/p>\n<p>Why: Because I&#8217;m awesome&#8230;. (actually don&#8217;t remember exactly what I put there, but I know it was something good and listed all my qualifications cuz I got a decent number of responses back ;))<\/p>\n<p>You have 24 hours to email me or this message will self-destruct&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now that I read it out loud it does come come off kinda cheesy, haha, but if I recall correctly I got a personal message back from 3 pretty decent firms back then. One said something like &#8220;Already staffed, but good job getting my attention&#8221;, the other &#8220;let&#8217;s set up an interview&#8221; (not sure how that one ended because I don&#8217;t remember doing the interview?) and the third one, &#8220;You have 24 hours to call me back and the job is yours.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>It was that last one that made me happiest :)<\/strong> Now unfortunately I didn&#8217;t check my email until a few hours after those 24 expired (I was probably out partying or doing something equally non-productive), and when I heard back the second time it wasn&#8217;t as exciting. It went something like, &#8220;Too late &#8211; you missed your chance&#8221; and that was that.<\/p>\n<p>Woops.<\/p>\n<p>But I did learn an important lesson that day: <em>It&#8217;s all about getting people&#8217;s attention.<\/em> Whether for a job interview, a hot date, or any other type of opportunity you&#8217;re shooting for. You&#8217;ve got to stand out one way or the other from the crowd and do so in a way that closely fits their style. Else you&#8217;ll just go right into that pile with all the other hopefuls on standby&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think I&#8217;ve digressed from the point of today&#8217;s post :)<\/strong> Which I&#8217;m guessing is this: when you find yourself antsy, do something about it. It applies to your career as much as with finances, and the worst thing you can do is sit and wallow in it. (Well, first I advise wallowing at least for a few hours, but then after THAT sucking it up and doing something about it,\u00a0 haha&#8230; you can&#8217;t be &#8220;on&#8221; all the time!)<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see what all this job searching leads to, but for now it feels good to be at least <em>talking<\/em> about it. If you know of a place that can use some J. Money up in that biz, give your boy a shout!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/romantm\/\">romantm<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the weather around us right now, the fact I&#8217;m getting bored working at home all by myself, or because I&#8217;m&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/self-employed-with-ants-in-my-pants\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[45,5],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-34906","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-career","category-life"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Self-Employed with Ants in My Pants | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/self-employed-with-ants-in-my-pants\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Self-Employed with Ants in My Pants | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the weather around us right now, the fact I&#8217;m getting bored working at home all by myself, or because I&#8217;m...
