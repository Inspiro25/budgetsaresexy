Like all dogs, she&#8217;s the best dog &#8212; apologies to the logicians out there. Sadie is going to show us a dog\u2019s guide to personal finance. It&#8217;s gimmicky, but there will be plenty of dog pictures. And even I was surprised by some of the obvious corollaries. Let&#8217;s embark! (Get it?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63198 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-1-716x1024.png\" alt=\"Legendary personal finance dog posing for the camera!\" width=\"278\" height=\"398\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>Bury It For Later<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dogs like treats. About a quarter of the time, Sadie will take her treat, her bone, her new shiny toy, and bury it. She does it in stealth mode. I don&#8217;t catch her in the act. All I find is a dog&#8217;s attempt at refilling a hole, and zero attempt at actually fixing the landscaping &#8212; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c&#8217;mon Sadie!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For humans, burying cash in the ground isn&#8217;t smart. And neither is burying food (unless you&#8217;re hoping to let some seeds flourish). But what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> smart is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proverbially<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> burying your cash into an <\/span><b>emergency fund<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or saving for later in life via a <\/span><b>long-term investment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency funds and long-term investing are two different ways of saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need this <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bone<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> money today, but I think I&#8217;ll need it someday in the future.&#8221; Sadie is smart!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what&#8217;s the difference between an emergency fund and long-term investing? <\/span><b>Liquidity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That&#8217;s a fancy way of describing how quickly you can get your money when you need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63199 \" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-2-576x1024.png\" alt=\"Dog demonstrating saving money\" width=\"285\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-2-576x1024.png 576w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-2-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-2-768x1365.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-2-864x1536.png 864w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-2.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An emergency fund should be highly liquid, meaning you could access it right away if needed. That&#8217;s why many people keep their emergency fund in a high-yield savings account (HYSA). This is most similar to Sadie&#8217;s buried bone. It&#8217;s ready for retrieval at a moment&#8217;s notice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But long-term investing is a choice designed for 10, 20, or even 30+ years in the future. Some long-term accounts &#8212; like a 401(k) &#8212; might actually penalize you if you try to access your money before a certain age. Before you bury that long-term bone, you&#8217;ve got to be <\/span><b>sure<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you don&#8217;t want it anytime soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know life is short &#8212;<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/bestinterest.blog\/memento-mori\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">memento mori<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0&#8212; but saving money for later is a worthwhile safety net.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Automation<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadie&#8217;s habits are second nature. She eats breakfast and dinner at regular times. She has her afternoon nap. And her morning nap, her late morning nap, and her post-dinner nap. The same regularity applies to high-energy playtime and nature&#8217;s calls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suffice to say, Sadie&#8217;s routine is pretty automated. Not electronically automated, but naturally automated. She doesn&#8217;t have to think twice about her essentials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63200\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-3.png\" alt=\" two dogs on a bed\" width=\"450\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-3.png 1600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-3-300x181.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-3-1024x618.png 1024w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-3-768x464.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-3-1536x927.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For us humans, electronic automation in your finances has been proven (by science!) to be beneficial for your bottom line. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Thaler<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> won a Nobel Prize for his work on this topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some simple examples of personal finance automation?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Bill pay<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Every month, I pay my mortgage, utilities, and a few other smaller bills automatically.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Investment contributions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I deduct 401(k) contributions from my paycheck automatically. I contribute to my Roth IRA and brokerage account automatically. Don&#8217;t think twice, it&#8217;s alright.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Funding my &#8220;future spending&#8221; accounts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I&#8217;ve got a few different &#8220;future expenditures&#8221; that I&#8217;m saving up for. Vacations, Christmas gifts, the undeniable truth that my beloved Toyota will eventually eat the dust and be replaced. I use my budget to automatically set aside money every month to fund these eventual expenditures.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t let the stress of finances affect your nap time. Sadie sure doesn&#8217;t. Just automate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Identify Mistakes, Then Learn From Them<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We already covered that Sadie is the best dog. But, sometimes the best dog is a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bad dog! <\/span><\/i><b><i>Bad dog!<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, Sadie is very aware when she&#8217;s been a bad dog. She reads human body language like a blaring neon sign. <\/span><b>OWNER UPSET, OWNER UPSET, RED ALEERRRRRTTT!!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Sadie shines in this regard is that she learns from those mistakes. Her emotional if-then circuitry is on-point. <\/span><b>IF<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> poop on floor makes owner upset, <\/span><b>THEN<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> no poop on floor makes owner happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, we humans like to muddle up this simple logic when it comes to our personal finance. <\/span><b>IF <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buying speaker system leads to credit card debt, <\/span><b>THEN <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buying new Corvette is good investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait&#8230;huh?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half the battle is simply learning what&#8217;s smart and what isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve written before that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bestinterest.blog\/secret-sauce\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personal finance is a dense jungle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but the trail through the jungle is well-defined. If you&#8217;re unsure about the smart path through your personal finance jungle, odds are that the right answers are already out there. You just have to go find them a.k.a. use Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then once you find the right answers, you&#8217;ve got to execute! Take your knowledge and put it into action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadie has thousands of years of &#8220;human = master&#8221; evolution guiding her to better behaviors. Your psychology is much more complex. It might take some practice to re-wire your brain towards the best financial behaviors. That re-wiring, my friend, is what learning is all about.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Keep on Smelling. Stay Curious.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every hole. Every pole. Dead moles and stale rolls. Sadie will smell anything and everything. And once in a while, that persistence pays off. Last week she found a piece of hamburger in the yard, fallen off a plate the night prior. Jackpot! Even when she hits a cold streak of olfactory failure, she keeps on smelling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63203\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie.png\" alt=\"dog smelling tree\" width=\"451\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie.png 512w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-300x246.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see two corollaries to personal finance. And no, it doesn&#8217;t involve sniffing fresh $100 bills for that &#8220;new money scent.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first lesson is to keep searching until you find what works for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started budgeting right when I entered professional life. I used an Excel spreadsheet, but found it clunky. After some sputtering, I eventually found Mint. I enjoyed Mint more than my spreadsheet, but found Mint&#8217;s automatic categorization inconsistent. And so Mint fell by the wayside too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet my budgeting itch still tingled. I didn&#8217;t enjoy being unaware of where my dollars were going. Like Sadie, I kept on sniffing for success. What are other people using, I wondered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I found<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/you-need-a-budget-ynab-review\/\"><b>YNAB<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Queue the angelic music. YNAB isn&#8217;t for everyone, but it&#8217;s certainly for me. All the app asks is that you follow a few simple rules &#8212; which turn out to be great habits. And the result is that you receive full knowledge of where <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dollar you own is going. You can easily track<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\"><b>your net worth<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I credit YNAB with saving me hundreds of dollars <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every month<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially when I first started using it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the second lesson from Sadie&#8217;s sniffs is simply to remain curious. For you, it&#8217;s more about your personal finance education than holes in the ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example: just Google &#8220;Buy vs. Rent.&#8221; It&#8217;s a classic question for the young professional. Do I buy a home, or rent an apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answers you find will be diverse, conflicting, educational, confusing (and confused), simple, complex, etc. A thousand bloggers &#8212; and even a couple experts! &#8212; have their opinions whether renting or buying is best and why. And within all those opinions, you&#8217;ll find some kernels of truth that apply directly to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sticking with the first answer you find is unlikely to lead you to the best answer. Stay curious, keep learning, and understand why certain answers are what they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Don&#8217;t Binge Your Resources<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ok, Sadie is still working on this one. Left to her own devices, Sadie will eat a cup of kibble in about 17 seconds, and then promptly look at me for more. Since I want her to maintain her sleek build, I resist her puppy eyes. But it&#8217;s tough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way, Sadie&#8217;s consumption reminds me of a common financial cautionary tale. Maybe you&#8217;re already familiar with it. The trope involves someone spending the majority of their paycheck as soon as they get paid, only to then look elsewhere &#8212; presumably with puppy eyes &#8212; in need of more money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t spend all your money in one fell swoop. In food, we&#8217;d call that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rationing<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In money, it&#8217;s called <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">budgeting<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t really need to explain it any further. You get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Give When You Can, Take When There&#8217;s Enough<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: This is just one stranger&#8217;s (a.k.a my) opinion. Don&#8217;t take it as gospel. And don&#8217;t feel like you need to listen to a dog nor a biased dog-owner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We first got Sadie as a foster in May 2020 (yeah, we &#8220;foster failed,&#8221; adopting her ourselves). She was a stray in Houston, found on the street along with her three 6-week old puppies. We (and Sadie) took care of those puppies for another two weeks until they all got adopted out. Yay!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63201\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-5.png\" alt=\"puppies on a step\" width=\"449\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-5.png 512w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-5-300x224.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Sadie arrived, she weighed 26 pounds. This (still) makes me sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadie&#8217;s food intake (a.k.a. street scraps) and energy stores went towards feeding her kids. Not enough was left for Sadie. She was just following her natural hormonal protocol &#8212; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feed the babies<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It probably wasn&#8217;t what humans would consider a &#8220;conscious choice.&#8221; Nevertheless, Sadie gave a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lot<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then she came to our home. We were able to give her plenty of dog kibble, but also eggs, sweet potato, pumpkin, cottage cheese &#8230; lots of high-calorie foods that are recommended to help dogs add weight. And Sadie took advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She&#8217;s now a healthy 41 pounds. Her fur looks great. She goes on boat rides and camps in the woods. Her name-tag petitions readers to &#8220;Rub My Belly!&#8221;&#8211; it\u2019s her favorite! She\u2019s a long way from the streets of Houston. Great success!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63202\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-6.png\" alt=\"happy dog on a hike\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-6.png 1600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-6-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-6-1024x768.png 1024w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-6-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sadie-6-1536x1152.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of us (you know, humans) find ourselves on both sides of this story at one time or another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes we&#8217;ve got enough resources to give them away freely. To lend a hand. To volunteer. Helping others. To give to charity. To rub a belly in need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At other times, we&#8217;re the underweight momma dog looking for any port (pork?) in the storm. And if there are enough eggs and cottage cheese to go around, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with taking full advantage of that meal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a dog knows to pay it forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Tail End<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s nap time for me.
