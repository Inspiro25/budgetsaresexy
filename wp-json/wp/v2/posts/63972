I like to read boring terms and conditions, geek out on all our tax stuff, deal with real estate, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a passion for personal finance, which helps! She does not &#8212; and I don\u2019t blame her as most people find this shit boring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, this morbid thought came to mind \u2026<\/span><b> If I die before we\u2019re financially independent, my wife might have a hard time converting our \u201ccouples FIRE plan\u201d into a \u201csingle person\u2019s FIRE plan.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking about death isn\u2019t fun, and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">planning<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for it is even worse. But hey, we all die someday. And with the increased shark sightings at my local surf spot recently, maybe I\u2019ll be gone sooner rather than later. &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f; Bad joke &#8212; sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until now, I haven\u2019t done much estate planning. Since we don\u2019t have kids yet and no big debts, I\u2019ve kind of just assumed that when I die, my wife would be fine financially. She\u2019s certainly capable of figuring stuff out on her own (10x my smarts). But because our portfolio landscape is a little messy right now (various real estate investments, random bank\/credit card churning, multiple retirement accounts, etc.), maybe it\u2019s time I start documenting some of this stuff and coming up with a formal plan that would help her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I started writing down some changes my wife would want to make to streamline our (her) finances when I am no longer in the picture. Our overall FI strategy wouldn\u2019t change that much (Coast FI), but having some written plans is never a bad idea &#8212; especially for someone dealing with grief of a lost loved one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a draft letter, which is just a starting-off point. This coming year I\u2019m going to prioritize more official estate plans, including a will, proper records, and all that grow-up stuff I should have started years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***BTW\u2026 As I was researching some of this estate planning stuff, I came across 2 much more thorough articles you might want to check out. <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lhlic.com\/consumer-resources\/what-to-do-when-someone-dies\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checklist for when a spouse dies<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/retirement\/letter.aspx\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write this letter to your family before you\u2019re gone.<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Things to Do With Our Money If I Die<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDear beautiful wife,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So sorry I broke my promise to live until we\u2019re both 100&#8230; And I\u2019m even more sorry about the financial shitshow I\u2019m leaving behind! Hopefully, this letter will help you clean up the mess, simplify our stuff, and help you create a new\/clean plan moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Things to Do Immediately<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing! Honestly, there\u2019s nothing you need to worry about within the first few weeks of my death.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have enough cash in our checking accounts to live for a few months.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your name is on ALL our cash accounts as a joint owner.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ALL our credit cards are on auto-pay.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ALL our bills and utilities are on auto-pay.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ALL our properties and syndications are cash flow positive with rent auto-deposited into our accounts.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So don\u2019t freak out or worry about money right away. Nothing needs to be handled urgently.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Things to Do Within ~1 Month<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you can do anything with our (your) accounts, you\u2019ll probably need to show the bank\/brokerage\/etc some paperwork, like official copies of my death certificate and our marriage certificate. A copy of our marriage certificate is with this letter! But you\u2019ll have to order my death certificate from the city or county. Order a few of them. You might be surprised how often you have to give someone this document.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To start taking action, contact the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/benefits\/survivors\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Security<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Admin office and report my death. You can do this over the phone (1-800-772-1213) or in person at an office.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we have a child, you are eligible for monthly survivor benefits of $2,132 per month starting right now, until the kid is 16! Also, the child gets $2,132 per month. <\/span><b>So in total, you\u2019ll receive $4,264 per month.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we don\u2019t have children, you\u2019ll only get survivor benefits when you reach retirement age. ~It\u2019s like $2,843 per month starting when you\u2019re 67.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, (this is optional, totally up to you) <\/span><b>withdraw $20k &#8211; $50k in cash<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from our taxable brokerage account (TD). You will need to sell some stock to do this &#8212; just call the TD Ameritrade number and they will walk you through it. Transfer this cash into our checking account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use this cash to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover funeral costs (Don\u2019t do anything fancy &#8211; just throw a massive party and invite all our friends! Maybe fly my fam out from Australia?)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time off work, as much as you need. 6 months, 1 year, or longer, it\u2019s up to you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This cash will cover living expenses (auto-pays the credit cards)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please don\u2019t feel bad for taking time off work and spending our money. Spending $50k only puts a tiny dent in our overall net worth and won\u2019t majorly derail any of your early retirement plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Things to Do Within 1 &#8211; 3 Months<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Log into our Mint.com account, and you\u2019ll see a list of all our assets, accounts, credit cards, etc. These are also all listed in our Net Worth spreadsheet. Here is what to do with each of them:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Checking Accounts: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you are listed as the primary beneficiary on all my accounts (100%), you don\u2019t need to go through the probate process. Just call the bank directly and change them into your name. For any old account with a $0 balance, just close the account completely. You probably only need 1 main checking account going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Credit Cards: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorry we have so many, you really only need 1 going forward! Contact all of the banks and credit card companies and cancel the cards in my name with a $0 balance. These are old and no longer needed. You just need 1 main CC going forward \u2192 whatever one you decide, just make sure bills are auto-paid from the main checking account each month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Investment Accounts:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Again, for the ones in my name, you are listed as the primary beneficiary (100%). You can deal with the banks\/brokers directly to change the names without going through probate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joint brokerage:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Change this into your sole name. Should be easy-peasy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>My IRA:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They will convert this into an \u201cinherited IRA.\u201d Don\u2019t touch this account, just let it grow until the year 2045. (That\u2019s when I would have turned 60). There will be about ~$1M in this account by then. You\u2019ll be taxed when you withdraw this later in life, so do it in small amounts annually as needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Roth:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As my spouse (and listed primary beneficiary) you can just change this account into your name, and it will be treated as if it was yours all along! (Ideally, try to consolidate my Roth with your existing Roth!) This is called a \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/roth-ira-beneficiary-rules-4770500\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spousal Transfer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d. Remember, Roths grow tax-free so leave the assets in this account alone as long as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>HSA: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same as the Roth \u2192 do a \u201cSpousal Transfer\u201d and this now becomes your HSA account. Let it grow tax free as long as you can for future medical costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Gift accounts for nephews:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This money technically isn\u2019t ours, it\u2019s owned by our nephews. But since they are still minors, an adult custodian must be assigned (me currently). My advice would be to change the custodian to the kids\u2019 parents \u2192 get the management off your plate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Physical Rentals:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Contact xxxx at xxxx management company and she\u2019ll help you transfer the titles into your name. Since we have joint ownership, when I die, the ownership should revert to you as the sole survivor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Syndications:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The full list of contacts is *here.* Notify everyone and ask them how to change the ownership into your name. The private partnership agreements make this pretty easy and your name is listed on most of the shares anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Things to Do Within 3 Months &#8211; 1 Year<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set an appointment with our tax guy, xxxxxx. Tell him everything that\u2019s going on, the changes you\u2019re making with our assets and ask him what forms to save and collect. He\u2019ll help file your taxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">List and sell all the physical rental properties. Xxxxx will help you do this! Put all the sale proceeds into our TD brokerage account. Invest everything in VTI, just like all the other money in there. (This is optional, of course. But I think you\u2019ll be much better off owning no physical real estate.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure out the DMV process to put the Prius in your name. Here\u2019s a list of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dmv.ca.gov\/portal\/vehicle-registration\/new-registration\/special-circumstances\/handling-a-deceased-persons-dmv-matters\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forms and paperwork<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you might need for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact my retirement broker in Australia. I have about $30k down there in a retirement account and you are the non-contingent beneficiary. I believe you are able to \u201cwithdraw\u201d these funds as a lump sum, being that you are not an Australian citizen. My parents can help you research and figure out that crap. If you\u2019re able to get the funds out, move the money to the U.S., stick it in your brokerage and buy VTI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Things to Do Between Years 1 &#8211; 5<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve got some good news and bad news\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bad news is, we are not financially independent yet. So you\u2019ll have to continue working at some point, and growing our (your) retirement nest egg.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is, you have a 1M+ net worth, which gives you considerable momentum! If you can cover your basic living expenses and leave all the investment accounts untouched, you will probably retire before your 45th birthday! We\u2019ve been on this train for a while already &#8212; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/coast-financial-independence-building-wealth-even-if-youre-not-saving-any-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coast FI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> baby!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some things to help you out\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a year to figure out your *new* approximate annual spending (without me in the picture). Continue to use Mint.com to track expenses and spending trends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep using our budget template in *google docs* to make sure you\u2019re on track each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>If you overspend <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a little within a year, no problem! It will just take you a tiny bit longer to reach FI. A $10-15k variance isn\u2019t a huge deal at this point. Don\u2019t stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>If you underspend<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a little within a year, that\u2019s great, too! Keep putting all excess savings into the brokerage account and buying VTI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Track your net worth every few months to make sure things are trending upward. If the market crashes or has dips, don\u2019t freak out. Just leave everything untouched and let it rebound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your net worth reaches 25 &#8211; 30x your annual spending, you\u2019ve reached FI and can do whatever you want for the rest of your life!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know most of this already, but I wanted to write it down anyway. It really is this simple, and you can do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>My Wishes for the Rest of Your Life<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get to design your own life after I die. So don\u2019t feel compelled to follow any of the plans or advice that I give.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, I hope you find and pursue work that you truly enjoy and are passionate about. I know teaching is an underappreciated and underpaid profession, but you have a gift and I encourage you to continue sharing that with the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope you spend and enjoy all of our money. Please don\u2019t feel bad about treating yourself, living comfortably, and giving as much as you can to others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love you so much,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS: If and when you are ready to start dating again, there\u2019s a dating app &#8212; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/firedating.me\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FireDating.Me<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; where you might be able to find another personal finance nerd to date!
