These are the main reasons I believe successful and unsuccessful people invest:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63834 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/WHYS_jpeg_Jih0FRU3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"439\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/WHYS_jpeg_Jih0FRU3.jpg 439w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/WHYS_jpeg_Jih0FRU3-300x175.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My buddy John* is probably the worst investor in the world. (his words, not mine!). John tried to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/millennialmoney.com\/investing-in-cryptocurrency\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invest in cryptocurrency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and failed miserably. He tried to buy a rental property &#8212; failed. He tried to start a business &#8212; lost his life savings. He even tried to invest in index funds (the most <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no-brainer way to grow wealth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and still somehow lost money doing it! &#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the outside, you might say that John just always has bad luck. But when you ask him WHY he chose his investments, he\u2019ll reveal:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He traded crypto because everyone else was doing it. He didn\u2019t want to miss out on something skyrocketing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He tried house flipping because he thought he could make a quick $50k in 90 days. A TV show he watched made it look so easy&#8230;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John\u2019s business was built around the idea of \u201cscrewing over his old boss and workplace.\u201d He wanted revenge.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He lost money investing in index funds because he <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/stock-market-game\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thought he could predict when the market was going up<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and when it was going down.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My theory about WHY is this: If you enter into an investment with corrupt motives, you are likely to fail. Instead, if you have pure intentions, your probability of success is much higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The HOW of Investing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason I listed the WHYs first is because <\/span><b>intent influences actions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I can tell my buddy John about some good investment activities he <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> follow, but unless he corrects his ill intentions, there\u2019s a high likelihood he\u2019ll find a way to do the exact opposite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the list of HOWs and specific actions that successful and unsuccessful people typically do:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63833 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/HOWS_jpeg_MTLhhtRg-e1617420169330.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"441\" height=\"253\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>I\u2019ve done most of the bad investing things myself.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s difficult to put emotions aside, think long-term, study your ass off, and follow the boring path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the older I get and the more I study successful people, the more I\u2019m learning to stick with the good activities on the right side. It might be boring, but it increases my rate of winning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please also note that not everything in my list is so black and white! Everyone interprets these words differently &#8212; I only put them in 2 columns for simplicity. It\u2019s not gospel.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Winning a Battle vs. Winning the War<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might be thinking, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHang on a sec\u2026 I know someone who has horrible intentions and gambles constantly, and they are making a shit ton of money right now.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yep, there are always going to be exceptions to the rules. Sometimes people are going to be right for all the wrong reasons. But while they might win individual battles, they usually don\u2019t have a consistent strategy to win a war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing is a loooooooooooong game. Think infinitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually my \u201cbad\u201d investor friend John won a small battle recently. He <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/research\/poll-how-well-did-meme-stock-investors-understand\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invested in a meme stock<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and made 10x his money in just a couple days! I am truly stoked for him and his success. But, as you might have guessed, this win was negative reinforcement for John, so the gains disappeared shortly afterward with other similar risky trades.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Good Intentions + Good Actions = Success<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, I\u2019m not a genius investor or uber successful billionaire\u2026 so take everything I write with a grain of salt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, if I could go back in time and give my younger self advice about how to be more successful at growing wealth, it would be this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before investing, <\/span><b>check your motives<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Make sure your WHY is pure.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow the proven path, even if it seems boring.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mistakes are OK!&#8230; Just learn from them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think long-term. Play the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3lv1NN0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infinite game<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stick to your own strategy no matter what everyone else is doing. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJust because everyone else around you is winning, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re losing.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy investing!
