Instead, they&#8217;re a bit funky and the first two of the year are due on April 17th and June 15th &#8211; two months apart. Now over the year it works out perfectly fine and other payments cover 4 months instead of 3, but the part where I went wrong this month was that I didn&#8217;t account for the <em>quicker<\/em> tax payment in June forgetting that it wasn&#8217;t in July (and thus, not setting aside the appropriate money &#8211; which I don&#8217;t include in my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\">net worth<\/a> updates). So long story short, I had to front myself the $2,675.00 that was missing which pretty much accounts for the $2,500+ loss in cash you see up above. I&#8217;ve def. learned my lesson ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then to top it all off, of course, we&#8217;re now living on a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/now-living-off-one-paycheck\/\">one paycheck<\/a> budget.<\/strong> No longer bringing in the $1,300 each month like we used to when the Mrs. was working for her school. I&#8217;m not sure how drastic or not this will change things in the very near future, but seeing these numbers definitely helps make it all more &#8220;real.&#8221; And as a finance guy (or any guy, really?), it&#8217;s never fun to start losing streams of income when you&#8217;re working so hard to do the opposite<\/p>\n<p>I just gotta keep reminding myself that it&#8217;s all just a phase right now, and sooner or later we&#8217;ll be back on track and ready to start seeing tons more growth again.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve got faith!!<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s How The Rest Played Out in More Detail:<\/h2>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CASH SAVINGS<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$2,580.48)<\/span><\/strong>: Nothing much to say again other than *vomit*. And that I&#8217;m an idiot for messing up tax stuff this quarter :( I&#8217;ve also decided that I need to step back a bit and re-assess how we&#8217;re managing all of this stuff again. So many new things have come into play since our last budget reorganization and goal\/dream planning, that we gotta get back in there and make the appropriate changes &#8211; whatever that ends up being.\u00a0 Look for some new posts on it all soon :)<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EMERGENCY FUND<\/span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>($0.00)<\/strong><\/span><\/strong>: My goal was to start upping this back to the $10,000 mark, but due to obvious reasons it didn&#8217;t happen this month.\u00a0 I&#8217;m 99% sure we&#8217;ll be scrapping this department altogether though and just keeping one major savings account that houses ALL of our cash instead of having it divided all over creation.\u00a0 It&#8217;ll be another thing that we talk about in our future &#8220;get our $hit together&#8221; plan.\u00a0 I think it&#8217;ll streamline things a LOT.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> PHYSICAL GOLD<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">($33.40)<\/span><\/strong>: Of course this is the only area going up ;) I think I&#8217;m done trying to figure out gold for the time being, haha&#8230; and I&#8217;m still REALLY really wanting to pick up some of that old silver scrap too for the metals collection here, but that&#8217;ll have to wait until we get this ship all fixed and straightened up.
