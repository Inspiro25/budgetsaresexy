How, you ask, did I know it was up? Because almost <em>everyone<\/em> has taken a standardized test.<\/p>\n<p>These days, most American students are taking several state-issued standardized tests every school year, but even kids who are home-schooled need to take the SAT to get into college. Standardized tests are a necessary evil that we all have to get through, but as you\u2019re cursing the name of the person who invented the damn thing while you\u2019re sweating your way through all that bubbling, did you ever actually think about the person who wrote each of those questions? Probably not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lucky for you, you\u2019re about to meet one of those talented writers.<\/strong> That\u2019s right: my side hustle is writing questions for a couple of major standardized tests.<\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(NOTE:<\/span> As you can imagine, I had to sign some pretty strict non-disclosure statements when taking this gig. As a result, I can\u2019t tell you who employs me, which tests I write for, or exactly how much I get paid. But that still leaves a lot to say \u2013 read on!)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Some Background<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m a high school teacher living in the D.C. metro area (yep, I\u2019ve met J. Money in real life \u2013 I know, you\u2019re jealous!) and I\u2019ve been at it for the past five years. Currently, I teach social studies to a captive audience (ha!) of mostly high school seniors. But I\u2019m also certified to teach 7-12 English. In other words, I have experience and training in a few different areas, one in particular that is especially valuable to the organization that employs me to write the questions. And the thing is, since I\u2019m a teacher, I\u2019m pretty much a professional at being broke, er, I\u2019m pretty much a professional at doing a lot more than just teaching to make money. I\u2019ve tutored, mentored other teachers, written curriculum, taught summer school. I\u2019m always on the look-out for extra income opportunities, particularly those opportunities that will also improve my resume.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting the Gig<\/h2>\n<p>The way that I got hired to write standardized test questions is pretty straightforward: one of my family members works full time for the organization that hires question writers (in the business, we\u2019re referred to as \u201citem\u201d writers) and they circulated an internal email indicating that they were in need of item writers in a few different subjects. My family member forwarded it to me, I sent in my resume, and the rest was history! I was hired and had my first assignment within the week.<\/p>\n<h2>Teacher by Day, Life Ruiner by Night<\/h2>\n<p>I have to say, writing test questions is probably my favorite side hustle. Basically, it works like this: my boss sends me an assignment, which is usually pretty specific. She\u2019ll ask for say, 10 questions, and will have a specific topic that each one will need to be about. There are a bunch of rules that I have to follow when writing the questions, in terms of both structuring the questions and topics and phrases that I have to avoid because they might convey ethnic, gender, or regional bias. For example, it\u2019s off limits to write a question that involves a phrase like \u201cslow cooker\u201d because \u201cslow cooker\u201d is a regional term. A test taker in the Midwest might not know that a slow cooker is the same thing as a Crockpot.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, I have about a week or two to complete the assignment, and it takes me an average of about 30 minutes to write each question. I email my set of questions back to my boss a day or two before they\u2019re due, she asks me to edit them if necessary, and that\u2019s it! The flexibility of the gig is great. I can come home from school, eat dinner, open up a bottle of wine, and crank out a few questions before bed. That\u2019s right, your suspicions were correct: people who create standardized tests really <em>are<\/em> staying up at night, thinking up ways to screw you over!<\/p>\n<h2>What Does It Pay?<\/h2>\n<p>I write for two different tests, which each pay different rates. The pay is per question, so my pay for a given assignment varies by how many questions were requested. I can\u2019t disclose the exact amount I get paid per question, but the range is between $20-$30 per question, depending on which test I\u2019m writing for.<\/p>\n<h2>Whoa! Is This the Perfect Side Hustle or What?!<\/h2>\n<p>Writing standardized test questions is a really sweet side hustle and I feel really lucky to have the job. There are two significant drawbacks, though. For one, the work isn\u2019t steady. It ebbs and flows, so I can\u2019t exactly count on the income. The second is a little more cerebral: I sometimes feel like I\u2019m participating in system I don\u2019t agree with, a system that relies on somewhat arbitrary tests (that I help write) to brand teachers (like me) as effective or ineffective without taking other important factors into account. Teaching is an incredibly complex job that simply can\u2019t be boiled down to test scores, and sometimes as I\u2019m writing the questions I feel like I\u2019m helping make my fellow teachers look like they\u2019re idiots when they\u2019re probably not.<\/p>\n<p>This is an unsolvable problem, though. States, universities, and professional programs all rely on standardized tests and someone has to write them. I suppose it\u2019s better that a fellow teacher write the tests than a grumpy bureaucrat who never met a high school student in his life. Still, this is something I think about.<\/p>\n<h2>So, You Want To Write Standardized Test Questions\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Again, I can\u2019t reveal the identity of my employer, but if you think you want to write questions for a particular test, do a quick Google search on the test and see who\u2019s responsible for its creation then figure out how to put in an application on their website. You\u2019ll be especially desirable if you have knowledge of a subject area that is somewhat specialized and less frequently studied, like Chinese language or chemistry. The subject I write in for both tests is not one that a lot of people study or know anything about, which is why I got the job so easily.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the side hustle you choose, go get one now! It will make a world of difference to your finances. Consider this your homework assignment :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>This edition of our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">Side Hustle series<\/a> was written by <strong>TeacHer<\/strong> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.teacherfinance.org\/\">www.teacherfinance.org<\/a> &#8211; to learn more about her other side hustles and the ups and downs being &#8220;professionally broke,&#8221; check out her blog or visit her on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/teacherfinance\">Facebook<\/a>!
