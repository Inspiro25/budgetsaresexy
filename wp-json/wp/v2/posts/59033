I started reading your blog sometime in 2014, and started using your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/budgets\/j_budget_template.xls\">basic excel budget tool<\/a> in November 2014, when my student loan debt was just over $81k.<\/p>\n<p>I also started using a basic Debt Snowball Payment Schedule excel document. Using those two basic charts, month in, month out, I paid the remaining $81k of debt in just over 4 years&#8230; Without the push and those tools, I have no doubt I&#8217;d still be paying that debt for a long time to come.<\/p>\n<p>On to the future! =)<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Laura<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The 52 Challenger<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Dr. J.

Although we are not completely debt free yet as we still have a $15,000 heloc remaining.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s not all &#8211; in mid April I QUIT a low paying dead end job that I was miserable at! Since then I have been working on renovating my new house and working doing side hustles for people while I figure out what I truly enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>(Although I must admit I am LOVING the whole lifestyle of working 3 days a week for other people and spending the other 4 either working around the house doing renovations, or doing fun things with my wife and baby.)<\/p>\n<p>The freedom I have been experiencing over the last little bit has been amazing. It\u2019s been a rough climb for many years, but I just feel on top of the world now with the huge progress from around $75,000 to $322,000 in net worth with the recent house sale.<\/p>\n<p>Cheers!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Max<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Happy Investor<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>In 2013, I was sick of debt. I was worth less than zero. I cut my spending and did all I could to crawl out. Once out in late 2013, I began saving and investing in dividend growth stocks. 5 years later, I made it to $385,000 with my house paid off and no debt at all.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not living as frugally as before, but still squirrel away enough to see steady growth.

All my savings and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/spavings-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spavings<\/a> have been because of your blogs and motivation. Thank you so much, because by next month I should have an extra $1,000 to put in a fund for my little baby boy due soon. He is going to learn about money as soon as he knows how to count to 5 :)<\/p>\n<p>Money was never talked about much in my family, but I&#8217;m planning to have a savings, checking, fundraiser\/donation and a piggy bank for church givings. My child will learn how to save 10 percent of their allowance to put in a piggy-bank to help people in need.

One day recently he came to the office looking terrible. Everyone encouraged him to go to the doctor and he did. Less than a month later, he was dead. He had an aggressive form of cancer.<\/p>\n<p>I know you can understand where I am going with this intellectually, but I think you are about 10 years younger than me.
