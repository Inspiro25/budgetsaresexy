Debt-free outside of my mortgage.<\/p>\n<p>I have been following the blog for exactly three years now! I thought I should share my net worth snapshot for all of the other voyeurs like myself who are interested in FI.<\/p>\n<p>I came across FI and your blog in a random post from an old co-worker on Facebook. The post was actually about an Elite Daily article that had come out about how if <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elitedaily.com\/life\/savings-20s-something-wrong\/1214445\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">millennials are saving money in their 20s, they are doing it wrong<\/a>. The article says young people should be out networking, traveling, etc. My friend had a major eye-roll moment about this story (she happens to be a Journalist), so she shared her dissent and within the comments section, others brought up this blog.<\/p>\n<p>I started reading your blog, MMM and Afford Anything from all of the suggestions and immediately wondered my own net worth. I was 29, had just moved to Arizona and bought a house. I went back and tracked three months of expenses and almost threw up when I saw I was spending over $1,000 a month on food and alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>My net worth in October of 2015 was <strong>$78,084.60<\/strong>. I had sold my home in Vegas, paid off my car, no student loads or credit card loans, but I was spending so much money on food (that I hardly remembered) seemed like a giant waste.<\/p>\n<p>I started budgeting, but still trying to live a life of enjoyment. I now spend my money on prioritizing the things that bring me real happiness like travel, spending time with friends and family, and renovating my home. I&#8217;ve cut waaaaay back on my expenses but have still managed to travel to Hawaii, Jamaica, Mexico, Seattle, Boise, and many more short trips in the three years since I started tracking.<\/p>\n<p>Today, three years later, my net worth is <strong>$272,969.68<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>I have maxed out my 401k, Roth IRA and HSA every year since 2015. I track my net worth every month (I stole <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/budgets\/j_budget_template.xls\">your template<\/a>, thanks!). I also started asking for raises and changed jobs when I couldn&#8217;t take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer anymore. In 2015, my salary was $62,000 and today I am at $120,000.<\/p>\n<p>Keep up the great work!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Did you catch that last part??? She doubled her salary in three years!

Money! I love seeing the snapshots of other people&#8217;s finances! I thought I&#8217;d share what I&#8217;ve been tracking for the past 5 years!<\/p>\n<p>My husband and I are engineers in our mid-thirties living and working in the Baltimore\/DC metro area. I make <strong>$150k<\/strong> writing software and he makes <strong>$120k<\/strong> designing fire safety systems for large construction projects. We haven&#8217;t been able to have kids yet, but that just lets us continue saving and living the cushy life. We have 3 crazy dogs that make our lives the best kind of chaotic.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve never really budgeted, but we pay ourselves into savings first. We pay off our cc balance monthly. We&#8217;ve only accrued interest once in 2 years of combined finances, and that was due to an oversight on our part, not a failing in our financial habits.<\/p>\n<p>2016 was when we joined finances, sold my old townhouse, and bought a rancher in a good neighborhood, with the hope of having kids and the knowledge that I have bad knees and would benefit from single story living. While the cost of living here is expensive, I&#8217;m able to pull an incredible salary and benefits that are geographically tied to this area. 100% family coverage of medical, 6+% matching, 100% coverage for STD\/LTD, 30 days off a year (that we&#8217;re encouraged to take), company equity, and I never need to exceed a 40 hour week.<\/p>\n<p>2016 is also where we &#8220;froze&#8221; our lifestyle. We decided that we were able to afford a very comfortable lifestyle where we never felt deprived and every raise and bonus has gone either straight to savings or to DIY home improvements that add more value to our house than they cost while also making us prouder of our home. I don&#8217;t have an algorithm for how regularly to update our home value, so I have a *super* conservative value in the chart and just leave it be. I think we could realistically sell it for $30k more than I have listed but real estate markets feel too fake for me to want to update my spreadsheet and see a giant jump. We bought it for 500k, so not doing too bad in that department.<\/p>\n<p>We do know that if we needed to cut back we could easily do so in many areas, but we are happy with our current savings rate and enjoy the conveniences and time that hiring a lawn service and such grant us.<\/p>\n<p>I sort of track our separate net-worths and then track my lifetime earnings thanks to the social security website. I&#8217;m at ~30% <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/total-lifetime-earnings-wealth-ratio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lifetime savings<\/a> right now, which I&#8217;m hoping to start to see go up going forward with how much we have in retirement accounts and our increased savings.<\/p>\n<p>My husband and a partner are buying his company owner out in the new year, otherwise a large chunk of our savings would have been sitting in our brokerage account. We have $10k in laddered CDs as an emergency fund (only lose interest if we cash out early) and we keep 3 months of expenses in our Bills checking account so that even if we lost an income, we would have time to readjust our finances before that account would be in any amount of risk. This is probably more conservative than we need to be given our job security in the region, but we run our finances by the rule of &#8220;the more conservative partner wins.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We both max out our respective retirement plans yearly and our income is too high to contribute to a Roth IRA. I&#8217;m still young, so I&#8217;m choosing to contribute 100% into a Roth 401k. My husband doesn&#8217;t get that option at his work.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to tracking my spreadsheet monthly, I log onto <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/personal-capital-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal capital<\/a> almost daily to keep an eye on our daily spending and keep an eye out for fraudulent activity.<\/p>\n<p>Total current monthly expenses: <strong>$6,236<\/strong> (overpaying both vehicles with loans on them)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how long they&#8217;ve been making this money, but damn! $270,000 total\/year is impressive! And leads me to believe it&#8217;s only been a few years since they&#8217;re only spending $6,000 of it a month which leaves a looooot of room for wealth growing. That&#8217;s pretty much the same amount we spend every month, only with half the income, haha&#8230; Am I allowed to blame my kids on that, or no?! ;)<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re gonna be sitting pretty when\/if they end up having kids though for sure. Which is really the whole point of paying attention to all this money stuff, right? To have the ability to make big moves in life without having to be slaves to money?
