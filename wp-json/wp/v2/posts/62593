I went on a no-spend month. Paid my house payment, power, etc BUT no going-out, entertainment, wander through the mall shopping. I filled up my gas tank on the 1st, bought some fresh fruits &amp; veggies, eggs, and milk, and decided what I COULD spend on that month.<\/p>\n<p>Milk, eggs, fruits, veggies-all okay. Otherwise, very little. I raided my freezer, pantry, friends\u2019 brains for bright ideas, and spent less than $100 on food for the month. Sadly, I can do at least another month like this because my pantry AND freezer are still full. Walked a lot, read a ton of books, took advantage of free wi-fi; stuff like that. Paid cash when I went to the grocery\/farmer\u2019s market.<\/p>\n<p>What it boiled down to was\u2026 I learned that I can comfortably live on a hell of a lot less than I\u2019ve been spending. *shudder*. And my budget needs some tweaking, so I redirect those $$ where they will be working for me.<\/p>\n<p>Like I said, I\u2019ve been reading your blog for a long time. I\u2019m grateful for the kinda oddball ideas you collect from all over, along with your own. I can\u2019t tell you what motivated me to do a no-spend month but I can tell you, it was well-worth the education. Thanks again for keeping the fire burning; I\u2019m working toward improving my finances every day!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I started tracking my net worth in March 2013 after finding your blog &#8211; $66k.

And I didn&#8217;t even know until my wife told me this weekend! Considering we met 6 years ago and at the time I had a $5,000 net worth and my wife said she had something like $30K, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s been pretty good!<\/p>\n<p>Although there was a $75K inheritance there in 2015. So we can take credit for roughly $400K in about 6 years (Still can&#8217;t believe those numbers!). Sorry, you&#8217;re probably one of the few people who can understand how crazy that sounds!

I went from overspending, underinvesting, and accumulating debt to being in a strong financial position.<\/p>\n<p>In less than 1 year since discovering the show and the FI community both my significant other and I have paid off all our debt (totaled $49,000), put away over 6 months in emergency savings each, and now comfortably save\/invest over 53% of our income.<\/p>\n<p>I grew up in poverty so I hope you know that having others to learn fiscal responsibility from makes a world of difference to people like myself. My life will forever be improved thanks to the resources I\u2019ve found such as bloggers\/podcasters like yourself!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I found an old excel file from 2008 where I was tracking my cash tips from the waitressing job I had in college (I\u2019ve always loved excel). In that file I noted I had $3,221.13 in my bank account which was the extent of my net worth.<\/p>\n<p>Today my net worth is over $215k!!! I\u2019ve been tracking it for 2 years since finding your blog so I know how much it\u2019s grown but it\u2019s extra awesome to see how far I\u2019ve come since college.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Shawna<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I started reading your blog while I was at my last job where my boss did not like me because of my political affiliation. I became unhappy at work and I felt I had to stay because I had expenses and just &#8220;adulting&#8221; that I needed to do.<\/p>\n<p>I left that job and started my own business and never looked back. I left them a 200 page exit memo, but leaving was the most freeing thing I did and I never again wanted to be in the position of feeling trapped at work.<\/p>\n<p>While I was consulting I was looking for the next right fit for me. It took about 7 months which I was fine with. Thanks to your blog, I had an emergency fund and I did not need to tap into my savings at all. I was prepared to take my time until I found a role that worked for me. Usually people find the job then leave, but this place was so toxic that I felt better off not having a job than being there.<\/p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today I am at such an awesome\u00a0place where people are truly so friendly and love what they do. I make just over $67K from my day job of which I save 50% and just over $73K on the side of which I save 100%. (Note: Waiting for a $50K contract to be finalized which would bring me up to just over $120K in side hustle income)<\/p>\n<p>You lit a FIRE under me to hustle like no other. I save, invest and challenge myself to focus on goals and how to crush them. These all kind of happened at once but honestly, waking up, reading your blog and having the right mindset is what is doing it for me.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; &#8220;Jeremy&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>J.
