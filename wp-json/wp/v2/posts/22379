href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/financial-planning-dont-be-a-tool\/\">&#8220;Babs&#8221; Wagner<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>By now, we\u2019re well enough into 2012 that everyone who made a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/12\/time-to-rock-those-new-years-resolutions-again\/\">New Year\u2019s resolution<\/a> <\/strong>has sorted themselves into one of two groups.\u00a0 The first is the miniscule group of folks who kept their resolutions (God bless all three of you overachievers!).\u00a0 The second group is the extremely large number of folks who blew their resolutions and now live with one more blot on the family escutcheon.\u00a0 I hate when that happens, and I have the many blots to prove it.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t make New Year\u2019s resolutions anymore.\u00a0 <strong>I have discovered the only resolution I\u2019ll ever make, and I make it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">every single day<\/span><\/strong>.\u00a0 Before I tell you this secret to success and happiness in every aspect of life (pay no mind to today&#8217;s post title), let me tell you what got me to this point.<\/p>\n<p>By the ripe old age of 29, I had already <em>declared bankruptcy<\/em>, been <em>fired<\/em> from my first grown-up job, and had my <em>wages garnished<\/em> for failure to pay my guaranteed college loans on time.\u00a0 Since I lost my credit cards in the bankruptcy, and wasn\u2019t familiar with the concept of living within my means, I had gotten into a nasty habit of getting myself \u201cpayday loans\u201d by cashing bad checks just about every month.\u00a0 I was broke, jobless and living on unemployment when it finally dawned on me that I needed to get my financial life in order.\u00a0 I had so many problems, it was overwhelming getting started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I did the only thing I could do:\u00a0 I lived within my means.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I got a job and each payday I would pay my bills, grocery shop, and cash a check for what was left in the account.\u00a0 I put the cash in my wallet and the checkbook in my desk, and that was it until the next pay day \u2014 no more bad checks.\u00a0 It certainly wasn\u2019t the height of financial savvy, but I learned to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/09\/do-you-remember-the-first-time-you-started-tracking-your-money\/\">track every penny<\/a> and I felt pretty responsible after a few months.<\/p>\n<p>The next year I got a raise, so I had my employer automatically buy <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/07\/bye-bye-bonds-hello-roth-iras\/\">savings bonds<\/a> each month.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t the greatest investment, but I couldn\u2019t easily undo the automatic investment and I couldn\u2019t easily cash them in.\u00a0 My \u201cportfolio\u201d started growing and I was feeling pretty mature money-wise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About this time I married my husband, a guy with only slight better financial chops than me.<\/strong>\u00a0 Between the two of us, we had car and credit card loans over $55,000 in today\u2019s dollars, all with interest rates in the 20%+ range.\u00a0 So we decided to pay off all our debts as fast as we could.\u00a0 We <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/what-if-you-could-live-off-50-of-your-pay\/\">lived on one paycheck<\/a> and it took us over a year.\u00a0 We felt fantastic when we got that debt off our shoulders!\u00a0 Since we knew we could live on that one pay check, we started investing the amount we\u2019d been allocating to debt.\u00a0 After that, we became pretty savvy about all things financial and it got lots easier to make good decisions.\u00a0 We definitely started late and moved slowly, but all the baby steps added up over time and we\u2019ll be retiring in our early 50\u2019s, never to work again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So have you guessed what my resolution is?\u00a0 It sure isn\u2019t \u201cget it together and do everything right this year.\u201d\u00a0<\/strong> Every time I vowed to do EVERYTHING perfectly, I found myself breaking my resolution almost instantly.\u00a0 I noticed this was true with more than finances:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cI\u2019m going to get in shape, lose 20 pounds, and eat healthy\u201d lasted about a week.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI really mean it&#8211;I\u2019m going to get the entire house squeaky clean, organized and beautifully decorated this year\u201d didn\u2019t last past cleaning out the kitchen junk drawer.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI\u2019m going to cook a healthy meal for my family every night\u201d immediately failed when I forgot to defrost the chicken and we were back on the fast food trail for good.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Every time I made a big plan, I crashed and burned.<\/strong>\u00a0 It turns out I\u2019m not perfect, my self-discipline is spotty, and it\u2019s really hard sticking with a resolution that I was continually failing to meet.\u00a0 So I stopped making resolutions and plans, and I try to live with just one goal every day:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: -10px;\"><span style=\"color: #006699;\"><strong>Do One Small Thing, Then Do Another.<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In the financial realm, I just lived within my means.\u00a0 Which gave me the motivation to save money.<\/li>\n<li>On the health front, I went to one Weight Watchers meeting, which got me to another, and a year later to a loss of 40 lbs.<\/li>\n<li>On the home front, I cleaned off my desk, which felt so good I got the whole house reasonably clean and organized after several months.<\/li>\n<li>I started nagging other members of the family to do some of the cooking, and after a year we\u2019re down to one night a week of eating out.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Do One Small Thing, Then Do Another.\u00a0 <strong>I don\u2019t set huge goals, and I don\u2019t beat myself up if I\u2019m moving slowly<\/strong>.\u00a0 I just keep doing small things and eventually they add up to a lot more success than all the big resolutions I never kept.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From what I\u2019ve seen in your comments, most of you are way smarter than I was\/am.\u00a0<\/strong> I suspect many of you actually keep your resolutions every year.\u00a0 But on the off chance that some of our community is NORMAL and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not perfect<\/span>, <em>how \u2018bout you share your One Small Thing?\u00a0 <\/em>What would you tell someone struggling with un-\/under-employment, too much debt or too little savings?<em>\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>How did you get started on the road to financial
