Got any fun stories to share?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I have been spending weekends at the beach. We\u2019re trying to give our dog some \u201cswim therapy,\u201d which the vet recommended to help regain strength in his back legs. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also trying something called \u201csurf therapy,\u201d which helps me maintain my overly happy disposition in life!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, in today\u2019s post I\u2019m going to lay out the 6 stages of financial freedom. I first came across these stages on the blog <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getrichslowly.org\/stages-of-financial-freedom\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Rich Slowly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, written by the legendary JD Roth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The 6 Stages of Financial Freedom<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years ago I used to think financial independence was a single milestone &#8230; The exact point where you transitioned from \u201cworking for money\u201d &#8212;&gt; \u201cmoney working for you.\u201d It\u2019s a common misconception when people discover the FIRE movement &#8212; only focussing on the early retirement finish line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after reading JD\u2019s post (and following several other personal finance OG blogs), I started to think differently. I realized that <\/span><b>financial independence is a journey, not an \u201call or nothing\u201d situation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There\u2019s a messy middle that everyone goes through before actually reaching FI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better yet, I learned that as people progress through the journey, more and more freedoms become available. Every person gets to decide how fast or slow they want to move through these stages, based on how happy they are with the freedoms they have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the 6 (really 7) stages of financial freedom:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stage 0: Dependence<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone is born here. As a baby you are 100% dependent on your parents or other adults to survive. Growing up (even if you have <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> income) you still depend on others for financial support and covering most of your cost of living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not much freedom<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this phase. Since some (or all) of your existence is supported by others, you don\u2019t have full control of your life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The path to financial freedom begins when <\/span><b>your personal income can fully cover your personal expenses.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stage 1: Solvency<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first level of independence starts when you can fully meet your financial obligations without needing help from others. Even if you have large debts or a negative net worth, you are solvent if you can cover your payments and full cost of living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very limited freedom<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this phase. You are paying your own way and making your own life decisions, but if you are spending everything you earn, it feels like a treadmill.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progress is made once you are <\/span><b>earning more than you spend.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stage 2: Stability<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this phase, you\u2019ve built up a decent cash cushion for emergencies and have no consumer debt. You are earning more than your basic cost of living and have wiggle room in your budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stability gives you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a bit more freedom.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Since you have an emergency fund, you\u2019re able to take small risks and use your cash buffer as a safety net. And since you\u2019re earning more than you spend, you have the freedom to choose what to do with excess income.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Many people stop and stay in this phase, forever. They use their excess income to upgrade their lifestyle, and repeat each time their income grows. This also feels like a treadmill (a faster one with each upgrade).**<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To progress past this phase, you need to <\/span><b>save and invest your excess income<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is the foundation of building wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stage 3: Agency<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this stage, you\u2019ve built up a substantial savings pile and investment portfolio. Not only is your excess income being saved and invested, but your assets are growing and contributing to your net worth, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a TON of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freedom and flexibility<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this phase. As your investment income grows, the need for personal income shrinks. This gives you more options to work and live as you please, designing your own life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that \u201cwork\u201d is still needed in this phase. You can\u2019t fully quit working forever until you\u2019re in the next phase, when <\/span><b>your investments are producing enough income to cover your expenses.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stage 4: Security<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first phase of financial independence. It\u2019s when your investment income can cover your basic living expenses (but not a whole lot more). \u201cLean FI\u201d is what some people call this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve reached <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial freedom!<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And you no longer have to work to cover your basic living necessities. However, there\u2019s no room for extra discretionary spending or personal luxuries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people reach financial independence (especially early in life), they typically want to travel, pursue new hobbies, share their wealth, give to charity, and treat themselves! To be able to do all this, you will want some additional wiggle room in your spending projections.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stage 5: Independence<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This stage is what most of us are all striving for. You reach true financial independence when your investment income covers your living necessities, as well as most personal luxuries. There is a cushion built into your annual budget for added flexibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have reached \u201cenough,\u201d and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the freedom here lasts forever<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**It\u2019s not uncommon for people to still have lingering \u201cworry\u201d feelings about money, even after FI is achieved. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/sequence-of-returns-risk-why-you-should-care\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sequence of returns risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, caring for aging parents, or massive unexpected emergencies can be scary to think about. Many people who have achieved FI still continue to work and save, which pushes them into the next phase.**<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stage 6: Abundance\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, your investment portfolio is making more money than you need in life. The gap between what you have and what you need will continue to grow and grow naturally over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This stage gives you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ultimate freedom<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><b>You can make all decisions in life based on happiness, not dollars.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When you\u2019re in abundance, you\u2019re in a great position to share, give back, help out friends and family, or set up long-lasting generational wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Financial Freedom Is Not a Race. Take Advantage of Your Freedoms in the Here and Now!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most people, I\u2019m ultimately striving for stages 5 and 6, independence and abundance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, I\u2019m not in a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rush<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get there. Here\u2019s why&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you asked me why I\u2019m working toward financial independence in the first place, I\u2019d list some of these things below. This is kind of my wish list for when I reach FI&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To work if I want, where I want, on my own schedule<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To treat myself and wife to big-ticket items, if and when we want to<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be able to travel, move, or live wherever we want in the world<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To surf anytime I want<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To dress however I want, all day every day<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To pursue any hobby I want to try<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be in a position to support friends and family if they need help<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give generously and spend time volunteering<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be at home and support my future kids (if we decide to have kids)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To coach, inspire, or otherwise provide value to strangers out there<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To build generational wealth for my family<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in stage 6 (abundance) would give me everything on this list. It\u2019s worth shooting for and that\u2019s eventually where I\u2019ll end up one day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently I\u2019m in stage 3 (agency), a long way from stage 6. BUT, I\u2019m beginning to realize that <\/span><b>most of my wish list is already available to me in stage 3.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I already have the freedom and flexibility to do most of these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I wanted to, I could get a high paying job, a second job, and hustle my ass off on the weekends to speed up my path to stage 6. This would give me access to my entire wish list, as early as possible. But, in order to do this, I\u2019d have to give up some of the freedoms I\u2019m already enjoying today in stage 3 (work freedom, dress, surf, travel, hobbies).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of right now, the sacrifice isn\u2019t worth it &#8211; I\u2019d rather stay in stage 3 and progress at a slower pace, knowing that I\u2019ll inevitably be at stage 6 one day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realize this prolongs my eventual goal, but it allows me to <\/span><b>enjoy the overall journey more &#8211; starting today.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is my thinking right now. I know many others who feel the opposite and are trying to speed up their journey. Some people are very eager to reach financial independence, quit working and unlock all the freedoms they\u2019ve earned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different speeds, same end goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What phase are you in?
