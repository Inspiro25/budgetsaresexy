For some reason it\u2019s fine to talk about a stock tip or a business venture, but to actually talk about how that tip or that venture affected your bottom line?<em> Scandalous.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Things get even more uneasy when feelings are involved. When you\u2019re emotionally involved with someone, perhaps even thinking about spending the rest of your life with that person, it can be difficult to bring up the subject of money.\u00a0 At the very least it&#8217;s unromantic, but it is ESSENTIAL if you want to create the best possible life together.<\/p>\n<p>Many people are afraid their financial situation will not measure up to what their significant other is looking for.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong> In such insecurities, one might have fantastical ideas about how rich the other person is compared to them and over value what they really have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line, until you <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/06\/talking-about-money-before-marriage-do-it\/\">talk about finances<\/a>, it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors and uncertainties.<\/strong>\u00a0 Just because he takes you out to a nice restaurant doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s loaded.\u00a0 Just because she has a great job doesn\u2019t mean she manages her money well.\u00a0 In this world of shifting gender roles, both sexes have the opportunity to be big earners and it\u2019s important to consider the ramifications of income imbalance, sharing debt, sharing credit, and the nitty gritty of each person\u2019s financial history.<\/p>\n<h2>Love Financials<\/h2>\n<p>Talking about money does not have to be scary.\u00a0 Quite often, it is relieving for both parties because it brings understanding into the fold.\u00a0 That is KEY in any relationship.\u00a0 The richer party is relieved that the poorer party actually understands the value of their money and the poorer party is relieved the richer desires a relationship with them even though their finances may not be great.<\/p>\n<p>When you first get into a relationship, a lot of focus is placed on what YOU want.\u00a0 Does this person have everything YOU\u2019RE looking for?\u00a0 Do they look right, sound right, spend right?\u00a0 Once you\u2019re in a committed relationship, the focus has to change.\u00a0 <strong>It becomes \u201cAre WE right?\u201d\u00a0 Do WE look right?\u00a0 Do WE spend right?<\/strong>\u00a0 You\u2019re a team!\u00a0 Two are always stronger than one and often the two sides can balance out where the other is lacking.<\/p>\n<p>By getting together, you can cancel out one another\u2019s draw backs and arise on the other side stronger than you were.\u00a0 This is why being open and communicative are so important when talking about finances in a relationship.\u00a0 Don\u2019t think about what is best for YOU, think about what would grow your future together in the best way for BOTH of you.<\/p>\n<h2>Setting Ground Rules<\/h2>\n<p>Once you know where both of you lie on the financial spectrum, talk about where you\u2019d like to be, what financial roles each of you are comfortable with playing, and then set up some rules for each party to adhere to.\u00a0 <em>OOooh, Rules!\u00a0 That sounds so romantic!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Eventually you have to ask yourself if you want more drama in your entire life though, or if you want to grow up and be fiscally responsible.\u00a0 The <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/introducing-strip-budgeting\/\">romance is still there<\/a>, but if you don\u2019t get serious about every part of yourself, how can you truly be serious about the relationship?<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few great rules:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a limit on spending.<\/strong>\u00a0 If something costs more than $200, then it must be discussed with the other person first before a purchase is made.\u00a0 You can set whatever limits work for you guys, but this is a good ground rule for shopping and understanding how the other person thinks about value. <em>(Editor&#8217;s Note: This number is $100 in the J$ household, although J$ tends to forget sometimes ;))<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Come up with a joint savings plan.<\/strong>\u00a0 Review what both of you have in the bank and talk about your plans on saving for the future.\u00a0 When do you want to retire?\u00a0 How much cash flow do you need?\u00a0 You\u2019re now calculating a budget, cash flow, and net worth for two!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rejoice in goals reached.<\/strong>\u00a0 Creating milestones for you to make as a couple allows you to celebrate when those goals are reached.\u00a0 You\u2019re not celebrating for one or the other, you\u2019re celebrating for the BOTH of you.
