You got like 10 things hitting you all at once, haha&#8230; Guess that&#8217;s life, eh?<\/p>\n<p><strong>1)\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/03\/owe-lots-of-taxes\/\">I owed the Gov&#8217;t $6,000 in taxes<\/a><\/strong> &#8212; On top of the $30,000 I already paid throughout the year :(\u00a0 So that really sucked, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s hard to complain when it also meant I brought home more money than normal too ;) So we&#8217;re all good&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/03\/maxing-out-sep-ira-investments\/\">I maxed out my SEP Ira with $22,000<\/a><\/strong> &#8212; In order to not owe the Gov&#8217;t even MORE than that $6k above! (And also to keep saving for retirement since I no longer have a 401(k) to do so in since I&#8217;m self-employed&#8230; I miss <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/06\/my-1-financial-goal-each-year-max-out\/\">that guy<\/a>, though!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) We maxed out the wife&#8217;s ROTH Ira (with $5k) for the first time ever<\/strong> &#8211; wiping away another $5,000 in cash.\u00a0 But it was a last minute thing when we realized that if things continue on the up and up, that we&#8217;ll soon *not be able to* invest anymore there due to income level capping (which is a good problem to have, of course). So we filled it up just in case, and took another hit on the reserves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4)\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/03\/bought-first-gold-coin-us-mint\/\">I bought a solid gold 1 oz coin last month!<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0 You can read the post for all the reasons behind it if you missed it, but basically I dropped $1,900+ on it for both investment purposes, and also for &#8220;world ending&#8221; hedging purposes ;)\u00a0 It&#8217;s not enough to do much on either side of the equation there, but it did satisfy my curiosity for a bit, and now I have something cool to track over time&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be picking up any more though in the very near future. The next investment may be in the <em>junk silver<\/em> arena like my boy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thousandaire.com\/why-you-should-buy-junk-silver\/\">Kevin did<\/a> over at <em>Thousandaire<\/em> :)\u00a0 If you like that kinda stuff, check out his article &#8211; it&#8217;s a good one.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 10px;\">How The Rest of March&#8217;s Net Worth Broke Down:<\/h2>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CASH SAVINGS<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$28,214.86)<\/span><\/strong>: The biggest hit since we started tracking these <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\">net worth<\/a>s, but obviously a lot of great stuff accomplished in the process. I&#8217;d be a bit more scared if our cash reserves were a lot lower than they were at the time ($100,000) and probably wouldn&#8217;t have done a cple of those major things I just listed above either, but the beauty of having so much on reserves is that it gives you ultimate FREEDOM!\u00a0 Freedom to sit on it all and wait for an opportunity to hit, or freedom to use it to pay off debt later, or invest in something important to you (like a business?) or anything else you want.\u00a0 So while it does seem at times that I&#8217;m an idiot for holding onto so much and not doing anything with it, you&#8217;ll now know why I tend to veer that route ;)\u00a0 Cash is totally king in my books, and I&#8217;m all for being more safer than not in this department.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EMERGENCY FUND<\/span> ($0.00)<\/strong>: Holding steady here at $10,000 still!\u00a0 Though the reality is we have a bigger E Fund here if you account for the cash in other savings\/investment accounts too.\u00a0 I should probably adjust these numbers a bit later on, but for now we&#8217;ll leave it be.\u00a0 $10k is easy for me to understand &#8211; and allocate &#8211; properly in my head :)<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>**NEW**<\/em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> PHYSICAL GOLD<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$1,716.70)<\/span><\/strong>: I love having new categories to track!\u00a0 And this one&#8217;s even odder than usual since the measurement standard of &#8220;value&#8221; here changes so drastically throughout the weeks these days, and it&#8217;s not like I can just &#8220;cash in&#8221; at any time if I wanted to &#8211; making it even MORE illiquid.\u00a0 But, on the other hand, it&#8217;s a real solid in-my-hands investment that&#8217;s not tied digitally to the world out there ;)\u00a0 And since my good friend who also invests in these precious metals values them at &#8220;spot&#8221; + $50.00, I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and do the same here.\u00a0 And the &#8220;spot&#8221; price for <a href=\"http:\/\/goldprice.org\/gold-price.html\">1 oz. of gold<\/a> at the time of me writing this is $1,666.70 (even though I paid <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/03\/bought-first-gold-coin-us-mint\/\">$1,960<\/a> &#8211; yikes!), so add that along w\/ the $50 premium and we&#8217;re looking at $1,716.70.
