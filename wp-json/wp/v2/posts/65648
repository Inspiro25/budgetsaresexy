Shoes. <\/b>As you now know I\u2019m a super <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/16-good-and-bad-changes-since-my-retirement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fan boy of VANS<\/a>, so usually if I find a pair that fits and is cheap &#8211; like from the thrift store or somewhere &#8211; I\u2019ll buy it even if it\u2019s not my <em>favorite<\/em> so long as it has a high chance of me still wearing &#8217;em and enjoying. If I do end up liking them and wanting to keep &#8217;em, I do, but if I don\u2019t I have a list of 3-4 places around town I can easily go to and hock for a few dollars of profit, or at least break even. Which isn&#8217;t hard to do when you&#8217;re only snagging them for a few bucks ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a pair that in theory I should have <em>loved<\/em> cuz they&#8217;re a bit different and I don\u2019t have any green pairs yet to match my green outfits!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65732\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/green-checkered-vans-us-open-surfing.jpg\" alt=\"green checkered vans - us open of surfing\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/green-checkered-vans-us-open-surfing.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/green-checkered-vans-us-open-surfing-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/green-checkered-vans-us-open-surfing-550x367.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[2019 Vans U.S. Open of Surfing ed.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As I wore them around town, however, I felt like a complete CLOWN and quickly knew we were not made for each other.<\/p>\n<p>So the next week I walked them into one of my favorite vintage stores and sold them for $15.00 &#8211; netting a $7.00 profit. Win-Win! The shop got cool new shoes in their inventory, and I not only got a few bucks back, but more importantly GOT THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE so they&#8217;re not constant reminders of how clowny they make me feel.<\/p>\n<p>And that last part&#8217;s the important part.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s one thing to regret a purchase, but it&#8217;s another to be reminded of that regret over and over and OVER again!! Don&#8217;t let them drag you down!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you *know* buying something was a mistake, get rid of at once &#8211; from your home and your mind. Even if you completely lose out on the money as it will eat you up every time you set eyes on it!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><b>#2. I also have back up plans for my books. <\/b>If I see a book that looks remotely interesting I buy it regardless of the price tag. I learned this from <em>Ramit<\/em> at I Will Teach You To Be Rich who declared that the knowledge you get from it will <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ramit\/status\/662340152623284224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">always be worth more than the cost of it<\/a>, even if it&#8217;s just a single nugget. Which I wholeheartedly agree with. Plus, it takes away one more decision you have to make in life! &#8220;Does this book look interesting? Buy it!&#8221; Boom &#8211; easy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56577\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/books-dancing-gif.gif\" alt=\"books dancing gif\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>Then once you&#8217;re finished with the book, benefit #2 comes in: getting rid of it or including it in your personal library!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m pretty picky so most books never make it to my bookshelf even if they are great (I rarely re-read them), but after sucking out <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/essentialism-book-review-life-changer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their essentials<\/a> and then blogging about it for future posterity, the backup plan then gets initiated. Which looks like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Was this a great book? Find someone to give it to!<\/li>\n<li>Was it an OK book? Donate it. Either to a thrift store or tiny free library.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Done and done &#x1f44d;<\/p>\n<p>In fact, most of my back up plans include \u201cjust donating it\u201d when I&#8217;m done with an item or made a wrong decision. Not so easy to stomach if you&#8217;re living paycheck to paycheck and every dollar counts, but what a benefit for all those who&#8217;ve gotten things under control. It&#8217;s a beautiful thing not having to stress about every last decision you make &#8211; even if you lose out on a little money in the process!<\/p>\n<p><b>Which is really what it comes down to at the end of the day &#8211; being *at peace* with your purchases and not letting them get in the way of life.<\/b> And knowing that not all decisions are final either. You can always do something about it if you&#8217;ve goofed!<\/p>\n<p>Plan Bs also come with another interesting side affect\u00a0 &#8211; it allows you to <strong><em>experiment<\/em> more<\/strong> with things you normally wouldn&#8217;t. This is exactly how I got into skinny jeans&#8230; (so maybe don&#8217;t follow this advice?! Haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>I was 50\/50 on whether I\u2019d like them or even DARE wear them around in public as a 40-something, but knowing I could just return them or donate them right back the next day got me to pull the trigger and *test out in real life*. And, well, 4 skinny jean pairs later I actually don\u2019t wear much of anything else these days! I love &#8217;em!<\/p>\n<p>Though I can&#8217;t say the same with the decision to buy this weird contraption &#x1f602; I still like the idea of it but have only worn it twice in 4 months:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17982752326495654\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65661\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sleeveless-hoodie.jpg\" alt=\"sleeveless hoodie\" width=\"389\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sleeveless-hoodie.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sleeveless-hoodie-174x300.jpg 174w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sleeveless-hoodie-290x500.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Other areas these back up plans come in handy:<\/p>\n<p><b>#3. Coin collecting <\/b>&#8211; I know that at any given point in time I can re-sell the coins or trade them away, even if I don\u2019t get top dollar for it. I go in spurts where I get <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/when-its-time-to-detach-yourself-from-your-things\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disenchanted with collecting<\/a> and wonder if it&#8217;s just wasted money sitting there in cute coin form collecting dust, but then others where I find them incredibly fascinating and get immense joy researching and learning all about their history and beauty.<\/p>\n<p>But in both cases it&#8217;s helpful knowing there&#8217;s a back up plan for when I&#8217;m eventually done collecting. Which includes one day donating or lending my <em>local<\/em> collection to our local museum where others in the community can view and appreciate them too!! A much better use of them, and a challenge that keeps me going since it&#8217;s a hard feat to pull off :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. Rare books\/other antiquities<\/strong> &#8211; Similar to the above, most places will buy back their goods even if its at a discount or store credit. A couple years ago I bought a rare book for $150 that I could never find, and then literally the next week I found the same one &#8211; in slightly better condition too &#8211; for $75 (!!). I couldn&#8217;t believe it. I snatched it up right away knowing I could always re-sell a copy, but ended up just returning the $150 one for store credit to save the hassle. Plus, it&#8217;s always more fun to shop with credit :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. Amazon purchases<\/strong> &#8211; Just like all families in the country, Amazon is at our door daily. But unlike other families in the country, whenever we buy something we don&#8217;t end up liking or needing, we return it RIGHT AWAY!! Which of course they make *super easy* these days not giving anyone an excuse not to&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You literally don&#8217;t even have to box up your returns or slap a label on them anymore &#8211; you just drop to your nearest UPS store or other spot in your area and the Refund Fairies take &#8217;em away and drop the coins back in your wallet! It&#8217;s not hard!<\/p>\n<p>Yet as insanely easy as they make it, people still don&#8217;t take the time to return stuff and allow the financial and mental losses to stack up making life progressively more miserable with each day&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>So please, for the love of all things money, RETURN THE STUFF YOU DON&#8217;T WANT ANYMORE!! And do it right away so you don&#8217;t forget or miss the deadline!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A trick I use is just keeping the returns in the back of my trunk, that way when I&#8217;m riding around town it&#8217;s always with me even if I forget. Or you could pick a day of the week where all returns or donations go out of your house, like Friday afternoons so you start out the weekend with a nice cash or productivity boost ;)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65665\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/slam-trunk-gif.gif\" alt=\"slam trunk gif\" width=\"298\" height=\"373\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Either way, getting unwanted stuff out of your house and mind is what matters most.<\/strong> So many houses are getting cluttered that don&#8217;t need to be and it really isn&#8217;t that complicated!<\/p>\n<p>Make your purchases, have those back up plans in place, and continue making your life a little easier by simplifying your decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Lighter in the mind, fuller in the wallet &#8211; BOOM.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64642 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-money-signature.jpg\" alt=\"j. money signature\" width=\"186\" height=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s something that&#8217;s really helped me over the years: I always have a back up plan for stuff I buy!
