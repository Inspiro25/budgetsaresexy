These days 7 out of 10 kids need a student loan because college<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costs so much money (believe me, I\u2019ve been there \u2013 done that).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let\u2019s say you\u2019re not the lucky college kid who either has super-wealthy parents to pay your tuition or who got a free ride scholarship.

Save Money With Meal Prep &amp; Food Budgeting<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever heard of the Freshman 15?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t \u2013 it refers to the additional pounds of weight an incoming college student typically adds on in their first year of studying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do they put on so much weight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because colleges typically require students in their first year to purchase a meal plan. And students have at it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be very honest \u2013 I also was one of those students who fell victim to the scrumptious foods served by the university campus. I ate everything. And yes, I gained weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here\u2019s the bad part: If you fall victim to the freshman-15 in your first year \u2013 and start practicing fairly unhealthy eating habits \u2013 how will those habits translate to your second year in college?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s where they get you: In your second year in college, typically students still want to eat out at any time, anywhere on campus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that can be costly \u2013 especially if you are on a curtailed version of your meal plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In plain English: You may have to pay a lot more per meal in your second year in college versus your first year \u2013 and eating out can seriously add to your living expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you avoid spending so much money on food?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what I did: I meal prepped every single Sunday night for the entire week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every Sunday, I invited my college friends over and we literally made a small dinner party where everyone helped me cook this gigantic meal for the week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I divided my food up based on lunch and dinner meals<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each portion was labeled\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each meal I placed in the freezer and I took out the meal the day before<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it a lot of work? Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was it boring and not very exciting to eat at home every day? Unquestionably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But did it save me money? Absolutely. In fact \u2013 at my college, meal prepping saved me around <\/span><b>$12 to $14 <\/b><b><i>a day.<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That\u2019s $84 to $98 a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had I not meal prepped my week, my savings account would have been screaming at me for spending too much money on going out to eat. Start good spending habits early!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Buy a Bike to Save on Transportation Costs in College<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My college campus was gigantic \u2013 it actually had over 40,000 students attending. That\u2019s right \u2013 40,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many students decided to purchase a car. I decided to buy a bike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the benefits of purchasing a bike while at college below:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saved money on commutes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low cost (my bike cost me $115)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No annual parking fee (cars cost over $360 per year for parking)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No car maintenance costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got the exercise I needed to cut down on my freshman-15<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in the cases I needed to travel home from college (which was about 50 miles away from campus) or simply travel outside of the campus bounds, I did the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Car pooled with friends<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Used a car taxing platform such as Uber or Lyft<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rented a car for the day \u2013 which cost me $15 per day\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest though, I rarely used a car while at college. Everything I needed was right on campus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pro Tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Try to make friends with someone who has a car and seems to be willing to give you a lift every now and then. Trust me \u2013 it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Save on Textbooks by Renting or Sharing With Friends<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Textbooks are such a rip off in college (in my humble opinion).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually didn\u2019t know about this tip until it was too late.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s my story: I went to an economics class and on my first day, the professor let us know that we would have to buy <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> book from the bookstore. That same day, I went to the campus bookstore and purchased her economics book. Brand new. Big mistake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was $850 that I will never get back. And to make matters worse? I only used that economics book once. Ouch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how can you avoid spending a ridiculous amount of money on 1 book \u2013 like I did?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of class, try to figure out who the responsible kids are\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approach them and ask if they are planning to purchase the class book<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If yes, proposed that you go to the bookstore and split the cost of the book \u2013 by renting the textbook not by buying<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After I learned my cruel lesson, I applied the tips above and they worked like clockwork because no student wants to spend hundreds of dollars on a textbook.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key here is this: Make sure you consider <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">renting<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and not buying a textbook. Truth be told, I didn\u2019t even know we had the option to rent until I fell trap to purchasing the $850 textbook.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always ask if renting is an option before resorting to buying at a college bookstore<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If renting is not an option, ask if buying <\/span><b>used<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an option<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply all extra money you saved to pay down your student loan!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>4. Ask Beauty School Students to Cut Your Hair (for Free!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially for girls, cutting your hair could cost you a pretty penny.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, in my case, I typically walk away from the hairdresser $30 to $40 poorer. And I cut my hair about once every 3 or 4 months. So, we are talking $120 to $160 every year in expenses just to cut my hair \u2013 without coloring or any other fanciness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I realized how much money I was spending on hair maintenance, I decided it was time to check out some alternatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this is what I found: My university had a beauty school and beauty students are always motivated to practice their latest and greatest hair cut tips on others\u2026 wait for it\u2026 <\/span><b>For free!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I found out about this trick \u2013 I think my world changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, you never really know how your haircut comes out \u2013 it could be lop-sided or it could be totally different from what you explained to your hairdresser. But it certainly will be unique \u2013 and something you\u2019ll likely never forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even better? It will save you money \u2013 and that money saved can go pay off your student loan debt or any other debt you may carry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Skip Out on Spring Break \/ Winter Break<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who here dreams of going out, partying with your college friends during Spring Break or Winter Break?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the breaks are awesome and are the perfect time for students to enjoy their young lives with other college kids \u2013 Spring Break and Winter Break can also likely have a pretty large impact on your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/themillennialmoneywoman.com\/how-to-create-a-budget\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, let\u2019s check out the costs of a Spring Break \/ Winter Break:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travel costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hotel stay costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol costs (and this will probably be the largest part of your budget)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miscellaneous costs<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, on average, college students spend roughly $1,500 to $2,000. And that\u2019s a chunk of money that could be used toward paying off your student loans, credit card debt \u2013 or \u2013 wait for it \u2013 college classes offered during Spring Break or Winter Break!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s right. College classes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And you know what \u2013 that\u2019s what I ended up doing: Taking extra college classes during Spring Break and Winter Break because these classes are typically discounted and could help me graduate faster (which they did).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skip out on the fun now \u2013 use the money you save today to build your future tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Make Money at College by Becoming a Library Aide\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is probably the best choice I ever made.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a library aide might sound super boring \u2013 but you know what? It\u2019s actually pretty awesome \u2013 check out my reasons, below:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You earn money! (It\u2019s minimum wage \u2013 but it\u2019s still money)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You meet pretty interesting people (especially late at night)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You actually have enough time to study for your classes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that last bullet point is what made me super excited about becoming a library aide: <\/span><b>You are paid for essentially studying for class.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much better can studying get?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best times to work as a library aide typically are during the evening hours or the early morning hours \u2013 where there is not much distraction so you have the chance to get some studying in \u2013 while getting paid.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, it might not sound like the coolest part time job in the world, but it certainly gets some money flowing to your bank account.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. Split Netflix With Your Friends<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In college I was known as \u201cThe Splitter\u201d \u2013 and not in a relationship sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was known to literally split <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everything<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 without shame and without guilt. Down to the point of splitting the cost of Netflix with my 3 other roomies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And guess what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although my roomies thought I was a bit crazy saving money literally wherever the opportunity presented itself, I think they appreciated it too \u2013 because in the end, I also helped them reduce monthly expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We split the cost of everything from:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grocery purchases<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toilet paper<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taxi rides<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Point being: Split as much as you can, while you can.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pro Tip: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even more \u2013 if you think you have to, write up a contract with your friends to make sure everyone adheres to the paper contract. Yes, you might get some raised eyebrows thrown your way, but written contracts typically are a great way to make sure everyone is held accountable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>8. Ask for Useful Birthday and Holiday Presents<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was a high school student, I always asked for the coolest and latest gadgets for my birthday or other holiday occasions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These gift requests included a cool new bedroom duvet, a nice dress for a ball, and a funky laptop cover and screen protector.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are cool things to ask for (especially when you are 15 or 16 years old). But as you grow older, I learned that asking for more practical and useful gifts is probably going to save you a lot of money down the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, I\u2019ve said it: I\u2019ve become boring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are a few of my practical gift requests that have helped me save money:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial help toward my car insurance bill<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial help toward a medical bill<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial help toward purchasing new car tires<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See?

I thought I was getting the biggest bang for my buck with Chase \u2013 and 6 years later, I\u2019m still with them to this day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whichever institution or credit card you decide to choose for your personal scenario, make sure you do your research properly before committing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Closing Thoughts on Minimizing College Debt<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, there are so many different ways to save (and make) money while in college.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went through a regular university to study for a degree (marketing) that I never again applied in my life (since I\u2019m a personal finance blogger). So yes, I am living proof that anyone can go to college or to university, study and graduate with a degree, and still end up being successful in a completely unrelated field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This scenario happens all too often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you start your college career \u2013 whether it\u2019s your undergraduate or your graduate career \u2013 it\u2019s important to save as much money as possible so that when you graduate college, you won\u2019t have to worry about debt despair.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust me, dealing with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/themillennialmoneywoman.com\/paying-off-student-loans\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student debt<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can get quite overwhelming.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you play your college cards just right, chances are you won\u2019t be spending the best years of your life at the university system. However, it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll start practicing those healthy money habits that will build a solid financial foundation for your future \u2013 which will be the best future of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start implementing these 10 college saving tips now and your bank accounts will thank me later!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What other creative and crafty college saving tips do you have?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiona created <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/themillennialmoneywoman.com\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Millennial Money Woman<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to give back and help others work towards financial freedom early in life.
