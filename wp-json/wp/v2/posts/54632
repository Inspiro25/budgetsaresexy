Coming in at both first <em>and<\/em> third place, and even beating out the granddaddy of all problems &#8211; BUDGETING.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ll admit it &#8211; our grocery bills aren&#8217;t the hottest either. How people <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/how-do-you-spend-little-money-food-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eat for under $1.00 a meal<\/a> is still beyond me, even though <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/dollar-meal-budgeting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we&#8217;ve covered it<\/a> over and over again here on this site! I think I&#8217;ve just resigned myself to accepting it and moving on to other areas, haha&#8230; Is that bad?<\/p>\n<p>Next on the list you&#8217;ll also see TRACKING EXPENSES and DISCRETIONARY\/MINDLESS SPENDING, followed by IMPULSE SHOPPING and then ENTERTAINMENT\/SOCIALIZING with friends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But my favorite was what came next:<\/strong> GETTING SPOUSES TO COOPERATE with your budgeting\/finances! This guy here had me rolling!!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;What\u2019s the one area of my budget I struggle with the most? My wife. $30K over budget for 2017. The budget category is &#8220;wife&#8221; because she has no idea on what the money was spent on.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know what to say! Other than of course that it&#8217;s <em>not<\/em> funny, and I probably shouldn&#8217;t be poking fun at it ;) But again &#8211; this is life!!! And there&#8217;s always something for us to be working on regardless of how good or not we&#8217;re doing with our money!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So please don&#8217;t let this stuff bring you guys down &#8211; <em>it&#8217;s normal<\/em>. And we&#8217;re all here to learn and get better over time like the good humans that we are.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If it helps, one of the BEST things my wife and I did when we first combined our own money was to set up our own &#8220;do whatever you please&#8221; accounts that allowed us to spend as freely as we&#8217;d like &#8211; without feeling bad or annoyed about what the other person would say ;) We capped it at $100\/mo, but it was enough to relieve some pressure and can really be set at whatever you want. The trick is putting that *cap* on it though, so you know <em>exactly how much you&#8217;re working with<\/em> to not only budget better all around, but also to better reign in all your discretionary splurging as well. And believe me, when you know you&#8217;re not allowed to take out any extra money until the next month, you learn quick! (And it also helps both parties feel more in control too, regardless of who the main manager of the finances is)<\/p>\n<p>So yeah, take it for what it&#8217;s worth!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here were some other notes people sent in too that I found interesting and\/or was nodding my head in agreement with the entire time:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have a hard time with &#8220;sales&#8221; for things I don\u2019t need *at the moment* but can use\/need later. It&#8217;s almost like hoarding\u2026&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My problem area with budgeting tends to migrate&#8230; I\u2019ll notice I\u2019m spending too much in one area (e.g eating out) so I\u2019ll do an awesome job of reducing my spending in that category, but then I nearly always blow out somewhere else; like I\u2019ll buy lots of books, or drive around and do lots of different days walks with my dog and wreck the petrol budget. I\u2019m improving, but I don\u2019t quite have my savings rate where I would like it to be!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I struggle with impulse buying and sticking to my budget. It is horrible. I literally need someone going around with a cane to smack me anytime I buy or even look at something that isn&#8217;t on the budget. I see something and I decide that I must have it. Only to realize that I probably don&#8217;t need it and in the part of the world where I am, we don&#8217;t do returns &#x1f62d;. Even when I know I should not, I still go ahead and buy. I need serious help. Lol.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ok J. Money, here\u2019s my deal. My issue is not lattes and brown bagging lunches. I think most budgeted followers step over those penny\u2019s to save dollars. For me it\u2019s those multi hundred purchases. The Roomba, the high quality skin care, clothes to look good at the dinner party in upper middle class suburbia\/hip family neighborhood x, new hobby (photography, watercolor, books!). This is the stuff that fills my soul or makes my life easier&#8230; sometimes temporarily and sometimes longer (which is why I keep doing it). Leave me the lattes and help me purge my $39.95 (five at a time) book purchasing habit! I want to read &#8217;em all but you know I only ever get to like 1.5 of them. I need to split the wheat from the chaff and get wiser about those hundred something purchases that seem to show up every month.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The area of my budget that I struggle with the most is balancing fun with goals. I have my emergency savings and retirement accounts set up and am working towards paying off student loan debt (about $60k). I struggle with putting large amounts of money towards the debt while still making sure I spend a reasonable amount of money towards fun activities so my life isn&#8217;t totally boring!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I teach mindfulness as a psychologist and life coach, and have a beautiful day planner that I use on a regular basis (for my regular business and side hustle) because I&#8217;m very old-school and am not into digital things. Friends tease me that I only use my smartphone for phone calls! Due to this, I have struggled with the most with creating a detailed budget, which would involve first entering daily transactions to track my money, because even with the amazing programs out there (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/mint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mint<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Capital<\/a>, etc.), I can&#8217;t seem to make myself get online to do it. I already know I would use a budget planner as I use my other planner daily, and did not even know budget planners existed until I saw this post, so thanks for sharing the info!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Now to The Sea of Side Hustles!<\/h2>\n<p>So the above was all in response to trying to win our Mindful Budgeting Planner <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/hustler-budgeting-journal-giveaway\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we were giving out<\/a>, but then we had a 2nd giveaway too, all around a new Side Hustling Journal recently launched.<\/p>\n<p>We asked people what gigs they were considering and\/or already working on, and the results there were as varied as they were interesting as well!
