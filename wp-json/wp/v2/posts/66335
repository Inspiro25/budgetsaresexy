My net worth was close to $500k and life will go on, but I am sad bc this was money earmarked for a wedding, so it feels bad bad.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for any advice you can give me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p>Oh no!!! I&#8217;m so sorry to hear that! :(<\/p>\n<p>Are you sure it&#8217;s gone-gone?! Any sliver of hope you&#8217;ll get some of it back??<\/p>\n<p>[UPDATE: they were recently approved to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-gets-approval-return-270-million-customers-wsj-2022-08-04\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">give back $270 million<\/a> to customers, but unfortunately that&#8217;s only a fraction of the loss.]<\/p>\n<p>Really sucks either way, gosh&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never heard of Voyager before until your note so I googled them and unfort. still don&#8217;t know much :(<\/p>\n<p>I will say you&#8217;re on the right track of <strong>focusing on that half a milly to make you feel better!! <\/strong>That&#8217;s really what I do too when $hit goes down&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I also like to pretend it&#8217;s just <strong>erasing some of the &#8220;wins&#8221; I&#8217;ve gotten over the years<\/strong> vs losing *capital*&#8230; For example, with your $500k I&#8217;m sure $100k-$200k was just gains!! So really it&#8217;s like &#8220;only&#8221; gaining $85k-$185K in total which of course is still super good and you&#8217;d never turn that down right?!<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how I usually think of things when it comes to losses anyways :) That, or if it&#8217;s real bad <strong>I&#8217;ll just ignore the crap out of it until I eventually calm down since I know everything is temporary,<\/strong> lol&#8230; Like with my recent $13k loss in crypto (!!!). [Update: now only a &#8220;loss&#8221; of $11k! Though only really counts btw when you cash out&#8230;] Not sure this is the most <em>healthiest<\/em> mindset to have, but it does seem to work for me&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And at least you can still get married to the love of your life with or without $$$ yeah?! What if you &#8220;made it a thing&#8221; and did a super low key cheap wedding &#8211; but still a fun as hell one of course! And tell people it&#8217;s because all the $$$ was lost in the bankruptcy?! Kinda like &#8220;owning it&#8221; instead of ignoring it like I just suggested? &#x1f602; Might not be the most appropriate seeing how it&#8217;s your wedding and all, haha, but just throwing ideas out there&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Either way, I&#8217;m super sorry to hear about this and do hope you feel better sooner than later :( The losses are all a part of the game, though of course you always *wish* they were lost fairly vs unfairly!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; J$<\/p>\n<p>OH! I forgot about one other hack that sometimes works for me, especially when <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/silly-little-expense-trick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paying unexpected high bills<\/a>&#8230; Since my wife and I both share our money, <strong>I just think about how HALF the bills are hers too!<\/strong>, so I&#8217;m really only paying half of stuff myself, haha&#8230; So in the case with your wedding, while it still sucks, at least *your portion* is only half of it in theory! So maybe sucks just a little bit less?! Maybe?!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p>Some of this advice is kinda silly, but I swear it works ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And I didn&#8217;t say it in the email, but another key takeaway here is to NEVER PLAY WITH MONEY YOU CAN&#8217;T AFFORD TO LOSE.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Especially when dealing with crypto-anything.<\/p>\n<p>Sure you won&#8217;t earn a lot stashing it in boring old savings or CDs or the like, but at least your *capital* is preserved for exactly when you need it. You never really think you&#8217;re going to be involved with a bankruptcy or anything, but as we all know $hit happens so you always gotta be thinking multiple plays ahead&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anywho, that&#8217;s what I do when I&#8217;m dealing with financial disasters.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I focus on the total *gains* I&#8217;ve gotten over the years, and just deduct the losses mentally from it.<\/li>\n<li>I remind myself that half of all losses are actually my wife&#8217;s &#8211; not mine &#8211; so it&#8217;s only half as bad! &#x1f602;<\/li>\n<li>I bury my head in the sand for a bit until it all passes over&#8230; Again, perhaps not the healthiest, but it does seem to work for those like me with A.D.H.D. &#8211; you eventually just forget about it!! And even when you don&#8217;t, life has a funny way of erasing it for you anyways with enough time&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/nothing-is-ever-permanent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nothing is ever permanent.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And remember too, typically losses only &#8220;count&#8221; when you actually cash out! If your stocks are going up and down and up and down as they usually do, none of it matters until the day you click &#8220;sell&#8221; and lock in the gains or losses&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So in terms of the overall stock market, I rarely worry much &#8211; even during this past madness (I BUY instead!) &#8211; since I know none of it matters until X number of decades from now&#8230; Until then, it&#8217;s all just noise.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-47188\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/stock-market-crash-no-surprise.jpg\" alt=\"stock market crash no surprise\" width=\"562\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/stock-market-crash-no-surprise.jpg 625w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/stock-market-crash-no-surprise-300x273.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My two cents anyways!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you all deal with financial pain??

They released funds for people who had their money in fiat USD. Funny though, they lied about having FDIC insurance too, it&#8217;s been wild following all the information coming out. As far as dealing with the loss it&#8217;s been helpful for me to share with people that care about me. I even told my dad this week that I lost it bc of a bankruptcy. They all have been supportive and kind vs angry\/judgemental which surprised me. Overall I&#8217;ve been comparing this experience to how bank runs used to happen before FDIC, and I am grateful that doesn&#8217;t happen to us anymore.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Amen to that!
