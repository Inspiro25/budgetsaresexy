I liked her stuff so much I thought I&#8217;d post up another one!  And plus, I&#8217;m out at USAA&#8217;s headquarters today getting my learn on ;)  Let me know if you wanna see more of her? Maybe she&#8217;ll get a weekly thing?)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m a bit confused by some news I heard lately.<\/strong>  Although the economy remains in the tank, there\u2019s a bright spot called \u201caspirational spending.\u201d  If you\u2019ve never heard this term, it\u2019s when you make expensive purchases to match the lifestyle you <strong><em>want<\/em><\/strong> to be living, instead of the life you\u2019re <strong><em>actually<\/em><\/strong> living.  (Thanks Katy at <a href=\"http:\/\/thenonconsumeradvocate.com\/\">TheNonConsumerAdvocate.com<\/a> for this definition.)  Apparently, businesses like Tiffany\u2019s, Coach, Movado, Sam Adams Beer, and Abercrombie &#038; Fitch are raking in profits like drug dealers, despite general consumer disinterest in spending.  Turns out, there are a lot of people that aspire to the good life even in the worst of circumstances.  Or in the case of the cast of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/05\/getting-your-finances-in-shape-on-the-jersey-shore\/\">Jersey Shore<\/a>, some people who just aspire to the worst of behavior and call it the good life.  But I digress.<\/p>\n<p>All I can say is, \u201cyou go girl\/boy, spend that money and get the economy moving.\u201d  Woop Woop!  I totally believe in the power of corporate greed to improve our lives.  If Tiffany\u2019s is selling more rocks, they\u2019ll hire more non-union, minimum wage rocksellers, and everybody wins.  I\u2019m definitely not one to stand in judgment of the spending habits of others:  when it comes to aspirational spenders, it\u2019s not a choice &#8211; they were born that way.  (Before I forget, I must point out that I\u2019m neither endorsing nor hating any of the aforementioned brands.  Wouldn\u2019t dream of it; they all have high-dollar lawyers on retainer.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But some folks aren\u2019t on board with economic prosperity through aspirational spending. <\/strong> Google \u201cphotos of Bill and Melinda Gates\u201d and take a look.  Their clothes are pretty understated (I\u2019m being kind, they\u2019re just plain dull).  They aren\u2019t wearing current fashion; they might have bought their clothes this year or 10 years ago.  They might have stolen them from their grandparents.  Get out your magnifying glass\u2014not a single recognizable label on anything.  Melinda\u2019s not rocking the Dolce and Gabana logo on her handbag, and Bill\u2019s old-guy polo shirts are completely free of polo ponies.   And you won\u2019t find even a tiny bit of bling on either of them.  <em>Didn\u2019t they get the memo on how rich people are supposed to look?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what their lack of conspicuous consumption is telling the world:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>They\u2019ve decided to let their deeds do the talking, not their purchases.<\/strong>  Risky move.  No one will ever notice how rich they are if they keep dressing like the homeless and giving away billions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They\u2019re not gracious enough to provide free advertising for other businesses by wearing their labels.<\/strong>  I guess Bill figures nobody advertises Microsoft for free, why should he and Mel be stooges for Tommy Hilfiger?<\/li>\n<li><strong>They\u2019re unwilling to go along with the herd, and insist on defining \u201cthe good life\u201d in their own way.<\/strong>  Good luck with that.  I seem to recall Bill left the herd at Harvard to start a little computer business.  Look where that got him.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>True story:<\/strong>  several years ago in Vegas, a guy was teasing me about a souvenir t-shirt I purchased.  I responded that it wasn\u2019t just a cheesy souvenir, it was a nifty addition to my wardrobe.  T-shirts are cheap, durable, and you can wear them with any ensemble ($5 bucks to any straight guy who can say ensemble with a straight face and really mean it.  Pay the man J$).  After a hard day of wear there\u2019s no need to rush to the laundry, just throw them in your gym bag and \u201crecycle\u201d them as workout wear.  They also double as sleepwear and they make excellent rags when you\u2019re finally tired of them.  That\u2019s a lot for very little coin.  He was unimpressed by my pitch.  Then I mentioned I\u2019d read <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/07\/book-review-millionaire-next-door\/\">The Millionaire Next Door<\/a><strong>, <\/strong>enjoying the part about millionaires not spending money on appearances, and I\u2019d been inspired to go through life in cheap clothes while laughing to myself because I was a millionaire.  Wishing to be honest, I explained I only had half of the million, but I still enjoyed this little joke with myself.  Shut him right up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m really not a braggart, but the conversation had started off stupidly. <\/strong> This guy had lost two grand at a casino the night before.  He was bragging that he\u2019d been doing so much high-stakes gambling, they comp\u2019d his room and meals and he was living large.  No kidding!  Only the really wealthy pay two grand a night for a standard hotel room and a pass through the buffet.  He was truly ass-pirational!  I should have kept my mouth shut but I felt bad after hearing his tale, what with having to pay $79 for my room and the $500K thing.<\/p>\n<p>Try it yourself:  the next time you choose to do something economical, like buying your wedding dress at <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/04\/should-only-poor-people-shop-at-thrift-stores\/\">Goodwill<\/a>, tell yourself it\u2019s aspirational spending.  You might find it mildly amusing.  Even better, tell others you\u2019re living like fellow millionaires B &#038; M, and let them wonder.  It\u2019s no one\u2019s business whether you actually have the million or not, what\u2019s important is that your stuff looks the part.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>Guest post by <strong>Barbara &#8220;Babs&#8221; Wagner<\/strong> &#8211; a former poster child for financial misadventure, who learned most of what she knows the hard way.
