So, this post is about how it all went down, plus a few other cost-effective ring ideas people shared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully it gives some inspiration or ideas to any of you guys or gals planning to propose soon to your significant others! And for the rest of y\u2019all, just a fun and sappy story. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, here\u2019s a glimpse of my wife\u2019s engagement ring\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63689 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Mrs_Joel_Ring_JPG_9kZma0_i-e1611931200975.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stone is a Yogo Sapphire. And the reason it\u2019s weird-shaped is because I mined it with my bare hands! The setting and band are white gold with teeny tiny diamonds all around it. The all-in cost was $1,390.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My Clueless Beginnings &#8230; How Much Should You Spend on an Engagement Ring?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was 27 years old and had no clue what I was doing. I&#8217;m guessing most people are a little lost and confused when they&#8217;re planning the biggest investment of their life (the marriage, not the ring). Carats, ring sizes, advice coming in from all directions &#8230; ring shopping is quite overwhelming!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My married friends weren&#8217;t much help. One colleague at work told me to spend at least $30,000 on a ring! I\u2019ll never forget &#8212; he said, \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about your wife sitting around having brunch with her friends\u2026 you want her to have the biggest and fanciest ring to show off.\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;\u00a0 Horrible advice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The internet told me to spend 3 months of my salary on a ring. I earned ~$90k\/year back in 2013, so this would have been like $22,500! This was WAY more than I had in mind. I continued shopping around online, but never found anything that felt right.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Does an Engagement Ring Have to Be a Diamond?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife never really liked diamonds. She studied soil science, worked in farms and vineyards, and was always more fascinated with other types of earth stones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day I was chatting with a family member and they mentioned that maybe a colored sapphire would be nice instead of a diamond ring. I had never considered a sapphire engagement ring before. I guess I thought anything less than a big sparkly diamond might <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seem<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cheap. But, the more I thought about my wife\u2019s style and attitude, the more I came to like the sapphire idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better yet, I was recommended a specific type of sapphire, called a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gemsociety.org\/article\/montana-sapphires-yogo-sapphires\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yogo Sapphire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.naturalbluesapphires.com\/news\/yogo-sapphires-the-blue-pebbles-of-montana\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yogos are found only in Montana<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and since my wife\u2019s family is from up there, it had a cool personal connection. I also heard that the center stone in Princess Diana\u2019s famous engagement ring might be a yogo sapphire, so this eradicated my fear of seeming \u201ccheap.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back, I don\u2019t know why I cared so much about what others thought. My advice now for any people looking to buy a ring is: Do whatever you feel is best for you and your partner. Don\u2019t let others decide your ring. The more unique\/different\/personal it is to you, the more special it will be.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Finding a Yogo Sapphire<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was chatting with another family member at Christmas, they were telling me about visiting a yogo sapphire mine once as a kid. His school class took an excursion into the mine, and all the kids got to try mining their own stones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This got me thinking &#8230; Instead of buying a sapphire, why don\u2019t I just visit a mine, ask the workers if I can borrow a pick axe, and dig up my own natural sapphire? How hard can it be? Plus it\u2019ll save me a few bucks instead of buying one at the store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started calling around to different mines in Montana to ask about yogo mining. Unfortunately, I hit a few roadblocks. Since yogos aren\u2019t very profitable for the mining business, there was only 1 mine that specialized in yogo sapphires, and that mine had been closed for 2 years due to a large accident involving the owner. &#x1f633;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few more phone calls to mine sites, I struck some luck, albeit a bit of a risk &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found a guy who owned a small mine in the middle of dingo woop woop, Montana. He said that a few years back he bought a truckload of \u201creserve ore\u201d (dirt) from a yogo mine and he\u2019d be happy to ship me some. He said <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGive me your credit card number over the phone, I\u2019ll ship you a box of dirt and some instructions, and you\u2019ll probably find some yogo sapphires in there.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guy said he&#8217;d charge me $100 for the dirt and $40 for shipping. 2 weeks later, I had a large box of dirt delivered to a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I guess things have changed since I was searching for a Montana sapphire because some mining production has restarted and there are even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/montanagems.net\/activities\/on-site-mining\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">options for people to find their own stones<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now. Yogos in particular are coveted enough that the ones that come from \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gia.edu\/gems-gemology\/summer-2018-gemological-characterization-of-sapphires-from-yogo-gulch-montana\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yogo gulch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d can come with special certification.)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mining Gemstones Isn\u2019t Really That Hard &#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The box was about the size of a small cooler. I was expecting to find some regular loose soil inside that I\u2019d have to sift through, but instead there were about 15-20 large dirt rocks in the box, each about the size of my fist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instructions were to soak the rocks in water and slowly rub them with various tools until you find gems inside. It was a very slow and tedious process that took several trips to my friend\u2019s house to work on. After hours and hours of rubbing and scraping, we started to find little rough sapphires &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63688 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/yogo_sapphires_jpg_PTc6jiug-scaled-e1611931185649.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ended up with about 100 tiny blue stones, only of which 4-5 would be big enough to put in a ring. Coincidently, one gemstone was in the shape of a heart, so that was used in the final ring.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How I Met the Fancy Ring Designer<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a pure coincidence \u2026 The week after mining the sapphire, I was throwing a party at my house and one of my friends brought along a guest. The guest turned out to be a custom necklace designer who worked at a fancy jewelry store in Beverly Hills.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few beers, we got talking about the sapphire story, and he offered to design and make me a ring. I was surprised, because he was used to designing custom bling bling for celebrities and gangster rappers in town \u2026 Their budgets were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, mine was only a few grand. He told me not to worry about the money, and he would ask his boss if he can just do this job \u201cunder the table.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63687 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/ring_designs_for_yogo_jpeg_10PI6r4l-e1611931172454.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"487\" height=\"272\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I gave him the yogo sapphire and after a few weeks of emails back and forth with design ideas, it was all ready. I picked up my custom ring outside the back of his workplace and in exchange for an envelope full of cash. The best $1,250 I\u2019ve ever spent. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$140 for the stone + $1,250 for the ring stuff = $1,390. Not too shabby!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>It\u2019s the Thought That Counts, Not the Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, any ring is a good ring. I like to think that my wife would have said Yes even if I proposed with an empty box. (Some people don\u2019t even want a ring, just an eternal promise of love &#x1f60d;.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the ring competition last year, we got a TON of responses from people who spent less than a few hundred dollars on a ring. And some even under $1!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you&#8217;re planning a proposal in the near future, don\u2019t feel pressured to spend money just \u2018cause. High or low, YOU set the budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Other Ideas for Budget-Friendly Engagement Rings and Discounts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few ideas we got from the competition respondents! &#x1f447;&#x1f447;&#x1f447;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ensorings.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enso Rings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ($20 &#8211; $40): These are made from super durable silicone and look quite sharp I think!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brilliantearth.com\/lab-diamonds-search\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lab Diamonds<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (~$300 starting): These diamonds are made in a lab (environmentally friendly!), and are indistinguishable from earth diamonds.

Ask the repair person if they have any diamond connections and if you can strike a cash deal. (The watch is just a decoy to talk to the repair person, obviously!)
