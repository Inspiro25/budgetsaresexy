They\u2019re so loud!\u201d \u201cOh, I love it!\u201d I told her. \u201cEvery time I look over I see dollar signs.\u201d \u201cTwenty, forty, sixty, one hundred!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>See, I love bachelorette parties, but not for the reasons one would expect &#8211; dancing, alcohol, the chance to wear cute matching outfits. Even though I actually didn\u2019t have a bachelorette party of my own.<\/p>\n<p>We did everything a little non-mainstream for our wedding starting with choosing a <a href=\"https:\/\/millennialboss.com\/2016\/01\/hacking-engagement-ring-moissanite\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moissanite engagement ring<\/a> instead of a diamond, skipping the bridal shower and bachelorette party, and using <a href=\"https:\/\/millennialboss.com\/2016\/11\/diy-wedding-flowers-bouquets-centerpieces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diy wedding flowers<\/a> at our small winter ceremony. We were paying off over $100,000 of debt at the time, and it didn\u2019t make sense to spend tons of money or subject our friends and family to do so on our behalf.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62114\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/millennial-boss-wedding-day.jpg\" alt=\"millennial boss wedding day\" width=\"535\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/millennial-boss-wedding-day.jpg 724w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/millennial-boss-wedding-day-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><i>[Slightly freezing in this picture. Maybe a wedding in December in Boston wasn\u2019t our brightest idea, even if we saved a bunch of money!]<\/i><\/p>\n<p><strong>I love bachelorette parties though because they are one of the most profitable niches on Etsy!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I stumbled into this discovery two years ago when I started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/TheSwagElephant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my small Etsy shop<\/a> as a side hustle. I started selling temporary tattoos for bachelorette parties with phrases such as \u201cBride Tribe,\u201d and the Hangover movie inspired \u201cWolf Pack.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t a side hustler before this, but I had heard about the concept of selling on Etsy on a podcast and decided to go for it. I had been to enough bachelorette parties to know that cheap decor and accessories were what I wanted to sell. I\u2019ve had to Venmo too many Maid of Honors in the past for bachelorette party supplies that I would never wear or use again.<\/p>\n<p>After a quick google search, I found <a href=\"http:\/\/temporarytattoos.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TemporaryTattoos.com<\/a> and had a box of 3,000 gold tattoos with bachelorette-related sayings manufactured and shipped to me. I put them on my wrists and then took a few pictures on my phone of my arms in bars, in front of flower bushes as I walked around my neighborhood, and in front of my apartment complex pool. I then created an Etsy shop and listed the product.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62115\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wolf-pack-tattoos-etsy.jpg\" alt=\"wolf pack tattoos\" width=\"425\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wolf-pack-tattoos-etsy.jpg 522w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wolf-pack-tattoos-etsy-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wolf-pack-tattoos-etsy-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wolf-pack-tattoos-etsy-144x144.jpg 144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>To my surprise, this side hustle worked and the margins on this product were crazy!<\/strong> Each tattoo cost me 20 cents and I could sell them on Etsy for at least $2 each. Since multiple girls attend a bachelorette party, I often sold bundles of 15 or 20 tattoos at one time. Every sale was at least <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$15 profit<\/strong><\/span>, and Etsy brought all of the customers to me. I barely had to do any marketing.<\/p>\n<p>The problem, though, was that I hated it. The cha-chings of sales coming through wore off quickly when I realized I had to check my Etsy app for orders each morning, print out a shipping label, and then stop at the post office on my way home from work each time. I didn\u2019t have sales every day, so it also became hard to predict my schedule. If I was even <em>a day<\/em> late with shipping out the order, I could get a nastygram from the customer and possibly a negative review.<\/p>\n<p>By the fall of 2017 I decided that the work itself was easy, but it took up too much mental space in my day that I just didn\u2019t want to allocate anymore. And while the money was good, it wasn\u2019t<em> life changing<\/em> enough to make it worth it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Around that time I learned about the concept of <em>selling printables<\/em> when I invited Laura of I Heart Planners <a href=\"https:\/\/firedrillpodcast.com\/fire031\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on my podcast<\/a> and fell in love.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Printables (or digital downloads) are items that you can sell passively on Etsy. You make the digital file on your computer, upload it to Etsy, and then thousands of customers can buy and download it with no further action from you.<\/p>\n<p>I loved the idea of a passive product that would remove the steps I didn\u2019t like about being an Etsy seller. I switched my product line from temporary tattoos to printable scavenger hunts. Bachelorette parties can print out my scavenger hunts and take them bar hopping, checking off activities such as \u201cfind someone with the groom\u2019s name and take a picture,\u201d \u201crequest Single Ladies by Beyonce,\u201d or \u201cbuy the bride a shot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/TheSwagElephant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62116\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bachelorette-scavenger-hunt-printable.jpg\" alt=\"bachelorette scavenger hunt printable\" width=\"501\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bachelorette-scavenger-hunt-printable.jpg 766w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bachelorette-scavenger-hunt-printable-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bachelorette-scavenger-hunt-printable-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bachelorette-scavenger-hunt-printable-144x144.jpg 144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>These scavenger hunts sell for $7 each, and my top design that took under two hours to make has made me well over <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$1,000<\/span> in profits.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The best part is how low maintenance this side hustle is for me. I really focused in 2018 and made a bunch of listings over the course of a few weekends and have barely touched the shop since. I think I added one new listing in June of this year but zero others in 2019. I\u2019ve still made thousands of dollars this year on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/TheSwagElephant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my shop<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>The reason that I am side hustling is that my husband and I are saving for financial independence. We were in the financial independence retire early camp, but I\u2019ve realized since starting my side hustles (<a href=\"https:\/\/millennialboss.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I blog too!<\/a>) that I love to work. I just want to be able to control <em>how<\/em> I work, and for <em>whom<\/em> I work for, in the future. There is work that is creative and fun if you can find it!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Since learning about FIRE though, we\u2019ve paid off over $100,000 of debt, owned and sold a rental property, learned how to manage investments, and are well on our path to financial independence.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One could even argue that we are already financially independent somewhere, but since we choose to live in a high cost of living area (Seattle), we still have some ways to go. Luckily, we both enjoy our jobs so we are in comfortable cruise mode.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62117\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/millennial-boss-hiking-husband-dog.jpg\" alt=\"millennial boss hiking\" width=\"578\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/millennial-boss-hiking-husband-dog.jpg 773w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/millennial-boss-hiking-husband-dog-300x196.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/millennial-boss-hiking-husband-dog-768x503.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In August of this year we had our first baby and I\u2019m currently on maternity leave. The \u201ccruising to financial independence\u201d part is a little more difficult with a newborn, I\u2019m realizing, but we\u2019re loving it! I\u2019m also super glad I have my side hustles, because covering unexpected baby expenses and saving for her future becomes a lot easier when you have additional money coming in on top of the day job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Last year I made $40,000 with my side hustles all-in, so it\u2019s no small change!<\/strong> Most of the income is from blogging which is where I put a majority of my hours into each week. The Etsy shop is my favorite, though, and I\u2019ve made almost <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$6,000 and growing<\/strong><\/span> with just a few weeks of work last year. I\u2019ve since learned a little more about <a href=\"https:\/\/millennialboss.com\/2019\/09\/etsy-seo-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etsy SEO<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/millennialboss.com\/2019\/09\/boost-etsy-ranking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increasing sales on Etsy<\/a> that have also helped me dial up profits further.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62118\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/etsy-printable-stats.jpg\" alt=\"etsy printable stats\" width=\"608\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/etsy-printable-stats.jpg 946w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/etsy-printable-stats-300x101.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/etsy-printable-stats-768x257.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When I have a free second, I plan to expand my product line to include <em><strong>baby shower<\/strong><\/em> and <em><strong>bridal shower<\/strong><\/em> printable decor and invitations. I think those niches, like bachelorette, will also sell well.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many different printables outside of the wedding niche though that sell on Etsy. There are kitchen spice jar labels, holiday gift tags, place cards for Thanksgiving dinner, budgeting spreadsheets, kids first day of school signs, prom proposal posters, you name it. It\u2019s just about coming up with a good idea and then finding the time to do it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/etsy-printables-ebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62119\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/seasonal-printables-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"seasonal printables ideas\" width=\"376\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/seasonal-printables-ideas.jpg 377w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/seasonal-printables-ideas-260x300.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>I recently gave away an ebook to my blog readers called \u201cThe Seasonal Products Secret\u201d where I share 12 months of printable ideas you can sell on Etsy.<\/strong> With the holidays coming up, seasonal products are where you should look for profits, and I\u2019m happy to share this ebook with Budgets are Sexy readers if you\u2019re curious about it :) <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/etsy-printables-ebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">You can download the free ebook here.<\/a><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>My plan this year is to figure out how to be a Mom and enjoy my maternity leave as much as I can.
