If you want to be rich, do rich people stuff.&#8221; &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moneypeach.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Peach<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gooooooood morning my fiscally conscious friends!<\/strong> How&#8217;s your money saving, investing, clearing away debts this week? Anyone kill any credit cards or student loans?<\/p>\n<p>We had a major weight lifted off our shoulders this week when we found out our tenants are going to renew for another year &#8211; whew! And with our additional $25 raise in rent too! (The first time we raised it in 3 years) My wallet started having convulsions when we found out they might need to deploy being in the military&#8230; And as much as I love <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/08\/1st-month-being-landlord-how-property-managers-work-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">using a property manager<\/a>, they cost a pretty penny finding renters. Another reminder that home ownership is no joke! I hope you never rush into it like we did all those years ago&#8230;\u00a0 It&#8217;s easily <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/biggest-life-purchases\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the biggest mistake<\/a> of our financial lives. (But since this blog came out of it, it&#8217;s hard to complain all the way :))<\/p>\n<p><strong>In other news, remember our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/06\/financial-personality-quiz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Personality Quiz<\/a> we did last week?<\/strong> Well, the team over at <a href=\"http:\/\/payoff.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Payoff<\/a> tracked where y&#8217;all fell in terms of each of the personalities, and were kind enough to shoot over a snapshot of it:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/06\/financial-personality-quiz\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44421\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personality-types-blog.jpg\" alt=\"financial personality types\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" \/><\/a>Then they asked if I&#8217;d like an analysis of my readership straight from the guy who invented the quiz &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jgbuckwalter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. J. Galen Buckwalter<\/a> &#8211; who turns out to be the same scientist behind eHarmony&#8217;s &#8220;love&#8221; patent &#8211; hah! And who&#8217;s also apparently responsible for 4% of marriages in the US :)<\/p>\n<p>I said hell yeah, and here&#8217;s a portion of what he wrote back:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Your readership shows a lot of similarities with what we see in the general population. Foremost is the fact that the two types seen most frequently are Storytellers and Guardians. Storytellers are your classic leaders: adventurous, social and outgoing. Guardians are much more cautious and traditional, yet they are every bit as comfortable taking a leadership role. Other groups that are present in your readership at the frequencies we see in the general population are Adventurers (thought leaders, creatives, novelty-seekers), Ambassadors (nurturers, hosts, people-pleasers), Rocks (stoics, emotionally controlled, hard to rattle) and Sparks (emotionally expressive, dramatic, anxious).<\/p>\n<p><em>Now for some interesting areas where your readership differs from the general population&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are many fewer Architects among your readers than among the general population. This is particularly interesting because Architects fit the classic profile of financial planners. They are organized, they enjoy planning, and they fit well into the \u201csystem\u201d as it were.<\/p>\n<p>One possibility that may explain the underrepresentation of Architects is that you may have a particular appeal to people who do not really want to fit into the system. However, we can reject that notion out of hand because your readership is also low on Free Spirits. These are the folks that enjoy a healthy dose of chaos in their organizational approach and also like to challenge the system. You would expect that these folks would have a hard time committing to the structure needed to budget and all of the good stuff you provide information on in your blog, so it is no surprise that you are low on this group. But again, the point I want to make clear is that your low frequency of Architects does not seem to be coming from any messaging on your part that appeals to the folks who are not comfortable with the authoritative aspects of our financial system.<\/p>\n<p>So now that you know who is underrepresented in your group, the blooming obvious question remaining is who is overrepresented in your group. The largest overrepresentation is with Contrarians followed closely by Oases. Contrarians are the question-askers, the people who like to work within the system but serve the purpose of making sure the group does not avoid the hard questions. As we have been diving more and more into the functioning of these types, I have been rather stunned by how essential Contrarians are to the successful functioning of any group&#8230;An Oasis is a person who glories in their internal dialogue, a thinker, a critic. Much focus on this broad personality type is on their preference to avoid social situations, a preference that is often incorrectly portrayed. Oases don\u2019t fear social situations; in fact many are highly effective speakers and even <em>bon vivants<\/em>. They do find that social situations take energy and they need both prep and recuperation for big social events. They do not tend to be as naturally effective with finances as do Architects, but when they focus on a problem they tend to solve it.<\/p>\n<p>So there you go, J. Money, a few personality-based insights into your awesome readership. It is super diverse, just like every successful community must be. They tend toward being highly inquisitive yet collaborative. One suspects that may reflect their fearless leader as well.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Neat, huh? :)<\/strong> You can read the entire report in full here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1P1IH812vMZEuTcUZXRdf1vjqW_Eo2LY5nW7apWqydHA\/edit?usp=sharing\">BudgetsAreSexy Readership Analysis<\/a>.

It was an embarrassment he resolved never to face again. Luckily, his wife rescued him and paid the tab. [In] February 1950, McNamara returned to Major&#8217;s Cabin Grill with his partner Ralph Schneider. When the bill arrived, McNamara paid with a small cardboard card, known today as a Diners Club\u00ae Card. This event was hailed as the &#8220;First Supper,&#8221; paving the way for the world&#8217;s first multipurpose charge card.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>These 3 new reality shows are casting &#8211; know anyone?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Show #1<\/strong> for Spike TV (shoot me <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an email<\/a> if interested and I&#8217;ll connect you):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are looking for a couple who lead the lives of millionaires but are at risk of losing it all.\u00a0 They make a very generous combined income, yet are unable to save any of it.\u00a0 Whether they are living way above their means or keep making poor investments, this couple needs serious help&#8230; To be clear &#8211; we are not looking to shame this couple.\u00a0 We want to help them.\u00a0 This experience for them could prove to be invaluable.\u00a0 We would be shooting with them this summer and obviously, there will be monetary compensation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Show #2<\/strong> for not sure&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Casting families who have dreamed of living in paradise but don&#8217;t know where to start!\u00a0 Do you think you and your family could retire today if you wanted to?
