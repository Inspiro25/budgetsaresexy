Gimme all day long, please!<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<p>J. Money &#8211; I would say that from what I know of you from your pretty recent blog posts and the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/good-vs-bad-reasons-to-quit-something\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Money Show<\/a>&#8216;s first 15 podcast episodes, we have very similar money philosophies. I lean a bit more towards the Mustachian approach of reducing expenses than you, and I hate real estate a little less than you.<\/p>\n<p>That said, you might get a kick out of our recent financial journey. If you don&#8217;t have time or interest to read it, no big deal. It was good to prepare as I am sharing my &#8220;life-story&#8221; this evening to a small group in our church.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TLDR Version<\/strong> = Life&#8217;s crazy, I would do a few things a bit differently if I had a do-over, but then again, I enjoy the lessons I&#8217;ve learned. I am definitely in the &#8220;rent&#8221; camp at the moment, as buying and selling 3 houses in less than 5 years is wack!<\/p>\n<p><strong>July 2008<\/strong> &#8212; Start internship w\/ Northwestern Mutual &#8211; primarily selling insurance while finishing my degree at University.<\/p>\n<p><strong>May 2009<\/strong> &#8212; I graduate, move home w\/my folks, obtain investment licenses and continue building my clientele with Northwestern Mutual.<\/p>\n<p><strong>June 2010<\/strong> &#8212; After moving out I realize that I&#8217;m not really making a lot of money and we mutually decide, after I flake out for a few days to a week, that it wasn&#8217;t\/isn&#8217;t the best timing for me to build this biz.<\/p>\n<p><strong>July 2010<\/strong> &#8212; Move to a similar role with State Farm for a few months. Big difference was I was serving existing clients, and had a base salary. But my heart still wasn&#8217;t in it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2010<\/strong> &#8212; Spent a few weeks going door to door signing people up for a new garbage collection provider. Funniest thing here was that I got one sale on my first day, and never got another sale again!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mid-September 2010<\/strong> &#8212; Tried my hand playing online poker for a few weeks. I think I made money, but my hourly rate was ~$2.50 an hour. Clearly not worth it!<\/p>\n<p><em>[Editor&#8217;s note: we once had a professional poker player stop by the blog to share what it&#8217;s like to live that lifestyle full-time! Pretty interesting if you ever want to check it out: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/confessions-of-online-poker-player\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Confessions of a poker player<\/a> (pt 1), <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/day-in-life-of-poker-player-pt-2-of-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A day in the life of a poker player<\/a> (pt 2)]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>November 2010<\/strong> &#8212; Offered a contract position with Wells Fargo call center, then 4 weeks later moved to Ameriprise because it was a permanent\/full-time job (this was a good call to make since Wells shut down that call center about 5 months later)<\/p>\n<p><strong>December 2010 &#8211; December 2015<\/strong> &#8212; Worked in two roles at the Ameriprise corporate headquarters starting at $42,000, ending at $75,000 &#8211; and earned the CFP\u00ae designation while I was there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>December 2011<\/strong> &#8212; I met my beautiful wife Tory at a local townie bar in the small town we grew up in. We knew each other by name\/face as we were in the same graduating class in high school, but never had as much as a single conversation before.<\/p>\n<p><strong>October 2012<\/strong> &#8212; We got married and moved into an apartment. Rent was just under $800\/mo for a 1 bedroom 700 sq. foot apartment. This was plenty of space, but we didn&#8217;t like hearing our neighbors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2013<\/strong> &#8212; We purchase our first home and the mortgage is roughly $1,500\/mo PITI. Our combined income is roughly $80,000. Tory has hardly any assets at this point, and ~$65,000 of student loans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>December 2013<\/strong> &#8212; We get our first roommate to have some extra cushion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>August 2014<\/strong> &#8212; We now have 3 other roommates that are covering our mortgage! My wife does not like having roommates, and I don&#8217;t blame her, but I push us\/her to save and pay down debt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>March 2015<\/strong> &#8212; My wife leaves her job as it requires handling conflict which she doesn&#8217;t deal well with, or lend itself to growing a family (she had to work a fair amount of nights). She nannies until 1 month before our son is born and then becomes a full-time stay-at-home-mom.<\/p>\n<p><strong>August 2015<\/strong> &#8212; We purchase a smaller house that is 6 blocks away from our first home, and turn our first home into a full-fledged rental. Our new mortgage payment is under $1,100\/mo PITI.<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2015<\/strong> &#8212; Our son Xavier is born (accidentally in our home! This is a story for another time!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>December 2015<\/strong> &#8212; I leave my corporate gig paying me $75K + great benefits for a role as an Associate Financial Advisor with one of the top 100 (out of ~8,000) Ameriprise practices. This pays me $80,000 with some benefits, but the total compensation + benefits is probably about $5,000 less than the corporate gig.<\/p>\n<p><strong>June 2016<\/strong> &#8212; We sell our second home without the help of a realtor and it turns out that when all is said and done, it cost us ~$1,400\/month to &#8220;rent&#8221; the place we owned for ~10 months. Two days later we purchased a home that is closer to my new office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>August 2016<\/strong> &#8212; I find out that the &#8220;script&#8221; I was being asked to deliver to my\/our clients at this practice on why we were increasing their investment advisory costs was a lie &#8211; and I resign. This is 6 weeks after we purchased our home!<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2016<\/strong> &#8212; I start working with another Ameriprise Franchise office, but this time, I&#8217;m building my clientele from scratch again, with no base salary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2017<\/strong> &#8212; We decide to move up our timeline for baby #2 a bit after learning that Tory&#8217;s mom has cancer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>January 2018<\/strong> &#8212; We move in with my in-laws to dramatically improve our cash-flow, and be with Tory&#8217;s ailing mother.<\/p>\n<p><strong>February 2018<\/strong> &#8212; Tory&#8217;s mom passes away. We knew our time with her was limited, but we thought that we at least had a few more months. We were so glad we got ~4 weeks living with her before she passed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Late-February 2018<\/strong> &#8212; We sell our primary residence (the one we purchased in June 2016)<\/p>\n<p><strong>March 2018<\/strong> &#8212; 3 of our 4 tenants move out, and I&#8217;m currently negotiating with the 4th to offer them an incentive to move out. She, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/when-your-landlord-kicks-you-out-of-your-house\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unlike you<\/a>, does not have children or a spouse, and will be moving in with her folks, so other than convenience, there is no real reason to delay the inevitable. Also, I&#8217;m trying to complete as many things as possible prior to my wife giving birth again!<\/p>\n<p>Our cash flow is super manageable, but the rest of 2018 will be about even, and then in 2019, we&#8217;ll be able to pay down some debts\/start saving. We intend to move out, and I will push for renting in 2020 or 2021 :)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***********<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fun to read, right?? :) I then asked what type of church meeting this is as that&#8217;s a looooot of info to be giving out, haha, and thinking maybe it was some sort of Dave Ramsey class relating to finances or something? But nope:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***********<\/p>\n<p>The church is only 2-3 years old and this is a group of 6 people participating in a 7 week group where week one, we all gave super brief introductions and established guidelines and expectations for the group. Then weeks 2 &#8211; 7 we each get our turn sharing our life story.<\/p>\n<p>Although I don&#8217;t think you are a &#8220;church&#8221; person, this church is awesome!
