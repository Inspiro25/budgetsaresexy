They recognize that  financial stress is a constant issue and they take responsibility for  keeping the ship afloat.\u00a0 They deal with the issues that inevitably arise they make the money decisions.<\/p>\n<p>That person is the <strong><em>Family Chief Financial Officer<\/em><\/strong> (or the CFO).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cRunning  a family\u2019s financial affairs is like running a business. The  family CFO needs to create a family mission statement,  track  monthly  cash flow and expenses, review periodically to avoid   overspending, take  full advantage of legal tax breaks, and work with   professional people  hired to assist the family like accountants,   lawyers, and financial  planners.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Here are a few tips and strategies on how to  perform  these family CFO duties:<\/p>\n<h2>Create a Family Mission Statement<\/h2>\n<p>Each  family needs to understand what the family finances is all about so the  first thing every family needs is a MISSION STATEMENT. As hokey and  awkward as this may seem, writing down the goals and  dreams of the family is one of the most powerful steps you can take. You  get a notebook and you identify what you want your goals to be and be  brave and even set dates for achieving those goals. You list things like  paying off the house, putting kids through college, saving money for  retirement, having money for one or two trips or vacations each year and  so forth.<\/p>\n<h2>Know Your Expenses<\/h2>\n<p>The  most important job of the family CFO is to know the family expenses  inside and out. Open up your checkbook and review your credit card  statements for the last three months or more. Study what money is being  spent on. Figure out the monthly bills and expenses. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/10\/easiest-way-to-be-financially-confident\/\">Understand where  your money is going<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Analyze Your Expenses<\/h2>\n<p>Once  you\u2019ve organized your expenses then you can identify every opportunity  to lower the costs of each of those starting with the biggest ones  first.\u00a0 Identify every interest bearing item.\u00a0 Then  go shopping and go look for the very best mortgage companies, auto and  student loans, and car, boat and homeowners\u2019 insurance you can find.  Don\u2019t let old friendships or concerns about hurting someone\u2019s feelings  get in the way of saving money. Just remember that your old time  insurance agent or financial planner doesn\u2019t pay your bills.\u00a0 <em><strong>As  CFO you get to fire people who don\u2019t produce value or cost you too much  money. <\/strong><\/em>You get to hire people who deliver best value and the best  rates.<\/p>\n<h2>Hold Regular Family Finance Meetings<\/h2>\n<p>Every few months or so, the CFO must meet with the Vice President of Family Affairs (Your Spouse) and all employees (kids).\u00a0 The purpose of the meeting is to conduct a formal review of expenses and bank balances.\u00a0 Each  family meeting should have an agenda that covers the review of each key  component of the family mission statement and budget. The goal of the  meeting is to make sure everything is going according to plan.\u00a0 The end of each meeting also includes a discussion of the question: <em><strong>\u201cHow can we save more money?\u201d <\/strong><\/em> Decisions made are documented in writing with tasks, responsibility and dates for completion of actions identified.<\/p>\n<h2>Institute a Family Reward System<\/h2>\n<p>To  get everyone in the family involved and committed to achieving  progress, reward people based on the money saving ideas developed and  deployed. Bonuses and rewards should be based on ideas, practices and  decisions that lower expenses and actually save or make the family  money. Examples: Make a list of chores and assign duties, then eliminate  the cleaning lady. Study the Internet for quick and easy recipes, cook  at home and go out to restaurants half as much. Take up walking or  running and quit the health club. Do research to identify the best cell  phone packages.\u00a0 Reward the family out of the money saved  by making changes in how money was spent in other areas (water, garbage  and recycling, or going to a better Internet TV package).<\/p>\n<h2>Manage the Family Net Worth<\/h2>\n<p>The  Family CFO has the responsibility of managing assets and liabilities  and to make sure that the family net worth stays healthy. One of the  most significant and most difficult decisions to make is to be brutally  honest with yourself and your ability to manage your family financial  affairs. If you have numerous types of property and assets that you may  best enlist the support and help of a financial advisor.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>\u201cKnow what\u2019s going on with your money, where it is going and how it is invested. That\u2019s what you and your family deserves.\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Who is the Chief Financial Officer in your house?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\nMore info on Scott Feher&#8217;s book: <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1616230576?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1616230576\">Your Life &amp; Your Money, Putting Your Financial House in Order<\/a><\/em> (amazon link).\u00a0 Pretty good stuff!\u00a0 And obviously I&#8217;m the CFO in our household ;)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[I got this as a press release for a new book coming out, Your Life &amp; Your Money, Putting Your Financial House in Order, and&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/who-is-the-family-chief-financial-officer-in-your-house\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":16327,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[74,105],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-3543","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-advice","category-money-management"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Who is the Family Chief Financial Officer in your house? | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/who-is-the-family-chief-financial-officer-in-your-house\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Who is the Family Chief Financial Officer in your house? | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"[I got this as a press release for a new book coming out, Your Life &amp; Your Money, Putting Your Financial House in Order, and...
