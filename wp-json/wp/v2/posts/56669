Last year I effortlessly saved $3,500.00 doing that. &#8211; Teres<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I set up my bank card to round up transactions, multiply that amount by 10 and then save it automatically. Works like a charm and stops you from buying things you don&#8217;t need, as a 30 cent chewing gum immediately &#8216;costs&#8217; you 7 dollars to your savings! &#8211; Rick J.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I participate in <a href=\"http:\/\/theprudenthomemaker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Prudent Homemaker<\/a>\u2019s weekly post of \u201cFrugal Accomplishments\u201d and so I keep a word document listing what I\u2019ve done each day for frugality\u2019s sake. These range from the less-than-exciting washing Ziplock bags in order to reuse them, cooking dried chickpeas in my slow cooker overnight, and making all meals from scratch to some big and exciting things like trips. &#8211; Libby<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My dad always told me to break a dollar. So instead of finding change for something, he just breaks his bills and keeps the change&#8230; Which after a long day of shopping makes for some really heavy pockets, but he&#8217;s been saving his coins like this for all my life and then by the end of the year, he uses the coins for Christmas gifts!<\/p>\n<p>Only bummer is now is that unless he wants to use Coinstar and pay their fee, he has to manually wrap his coins now in order to turn them into the bank since they won&#8217;t do it anymore. So that&#8217;s what he does while watching TV. He&#8217;s retired, he has all the time in the world. lol. &#8211; Samantha Z.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My one life hack has been using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodwill.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/Donation_Valuation_Guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goodwill deductible pricing list<\/a> as a baseline for buying stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, if I can&#8217;t find an item I need at Goodwill and have to buy it at the store, I try to find it for the same price as the tax deductible value.<\/p>\n<p>So for example, if the gov&#8217;t gives you $25 deductible value for a dresser, I will look for a new dresser on Craigslist\/letgo\/OfferUp for $25 or less. That way, when I donate it to Goodwill later, I get the full value, or more deducted!<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re really good about this, you can also do it with clothing, homeware and a lot of stuff. We have been slowly clearing out stuff as much as possible and getting thousands a year in deductions because of it. If you do it right you&#8217;ll pay hardly anything for clothing, etc. &#8211; Akua O.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My way of saving money this month (and every month): I love listening to audiobooks because it&#8217;s a good way to learn while doing other things AND a great way to get through a lot of books quickly (I&#8217;m an auditory learner).<\/p>\n<p>However, I REFUSE to pay for audiobooks. I use an app called <a href=\"https:\/\/app.overdrive.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Overdrive<\/a>. It connects to my local library and I can download from a decent selection of audiobooks. I recently listened to the entirety of Stephen King&#8217;s The Stand (that kept me going for a while!) and now I&#8217;m in the middle of John Steinbeck&#8217;s Travels with Charley. &#8211; Sherri :)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I decided to do a restaurant ban in May and cooked food at home instead. Then, I looked at all the other months since January last year to this year to see how much i was really spending on restaurants. J, I was spending $800\/month on average, NOT INCLUDING GROCERIES! So, that May alone, I essentially saved $800. I\u2019m a foodie and I love trying new restaurants. So I decided to incorporate a restaurant challenge every other month from now on. :) &#8211; Crazy Mom McGee<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Bottles, cans and coupons&#8230; it\u2019s that simple. In Oregon we have what\u2019s known as the Bottle Bill. Every bottle or can of beer (Ok, soft drinks and sports drinks are included) is worth $0.10 if redeemed at the Bottle Drop. So I save them and when the bag is full I make the short drive and do just that.<\/p>\n<p>The kicker is if you use the redemption dollars at the local Fred Meyer (Kroger) store they tack on an additional 20%! My last redemption was over $40&#8230; free money! Add to that my lovely bride&#8217;s coupon clipping prowess which kicked in another $16, and we saved a whopping $64 off a $120 grocery bill!! That\u2019s real money!!!<\/p>\n<p>It flattens me to see neighbors putting bottle and cans in their weekly recycling bins. They get nothing! I\u2019m 53 and doing the FATFIRE thing&#8230; worked hard, saved harder&#8230; And my neighbors ask me all the time for my secrets. I tell them to look in their recycling bins!! It\u2019s all in the attitude man!!!! &#8211; Randal E.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We receive free beef bones and the occasional roast from our raw milk dairy\u2019s manager. With the bones we make delicious stock, which is turned into chilis and soups. &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovelibertyshelter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Liberty<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I used the plastic bag that holds my deluxe package of toilet paper as the trash bag liner in the bathroom trash can instead of plastic bag. It doesn\u2019t save much&#8230; cents. &#8211; Leann H.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Spending money on food is essential. I think its wise to have a plan when it comes to food. My parents do not live far away from me, and they also live on a tiny retirement budget as well. We\u2019ve teamed up to help save money on food items. Since I only graze at morning and noon eating times, I buy for these things myself, however we share supper together. Once every two weeks, my mother and I plan our menu for the next 14 days, then we shop for the items we need to realize that said menu. I drop in after work on my way home and eat with the fam. If I\u2019m late she puts it in a container and I take it to go. I\u2019ve managed to save $150 a month using this method and they reduce costs by sharing the more expensive meal with me. We all win! &#8211; Dwight<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Last summer I read that using only a smidge of toothpaste, instead of covering the entire brush, was just as beneficial. Made a bet with a friend that I could go a year on two tubes of toothpaste; one in the shower and one at the sink. I brush twice daily, minimum, often more. Started last August and still have sufficient in both tubes to make it a year. My grandkids are rolling their eyes as I type. &#8211; Helen W.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a heat wave this weekend, but I left the A\/C off and instead retreated to my basement. In the cool(er) air, my time was spent going through old paperwork and sorting out what needs to be kept from what can be taken to the community shred day in two months.<\/p>\n<p>Then I went sorted through usual piles of basement \u201cstuff\u201d and found working\/usable items that I can donate to my church\u2019s collection drive in two weeks. Since Savers will pay based on weight collected, my basement was cleaned and my church will benefit. The cold shower after the work also saved on the hot water bill.<\/p>\n<p>I can only estimate how much money was saved \u2013 surge pricing from ComEd is a mystery \u2013 but I\u2019d say $15 in electricity for the 3-day period, perhaps $20 in weight-based donations to the church, but the prevention of dumping things into a landfill: priceless. &#8211; Nora S.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>One thing we have started doing is on special days (this month was Father&#8217;s Day and my wife&#8217;s birthday) we pick a special meal to make together and eat at home. We started this for two reasons, first, we do not want our happiness to rely on someone else to cook our meal (or screw it up) and it always seems like that is the day the service is just terrible. The second thing is saving money, and I am sure (with our now family of 4) it has saved us about a $100 this month! &#8211; Luke G<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I hang up my laundry to dry! May only be a few dollars saved, but encompasses ours frugal lifestyle in its entirety. &#8211; Kelly C.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2>Great Overall Financial Advice:<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>Best money advice I have is this: to have iron willpower, but a flexible budget. By that I mean, know what your savings goals are and go for it wholeheartedly, but know that circumstances and human mistakes will come up now and again and a budget has to be somewhat breathable too. You have to leave room for margin, but don&#8217;t skimp on what&#8217;s really important. I have regretted spontaneous purchases and even vacation trips sometimes, but I don&#8217;t regret saving. &#8211; Rachael<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The best financial tip I have been given is to wait 2 paychecks before purchasing a large splurge item (anything unnecessary over $100). I&#8217;ve found that waiting that long has led me to avoid a LOT of unnecessary items or has allowed me to put away some extra cash to better afford these items. &#8211; Joyce<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The classic financial tip I\u2019ve been given is to spend my wage income on income producing assets until I can fund my lifestyle using those assets instead of wages. &#8211; Kahlil<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019m an avid \u201cCash Collector\u201d and a golf enthusiast, and as anyone who plays the game knows it can be kind of pricey based on where you live and the type of golf course you play. On an average week I play Friday afternoon and (2) rounds on Saturday. Total cost for the month is $600.00.<\/p>\n<p>So I have a side hustle now of working part time at my favorite course. I work 2-3 shifts a week for a total of 12-15 hours. The benefits are twofold, I get free golf and free driving range, plus they pay me $10 and hour. So I have a cost avoidance of $600 a month, plus extra cash of $120-$150 a week. Total savings averages over $1,000.00 per month for 6-7 months a year. Paycheck goes straight to Vanguard.<\/p>\n<p>Side note: when you work at a golf course, you also find lots of misplaced golf balls\u2026 So the savings keep on growing! &#8211; Cash Collector<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The most classic financial tip I ever received was to use the envelope system when budgeting. It actually helped when my wife and I were first married. She was a spender, I was a saver, and our two lifestyles caused us to butt heads a little. The envelope system helped her to see visually what I was doing via spreadsheets and online banking and it made it easier for her to get behind it. That was 8 years ago. Since then, we\u2019ve paid off two cars, my school debt, started 2 Roth IRA\u2019s, a mutual fund, a 401k from her work, and bought a house last fall because all because of the envelope system. &#8211; Sam C<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I created a cash flow analysis spreadsheet and subscribed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.balanceforecastingapp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BalanceForecastingApp.com<\/a>, which is a much more user friendly way of tracking cash flow and forecasting when and what you will have available to push to your savings or investments. I am a power spreadsheet user but the app is great because it has a calendar view which is much friendlier than using a spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<p>I have put $396 towards investments through tight cash flow tracking and I can see using one of the graphs how my &#8220;operating&#8221; (aka chequing) account is going UP each month, meaning I will have my cash flow under control and will have more money I can invest in the future, and when. &#8211; Brian V. from Canada<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My son and I went &#8220;dumpster diving&#8221; at my son&#8217;s condo! Found two Ethan Allen dark end tables and I am staining the tops white wash and paint the rest in expresso color flat paint. All hardware which is antique bronze is going to be spray painted nickel. I got the paint on the reduced mismatched shelf at Menards for $1.00. I have no doubt saved at least $100. on each new end table, perhaps more! &#8211; Deb<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I have a sheet on the fridge that has my budget for credit cards for that month. Every purchase I subtract and when it hits zero I\u2019m done for the month! We use cards for gas and groceries, so there is an incentive to not splurge or that last week we\u2019ll be pretty hungry! &#8211; Paul<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Everything I put my money into is an investment. Including every food item I&#8217;ve ever eaten, every piece of mountaineering equipment I own, every dollar I&#8217;ve placed in a savings account, and every share of stock I own.<\/p>\n<p>I got this perspective from the company I work for&#8230; The culture is built around a supreme belief in the <em>individual<\/em>. This philosophy extends even to taking a customer out to a meal. We are expected to treat every business purchase as an investment in the company.<\/p>\n<p>Does the company really need you to order a filet mignon and a $300 bottle of wine for dinner? Or would a ribeye and a $50 bottle do the trick ;) What more would I get for that extra investment? That&#8217;s the question we are expected to ask ourselves any time we are spending the company&#8217;s money.<\/p>\n<p>I have since applied that philosophy to everything I spend my own money on. &#8211; Justin C<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The best financial tip I use is excessive spreadsheeting. That way because the spreadsheet takes up so much of my time, I don\u2019t have time to go out and spend! &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/fintranslator.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yaacov<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2>Favorite Lifestyle Tips:<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>A great hack I&#8217;ve done in my life lately &#8211; Pomodoro Timer!

I know I have a break coming and try to break my goals up into 25 or 35-minute chunks. It helps keep me focused instead of trying to give my brain a rest by distracting means, leading to unproductivity. Definitely try it in your life! &#8211; Megan<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019ve signed up for <a href=\"http:\/\/theskimm.com\/?r=0d851df4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TheSkimm<\/a> which gives me a quick summary of news from around the world and what the talking points are.

Introverted, I challenged myself to meet a new person every week. I ended up meeting thousands of people &#8211; some of which I still keep in touch with now. This was an irregular way of meeting people who have completely helped me mold a path for myself, something I&#8217;ve never forgotten. &#8211; JF<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve started using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stayfocusd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StayFocusd app<\/a> to limit mindless website usage.

I want to deal with pieces of paper or emails or website links as fast as possible, to get them off of my to-do list, so I try to take care of it as soon as I touch it (or open a link). I got into a habit of picking things up once, putting it down, leaving 10 website tabs open on my computer, and it can quickly get overwhelming. So now when I get a piece of paper in my hands, or an email in my inbox I go think to myself \u201cwhat can I do to take care of this issue so I never have to touch this piece of paper again\u201d. Work has become much less stressful since I began implementing this policy. &#8211; Hannah<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019d have to say the most beneficial hack for me lately has been logging my eating habits via the app <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loseit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lose It<\/a>! I\u2019ve struggled with my eating habits for years and have finally found a way to hold myself accountable, learn how many calories I\u2019m consuming daily, and all in a relatively simple app (there\u2019s a bar code scanner, so it\u2019s really easy!). &#8211; Nick S.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>One &#8216;hack&#8217; for me to get up early &#8212; not only do I set an alarm, but I&#8217;ve also worked out arrangements with my helpful sister to give me a wakeup call every morning! She lives in a time zone ahead of me, so she&#8217;s up long before I would be up. She gives me a call at 6am my time (7am her time), and we try to chat for about twenty minutes first thing in the morning. This not only forces me to wake up and think right away &#8212; at least enough to have a reasonable sounding conversation &#8212; but it gives me some sisterly bonding time too! &#8211; Rachael<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I took a class in my community about Compassionate Listening. I went in thinking I would be on top of this skill from the beginning. wrong! I learned I stop listening not to jump in and make a point , but to be helpful and solve the problem efficiently. I learned I tended to sympathize by going into my own similar story, which shuts down listening. Take this class to understand family members and they will feel listened to. Neighbors and coworkers who are across the political spectrum will feel respected and listened to. I am creating Peace, amazing in these divisive times of nasty national discourse. &#8211; Mary<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2>The Best Career Hacks:<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>I started doing a micro-task managing approach where if something takes less than two minutes, I do it immediately instead of adding it to my list to do it later.

It\u2019s not the exact same outfit everyday, so a more accurate term may be to call it a <em>capsule<\/em> wardrobe. Pretty much all of it is made with fabrics that are wash and go, cutting down both on the cost and time it takes to bring clothes to and from the dry cleaners. I have a few shirts, skirts, pants, shoes, and appropriate accessories that are all in the same color family and easily mix and match with each other. I cut down on the time I take deciding on what to wear to work, giving me more brain space to do my job well and work on my personal productivity :) &#8211; Elora<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Want to know the one career hack I\u2019ve made JUST last month that has given me so much joy?<\/p>\n<p>I said \u201cNo.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I had taken on way too much and started to unravel and realized I was still effing broke and no further ahead than the previous year.<\/p>\n<p>Saying No has allowed me to put myself first, not give a damn how the next person feels about it and have more time for meditation, journaling and self-love.

I figured the marginal costs were less than the benefits (of free living), so I bought a cheap van, fitted it with solar panels and all sorts of stuff (even a bed and sink), but in the end it was just required too much mechanical work that I did not see initially.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, it cost me probably over 3k (not horrible) but I sold the van to cut losses and still have the panels as an asset, so it&#8217;s not as bad. I&#8217;m 19, so thankfully I took the risk early and I can remake it all back. &#8211; Joseph P<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The worst &#8216;investment&#8217; I ever made are the things that I am so convinced I will use and then have never done a thing with. Like the public speaking course I spent over $400 on, or the Circut machine that I thought I had to have for over $300, or even the paper shredder I bought for almost $200. (At least the paper shredder I have used, albeit reluctantly. :P)<\/p>\n<p>I think any time I put a lot of money down on something that I hope will change me, I&#8217;d better be careful. More self-improvement gadgets is no different than having a lot of kitchen gadgets and thinking I will be a world class chef, or having a lot of electronic technology will make me a computer programmer. Things on their own aren&#8217;t going to change me. I need to change first, and over time as that&#8217;s happening, I can re-evaluate if I &#8216;need&#8217; anything else. (And in the process, not only will I be a different person, but hopefully save some money too! ;)) &#8211; Rachael<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When I was 19 I knew everything, just like every other teenager, right?<\/p>\n<p>There was this girl, we\u2019ll call her J. A girl who my parents did not like and surely didn\u2019t approve of. But I knew everything and I was in love. After about six months of dating I needed some cash so I gave J my ATM card and PIN. Well, she came right back with cash. I called the bank (in secret of course) to check my balance to make sure I could trust her. It was all good. Or so I thought\u2026<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks later J and my mother in law (yes, I would soon marry J) emptied my checking account. $3,000 is a lot to lose when you\u2019re only 19 years old. I was furious!! I forgave her of course because mother in law \u201creally needed the money\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>We got married after dismissing the warnings from ALL my family and friends. I could go on and on about how many times my heart and bank account would be broken over the 3 years of marriage. My worst financial mistake? Not listening to my parents. Being so love struck you lose your mind and give away personal information.<\/p>\n<p>The story ends well though (for me anyway). I\u2019m re-married to wonderful gal and have a daughter. The daughter is now 19 and thinks she knows everything now too. Full circle. &#8211; Steve S<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other popular fails were<\/strong>: loaning out money to family, not investing earlier, buying new cars, getting into debt, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/stop-house-shaming\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buying homes when not ready<\/a> (!!!), buying whole life insurance, investing in &#8220;hot&#8221; stocks, bad marriages and divorces, launching\/investing in businesses that you don&#8217;t know anything about, lifestyle inflation, trying out MLMs, investing in bitcoin, pulling out money from your 401k!, picking up timeshares, taking out too much student loans, and buying boats and horses &#8211; not at the same time ;)<\/p>\n<p>So there you have it!
