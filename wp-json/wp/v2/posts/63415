The financial independence FIRE movement has a bunch of these haters. And while some concerns about early retirement might be legitimate, the most common objections I usually hear are myths (or personal limiting beliefs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHaters gonna hate. Potatoes gonna potate!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s my opinion that \u201chate\u201d really just comes from a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lack of understanding<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So my hope in this post is to explain a bit more about each of these common FIRE movement myths and expand on the reasons why I believe they\u2019re mostly untrue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Myth #1: The FIRE movement is only for young folks.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can see why people think this. From the outside, it appears that FIRE walkers are a bunch of kids in their 20s and 30s. But, the deeper you dig and more entrenched you become with the community, the more you connect with people in their 40s, 50s, 60s and older. <\/span><b>We\u2019re all prioritizing financial independence by learning, sharing, and helping each other &#8212; no matter our ages.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons I think this myth exists is because younger folks have a louder voice. Whether it\u2019s new blogs, posts on social media or getting featured by news outlets, it\u2019s usually the younger \u201csuccess stories\u201d that are published and shared the most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, since <\/span><b>time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> plays a big role in building wealth, some people believe financial independence can only be achieved by those who have decades of time up their sleeve. This simply isn\u2019t true. While a young person might have a bigger time benefit, it\u2019s not the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> factor involved in building wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We published a great article a few months back from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/think-youre-too-old-for-fire-think-again\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Late Starter FIRE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, written by an Aussie gal who discovered the FIRE movement when she was 47. Since then she\u2019s encouraging more people in older age groups to join the community. Check out her <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.latestarterfire.com\/late-starter-to-fi-series\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Late Starter Interview Series<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with 25+ similar stories about people discovering FIRE movement \u201clate\u201d in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Myth #2: The whole point of FIRE is to stop working as early as possible.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEarly retirement\u201d is just one single M&amp;M within a massive bowl of delicious candies. (Excuse the weird reference, I\u2019m staring at a pile of leftover Halloween treats on my desk!)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I\u2019m trying to say is that quitting your day job is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only 1 of 100 <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits of getting your financial life in order. Retiring early might be the initial reason some folks are attracted to FIRE, but it\u2019s not the main reason they\u2019re sticking around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, most FIRE followers who are in a position to retire early are choosing not to! Somewhere along their journey they\u2019ve found work or careers that they truly enjoy. They\u2019ve found activities they are passionate about and work that adds value to their life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Retirement is not the sole purpose<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (In fact, it\u2019s not really even a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purpose<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at all).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, the FIRE movement is all about figuring out what the heck you want to do with the rest of your life. I want to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/slow-down-fire-is-not-a-race\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow that process down<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not speed it up.\u00a0 Many other FIRE folks are jumping on the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/coast-financial-independence-building-wealth-even-if-youre-not-saving-any-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coast FI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> train&#8230; Learning to identify work they want to do less of, and replacing that with stuff they want to do more of.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**You\u2019ve probably already noticed a lot of people dropping the \u201cRE\u201d from the FIRE acronym&#8230; Shortening it to \u201cFI\u201d shows they care less about the \u201cretire early\u201d bit and more about the financial independence or financial freedom side.**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Myth #3: You probably need $5 to $10 million to retire comfortably<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you ask the average person on the street <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHow much money do you think you need to retire?\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they\u2019ll likely ballpark an extremely high dollar figure. It\u2019s mostly based on feelings, not mathematical retirement planning. Actually, even some personal finance gurus <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/suze-orman-says-you-need-5-million-to-retire-thats-nonsense-2019-01-15\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ballpark that $5-6 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the amount of investable assets everyone needs to retire comfortably. I think it\u2019s crazy!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most popular method the FIRE community uses to calculate how much one needs to retire (also known as your \u201cFIRE number\u201d) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/retirement\/strategies\/withdrawal\/4-percent-rule\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the 4% rule<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And since most of you already know what this is, I\u2019ll save blabbing on explaining it in this post!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, what\u2019s important is that the 4% rule <\/span><b>uses your annual expenses to determine the size of your retirement nest egg<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230; And since everyone\u2019s annual expense is different, everyone\u2019s retirement number is different. Check out the chart below with figures based on the 4% rule and desired retirement income\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63470 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Screen_Shot_2020_11_04_at_1_15_14_PM_png_qF6PTAuv.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"431\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Screen_Shot_2020_11_04_at_1_15_14_PM_png_qF6PTAuv.png 431w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Screen_Shot_2020_11_04_at_1_15_14_PM_png_qF6PTAuv-300x192.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people will need a bigger nest egg because they plan to spend a lot. Others need less because they can live on less. In my opinion, the average early retiree doesn\u2019t need anywhere near $5 mil invested to retire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What shits me to tears about this FIRE myth is that spreading a one-size-fits-all \u201cmagic number\u201d for retirement can be harmful for people just starting their financial journey. Most people can\u2019t fathom a $5 million retirement fund, and unreachable numbers can kill the motivation to start saving or investing in the first place. I\u2019m not suggesting people should aim for low numbers; I\u2019m suggesting that people learn the realistic numbers that suit their individual scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Myth #4: You gotta have a mega high salary to become financially independent, or retire early.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Income is only part of the FIRE equation. Here are 3 main areas that make the most impact in building retirement savings (listed in order of importance):<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reduce expenses. <\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA dollar saved is worth more than a dollar earned\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Learn to invest intelligently.<\/b> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not how much you make, it\u2019s how much you keep.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Grow your income.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And be careful of lifestyle inflation :)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a young person with a ridiculously high salary certainly has potential to build wealth quicker, or retire earlier, high income is not a necessity for FIRE. <\/span><b>Just focusing on the first 2 points <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">above is more than enough to drastically turn someone\u2019s finances around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out this awesome FIRE blogger, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/educatorfi.com\/about\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EducatorFI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who is living proof that low income earners can slash debt and build wealth quickly, by focusing on making smart financial decisions. Also, check out the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/educatorfi.com\/educators-on-fior\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview series with 30+ other educators<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who share how they are improving their finances, while doing work that matters!\u00a0 (I have a soft spot for teachers &#8211; my wife is one!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, remember growing income doesn\u2019t always mean getting huge pay raises at work. Picking up a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">side hustle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a fun way to make a bit of extra money!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Myth #5: FIRE is for tight-asses who practice extreme frugality<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I gotta laugh at this one. Personally, I have no issue with extreme frugality, but I can see why it rubs some people the wrong way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will always be enthusiasts who take money recommendations to the extreme.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you tell a group of people to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201ctry lowering your expenses,\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> most people will cut out a few spending luxuries and be done. But, there will be a few creative thinkers within the group who will take the task as a personal challenge. They will try everything they can to reduce their expenses all the way to zero, even if it kills them. For them challenges like this are fun!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these extremists make up a small number within the FIRE community. The majority of folks recognize that every rule about money is more like a guideline&#8230; They follow along until they experience diminishing returns, or when it impacts their happiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FIRE movement definitely promotes reduced spending and a frugal lifestyle. But really most people only cut back on the things that don\u2019t provide long term joy. Spending less on crap allows for more spending on things that provide value.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Myth #6: The FIRE movement is just a fad. People will lose interest when the stock market crashes.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people believe that when the next big stock market crash comes, the FIRE community will dissipate. Losing a butt-ton of money in a short period of time will test everyone\u2019s faith, and shatter everything we\u2019ve been working towards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, this misconception was already proven wrong earlier this year. When the covid 19 pandemic hit and the stock market tanked, most investors lost over 30% of portfolio value within a couple weeks! But, everyone in the FIRE space stayed the course and stuck with the plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the FIRE movement actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gained<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a ton of traction and followers during the last market dip. It\u2019s in dire situations like this pandemic where people actually wish they had learned more about FIRE earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, the FIRE movement will always exist. I can\u2019t imagine a world where people don\u2019t ever want to improve their financial lives and consistently work towards being happier and more free in life!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, there you have it! What do you hear about FIRE or reasons people think it\u2019s no good?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy Monday!
