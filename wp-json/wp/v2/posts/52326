Chime &#8211; a simple online bank w\/ built-in app features!<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/chime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52332\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/chime-bank.jpg\" alt=\"chime bank\" width=\"602\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/chime-bank.jpg 704w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/chime-bank-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/a><strong>This is one of the first banks I&#8217;d check out if I wasn&#8217;t such a fanboy of USAA.<\/strong> Similar to <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/simple-bank-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Bank<\/a> who we&#8217;ve featured here before,\u00a0 Chime gets how ridiculous Big Banks treat their customers and wants to make the banking process as easy and helpful as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Without fees, without hidden costs, and definitely without headache.<\/p>\n<p>What separates them from the other online banks though is their understanding of how much we LOVE our apps and features coming out left and right. Their vision is to have everything in one centrally located and connected place where you don&#8217;t need a bank plus 15 other apps to log into to get $hit done. You just have one &#8211; Chime (in their perfect world :)) &#8211; and you&#8217;re good.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re still a ways away from this, but they&#8217;ve already rolled out some of the more popular savings tricks from apps which is currently available to anyone with a Chime account. Here&#8217;s a list of some of their features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Save When You Spend<\/strong> &#8211; Similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/acorns-app-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Acorns<\/a> and other &#8220;round up&#8221; applications, Chime will help you save more by rounding up all your transactions to the nearest dollar every time you buy something. They&#8217;ll then automatically transfer the difference right into savings for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Save When You Get Paid<\/strong> &#8211; You know how everyone tells you to &#8220;pay yourself first?&#8221; Well, this does exactly that. Activate this feature once, and then chime will automatically transfer 10% of every paycheck in the future right into your savings account before you even have a chance to spend it. Nice and simple (and smart).<\/li>\n<li><b>Early Direct Deposit<\/b> &#8211; This one I&#8217;ve never heard of before (?), but basically if you&#8217;re a member of Chime and your employer directly deposits your paychecks every payroll, you can sometimes see your money show up in your Chime account <em>up to two days faster<\/em> than normal. Again, never seen this before as I&#8217;ve been out of the 9-5 world for a while, but sounds kinda cool?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pay Friends<\/strong> &#8211; Lastly, Chime makes it super easy to xfer money between friends with a click of some buttons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can find more info about Chime here: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/chime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChimeBank.com<\/a> (FREE \/ BudgetsAreSexy readers get $5.00 bonus at sign up)<\/p>\n<p>(They also have a pretty cool sister site where people can see how much they&#8217;re *really* spending in nonsense fees from the Big Banks out there: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankfeefinder.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BankFeeFinder.com<\/a>. Even if you&#8217;re not in the market for a new bank, I highly encourage you to run their analyzation anyways so you can see exactly what&#8217;s going on with your current bank! Some of them are good at hiding stuff! (I&#8217;m looking at you, Bank of America))<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Trim &#8211; a personal financial assistant that saves money for you<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/trim\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52450\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/trim-app.jpg\" alt=\"trim app\" width=\"630\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/trim-app.jpg 630w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/trim-app-300x123.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While not exactly an *app* (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/trim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trim<\/a> works through text messaging and Facebook Messenger), they act in pretty much the same way. And particularly, to better help you save money.<\/p>\n<p>They do this through four ways:<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. Trim Financial Manager<\/strong> &#8211; Hook up your bank accounts <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/trim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">once<\/a>, and then Trim will analyze your transaction history and allow you to do a number of pretty slick things right there directly through them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancel any unwanted subscriptions (and let you know what subscriptions you even have!)<\/li>\n<li>Set spending alerts<\/li>\n<li>Get balances<\/li>\n<li>Find out how much you spent on Netflix\/etc last month<\/li>\n<li>And even fight fees automatically with your bank<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>#2. Trim Savings<\/strong> &#8211; Connect your Visa card to them through FB Messenger (must be a Visa, and must go through FB Messenger), and then get the following free perks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coupons that automatically get applied to your card<\/li>\n<li>$1.00 on any grocery purchase greater than $5.00 (you\u2019ll get 10 of these)<\/li>\n<li>$1.00 on any dining purchase greater than $5.00 (you\u2019ll get 10 of these too)<\/li>\n<li>$10.00 on any movie purchase greater than $20.00 (you&#8217;ll only get 1 of these)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In total you can nab $40.00 of cash back, again &#8211; only through your Visa card.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. Trim Bill Negotiator<\/strong> &#8211; Sign up through either FB Messenger or text message, then connect your Comcast bill (<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>update:<\/strong> <\/span>and now any other cable\/internet bill as Trim works with them all now!) and credit card you use to pay it with, and Trim will start negotiating it down on your behalf. If they succeed in saving you money, they take 25% of the savings for the<em> first<\/em> month only, and then you get to keep all the rest, and if they fail they don&#8217;t charge a thing. They say the average savings is about $30.00 <em>every month<\/em> &#8211; PRETTY COOL!!!<\/p>\n<p>(<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Another update:<\/strong><\/span> For Comcast users, Trim will now monitor your area on an ongoing basis for outages, and if they catch any they&#8217;ll automatically try and get you a credit!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. Amazon Price Patrol<\/strong> &#8211; Lastly, Trim will monitor your Amazon transactions if you want them to, and then anytime they find a discrepancy in the price you paid vs the current price of an item, they&#8217;ll automatically go out and get you a refund for the difference. It&#8217;s very similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/paribus-review-get-money-back-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paribus<\/a> if you remember our review of them the other year, but it&#8217;s also still in beta mode so may be a little wonky until they get it all streamlined. Still, another cool task to give to robots while we&#8217;re out enjoying our lives ;)<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about all these features here: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/trim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AskTrim.com<\/a> (FREE, except for the Comcast commission part)<\/p>\n<h2>#4.

They\u2019ll then manage it all for you, help you grow it, and offer advice along the way.\u00a0 So pretty much a \u201crobo-advisor\u201d, just without any minimum balance requirements and set up to be as simple as possible. (Available in Canada too!)<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/awesome-savings-account-for-emergency-funds\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brightpeak financial<\/a><\/strong> (FREE) &#8212; A division of Thrivent Federal Credit Union that rewards you for saving money into their &#8220;emergency savings account&#8221; (such a perfect name for an account, right?)

Hook up your accounts with them once, and then Clarity will analyze all the data and make suggestions on how to better optimize and save your money. But rather than just telling or showing you what to do, you actually have the ability to *take action* there directly in the app \u2013 the major difference between them and most other fintech apps.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/self-lender-review-build-credit-through-saving\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Self Lender<\/a><\/strong> &#8212; An alternative way to build credit back by <em>saving<\/em>. Their &#8220;credit builder account&#8221; offers a CD (certificate of deposit) that you *pay into* every month until the term is up, all the while recording your good payment history. It&#8217;s not free, but it could be a good option for anyone struggling hard w\/ their credit right now.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/qoins-app-pays-off-debt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Qoins<\/strong><\/a> (FREE) &#8212; Similar to Acorns, this app rounds up all your daily transactions to the nearest dollar, and then applies the difference straight to your <em>debts<\/em>. I don&#8217;t know why this is the first app that&#8217;s offered this over the years (??), but of course I&#8217;m loving it! Anything that gets you to take action is good, even if it&#8217;s just a handful of dollars each month!<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/tip-yourself\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Tip Yourself<\/strong><\/a> (FREE) &#8212; An app that allows you to transfer small dollar amounts from your checking account to a<em> Tip Jar<\/em> so you can reward yourself anytime, anywhere, whether it\u2019s just $1.00 or a larger amount for something special! Been following these guys for over a year now and REALLY like what they&#8217;re doing. So easy and uncomplicated!<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/go\/debitize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Debitize<\/strong><\/a> (FREE) &#8212; If you\u2019ve ever wanted to mix the benefits of both credit cards and debit cards (credit cards for the rewards, and debit so the bill doesn&#8217;t rack up!), this is the tool for you. Debitize monitors your credit cards for new activity, and then automatically initiates a transfer out of your checking account into your Debitize account whenever you make a charge. When your credit card bill comes due, Debitize pays it for you \u2013 automatically and on time \u2013 with the funds from your Debitize account. So you still go about your business using credit cards as normal, but now without the fear of not having the $$$ in your account to pay for it at the end of the month.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/save-money-using-honey-browser-extension\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Honey<\/strong><\/a> (FREE) &#8212; One of the easiest ways to save while shopping online. Download the browser extension once, and then at check out click the Honey button and it&#8217;ll automatically scour the internet for coupons, and apply each one of them to your cart until it finds the one with the most savings. Sometimes it&#8217;s $1.00, and others $10.00 (depending on what you&#8217;re buying), and in all cases it literally only takes like 15 seconds.

Attach your bank accounts with them one, and then have their digital robots analyze your income\/expenses and automatically transfer out a few dollars here and there that they know you won&#8217;t miss. They&#8217;re one of the pioneers in this automated savings game, and I believe in their vision so much that I actually joined their board of advisors!
