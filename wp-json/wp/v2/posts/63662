Our credit card was refunded ~$2,500 which is why we didn\u2019t have to pay it this month and we carry a positive balance!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Abnormal expenses:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> None.

(We tried to refuse &#8212; we don\u2019t drink energy drinks &#8212; but he insisted). My wife and I ended up with 1 of the cases, so I sold it for $20. &#x1f923;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63705 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Redbull_and_surf_board_jpeg_nzfm7s7j.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"504\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Redbull_and_surf_board_jpeg_nzfm7s7j.jpg 504w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Redbull_and_surf_board_jpeg_nzfm7s7j-300x172.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, I found a beaten up surfboard for free on Craigslist.
