When it finally came back up, I had over 30,000 page visits and it was still before noon. On that day, we weren&#8217;t so anonymous anymore.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/couple-saved-1-million-retire-135650907.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53412\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/fame.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/fame.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/fame-300x209.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We then started getting texts from friends and relatives:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hey, you&#8217;re on Yahoo!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>You have a million dollars? What???? Huh??<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To my surprise, it turned out to be a much less painless experience than I had assumed. No one asked us for money. No one treated us any differently. I <em>was<\/em> hoping that <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/couple-saved-1-million-retire-135650907.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the article<\/a> would trigger some interesting conversations about money, but that didn&#8217;t happen either.<\/p>\n<p>Life moved on. Except for one person who <em>did<\/em> want to talk money.<\/p>\n<h2>Aunt K Loves Her Job!<\/h2>\n<p>One family member was excited to learn about our secret lives. The first conversation took place last year when we had the big publicity. It went something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aunt K<\/strong>: That&#8217;s so awesome that you&#8217;re planning to retire! Congrats!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Me<\/strong>: Thanks! How about you? At what age do you see yourself retiring?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Aunt K<\/strong>: Not any time soon. I absolutely love my job. I&#8217;d do it for free! I&#8217;d like to retire, but probably not until 65.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Me<\/strong>: That&#8217;s wonderful! If you&#8217;re doing what you love and you happened to get paid for it, that&#8217;s hardly working.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Aunt K<\/strong>: I know! It&#8217;s amazing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, Aunt K&#8217;s bliss was not to last. A couple months ago, we saw her again and she was singing a different tune. While Aunt K loves her core job, there are other problems. She works in a school district that has issues with administration. The state that she teaches in is also mismanaging the teachers&#8217; retirement fund, so she&#8217;s worried that all of the money she&#8217;s saving may be blown by politicians.<\/p>\n<p>I feel bad for Aunt K. She loves teaching, but the circumstances around it have changed. Just last year, saving money wasn&#8217;t a priority and she dismissed the idea of financial independence. Now, she worries that she&#8217;ll never be able to stop working when she&#8217;s finally ready to.<\/p>\n<h2>Excuses, Excuses, Excuses<\/h2>\n<p>I hear folks making excuses for not saving<strong> All<\/strong>. <strong>The<\/strong>. <strong>Time<\/strong>. Here are some of my favorites.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;I love my job!&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Aunt K&#8217;s excuse is the most common one that I hear. If you love your job, that&#8217;s awesome! What an amazing gift in a world where many folks dread their 9-5! You&#8217;ve got something wonderful there.<\/p>\n<p>However, will your job always love you? Plenty of folks who worked at Enron loved their jobs too. There are always other factors at play. <a href=\"https:\/\/willrobotstakemyjob.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Robots and artificial intelligence<\/a> are going to start taking more and more jobs. This will be a major societal change that you don&#8217;t want to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_ca\/article\/8qgpbp\/what-well-do-when-robots-take-our-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on the wrong side of it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to die young.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is the favorite excuse of a good friend. He insists that he will die before he&#8217;d ever retire, so he doesn&#8217;t save. I&#8217;m not sure why; both of his parents are in their 90s and he has no serious health problems.<\/p>\n<p>And why would you want to bet on an early death anyway? What&#8217;s the backup plan if you don&#8217;t die?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;The money won&#8217;t be there for me anyway, so why bother?&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Bad things happen to good folks. Maybe you know someone who retired in 2008 right before the Great Recession clobbered us all. Maybe a family member got taken by a Bernie Madoff character. This stuff happens, but not to most. Put your money away and stop worrying.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;I could never do that.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A friend recently lamented her financial position:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We have nothing saved!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I replied with:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Get rid of the new SUV.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Rent your mother-in-law apartment on Airbnb.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Take local vacations instead of exotic ones.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Every single suggestion was met with the same response:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I could never do that.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Well, I hope you plan on working until a ripe old age because you know that whole retirement thing? <em>You&#8217;re never going to be able to do that.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Money doesn&#8217;t matter. Until it does.<\/h2>\n<p>My mantra in life is this:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2012\/10\/03\/the-practical-benefits-of-outrageous-optimism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optimism is the only way to go through life<\/a>. And a little preparation can make you a better optimist. Because I&#8217;ve taken care of myself financially, I&#8217;m prepared to deflect the curve balls that life throws at me. Money doesn&#8217;t matter most of the time. But when it does, and you don&#8217;t have it, it&#8217;s going to hurt.<\/p>\n<p>To the folks who make excuses for not saving money, I say this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Financial independence isn&#8217;t about quitting your job. It&#8217;s about options. If you love your job, stay there. It&#8217;s much better to work because you want to than because you have to!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And also:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>You get nowhere <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hedonic_treadmill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">running on the hedonic treadmill<\/a>. Stuff doesn&#8217;t bring long term happiness. Spending time with loved ones and meaningful activity does. A frugal, simple life is the most efficient and rewarding way to live.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>If there is anything true about life, it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s an ever changing, unpredictable journey.<\/strong> If you would told me 5 years ago that I&#8217;d no longer be programming computers or <a href=\"http:\/\/1500days.com\/free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have a job<\/a>, I would have thought you were crazy. But, the serendipitous turns of life are what makes it fun and interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Just save some money so you can embrace the fun opportunities when they present themselves. Save enough so you <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/paradox-of-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">never have to worry<\/a>.
