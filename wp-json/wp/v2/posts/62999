Most of them happened within 90 days of quitting my job. But even now, after a two-year sabbatical, I\u2019m still discovering new things about my relationship with \u201cwork.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s rewind a bit \u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Thinking about taking a sabbatical from work<\/h2>\n<p>It was early 2018 and I was feeling run down, unappreciated, and a little lost. The company I worked for always wanted more from its employees, and no matter how hard I worked, I never felt like I was doing good enough.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m certainly appreciative for the opportunity and time I spent working there (I appreciate every job I\u2019ve had, no matter how <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/crappy-jobs-on-my-path-to-fire\/\">crappy or difficult<\/a> it was). I just wasn\u2019t stoked about the path I was on, and more importantly, <b>I wasn\u2019t proud of the person I was slowly turning into.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I worried that if I quickly changed jobs or joined a new company, I could find myself in the exact same situation again a couple years down the road. I didn\u2019t have a workplace problem, I had a ME problem! So I set my sights on taking a sabbatical. A full reset. A career break. I wanted to discover what my life would be like if I completely removed \u201cwork\u201d from the equation.<\/p>\n<h2>Planning a year off of work<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s a gutsy move to leave your job without another one lined up. No matter how much planning I did, there was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, <i>\u201cI wonder if I\u2019m going to regret this later.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Before handing in my resignation, I considered these three things:<\/p>\n<h2>Can I afford a sabattical?<\/h2>\n<p>How much will taking an unpaid sabbatical set me back in my journey to FI?\u00a0 I ran several nerdy cost models and calculations. But it\u2019s a tough question to answer, because a lot can happen in an extended period like a year or more! Ultimately, I decided that no matter what the financial cost was, it was going to be an investment in myself.<\/p>\n<p><i>*I later wrote an article on this topic, \u201c<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/1-year-off-work\/\">How much does it cost to take a year off work<\/a><i>,\u201d that explains the methods of trying to calculate a sabbatical year and why it doesn\u2019t really matter in the end.<br \/>\n<\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Who will hire me after 12 months off?<\/h2>\n<p>Am I committing career suicide? Before I quit, I asked old bosses, mentors, professional recruiters, etc. and got a wide variety of responses. Everything from, \u201cNo way, I would never hire an employee who just took a year off\u201d\u00a0 to \u201cYou will always be able to find work, Joel. I wish I did that when I was your age!\u201d.<b><\/b><\/p>\n<p>IMO there\u2019s no perfect advice to give someone thinking about taking sabbatical leave. All I\u2019ll offer on this subject is this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you want to get back to work, be prepared for a longer-than-usual job search NOT just because you will be overlooked quicker than other candidates, but because <strong>you\u2019ll have changed so much as a person<\/strong> and will be pickier about any new job you want to take.<\/li>\n<li>The most important question you\u2019ll get asked from a prospective new employer is: How did you fill your time during your extended leave? Make sure you\u2019ll have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freesumes.com\/the-best-way-to-explain-your-sabbatical-to-a-new-employer\/\">a worthy answer<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What am I going to do with my time away from work?<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m a list maker, so I compiled a huge list of things I wanted to do and try during my year off. These were passion projects, trips, and even just simple little things that I hadn\u2019t gotten around to because I felt like work was always in the way.<\/p>\n<h2>The first 90 days of my sabattical<\/h2>\n<p>It was a weird experience going from a full schedule every day to nothing planned during an extended break. Instead of the world telling me how to live and what to do every day, I got to decide when, where, and how I did things. All this freedom got me reflecting on the way I made everyday decisions, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When setting my alarm at night, \u201cWhat time do I *feel like* getting up tomorrow?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Before going to the store to get groceries, \u201cDo I even like this store?\u201d and \u201cI wonder what else is around here?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Before doing something that was on my personal goal list: \u201cDo I really want to be doing this?\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Questioning everything led to a lot of self discovery and several epiphanies \u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Epiphany 1: My to-do list was written by the old Joel.<\/h2>\n<p>How I <i>thought<\/i> I\u2019d be spending my time and what I <i>actually<\/i> ended up doing was very different.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I thought I\u2019d be traveling and exploring a lot \u2026 Turns out I enjoy my own backyard more.<\/li>\n<li>I envisioned myself picking up old hobbies \u2026 Turns out that I\u2019d dropped them for good reasons.<\/li>\n<li>Thought I\u2019d get bored at home doing nothing \u2026 But unemployed life is just as busy as regular life. It\u2019s just filled with different things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Epiphany 2: \u201cFinding yourself\u201d isn\u2019t productive. Instead, build your future self.<\/h2>\n<p>I felt a little lost when I left work. So naturally, I thought I needed to \u201cfind myself\u201d again. You know, re-discover my inner purpose, whatever that means. I was trying to answer questions like <i>\u201cWho am I?\u201d<\/i> and <i>\u201cWhat is my purpose in life?\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p>But then I realized that discovering who I *was* might make me feel better about my past, but it wouldn\u2019t help solve much for the future. Constantly looking backward meant I wasn\u2019t looking forward.<\/p>\n<p>So, I started focusing on who I wanted to be in the future and building ways to become <i>that<\/i> person. I\u2019ve been more productive since thinking this way.<\/p>\n<h2>Epiphany 3: It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about everyone else.<\/h2>\n<p>I was raised to always tithe and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-include-charity-in-your-budget-and-other-ways-to-give\/\">give money to charities<\/a>. But up until a couple of years ago, I had never donated my <i>time<\/i>. Since I had an abundance of time, and no income, I tried switching things up to do <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsurance.com\/volunteer-work-benefits-employers,-employees-as-well-as-the-community\/\">volunteering<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Helping others is one of the most fulfilling things in life. I\u2019ve worked out that the more I focus on others, the happier I am.<\/p>\n<h2>Epiphany 4: Respect for other people\u2019s lifestyle is crucial.<\/h2>\n<p>Just because I was feeling stuck and needed a break from work, it doesn\u2019t mean that everybody else feels the same way.<\/p>\n<p>Some people really enjoy their career (I envy them). Most people can\u2019t afford to take a sabbatical. It\u2019s unfair for me to encourage others to quit their jobs and take time off work like I did. Instead, I need to respect everyone\u2019s individual situation.<\/p>\n<h2>Epiphany 5: Going \u201cback\u201d to work doesn\u2019t mean going backward.<\/h2>\n<p>At first I assumed that after my break, I\u2019d go right back to the same job in sales that I left. Even if I started in a lower position than I held before, I would approach it with a fresh perspective, new attitude, and work my way up again.<\/p>\n<p>But time away made me rethink my priorities in life. It got me discovering and developing new skills I never thought I\u2019d have. I stumbled across opportunities I never thought were available to me. That\u2019s how I\u2019m blogging here right now (talk about a career change)!<\/p>\n<h2>Epiphany 6:\u00a0 Coast FI, here we go!<\/h2>\n<p>Basically, my wife and I realized that there\u2019s no point in racing to achieve FIRE if it makes us miserable along the way.\u00a0We will cross the finish line in due course, whether we hit FI in 5 years, 10 years, or even 20 \u2026 we\u2019re not in a rush to retirement anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Joy is our north star, not money.<\/p>\n<p>*Here&#8217;s the backstory on how and why we decided to pursue <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/slow-down-fire-is-not-a-race\/\">Coast FIRE<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Epiphany 7: Maybe I could have had all these epiphanies without even taking any time off work at all!<\/h2>\n<p>I can\u2019t go back in time and change the decision to quit my job. But, my theory is that 90% of the personal development that a sabbatical brings can be gained by simply:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing your mindset<\/li>\n<li>Changing your attitude toward \u201cwork\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Reassessing your priorities (spending more time on #1 and less on #10)<\/li>\n<li>Doing more of what makes you happy<\/li>\n<li>Slowing down and just enjoying life more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I could have done these <i>while working<\/i>. And, you probably can too. Something to think about before pulling the trigger on a sabbatical yourself!<\/p>\n<p>Welp, that\u2019s it for now. Would love to hear if you\u2019ve taken unpaid time off and\/or have come to similar conclusions about work life &#8230; and does anybody work at a place where they pay for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cornerstoneondemand.com\/rework\/7-reasons-employee-sabbaticals-are-winning-idea\">employee sabbaticals<\/a>? If you do and you haven&#8217;t taken one, why not? If you <em>have<\/em> taken paid leave, what&#8217;d you do?<\/p>\n<p>Cheers! And have a wicked week ahead!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Joel<\/p>\n<p><i>*Photo up top by <\/i>Simon Migaj<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since taking time off of work, I\u2019ve had a ton of epiphanies.
