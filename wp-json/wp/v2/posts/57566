There is one checking account for the rental property to keep everything separate. All the bills and condo mortgage go through that account. There are two business accounts \u2014 checking and savings \u2014 for my consulting business. The savings can go away. There is a business credit card for all tax deductible expenses and we each have a personal credit card and a single joint credit card for household expenses. The investment accounts are all set by our financial guy but I will ask about consolidation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Excellent idea indeed to talk to their financial guy as 15 investment accounts sure seems a bit complicated!
