A 401(k) Champion leads by example. He or she is committed to act now to secure a retirement someday in the future.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Purpose of the 401(k) Champion Award:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To energize 401(k) participants to learn more about 401(k)s<\/li>\n<li>To identify and share the stories of 401(k) Champions<\/li>\n<li>To encourage a dialogue about 401(k) and retirement security<\/li>\n<li>To help employers share the benefits of 401(k)s, especially for youthful employees who may not realize how to maximize the benefits of long time horizons<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>And to help encourage that dialogue about 401(k) and retirement security more,<\/strong> I thought we&#8217;d share the essay Mrs. Nickels shot in (and won with!), who not only runs a fun finance site herself, but also took the dive into running LAUNDROMATS a few years ago for a pretty killer side business! We should probably have her do a side hustle post on it actually, now that I think about it! :)<\/p>\n<p>Take it away, Laura!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-62820 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/laura-dobbins.jpg\" alt=\"laura dobbins\" width=\"270\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/laura-dobbins.jpg 480w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/laura-dobbins-235x300.jpg 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;Why I Love my 401(k)&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p><strong>I remember the day clearly.<\/strong> It was the summer of 2002, and I was sitting in the company conference room beginning to lose focus. At the end of the table was the representative from the company 401(k) plan, and he was there to encourage the latest new hires to sign up. One of those new hires was me.<\/p>\n<p>The rep went into his well-rehearsed bullet points, mentioning the company would match 50 cents for every dollar we contributed, up to 6% of our salary, and the earlier we started contributing, the better. And that if we really wanted to get serious about investing in our future, we should enroll in what they called \u201cAuto-Acceleration\u201d; a program that automatically increased contributions by an additional 1% each year.<\/p>\n<p>I sat in that conference room playing a mental game of ping-pong back and forth in my mind. \u201cIs it worth it? Will anything come out of this? Am I going to miss that money not being in my paycheck? I\u2019m only 23, why should I worry about something so far in the distant future, like retirement?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I was a little uneasy about investing in this \u201cplan\u201d, this mysterious \u201c401(k)\u201d they spoke of. It sounded as foreign to me as French at the time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But even with my reservations, I did it.<\/strong> I opened my 401(k) account that day, and chose to put away 6% of my salary to take full advantage of the company match, just as the rep suggested. I even enrolled in Auto-Accelerate. Then I crossed my fingers, and waited. Anticipating the pain of that first paycheck where I\u2019d see 6% of my salary go to my 401(k) instead of my checking account.<\/p>\n<p>To my shock and complete surprise, I didn\u2019t feel the difference in my paycheck at all. My check only went down by $60. So I carried on, letting the contributions continue, and soon I even upped the contribution rate to 10%. Still didn\u2019t feel it much. Over time, as my salary continued to increase, and my Auto-Accelerate bumped my contribution rate by 1% each year, I eventually reached the yearly maximum contribution, and I just continued maxing it out each year after that.<\/p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m 41. I look back to that day in 2002, and wish I could give my 23-year-old self a high five. I wish I could tell the younger me that I had just made one of the best decisions of my life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That little account I was so unsure about starting 18 years ago, now has over $300,000 in it.<\/strong> And because I started slow and gradually increased my contributions over time, I never felt the pinch. Not once. And even if I stopped contributing right now, my 401(k) is on track to reach nearly $2 million by the time I reach retirement. At 59 \u00bd, I\u2019ll be able to access that money penalty-free, and enjoy the kind of retirement I see in my mind.<\/p>\n<p>I picture leisurely days at home reading and relaxing, splurging occasionally on good food and wine, spending time with friends and traveling to destinations near and far. Resting in the knowledge that money will not be a source of stress.<\/p>\n<p>But it pains me to think about what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t started my 401(k) that day. I\u2019ve imagined that too. What would that retirement look like?<\/p>\n<p>Well, not good. More than likely I\u2019d be working well into my 70s, living in a small apartment on a fixed income with no room to splurge on things I enjoy. No money to travel or dine out with friends and family.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That\u2019s not living my friend, that\u2019s existing. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I want that time of my life to be my best years, not my worst.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now imagine your future self. You\u2019re looking back in time, thankful and grateful that you contributed to your 401(k) so many years before, while time was on your side. The cake has been cut, the \u201cHappy Retirement\u201d banner is coming down and you\u2019re packing up your desk into a cardboard box, tingling with excitement for life\u2019s next chapter.<\/p>\n<p>And it will be everything you hoped for.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>For more on Laura and her love of finance:<\/strong> MyShinyNickels.com\u00a0\/\/ Laundromats101.com<\/p>\n<p><strong>For more on the 401(K) Champion\u00ae Awards:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/401kchampion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">401kchampion.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>PS: Investing in my 401(k) was one of the biggest moves I ever made for my finances too!
