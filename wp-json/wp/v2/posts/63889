As a result, many young Americans are being crushed by\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student loan debt<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is now over $1.7 trillion &#8212; America\u2019s largest form of debt other than home mortgages. While investing in yourself is usually wise, we must ask at what cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may have been led to believe that the only way to attend college is to take out big federal loans in your name. (Or to get your parents to take out loans themselves or be a cosigner on yours.) However, I\u2019m living proof of the contrary. Here\u2019s how I earned two degrees with no student debt:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Getting a Bachelor\u2019s Degree Without Taking Out Loans<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I had been working since turning 15, there was no college savings, nor were my parents in a financial position to assist me. Therefore, living at home, commuting to school, and continuing to work was my only option to afford a higher education degree.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I was an undergraduate student, I worked at a Chick-fil-A. With my parents graciously letting me live at home for free, most of my salary was used on school and transportation. After earning a $1,000 scholarship from Chick-fil-A, I quit to find work closer to campus. I landed a retail job at the mall across the street, joined the staff of the student newspaper, and worked in the school\u2019s athletic department.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Juggling Jobs and School (and Winning a Scholarship)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a junior, I was working three jobs and going to school full-time. Even with three jobs, money was not plentiful. After working with the athletic department for nearly three years, I received a full athletic scholarship for my final year of school. To my knowledge, I was the first non-athlete to receive an athletic scholarship. It completely covered my college tuition and books.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly six years had passed since I first stepped foot on campus, but I finally did it. <\/span><b>I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree and walked across the stage completely debt free<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-na\u00efve to the fact of my massive accomplishment. My grades weren\u2019t spectacular, possibly due to working all those jobs, but never did it occur to me to take out student loans. It was not part of my mindset. Perhaps because my parents never modeled or preached that debt was the answer. If you don\u2019t have the cash to pay for it, you can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always thought. What do you do when you live that mantra? You find a way to get the cash. You work hard, become resourceful, and get creative. I recognize that the cost of college has ballooned since my undergrad days and many students feel forced into loans (or feel that debt is a way of life) in order to earn their degrees. Rest assured there is another way!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How I Graduated from College Debt-Free\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lived at home<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worked several jobs (on and off campus)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earned scholarship money<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bought used books\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63937 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/undergrad-ceremony-e1621803594717.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"840\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woohoo! Walking across the stage debt free!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Earning a Master\u2019s Degree Without Student Loans\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I landed a full-time job with my alma mater<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kennesaw.edu\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kennesaw State University<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (KSU), one employment benefit was the opportunity to further my education for free. The school offered a Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) that would cover all tuition costs. My only out-of-pocket expense would be for books. Realizing the regret would be greater if I didn\u2019t go for it, I began the application process. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would even qualify for graduate school or that I would be going back to school-especially at my age. Just the words grad school were very intimidating after being out of college for 15 years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Seizing an Opportunity\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working at KSU during the day and going to grad school at night comprised the next several years of my life. Adding to the challenge was the birth of our first child during my first semester of school. Plugging away taking two classes at a time set me on a track to graduate within three years. To save money, most of my books were purchased in used condition on Amazon or eBay. Additionally, I was fortunate to be awarded two scholarships totaling $1,500 that helped pay for books.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my final year of grad school, I was offered a job I could not refuse. Sadly, this meant losing out on any remaining TAP money from KSU, but luckily, only one semester remained to be paid for. In preparation to cough up the nearly $3,000 for my final semester, I was pleasantly surprised to discover my new employer offered a tuition reimbursement program. I couldn\u2019t apply fast enough.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018 I graduated with a Master of Arts in Professional Writing from KSU-a degree valued at nearly $20,000-completely debt free.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How I Got My Master&#8217;s Degree Without Debt\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worked for the university and received a full tuition waiver<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earned scholarship money<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualified for employer tuition reimbursement program (after leaving university job)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bought used books (renting books can now be a cheaper option)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63938 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/KSU-Graduation-with-Family-12.11.18-e1621803618364.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"726\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KSU Graduation with Family, Dec 2018!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Other Ways to Pay for College Besides Loans<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paying for college is a challenge for most. For the graduating class of 2018, the average student loan debt is $29,200 per borrower. There\u2019s not always one clear path to pay for your schooling. You\u2019ll most likely need to pool together funds from multiple resources. As Benjamin Franklin famously said, \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d This is especially true when it comes to student loan debt. In other words, you\u2019re a lot better off devising a plan to avoid student loans from the start. How do you avoid loans when you\u2019re short on rich family members and trust-fund cash? Here are some ideas:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. Work While You\u2019re in School<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This should be the obvious choice. While some students might say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to work because I\u2019d rather focus on my studies,\u201d unfortunately that is not the reality for many of us. A part-time job can help pay for college-related expenses and potentially reduce or eliminate what you need to borrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most on-campus jobs are flexible-allowing you to work around your class schedule. Some campus jobs also offer tuition waivers and pay you a stipend. Finally, there is no shame in taking a gap year and working in order to save money for school. I\u2019d rather work my butt off for a year than have to pay off student loans for the next 20.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Get a Job That Has Employer Tuition Reimbursement<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of paying for education on your own, work for an employer that offers assistance. Several companies, such as Chipotle, Disney, Starbucks, Home Depot, UPS, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Best Buy, Publix, Amazon, and Wells Fargo, are willing to help you pay for your education. Additionally, Chick-fil-A\u2019s<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chick-fil-a.com\/remarkable-futures-scholarships\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remarkable Futures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scholarship program is one that I can personally vouch for as a past recipient. Some companies may offer a student aid program that isn\u2019t advertised. Check with your human resources department to find out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3. Apply for Scholarships and Grants<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are about $100 million in<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/myscholly.com\/16-insider-facts-about-college-scholarships-and-financial-aid\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unclaimed scholarships<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> each year simply because students don\u2019t know they exist. In addition to lack of awareness, it seems people may be intimidated by the application process and think there will be too much competition for the money. No amount of financial aid is too small. You can secure funding to help cover books, housing, and other costs even as a sophomore or junior.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. Dual-Enroll in High School<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one is huge for cutting college expenses because it allows students to earn college credit for classes taken during high school. These classes are usually taught to a higher standard and credit is issued through a public university. Depending on where you live, the credits earned in this manner can be transferred to state schools. If you happen to have a college near you that offers dual enrollment, you could save a ton of money on school tuition.\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.savingforcollege.com\/article\/what-is-dual-enrollment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dual enrollment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> courses are often offered completely free or at steep discounts compared with the tuition fees of most colleges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Other Tips to Save Money While in College\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The saying, \u201cLive like a college student\u201d doesn\u2019t have to mean eating ramen noodles and rolling pennies. It simply means being creative, resourceful, and wise with your choices. Remember, the key to financial success is being aware of how you\u2019re spending your money. The idea of saving money in college might sound absurd-but it&#8217;s totally achievable. The more money you can save during college, the more prepared and confident you\u2019ll be entering the real world. You might be surprised to discover all the ways you can save. Here are some tips to eliminate many of college\u2019s biggest expenses:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. Attend an In-State School<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This single decision will save you tens of thousands! The\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/04\/24\/tuition-at-public-universities-is-10230-a-year-on-average.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average tuition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at a public, in-state school is $10,230 per year, and the average tuition at a public, out-of-state school is $26,290 per year. That\u2019s an annual difference of more than $16,000 and a four-year difference of a whopping $64,000. Private college rates are even higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Live at Home<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand the desire to get away from your family, but living at home is one of the best ways to save-assuming you are attending school near your home. Even if your parents charge you a nominal rent, that&#8217;s probably going to save you much more than trying to live on or off campus. Although you&#8217;ll have some commuting expenses, you should still experience significant cost savings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3. Ditch Your Car\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most college students don&#8217;t need a car mainly because they live on or near campus. Do you know how much it costs for the privilege of owning a car? According to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaa.com\/autorepair\/articles\/average-annual-cost-of-new-vehicle-ownership\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AAA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the average annual cost of car ownership is about $9,000 a year. That\u2019s a massive savings of $36,000 over four years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s society offers a plethora of ways to commute. On campus, you can walk, bike, skateboard, scooter, or bum rides. Additionally, many colleges have free buses and shuttles that help students get around campus and even to nearby apartments and shopping centers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. Maximize Campus Amenities\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many campuses have an array of museums, movie nights and other social events for minimal or no cost. You certainly don\u2019t need to pay $50 a month for a gym membership if your college has a workout facility you can use for free. Perhaps one of the most underappreciated and overlooked buildings is the library. In addition to books, college libraries have computers, videos, software, and more. This is all free to students. Additionally, several college athletic events offer free game tickets to students. Research what your school\u2019s activity and athletic fees cover. You might be surprised!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>5. Ask for Student Discounts<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t leave home without your student ID. Many places offer student discounts including restaurants, shops, movie theaters, theme parks, and more. Discounts are available on everything from clothing to computers for those with a valid student ID. For example, Apple and Adobe offer reduced prices on tech, while hundreds of big brands give money off on clothing. Before you pay full price, see if there&#8217;s a student discount.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>6. Learn to Cook<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do your best to limit eating meals out. If you bought your school\u2019s meal plan, use it. Student discounts aside, the cost of eating out can add up quickly. Consider investing in a good coffee maker instead of spending money every morning on lattes. It&#8217;s almost always cheaper to cook than it is to go out and buy pre-made food. While a dinner for $7 to $10 may sound cheap, it adds up over time. You can probably cook the same meal (and prep for future meals) for about half the price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>7. Attend Events With Free Food<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you get starving college students to attend an event? You guessed it, free food! Look for signs, posters, and promotions around your campus. Additionally, events will be announced on the school\u2019s website, social media channels, and student email listservs. These announcements usually promote free food to lure students. You may feel like a scavenger doing this, but if you think about the enormous cost of food, the amount of money you\u2019ll be saving, plus the fact that you\u2019ve probably already paid for this through your tuition and activity fees, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>8. Earn Your Degree in Four Years<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways to save money in college is to simply have a solid plan for your classes and degree program. Earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in four years, as opposed to five or six, can save you thousands. Contrary to popular belief, college is not the time to find yourself-it\u2019s too expensive. You should be going to college with a specific purpose. Ensuring that you\u2019re taking the right classes and progressing to earn your degree on time is a great way to save money. Every extra class and semester costs time and money. Better yet, if you can earn college credit while still in high school (see dual enrollment), do it! By knocking out several classes or credits early, you might even be able to graduate early and save money.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Final Thoughts on Spending on Higher Education\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see there are many ways to pay for college and save money while in school. Unfortunately, when it comes to higher education, our culture tells us to borrow a ton of money then spend decades paying it off. Don\u2019t let anyone force you into taking out costly loans to pay for college. There are plenty of less expensive options that can lead to a rewarding career. If you can save money in college, invest it, and become financially independent in your early 30s you will be far ahead of most of your peers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope these suggestions have sparked some ideas that will create a new path allowing you to obtain the educational experience you desire without spending a lifetime in debt. Odds are, with the soaring cost of college, you\u2019ll require more than one tactic to pay for school.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Yes, You Can Pay for College Without Loans!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m here to share that <\/span><b>IT IS POSSIBLE<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to earn a college degree and receive a diploma in the mail instead of bills for student loans. Many different resources exist that can help you pay your way through. If I did it (twice), so can you! Do whatever you can do to either graduate debt free or greatly limit any loans you might incur. Your older self will be forever thankful.
