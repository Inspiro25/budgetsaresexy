(Side note: Zillow stated our house was \u2018worth\u2019 $200K+ when we put it on the market but it only sold for $185K (asking price) because the realtor stressed this was market price (damn you Zillow for getting my hopes up).)<\/p>\n<p>Since we moved we have been staying with my parents (I give them $500 a month to help them out). In July we signed a contract (you will see a dip this month since we had to pay 25% upfront for all upgrades) to begin building our &#8216;long-term&#8217; home \u2013 construction should be finished in January 2020.<\/p>\n<p>My husband had a very difficult time finding work that suited him or paid what he felt he deserved after we moved (previously he was making $66K). Finally in April he got a job paying $60K but the manual labor and long hours were not ideal. In June, after a long wait (he applied in April as well) he started working for <em>my<\/em> company and works part-time.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a really great job but here you have to pay your dues, and only with time and experience can you move into a full-time job. The hourly rate of pay is the same it\u2019s just the hours worked, so hopefully within 6 months he will transition over from PT to FT hours. Us working for the same company is great \u2013 I do not ever have to ask him what his companies policies are, what holidays he\u2019s off for or how much the benefits costs, lol.<\/p>\n<p>Before we moved his income paid for all his bills and the money we spent outside the home (activities, vacations, eating\/drinking, movies, etc). My income paid for my bills plus all the costs associated with our dogs (we had two then) and the previous house which I bought prior to us getting married.<\/p>\n<p>It might have been a weird arrangement but it worked for us during our first 2 years of marriage. We now combine expenses, but my breakdowns below do not include him yet (lol); only my figures since he has not built up any savings and only recently set up his 401K. At least I got him to contribute 10% like I do; our company matches 100% up to 5%. <em>(EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Good job, Debbie!!!!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We use a credit card every month for rewards, but pay it off each month in full so it is not listed. The proceeds from my house sale, as well as some extra savings built before then, is the reason our savings account has such a \u2018cushion\u2019. We plan on using only $50K (20%) for the down payment on our new home build when we close next January, as well as some for furniture and appliances that&#8217;ll be needed and then sit on the remainder of the cash. As life sometimes decides to take unexpected turns (like those two market downturns Oct and Dec). We plan on using the remaining funds wisely after we determine what our new monthly bills will be.<\/p>\n<p>Attached is a graph of our net worth over the past two years, as well as a breakdown of September&#8217;s net worth numbers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61919\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-breakdown-debbie.png\" alt=\"debbie's net worth breakdown\" width=\"508\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-breakdown-debbie.png 508w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-breakdown-debbie-300x109.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(Looks like she&#8217;s using our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/budgets\/j_budget_template.xls\">Financial Snapshot spreadsheet<\/a>!

I love my corporate job. I want financial freedom, but I don\u2019t want to retire. I want to travel more, but I don\u2019t want to be a blogging nomad. So thank you for your moderate welcoming space!<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re in our early 30s with 2 young kids. We\u2019re less than 6 years to our arbitrary magic number where my husband can retire without risk, which would mean (assuming I get no promotions or pay increases, and my husband\u2019s business doesn\u2019t grow at all) paying off our house in the next 18 months (AUD $1M*) then paying off my in-laws house (a AUD $320k* investment property we rent to them) another 2-3 years after that. We have planned for a family gap year in between though which will be a small step backwards.<\/p>\n<p>Our current net worth looks a bit like this converted to USD:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-61963 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carla-net-worth.jpg\" alt=\"carla net worth\" width=\"608\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carla-net-worth.jpg 1044w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carla-net-worth-300x76.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carla-net-worth-768x193.jpg 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carla-net-worth-1024x258.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We have cars but I don\u2019t count depreciating assets in net worth.<\/p>\n<p>I also haven\u2019t included the value of my husband\u2019s business because he is unconvinced he could sell it as a going concern. I disagree but am not an expert. Will be a nice bonus on top of everything if he does sell it when he retires. <em>(EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: That&#8217;s what I do with my businesses too &#8211; only count it once it&#8217;s sold as who knows what can happen with them or how much they&#8217;d bring in reality&#8230;)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>*House prices in Australian cities are a bit crazy compared to average US city (excl. San Fran of course). For example our $217k investment is a tired old 3 bed a stone\u2019s throw from the prison on the outskirts of the city. If we buy another investment we will buy in the US where we can get positive rental returns at a much lower price! Haha&#8230; But we borrow much less than the banks offered and will have paid it off in 5 years rather than 30.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks again for your blog and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/good-vs-bad-reasons-to-quit-something\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">podcasting<\/a>.
