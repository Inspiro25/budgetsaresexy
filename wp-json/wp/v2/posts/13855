Only yesterday, I suddenly wake up and realize that, Holy $hit!, I&#8217;m about to be a free man!<\/p>\n<p>And herein lies the secret ;)\u00a0 I, J. Money &#8211; king of all things money and blogging &#8211; had snuck in a <em><strong>$18,000 (!!!) loan<\/strong><\/em> from the Bank of Mom &amp; Dad!\u00a0 And no one knew but the wife!\u00a0 (oooooooohhh&#8230; ahhhhhhhh&#8230; crowd gets shocked!) Haha&#8230; It sounds pretty crazy w\/out the details, but I assure you it was a calculated play based on whole bunch of variables (and potential) from the get go.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning, shall we?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>18 months ago I get approached by a friend to invest in a project.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s an income-producing deal, but I needed a whopping $18,000 to own it outright (and really, that was the best way to play it.\u00a0 As shady as that sounds (no it&#8217;s not illegal or anything, haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li>I considered borrowing against my own money, but at the time I was in the process of saving up for my goal of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/my-new-savings-goal\/\">blogging full-time<\/a>, and it didn&#8217;t make sense for me to pull out all of the money I had in there (which was around $20k at that point) &#8211; even IF it would help me reach my goal a little faster (it did).\u00a0 Looking back it was a good thing too considering I got <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\">laid off<\/a> just a few months later ;)<\/li>\n<li>So at that point, it was either borrow the money from somewhere else, or pass on the opportunity and continue trucking forward w\/ my $50k savings goal. I chose borrowing from mom and dad instead.<\/li>\n<li>After talking with my parents, and researching other personal loans out there (including a cash advance from my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa-credit-cards\">USAA credit card<\/a> which would have only come out to about 6%! (they&#8217;re pretty good about that if you call and lock in a deal before using one of those c\/c checks), I decided to take them up on their offer of 0% interest.<\/li>\n<li>At first it felt pretty weird\/wrong &#8211; esp since I HAD the money and I just didn&#8217;t wanna tap it yet &#8211; but like with all parents, they really wanted to help out their kid and were just as excited to loan me the money, as I was for the business venture and to prove myself ;)\u00a0 I tried offering them at least 2-3% for their time and what not, but they wouldn&#8217;t have any of it and declared it was gonna be 0% or nothing.<\/li>\n<li>So I took it :)\u00a0 And then we wrote up an agreement, had everyone sign it, and decided that for the next 18 months straight I&#8217;d cut them a check for $1,000 until it was entirely paid off in full.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Which leads us to today!\u00a0 The day I send in my very last check and become $1,000 richer each month!<\/strong> Woohoo! (I actually made the last check $1001 just to force them to take an extra dollar from me in the end! haha&#8230;) I figured I&#8217;d have to tell y&#8217;all some time since my future <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/net-worth\/\">Net Worths <\/a>were about to look a heck of a lot better! And I had no explanations on where the heck that extra money would be coming from ;) Kinda hard to hide $1,000 every month when you list out all your financials for everyone to see! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the news!\u00a0 <em><strong>What do all think?<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 Would you have done the same in my shoes, or just gone ahead and dipped into your savings and\/or passed up on the deal entirely?\u00a0 I can&#8217;t divulge what, exactly, the project WAS that I took on a year and a half ago (I promised I&#8217;d keep it on the hush)\u00a0 but I can tell you that it has, indeed, been generating well over the $1,000\/mo I was paying for it each month&#8230; which was the #1 factor in making this decision to begin with: The fact that I could use this generated income to PAY OFF the entire loan this way.\u00a0 Provided it continued on the right path the whole time, of course ;)\u00a0 This woulda been a completely different post had things gone awry! Haha&#8230; And it may or may not have been hidden from y&#8217;all even longer in that case ;)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Any of you taking calculated risks these days?\u00a0 <\/strong><\/em>Or bet yet &#8211; have some juicy secrets to tell ME?!<br \/>\nI wanna know!!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/_lovenothing\/\">Zawezome<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>None of you know this yet, but I&#8217;ve been keeping a rather salacious secret from you when it comes to my financials ;)\u00a0 I don&#8217;t&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/secret-loan-bank-of-mom-and-dad\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":16791,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[178],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-13855","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-entrepreneurship"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>My Secret Loan From Mom &amp; Dad (True Story) | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/secret-loan-bank-of-mom-and-dad\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"My Secret Loan From Mom &amp; Dad (True Story) | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"None of you know this yet, but I&#8217;ve been keeping a rather salacious secret from you when it comes to my financials ;)\u00a0 I don&#8217;t...
