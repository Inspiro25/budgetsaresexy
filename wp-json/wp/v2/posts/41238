It&#8217;s very much <em>bitter<\/em>, with a tinge of <em>sweet<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Then you have the times when it&#8217;s 99% sweet and only 1% bitter &#8211; like when you receive a call out of nowhere saying you&#8217;ll be receiving some money from someone who died well over 15 years ago &#8211; WOW! And to the tune of $3,200! It still stings of course when you&#8217;re reminded of that fateful event so long ago, but what a nice surprise to come after all these years :) As if it were on purpose to continuously bring joy to your loved ones&#8217; lives.<\/p>\n<p>[<strong>Note to self:<\/strong> When you distribute your own millions in 98 years, be sure to &#8220;forget&#8221; about some of it and have your future great-great-great-GREAT grandson hand deliver the checks to all family members years after you pass. Or better yet, divide it by 50 years and have that great-great-great-great grandson send the checks every year for half a century and REALLY make your family happy! That way the slackers can&#8217;t spend it all at once too ;)]<\/p>\n<p>Anywho, I&#8217;m not quite sure what the reasoning was behind this new money we&#8217;ve now received (it was from a family member on my wife&#8217;s side), but regardless we were given $3,200 to do with as we please, so long as &#8220;what we please&#8221; equals &#8220;giving to our kids.&#8221; So really, it&#8217;s for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/07\/cute-baby-j-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">Baby Penny<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/introducing-j-nickel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nickel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>And what do you do with a kid&#8217;s inheritance?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, you could:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy them tons of candy<\/li>\n<li>Buy them gobs of fancy toys (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00B3G8UGQ\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B3G8UGQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkId=VBMKKHQHZALO5MHM\" target=\"_blank\">iPotty<\/a> anyone?)<\/li>\n<li>Put the money into their savings<\/li>\n<li>Put the money towards their future college degrees<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>We went with the college degrees.<\/strong> Specifically, their 529 college savings accounts through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.virginia529.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia529<\/a> &#8211; our state&#8217;s plan so we get double bang for our buck: tax-free growth AND a write-off for investing in the first place! Up to $4,000 per account, and per <em>YEAR<\/em>. A perfect way to extend those happy little dollars if I do say so myself. (We went with the <em>inVEST<\/em> option btw, not <em>prePAID<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p>Once we settled on where this money was going, the next question became &#8211; <em><strong>How much do we give each kid? <\/strong><\/em>Do we split it up evenly so it&#8217;s technically fair, or do we make sure both kids have the same amount invested in their accounts since one has a whole lot more than the other being a year older in the game? How much lopsidedness is appropriate?<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m still not entirely sure what the right answer is,<\/strong> but what we ended up going with was the &#8220;let&#8217;s get the two accounts as close together as we can&#8221; route. Mainly, because one had $4,500 in their account and the other $0.00. Just didn&#8217;t seem right to give each $1,600 when we&#8217;re no longer in the position to contribute to *either* account on a monthly basis anymore :(<\/p>\n<p>When Baby Penny was born the income was <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/net-worth-update-331530-72-increase-of-30k\/\" target=\"_blank\">rolling in<\/a> and we were able to divert a cool $4 grand to it. With money being tight now, however, we haven&#8217;t thrown a dime into Baby Nickel&#8217;s 529 (or had opened one up, for that matter) leaving him with a big fat goose egg to stare at.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So in went a whopping $3,200 into Baby #2&#8217;s account which leaves us more balanced now:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Baby Penny&#8217;s 529: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$4,504.29<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Baby Nickel&#8217;s 529: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$3,065.83<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>(The market&#8217;s depleted a little of each since making the investments.

It&#8217;s still nice and aggressive (and categorized as so in the plan), just not <em>as<\/em> aggressive which I&#8217;m perfectly fine with. So I thought that was pretty cool :)<\/p>\n<p>(Btw, xfering 529 accounts from state to state is pretty easy these days &#8211; in case any of you have been putting it off.

Didn&#8217;t want to get my hopes up until I saw the $$ hit our account, if you know what I&#8217;m saying&#8230; Again, crap way to receive it but much better after so many years have gone by! And I&#8217;m serious about my own wealth down the road&#8230;. Totally gonna surprise the hell out of my loved ones when I&#8217;m gone ;)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with one other nugget to marinate on&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Do you\/would you include college savings into your net worth?<\/h2>\n<p>Since you&#8217;re technically the owner of it and can disperse the money to whom you see fit, even yourself? Or do you separate it out since it&#8217;s money that&#8217;s &#8220;owed&#8221; to someone else at a future point in time?<\/p>\n<p>Originally I <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/baby-money-now-has-a-net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">kept it out of our net worth<\/a> myself, but then I realized the kids may never use it if they have their mom&#8217;s smarty pants genes and all get scholarships, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/12\/net-worth-update-529-mortgage-increase\/\" target=\"_blank\">so I added it in<\/a> since we could always end up keeping it in the end (along with a hefty tax bill, of course).<\/p>\n<p>The more I think about it these days, however &#8211; especially with the &#8220;wishes&#8221; of this new inheritance addition &#8211; <em><strong>I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll just end up giving it to our kids regardless of the situation<\/strong><\/em>. After all, it&#8217;s set aside to be invested into <em>their<\/em> future, so whether that&#8217;s college or their first home or even first business, the point of this money is to help jump start their lives, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I&#8217;m now thinking we need to take it back out again<\/strong> &#8211; though it pains me to not have money accounted for like that. I use my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/budgets\/j_budget_template.xls\" target=\"_blank\">financial snapshot<\/a> to show *where* all our money is at any given point in time, so I&#8217;ll just have to devise a section for the kids and account for it there. Though now that I think about it it&#8217;s not like we include their savings accounts in our worth, so why would their 529s be any different? Hmm&#8230; I think I&#8217;m having an epiphany here :)<\/p>\n<p>But I digress&#8230; Point is, our kids inherited some money, daddy&#8217;s using Vanguard funds to help grow it into the millions (since that&#8217;s what college will cost by then &#8211; hah!), and in 17 years we&#8217;ll give the gift of a fully paid for degree just like our parents did for us. Society may not believe in college like it used to, but we sure still do. And it would be a blessing to have our boys join the real world unsaddled by such massive debt like so many of our friends.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Now let the opinions fly! ;)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Here&#8217;s a post I did on the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/09\/pros-cons-529-college-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\">pros and cons to 529 college savings accounts<\/a> when we were first looking into them &#8211; in case you&#8217;re embarking in some high-quality baby making too!<\/p>\n<p><em>[Photo cred: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/smemon\/4996958736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sean MacEntee<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Getting an inheritance is always bitter sweet.
