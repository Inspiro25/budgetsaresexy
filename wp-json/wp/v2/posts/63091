This Aunt was pretty financially savvy and didn\u2019t have any kids of her own. She put the money in a UGMA account (named for legislation called the Unifed Gifts to Minors Act) and invested it in a broad, low-cost mutual fund that would multiply over time as my wife grew up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, this investment account has about $35k in it. &#x1f633;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a bit embarrassing for us to talk about. My wife and I are extremely proud people &#8230; the do-it-yourself type. We don\u2019t like taking handouts, and large gifts make us uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, over time, we\u2019ve found ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/would-you-accept-a-car-as-a-gift-asking-for-a-friend\/\">accept the gracious gifts<\/a> and blessings that come our way. One of those ways is to<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-include-charity-in-your-budget-and-other-ways-to-give\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay it forward<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><b>The blessings that rain down on us throughout life &#8211;&gt; we pay it forward and try to make it rain on others!\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About four years ago, when our first nephew was born, my wife and I set up a UGMA account for him with $2,500 invested in a total stock market index fund. Same with the second, third and fourth nephews as they were born &#8230; a total of $10k gifted so far! When they turn legal age, they can access the account for college savings, a down payment for real estate, or keep the money as an investment counting toward their own FI number!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We set up all the accounts with Fidelity, which was a really easy process online that I\u2019ll share at the end of this post.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-63093\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kid-gift-accounts-300x298.jpg\" alt=\"a screenshot of the 4 accounts shows a combined balance of more than $12,000\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Investing With the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, my plan was to just buy some stocks in my regular personal brokerage account and figure out the transfer later when my nephews were older. But, after calling my Fidelity rep and talking through the options, my wife and I learned about UGMA custodial accounts and really liked what they had to offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/u\/ugma.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uniform Gifts to Minors Act<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was created back in the 50\u2019s. It allows people to transfer assets to kids but remain in control of those assets until the child reaches legal age. It\u2019s like setting up a trust but way easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also checked out the 529 plan option and college savings accounts. But <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/pros-cons-529-college-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">going to college is a decision<\/a> we wanted to leave to the kids and their parents. Personally,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/no-college\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never went to college<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but my wife did. We didn&#8217;t want to set up a college savings account where our nephews felt <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pressured<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to attend school just because they have the money to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, for the amount we are gifting, we are not too concerned about the tax benefits of college savings accounts. Kiddie tax should be small &#8212; and we might even be able to do some capital gain harvesting while the child is young with no income.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Roth IRAs vs. UGMA<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Children can open Roth IRA\u2019s, and there\u2019s no age limit. <\/span><b>But, the child needs to earn some type of income<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Earnings need to be at least as much as the amount that\u2019s being contributed to the Roth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process and account type for Roth IRAs are very similar to those for UGMAs &#8212; you open the account and assign an adult as the custodian &#8212; and then it\u2019s transferred to the kid when they are legal age. Some brokerage firms don\u2019t offer <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/blog\/investing\/why-your-kid-needs-a-roth-ira\/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20age%20restrictions,Roth%20IRA%20for%20the%20child.&amp;text=A%20Roth%20IRA%20is%20more,be%20withdrawn%20at%20any%20time.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">custodial IRAs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but Fidelity and Charles Schwab do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since none of my baby nephews earn income, we couldn\u2019t set up a Roth for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why I Like UGMA Accounts and Why We Chose Fidelity<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No lawyers, no messy trust paperwork, costs $0 to set up and $0 expense to maintain!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online set-up usually takes 10 minutes. All you need is the child\u2019s name, DOB, SSN, and address.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can assign any adult as the \u201ccustodian\u201d (like a \u201ctrustee\u201d of a trust), and they have full control of investments until the child turns legal age. (For my nephews\u2019 accounts, I put myself as the custodian and will transfer it over to their parents at a later date.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The asset counts against the minor&#8217;s estate, so tax will be calculated at the child&#8217;s tax rate.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fidelity, there are no trade fees or a minimum amount of money you have to give. You could transfer just $1 if you want. (But some index\/mutual funds have trade minimums, which you need to abide by as usual.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the child turns legal age, the account can transfer to their name like a regular brokerage account. They can do whatever they want with the funds.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What to Know Before Setting Up a Gift Account<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Uniform <em><strong>Transfers<\/strong> <\/em>to Minors Act (UTMA) is a little different than the Uniform <em><strong>Gifts<\/strong> <\/em>to Minors Act, mainly the tax liability and maturity time. Might want to consult your brokerage firm and tax advisor if you are planning to give massive amounts of money or stock away!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on which U.S. state you live in, the child gets ownership at age 18, 19, or 21.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an irrevocable transfer! You can\u2019t change your mind later and take your money back. The child owns it, not you or the parents.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a large UTMA might affect the kid&#8217;s financial aid eligibility later in life!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all you Uncle Scrooges out there &#8230; If you\u2019re giving more than $15,000, you\u2019ll have to pay gift tax to the IRS.

But here\u2019s what it might look like in the future, with compound interest &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming an 8% growth rate, with a $4k starting balance today, if left untouched &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At age 18, the account could be worth: $11,748!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At age 30, the account might be: $29,585! Woohoo!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he\u2019s 40, he could have $137,896. Boom!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If he keeps the account until age 70, it\u2019ll be $642,728!
