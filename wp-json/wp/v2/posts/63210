Because I\u2019m gonna explain it using examples with ridiculously expensive, multimillion-dollar beach houses that famous people live in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1 percent rule can be used in any city or state you are planning to invest in. It\u2019s a general guide to quickly identify <strong>whether a potential investment property will generate enough cash flow to cover its own expenses.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>When to Use the 1% Rule in Real Estate Investing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say you just won the Powerball lottery and have a cool $80 million burning a hole in your pocket. You want to buy a few high-end rental properties for passive income and think that Malibu, California, is a great place to look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical lottery winner loses all of their money on bad investment property &#8212; but you\u2019re smarter than that &#8212; so you\u2019re very careful about your search criteria. You want to make sure the mansions you buy will bring in enough rental income to cover all of the ongoing expenses, especially the monstrous mortgage payments!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reaching out to a Malibu realtor, you realize a few problems:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, there are over 600 beach houses listed for sale in Malibu! It will take way too long to look at and carefully analyze each potential property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, these mansions range between $4 million all the way up to a $125 million purchase price! There\u2019s too much variety&#8230; How do you know which ones will be a good investment for positive cash flow?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time you look at the beautiful photos for luxury <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-vs-stocks-a-real-life-look-at-returns\/\">real estate<\/a> listings, you fall in love. &#x1f60d;\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to separate your emotions from your logical investment brain!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hmmm \u2026 If only there were a quick way to narrow the search down, identify the best candidates for positive cash flow, and do it all in a mathematical way with no emotions \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The 1 Percent Rule &#8230; A Quick Math Guideline<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the 1 percent rule, you can analyze a potential investment property in less than 60 seconds. All you need is 2 data points: <\/span><b>the purchase price<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0and <\/span><b>the expected monthly rent<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The rule states that if the monthly rent is at least 1 percent of the purchase price, the property will likely be a good investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monthly rent \/ purchase price = (%).\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this number is <\/span><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>higher than 1%<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this investment property has good potential! This property should be further investigated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the number is <\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>lower than 1%<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, skip over this for now as the incoming rent might not be high enough to cover all the mortgage and maintenance costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind, this is not an exact rule. It\u2019s more of a guideline. There are a ton of different factors that make a real estate investment profitable or a failure. The 1 percent rule is just a quick tool any investor can use to sift through 600 houses (or mansions) for sale and narrow it down to a select few that have the highest probability for success.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at some real life examples and calculate whether they meet the 1% rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Example #1: Matthew Perry\u2019s $15 million \u201cKick Ass Malibu House\u201d (His Words)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matthew Perry <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2020\/dirt\/actors\/matthew-perry-lists-malibu-beach-house-1234747256\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just listed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his beach house for sale for $14,950,000.

The 1% rule is just a quick guideline for cash flow investors. It was made way back in the day when interest rates were higher and purchase prices were low. There are hundreds of different factors that determine whether you\u2019ll be successful at rental property investing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know from experience. Take <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/yes-you-can-buy-a-rental-property-in-another-state\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my TX rental property<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example: When I bought it, the incoming rent was $1,800 per month, and I paid $189k for it.\u00a0 (<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>0.95%<\/b><\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">price ratio).\u00a0 But although it didn\u2019t meet the 1% rule, I can safely say the incoming rent covers the mortgage loan, tax, insurance, property management expense, AND provides me a positive cash return each year!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What If None of the Places in Your Search Area Meet the 1 Percent Rule?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will always be some markets that have high real estate prices and much lower rent ratios. Typically these are in high cost of living cities and areas like Boston, New York, Bay Area, Seattle, etc. (actually Los Angeles and Malibu typically don\u2019t have real estate properties that meet the 1% rule &#8230; the addresses I found above are extreme outlier examples only!).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few things you can do if you <\/span><b>can\u2019t find any properties<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that meet the 1 percent rule in your area:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/yes-you-can-buy-a-rental-property-in-another-state\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you can invest in a different market<\/a>! That\u2019s why I started investing in Texas properties, because I couldn\u2019t find anything in my search criteria where I live in California. Fair warning &#8212; managing a rental property while living in another state has a number of challenges associated, and certainly isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option is, you might be able to <\/span><b>force<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the 1 percent rule by offering a lower purchase price. Take for example, this place here at <\/span><b>7221 Birdview Ave, Malibu.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are asking $15.5 million &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63215 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/birdview-15-mil-e1599172170990.jpeg\" alt=\"$15 million mansion in malibu\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A similar place on this street will rent for about $130,000 per month. (<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>0.8%<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) So unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t meet the 1 percent rule with these numbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BUT\u2026 What if we could buy this mansion for $13 million, instead of $15.5 million? At a $13 million price point, the ratio would increase to (<\/span><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>1.0%<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Thus, meeting the 1 percent rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you think the owner will give us a $2.5 million discount on the purchase price? It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to ask! Depending on how hot or cold the market is, you might get lucky and be able to force a better price to meet the 1 percent rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One last option is to knowingly break the 1 percent rule. If there are no properties that make the cut, there\u2019s probably a reason why. Typically higher cost of living areas have faster property value appreciation. The yearly income that you are knowingly giving up in rent could be made up for in other areas. This is a risky strategy and needs to be carefully calculated!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What If You Know the Property Value But Don\u2019t Know How Much It\u2019ll Rent For?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This scenario happens a lot. You might want to buy a house but have no idea what it will rent out for. Where can you get reliable rental data?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, your realtor might have a general idea. But, remember they are trying to sell you the home, so they may be tempted to inflate the \u201cpotential rent\u201d numbers just to get you more excited. Expect their estimate to be on the high end!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, call a few property management companies in the area. Tell them the address of the house you are looking to buy, and ask what they could rent it out for. In my experience, property management companies are more knowledgeable about gross rent rates because they sign the leases with tenants. That\u2019s their full time job, so they know exactly how much a tenant would pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, check online sites and advertisements. Craigslist is a favorite of mine! Be sure to check out <strong>Map View<\/strong> when looking at Craigslist postings &#8212; it\u2019s the quickest and easiest way to gauge the rental market. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zillow.com\">Zillow<\/a> is decent (I used it in the Malibu examples above) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rentometer.com\/\">Rentometer<\/a> is great, too. Whatever you use, it doesn\u2019t hurt to cross-reference multiple reputable sources.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Get Out There and Find Some Deals!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Searching for the right rental property can be exhausting and overwhelming. That\u2019s why these types of tools like the 1% rule exist &#8212; so you can save time and effort identifying the best <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/rental-property-vs-stocks-tracking-experiment-continued\/\">rental properties<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously my Malibu examples are ridiculous, but the 1 percent rule is the same no matter which area you are researching. Time to get out there and find some deals!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For you real estate experts out there, do you use the 1% rule currently?
