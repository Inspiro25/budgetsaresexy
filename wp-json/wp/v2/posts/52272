To support myself, I worked for minimum wage ($4.25\/hour) at a computer lab. This income\u00a0had to pay the utility bills and everything else. I kept the air conditioning off.<\/p>\n<p>Another casualty of low income was a healthy\u00a0diet. Dinners during those years consisted almost\u00a0entirely of spaghetti.\u00a0I&#8217;d make a huge bowl of noodles on Sunday evening and store them in a big plastic container. I&#8217;d reheat them along with some cheap spaghetti sauce for\u00a0dinner almost Every. Single. Night. Breakfast was cold cereal and lunch was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I ate for under $20 per week. My poor diet must have scarred me because the very first thing I bought\u00a0when I received\u00a0my first paycheck from real work was a pound of ground beef.<\/p>\n<p>Life is better now. Through a lot of hard work and diligent saving, my net worth <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1500days.com\/performance-update-day-1580-chaos-fi-flatulence-independence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is about\u00a0$1,800,000<\/a>. While I don&#8217;t eat spaghetti every night,\u00a0I still retain my frugal ways <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/financial-confession-bought-used-acura-nsx-for-45k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with rare exception<\/a>. I&#8217;m careful with my dollars, I have a modest home, and I don&#8217;t eat out often and am not afraid to clip coupons.<\/p>\n<p>However, I recently spent time with someone who is younger, far better off and maybe even more frugal than I&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Calling Doctor Frugal<\/h2>\n<p>Near the top of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\/blogger-net-worth-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rockstar Finance Net Worth Tracker<\/a>\u00a0sits the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.physicianonfire.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Physician on FIRE<\/a>\u00a0(I&#8217;m calling him <strong>PoF<\/strong> from here on out):<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\/blogger-net-worth-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52277 \" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFnetworthtracker.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFnetworthtracker.png 1024w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFnetworthtracker-300x121.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFnetworthtracker-768x309.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>PoF is an anesthesiologist who\u00a0makes a healthy income.

Despite the big income, he&#8217;s not a big spender. The PoF family went through\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.physicianonfire.com\/62000-spent-heres-where-it-went\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$62,000 in 2016<\/a>, less than <strong>$63,784<\/strong>\u00a0that the average American family\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuepenguin.com\/average-household-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plowed through in 2013<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Lifestyles of the Rich and Frugal<\/h2>\n<p>On a recent vacation, I visited the PoF and his family and was eager to see how they lived. Any time the conversation turned to\u00a0money or I noticed something related to dollar signs, I made a mental note. Here are some of my favorite observations:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Home<\/strong>: PoF lives in a modest space in a 1950s subdivision. The house is tastefully decorated with\u00a0mid-century modern furnishings, right down to the dishes and silverware. All of it could have been purchased at expensive antique stores or through auctions. However,\u00a0the PoF family bought it here and there, piecemeal from thrift stores, Craigslist and garage sales.<\/p>\n<p>The picture at the top of this post is a custom ceiling in a screened-in room at the PoF house. When I asked PoF about it, he said this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I found the old wood flooring on Craigslist and thought it would make a neat ceiling. I stuffed it into my car and nailed it up myself.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While PoF&#8217;s home is 3600 square feet (equally divided between above ground and basement), it cost less than PoF makes in a year. And PoF &#8216;s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.physicianonfire.com\/second-home-one-best-investments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vacation home set him back\u00a0just $15,400<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Grocery shopping<\/strong>\u00a0(PoF&#8217;s wife speaking here):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We shop at Aldi. They have the best fruits and vegetables.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Aldi is a discount grocery chain in the United States. No Whole Foods here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vehicles<\/strong>: PoF&#8217;s wife drives a modest minivan and\u00a0he sports an HHR with <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/cars-of-personal-finance-bloggers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 100,000 miles<\/a> on the odometer:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/cars-of-personal-finance-bloggers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52284 \" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFHHR.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFHHR.png 612w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFHHR-300x146.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bicycles<\/strong>: PoF has a load of bicycles in his garage. While they are nice bikes, they aren&#8217;t made out of carbon fiber or exotic metals. He bought most of them used:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I picked up my road bike and these two mountain bikes on Craigslist.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Going out to eat (or not)<\/strong>: The PoF and I sampled beers at local microbreweries, but we never went out to eat. A couple of our outings overlapped lunch and we simply packed sandwiches.<\/p>\n<p>And when PoF and his family do go out to eat, they don&#8217;t visit\u00a0high-end steakhouses. Before I departed, I asked PoF\u00a0for advice about a town that we were stopping at:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Yeah, we&#8217;ve stopped off at the Arby&#8217;s there for lunch a couple of times&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vacations<\/strong>: I asked PoF his opinion on signing up for\u00a0a hotel credit card. I&#8217;m going to New York and this card would get me two free nights in a super swanky hotel that would set me back $1,600 otherwise. I told PoF that I&#8217;m not really comfortable staying in fancy places like that and he said this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t like it either. I can open my own doors and carry my own bags.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The PoF family\u00a0isn&#8217;t cheap. Cheap is\u00a0serving guests Spaghettios, using generic toilet paper (just don&#8217;t do it) and tipping poorly. I\u00a0ate very well at the PoF household and the toilet paper was plush, just how I like it. PoF tipped generously on our microbrew expeditions.<\/p>\n<h2>Deprivation or Optimization?<\/h2>\n<p>I get into arguments\u00a0with spendy people frequently:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Why don&#8217;t you just treat yourself?<\/p>\n<p>Just buy it!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And my personal favorite (is the sarcasm coming through?):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I could never live your life of deprivation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The PoF family isn&#8217;t deprived in any way. They&#8217;ve been to Iceland and recently went on a cruise. PoF&#8217;s children have loads of Lego ($$$$$). PoF&#8217;s beer making operation is sophisticated and his refrigerator contained many fancy\u00a0brews.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52274 \" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFbeer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFbeer.png 988w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFbeer-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/POFbeer-768x574.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>They spend money on what matters to them and save when it doesn&#8217;t.<\/strong> Cars don&#8217;t make them happy, so the HHR is all they need. Neither does a big home or designer clothes.<\/p>\n<p>The PoF family has realized that\u00a0stuff\u00a0doesn&#8217;t bring\u00a0happiness. Money isn&#8217;t an issue when you have a net worth north of $3,000,000, but that isn&#8217;t the only cost of\u00a0stuff. Managing stuff requires your time. Accumulate enough stuff and it owns you.<\/p>\n<p>PoF and his family have optimized their lives for what is important to them. They live\u00a0minimally and with intention. They optimize their spending and more importantly, optimize their time.<\/p>\n<h2>Be Like Dr. Frugal<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to be frugal when you have no money.\u00a0Frugality by <em>choice<\/em> is\u00a0much more interesting. People like PoF have life figured out. He knows what matters and if it costs money, he\u00a0spends it. However, figuring out what matters is the true hard part, and it looks like PoF has succeeded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You may not be able to earn like the PoF family, but you can certainly live like\u00a0them. I recommend that you do!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[As part of our new weekly column by Mr. 1500 of 1500Days.com] ****** The most frugal times of my life were my\u00a0college years.
