Well, that is where this story begins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Way back in 2014, my pal <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/TillysTinyTreasures\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carrie<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> brought her own homemade infused alcohol to a New Year\u2019s Eve party I attended. It was a total hit! I immediately fell in love with her crazy and exotic flavors, like beet vodka and carrot tequila.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a health conscious person with a savory tooth, I was enthralled with a drink mixer that wouldn\u2019t leave me with a sugar hangover the next day. And sure enough, I was able to start January 1 feeling more refreshed than I would have with a sugary champagne crash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that party, the idea of liquor infusion kits was always circling in my brain. But it would take many years and a few months in isolation before the concept began to blossom.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Fast Forward to Covid and 2020<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like millions of others, the pandemic left me jobless and with just a little bit of free time on my hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suddenly everyone I knew had a serious case of cabin fever (at best), or were completely panicking with stress (at worst). I wanted to find a way to reconnect from afar and cheer people up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided to put together some care packages for friends, family, and first responders to send my loved ones a smile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In them, I included a \u2018Quarantini Kit\u2019 of dried fruits and spices that could be enjoyed as tea or as a liquor infusion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first infusion experiment was a hot toddy mix called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/collections\/stircrazi-infusion-cocktail-kits\/products\/applecinnamonpie\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great Balls of Fire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I knew everyone would do well with an extra splash of power foods and vitamins in their nightcap or tea. That is why my \u2018Quarantini\u2019 starred a lineup of immunity-boosting ingredients that also happened to taste great, like cinnamon, lemon, and ginger.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gift packages to first responders and close family were a huge hit across the board. Everyone who received a Quarantini kit responded with requests for more. The response was unanimous: This was a fantastic gesture to light up an otherwise dark moment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>That Was When I Suspected I Was on to Something\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of diving head first into a futile and competitive job search, why not make 2020 the year I would finally bootstrap my own e-commerce business?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d read <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Four Hour Work Week<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in college and had been attempting to start a business from scratch for nearly a decade. I can say from first-hand experience that starting a business is a lot trickier than those Tai Lopez\u2019 \u201cget rich quick\u201d YouTube ads would like you to believe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the side of my day job, I\u2019d dabbled in everything from fitness apps and wall tapestries to (more successfully) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3dr3R6I\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eBooks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and party costumes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an always aspiring entrepreneur, I know how invaluable customer input is. To make sure I was on the right track, I texted every friend in my phone to ask if they would actually purchase a \u2018Quarantini kit\u2019 for themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer was a resounding \u2018No\u2019. Instead of getting discouraged, I listened to my gut. I had a feeling their disinterest was only because I hadn\u2019t properly conveyed my vision.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, I dug deeper into the data of demand. Sure enough, Google trends for \u2018tea\u2019 and \u2018liquor\u2019 were spiking during the pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63876 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1-google-search-e1619150257345.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63873 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2-search-e1619150272482.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data was undeniable. Stay-at-home orders had sent liquor sales skyrocketing. Clearly people were looking for ways to relax and stay calm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why the second flavor I invented was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/products\/lavender-lemonade\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lavender Lemonade<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, known for its soothing aromatherapeutic scent and flavor. It is also just fun and exotic to drink lavender.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Making Prototypes During a Pandemic<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first batches, all of the materials &#8212; from the jars to the fruit &#8212; came from my local Trader\u2019s Joes and Walmart.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was during some of the strictest \u2018shelter in place\u2019 phases. Waiting in line for materials took me hours, and I was limited to the stores that were allowed to be open because they were selling necessities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I dried all of the fruit and vegetables in my oven myself. This resulted in lots of burned fruit and even more painful arm burns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, my husband and I were also responsible for the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CBV5EEPFndT\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flavor testing and creation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Shots of lavender flavored vodka became a welcome distraction from the burn wounds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent a day on my couch crafting up the label and packaging for my \u2018Quarantinis\u2019. The original design was inspired by old fashioned apothecary labeling from the 1800s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63877 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/3-Quarantini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/3-Quarantini.jpg 512w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/3-Quarantini-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/3-Quarantini-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/3-Quarantini-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63875 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/4-quarantini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/4-quarantini.jpg 512w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/4-quarantini-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/4-quarantini-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/4-quarantini-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63878 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5-stircrazi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5-stircrazi.jpg 512w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5-stircrazi-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5-stircrazi-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5-stircrazi-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(StirCrazi\u2019s original label prototype)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I put the photoshopped prototype on Etsy, and sent the link to all my friends again to see if they would purchase it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This time the answer was a resounding \u2018Yes.\u2019 Everyone responded with texts and voicemails of enthusiasm and excitement. To my surprise and delight, one of my friends even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B_y4pMDBbh2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made a purchase &#8211; on his own free will!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My test subjects also responded with a rainbow of useful feedback in everything from what flavors they wanted to what a reasonable price range might be. I knew I was really on to something when people even wanted to pay more than I was asking.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>This Was the Match That Lit the Dynamite<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is nothing like the feeling of the first sale on your online store to make you swell with joy, pride, and endless excitement for the opportunity of what\u2019s coming next. I might as well have just gotten a double deal from Mark Cuban and Lori Greiner on Shark Tank.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it wouldn\u2019t be long before my elation would transform into \u2026 panic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Quarantini Craze<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somehow the Etsy algorithm overlords decided to shine their luck on me. Or I was featured in a newsletter or magazine somewhere. I\u2019m still not certain of how or where this happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went from ecstatic to have two sales &#8230; to my entire store blowing up overnight. I used to love the \u2018Cha-ching\u2019 cash register noise my phone made when I had an Etsy order. That cha-ching sound was starting to induce panic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my husband and I arrived at Target to pick up more mason jars, my phone was buzzing with one order, then two, then five, then 10. My operation was barely a month old and I had to get to work fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Challenge of Scaling My Start-Up Business<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sudden demand meant I had to put a fulfillment process in place, get business insurance, file for an LLC, apply for my cottage license, and find a way to outsource production to a white label or co-manufacturer who could handle a higher level of demand (a challenge I am still navigating).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And meanwhile, I had orders to fulfill.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I managed to outsource the actual production of my teas quickly enough to a local tea supplier at a commercial kitchen, but I was still responsible for the assembling, packaging, and shipping of every single order.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is how my tiny apartment turned into a StirCrazi pick-and-pack headquarters. Every day in a sweltering heat wave I would pack and ship hundreds of boxes, slathering everything in industrial grade disinfectant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, Etsy has a feature where you can request a post office pickup, so our mail delivery person and I got to know each other really well. I eventually had to bake him a batch of cookies as a thank you for the hundreds of packages he was hauling back and forth from our door to his truck daily.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Mother\u2019s Day and Cinco de Mayo approached, I invented new seasonal flavors including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/collections\/stircrazi-infusion-cocktail-kits\/products\/roseallmay\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose All May<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (rose hibiscus orange) and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/collections\/stircrazi-infusion-cocktail-kits\/products\/spicy-margarita\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cinco de Drinko<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (spicy margarita). Soon after, my <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/collections\/gift-box-sets\/products\/diy-flower-gift-set\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bouquet inspired liquor infusion gift pack for Mother\u2019s Day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was blowing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Bulk Order: My Next Big Break<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember driving to the post office higher than cloud nine &#8212; strangely over the moon to be delivering 20 packages to the post office. I had dreamed of starting an e-commerce business all my life. Now here it was becoming reality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is when the big call came in. An event planner in Seattle had spotted <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/stircrazi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my Etsy store<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and wanted to place a party order of 40 to arrive in time for Cinco de Mayo (in four days). A company team offsite event that she was planning had been cancelled because of COVID-19, and she was brainstorming an alternative Zoom party for the staff \u2018pick me up\u2019 instead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was it! I had really made it to the big leagues now. We worked together to create a custom order. She was the best customer any new business owner could ask for, even talking me into charging more than I had originally quoted and requesting extra refill packs and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B_tj1C0BqH2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flavored sugars<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is what prompted me to expand into new product lines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63874 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-Stircrazi-refill-packs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-Stircrazi-refill-packs.jpg 512w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-Stircrazi-refill-packs-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(StirCrazi <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/collections\/flavor-refills\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">refill packs<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/products\/flavored-sugar\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flavored sugar<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is born!)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was only the beginning of many bulk rush corporate orders. Each one often involved pulling late nights to package and ship. (All in the unbearable heat of my second-story unit with no air conditioning.)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We began providing large orders for everything from Zoom bachelorette parties to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/pages\/large-orders\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corporate client mailings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for sales teams.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first customers were my most incredible cheerleaders and advocates. Their enthusiastic reviews were the rocket fuel I needed to launch and keep going.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a partnerships manager in a past life, my corporate experience came in handy when it came time to assemble a team of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/stircrazi\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">influencers who were true champions for the brand<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, my product photos all shot on my iPhone were in desperate need of an upgrade, so I purchased a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3py1NMs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">light box<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to give them a clean, crisp background.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63879 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IMG_0284-1-e1619150553451.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"474\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>StirCrazi 2.0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I was bootstrapping, it was up to me to design everything myself, from the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getstircrazi.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the product labels. Meanwhile, I excavated the deepest depths of Google to find allies and advisors in the form of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jenndavid.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">packaging designers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, food lawyers, suppliers and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there was the great mason jar shortage of 2020. The pandemic spawned a mass food-canning frenzy and I found myself scouring the empty aisles of every convenience store at 9 pm in desperate search for a mason jar 12-pack.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>And the Challenges of E-Commerce Didn\u2019t Stop There<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-commerce is a mighty mountain to climb, full of beautiful views and treacherous obstacles, such as finding a reliable supplier, building out the supply chain, and the headache from hell that is Facebook ads.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of mountains, the excessive shipping demands caused me to start obsessively hoarding a pile of packing materials and boxes in a corner of my apartment.
