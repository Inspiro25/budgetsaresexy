Which as we all know is nonsense if you&#8217;re completely omitting the *expenses* side of the equation??<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To be financially comfortable in America today requires an average of $1.4 million, up from $1.2 million a year ago, according to the survey. The net worth needed to be \u201cwealthy\u201d? That\u2019s an average $2.4 million, the same as last year in the online survey of 1,000 Americans between age 21 and 75.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Don&#8217;t tell Mr. Money Mustache or 80% of all other early retiree bloggers this ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The article then goes on to list the rankings of what people feel &#8220;wealth&#8221; means to them:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>28% Living stress-free\/Peace of mind<\/li>\n<li>18% Being able to afford anything I want<\/li>\n<li>17% Loving relationships with family, friends<\/li>\n<li>14% Enjoying life&#8217;s experiences<\/li>\n<li>11% Having lots of money<\/li>\n<li>7% Having good health<\/li>\n<li>2% Being charitable<\/li>\n<li>3% Other<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m actually surprised at the first one as I always thought I was unique in saying &#8220;peace of mind&#8221; myself, but I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not the only one as it really is the key to happiness! When you&#8217;re stress-free it means ALL the areas in your life are going pretty well! Health\/love\/career\/money &#8211; you name it. You either have to be high or delusional if you&#8217;re feeling content when any one area is majorly jacked up, haha&#8230; And unfortunately money doesn&#8217;t solve everything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The article then listed out all the things that people said made for a &#8220;rich daily life&#8221;, which was equally interesting to see:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>62% Spending time with family<\/li>\n<li>55% Taking time for myself<\/li>\n<li>49% Owning a home<\/li>\n<li>41% Meals out\/meals delivered<\/li>\n<li>33% Subscription services (Netflix\/Spotify\/etc)<\/li>\n<li>29% Grooming\/pampering<\/li>\n<li>27% Having the latest tech gadgets<\/li>\n<li>22% Shopping at specialty grocery stores<\/li>\n<li>21% Having a busy social life<\/li>\n<li>21% Driving a luxury car<\/li>\n<li>17% Gym membership\/personal trainer<\/li>\n<li>12% Using a home cleaning service<\/li>\n<li>10% Using car service\/not public transport<\/li>\n<li>4% Other<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s literally only three on that list that I personally only care for (spending time with friends and family, taking time for myself, having a <del>busy<\/del> (fun!) social life), but there was also a handful of things left out that I&#8217;d def. list: coin collecting, reading, going on walks &#8211; or hell, just not having to think about money at all! Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice? Just waking up and doing whatever you want without having to worry or think about $$$ in the least? (It would probably also mean this blog would cease to exist, but hey &#8211; pros and cons ;))<\/p>\n<p>I was also surprised that &#8220;owning a home&#8221; was so high on the list too.
