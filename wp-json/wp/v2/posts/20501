It occurred to me that every hour I put down on that paper, is a SOLID hour of hard work. Not <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,2396216,00.asp\">facebooking<\/a>, not talking on the phone, not going out for coffee or long walking breaks, nothing &#8211; just pure work.<\/p>\n<p>And then I think back to my old 9-5 jobs :)\u00a0 And how many hours spent there REALLY went towards my core duties. 6?\u00a0 5?\u00a0 3? Not counting my restaurant or retail jobs (THAT is a lot of no-B.S. work), you already take out an hour for lunch, and then another one when you first walk in since everyone knows that&#8217;s time for catching up and checking email (personal, and work) and getting everything squared away so you can &#8220;start the day.&#8221; Then factor in all the internet searching, or out of office breaks the average person usually takes, and we&#8217;re already down to 6 or 7. Maybe even 5 knowing some of my friends ;) (I think one day I actually worked ZERO hours to see if I could get away with it.\u00a0 And as bad as it sounds, no one noticed. I wouldn&#8217;t dare recommend it though!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pretty crazy if you think about it, right?<\/strong> I mean, it&#8217;s def. good for YOU the worker, and I&#8217;m not saying to work 100% straight w\/ no breaks or fun time or anything like that &#8211; it would indeed kill productivity &#8211; but it&#8217;s DEFINITELY different when you&#8217;re self-employed. Every hour you bill or need to complete a project is exactly that: An hour. There&#8217;s no internet rando time here, or goofing off and getting away with it there &#8211; it&#8217;s all pure work. I mean, yeah &#8211; we DO waste time online and all that too (do you know how many awesome reruns are on during the day?? Judge Judy? Hoarders?) \u00a0but that only *extends* our work day as we still have a job to finish up. We can&#8217;t go home and forget about it for the night, because to the self-employed, ANY hour can be a work hour. And there&#8217;s no salary to tell you it&#8217;s gonna pay off in the end. Literally ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So the next time you say you &#8220;wish you could work for yourself&#8221; or &#8220;It must be nice working in your boxers!&#8221; think about what you&#8217;re really asking for there.<\/strong> Would you be able to work 10-12-14 solid hours each day to make that happen? Not knowing 100% if you&#8217;re even GONNA get paid for all that work in the end? If you&#8217;ve never thought about how good you just may have it at your boring day-to-day gig, perhaps some of these things might perk you up just a little ;)<\/p>\n<p>Owning a small business, or writing blog posts all day may sound sexy to the average person, but it&#8217;s not always $hits and giggles. You gotta seriously enjoy <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">the hustle<\/a> if you want to be successful. \u00a0And if you&#8217;re not disciplined enough to sit still and pound out the work day in and day out, it may not be the best fit. Which is totally cool &#8211; it takes all kinds of people to run this world of ours!<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Other small biz owners: Anything you&#8217;d like to add?<\/em><\/strong> Do you put in more *actual* hours than a typical office job? Or am I totally cuckoo over here?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/marshillonline\/\">marshillonline<\/a>\u00a0 &#8211; Edited by J$ ;))<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ever since I started this year&#8217;s 50\/50 mission, I&#8217;ve been keeping track of the hours I&#8217;ve spent working, and something hit me HARD last night&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/biggest-con-working-for-yourself-work-hours\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[178],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-20501","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-entrepreneurship"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Biggest Con of Working For Yourself | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/biggest-con-working-for-yourself-work-hours\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"The Biggest Con of Working For Yourself | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Ever since I started this year&#8217;s 50\/50 mission, I&#8217;ve been keeping track of the hours I&#8217;ve spent working, and something hit me HARD last night...
