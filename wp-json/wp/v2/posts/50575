You know, to not let my previous self down :) I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s my best, but I do know tons of people are struggling to &#8220;figure it all out&#8221; right now work-wise, so maybe this will shake something up for y&#8217;all. Lord knows it takes us time to sort things, and even when we DO finally get our $hit together something else comes up to challenge it!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, hope you enjoy it.<\/strong> Big thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/wisebanyan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">WiseBanyan<\/a> for letting me republish this today. Check &#8217;em out if you&#8217;re looking for some investing help&#8230; They say they&#8217;re &#8220;the world&#8217;s first free financial advisor,&#8221; but I think they forgot about blogs ;)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p>J. Money currently makes six figures a year through blogging, being a blog\/money coach, and advising financial startups. But before getting to that point in his life, he held over 30 jobs and got laid off more than once. [Update: I no longer do coaching, but it was fun when I did!]<\/p>\n<p>J. was kind enough to give us some insight into what it takes to be an entrepreneur, why getting fired doesn\u2019t have to be the worst thing in the world, and the truth about making money on the side job hopping. Take a look!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Job hopping is getting more common these days, but it\u2019s still looked down upon. What would be your advice to someone young and restless thinking about making a quick job switch?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I think it\u2019s fine to switch jobs so long as you\u2019re truly going after your goals and not just chasing the money or a title.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s so easy these days to get sucked into wanting more just because it\u2019s what society tells us, but when you realize you can be just as happy \u2013 and still grow! \u2013 without job hopping all over the place, it becomes a much more positive, and peaceful, experience. And believe me \u2013 after <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/all-30-jobs-ive-ever-done\/\" target=\"_blank\">having 30+ jobs myself<\/a> before \u201cfiguring it out,\u201d it\u2019s a world of a difference!<\/p>\n<p>Just do your best to go after the right things, and whether you have to job hop or not at least you know you\u2019re on the right track.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Everyone says build up 3-6 months of savings as an \u201cemergency fund,\u201d but would you give any other financial advice to people in case of a layoff?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Yeah, the more savings you can bank the better, but something even more beneficial is having a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">side hustle or two<\/a> in the works. That way you\u2019ve always got an income stream coming in whether large or small. God forbid you do lose your job you could always dedicate more time to your side hustles and keep up the flow of money while you\u2019re out on the prowl for a new one. IF you even need a new one!<\/p>\n<p>My little blog I started years ago went from making $0.00 a month to fully supporting a family of four and ending up changing my entire life. So you never know what other opportunities can arise from your side hustles. And even better if you can get passive income streams going which don\u2019t even require any work on your behalf once you get them up and going!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>You were actually relieved when you were laid off. For people who are pretty upset about it, what would be your go-to plan (both emotionally and financially)?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to being financially\/emotionally ready, the best thing you can do is have as much of a foundation set before a time like this ever occurs. That means getting debts paid off, savings banked, an overall sense of good financial management, and general life goals. All easier said than done, of course, but believe me \u2013 it\u2019s easier to get working on this stuff now versus later when you lose your job! That\u2019s always a shock whether you\u2019re prepared for it or not.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What about people looking to start their own business?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re even remotely interested in starting your own business, I strongly suggest getting started with it now on the nights and weekends while you have that stability and income flowing in.<\/p>\n<p>You will fail and learn a ton in the process, and if you\u2019re not willing to spend your free time now growing a business, you\u2019re probably not a good candidate for self-employment.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got to want it bad, and it\u2019s much easier to take risks now while you\u2019ve got nothing to lose than later when your livelihood counts on it. And these days you don\u2019t need business cards or fancy business plans to get things rolling \u2013 just focus on getting as many \u201cyes\u2019s\u201d as possible by pitching people (i.e. clients) and then build out the company from there! It\u2019s all about that lean startup mentality until you get things rolling.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Would you say entrepreneurs in a sense are always at risk for getting \u201claid off?\u201d due to out-of-the-box thinking?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Hell yes! No job \u2013 or business \u2013 for that matter is ever 100% secure. You always have a boss, it\u2019s just a matter of whether it\u2019s a manager above you or a paying client. In either case a strong work ethic and creativity go a long way in securing your future. And the more times you get up after failing the better you get over time too!<\/p>\n<p>Working for yourself isn\u2019t all rainbows and donuts \u2013 it\u2019s just a trade off of pros and cons.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Any other money\/general advice for people in their twenties feeling queasy about the job market?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>YES! If you get a good grasp of your money early on, the \u201cjob market\u201d or economy or anything else matters much less as time goes on because you hold all the power. So being conscious of where your money is going and doing your best to prioritize can make all the difference in the world. One of the best ways to get on top of it all is to start tracking your net worth (assets minus liabilities).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s quite empowering knowing where you stand, and you can\u2019t measure success if you\u2019re not tracking anything. So track your net worth on a monthly basis and then really challenge all your expenses and see what\u2019s truly important in your life. Remember that the less you need to live off of, the less you need to earn.<\/p>\n<p>Once you become financially free almost all the events in the world matter less and less with time. And so does needing a job for that matter!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>You\u2019re a dad now! Do you have a key piece of advice regarding jobs and careers you plan on telling your child in the future?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I want them to experiment like crazy and work on whatever it is that they\u2019re passionate about!<\/p>\n<p>You always produce better work when you\u2019re excited about a project, and these days with technology and the internet the options are really endless with what you can build. I still hope they get a college degree to fall back on throughout the process, but at the end of the day if they can wake up and be excited with how they\u2019re spending their time, I\u2019ll be one happy and proud father.<\/p>\n<p>I never want them thinking there\u2019s only one path to success, or that they have to do whatever everyone else is doing. Most everyone else is stressed and in debt :)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Here&#8217;s to figuring it all out!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What up what up!
