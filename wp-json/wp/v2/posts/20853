If\u00a0 not, that&#8217;s a whole other blog post, haha&#8230; and sadly not that rare.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But anyways, today let&#8217;s help out a fellow reader of the site and see if we can help steer her in the right direction.\u00a0<\/strong> I know we all\u00a0 have different ways that work for us, but maybe one of them will click for her?\u00a0 Getting new perspectives always helps :)\u00a0 Here&#8217;s her concerns:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi J$,<\/p>\n<p>I need some advice on dealing with finances with my husband. We&#8217;ve been married for a year now, and we still have issues with finances. We have different styles when it comes to money that don&#8217;t seem to mesh.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a saver. I always tell him when I make purchases or if I pay more money on balances we owe (which isn&#8217;t a lot as a young married couple&#8230; we have $5,000 in credit card debt and my student loans don&#8217;t kick in for another year). I try to make good financial decisions and read all the time about making good decisions with money.<\/p>\n<p>He, on the other hand, is a big spender. He doesn&#8217;t always tell me he has made a purchase; I usually find it on our joint checking account later and have to confront him, which I hate doing. He spends often on himself, buying clothes he wants or things he thinks he &#8220;needs,&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t really seem to think long-term or that I might want or need things, too.<\/p>\n<p>I try really hard to talk to him about money, but it can be challenging. I want to make a plan that we stick to, but have a hard time knowing how to approach him with it.\u00a0We want to buy a house rather than living with family eventually, but with the rate he likes to spend on himself, I don&#8217;t know if it will happen.<\/p>\n<p>What should I do?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Yikes! One thing I will say that REALLY helps us out a lot (I tend to splurge more than the Mrs, if you can believe that), is that we have our own separate &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/05\/married-3-years-still-havent-combined-finances\/\">do as we please<\/a>&#8221; funds set up.\u00a0<\/strong> That only we can touch and do with however we want &#8211; no questions asked. It&#8217;s not a lot of money (unless you just save it up for whatever), but it REALLY gives you that freedom that spenders like to have sometimes.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s only a side account, so you still have your major combined accounts to pay for a new home, or food, or just life in general.\u00a0 Some people say they don&#8217;t like it cuz it&#8217;s kinda &#8220;secretive,&#8221; but if <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/05\/married-3-years-still-havent-combined-finances\/\">both people are on board<\/a>, and it helps him to continue to be free while relieving you of some stress (and nagging him), it may be worth a shot ;)\u00a0 Even if you just xfer in $100 a month or something like that &#8211; the ability to spend w\/out being judged could do wonders!<\/p>\n<p>I also think some <em><strong>good communication <\/strong><\/em>is needed too\u00a0 &#8211; that&#8217;s the base of *everything* in a marriage, which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree. The trick is figuring out a way to talk about things easier (maybe w\/ a glass of wine? Or 5? Haha&#8230;), and then consistently working at it.\u00a0 It would actually help squash a lot of OTHER problems too that may come up &#8211; or maybe money&#8217;s the one thing y&#8217;all really struggle with? Either way, that&#8217;s my 2 cents &#8211; I&#8217;m sure the others will have a lot to chime in about ;)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you think, guys?\u00a0 Have you been in this spot before?<\/strong><\/em> Have you figured out something that works?
