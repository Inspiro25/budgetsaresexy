Oh man, what a crazy year it&#8217;s been so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I sat down and wrote my 2020 money goals back in January, I had no clue about the poopstorm of events we were about to experience &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest stock market crashes in history<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately followed by one of the biggest stock market <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recoveries<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in history<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More people out of work than there has ever been<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Governments printed trillions of dollars and handed out money to public companies, small businesses, and citizens in need<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rates dropped to the lowest they\u2019ve ever been<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toilet paper somehow became worth more than gold<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impeachment, drone attacks, a global pandemic, bushfires, and a whole bunch of other monumental world issues<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the year is only half over!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Time to review, reset, and pivot our goals!<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend said to me recently, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis year is a complete write-off. I\u2019m cancelling all my 2020 plans and goals and will just figure stuff out next year.\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I can see why she feels that way, I disagree. I don\u2019t want to wait until things \u201cnormalize\u201d just to start planning my life. Plus, I think it\u2019s important to <\/span><b>continue pushing toward your goals no matter what challenges are thrown at you.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d rather be a guy with plans that fail than a guy with no plans at all. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it\u2019s time to revisit, revise, and maybe even remove some of my 2020 goals. Here\u2019s a few money-related goals I started 2020 with, and some changes going forward \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Quick note: Last year my wife and I realized that we had built up too much of an emergency fund. Since we weren\u2019t working for most of 2018 and 2019, we were holding almost two years of living expenses in cash, just to be on the safe side. Going into 2020, we planned on returning to work and thought it\u2019d be safe to move some of our cash savings into new investments and reduce our emergency cash amount.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1) Fund Roth IRAs (DONE in January)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I both have Roth IRA accounts that we plan to max out each year. Roths are relatively new accounts to us &#8212; we opened them in 2016 and have been adding to them for the past four years. This year we added the maximum of $6,000 to each of our accounts back in January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2) Get a job, you lazy bum! (DONE)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this blogging gig is part-time (for now), I\u2019m counting this goal as complete!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>3) Set up a \u201cgift to minors\u201d account for my new nephew!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My brother and his wife had another baby! Woo hoo! This is nephew #4 for me :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For each nephew (all four were born in the past five years), my wife and I have been setting up a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/giving-stock-ugma-custodial-account\/\">Unified Gift to Minor Account<\/a> with a $2,500 starting balance. This is a gift to each kid, not the parents. I will remain as the custodian of the account until the child turns 18, then it gets converted into a regular brokerage account under the child\u2019s name and control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My newest nephew was born a few months ago, but we haven\u2019t set up the new gift account yet. If you\u2019re interested in what a UGMA is and how it works, I can write up a future post on it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>4) Giving stocks instead of birthday &amp; Christmas gifts for 2020<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year for Christmas I bought my dad some stocks, instead of buying him a physical present. I made it into a fun little game of choice, and J Money shared the story in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/4-great-ways-to-spread-investments-around\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a post here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stocks I bought are performing pretty well, serendipitously. And it\u2019s giving me and my dad something fun to talk about regularly and watch grow over the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This got me thinking \u2026 Instead of buying birthday gifts for my family this year, I\u2019m going to buy everyone shares in public companies. I\u2019ve got five family members with birthdays between now and the end of the year, and then I\u2019ll probably buy stocks instead of Christmas presents for people as well. I know, it\u2019s kind of boring to get stocks as gifts &#8230; but I think my family will thank me later down the road!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>5) Make $3k in travel rewards and cash-back programs<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been playing around with travel hacking and testing new bank promotions that offer sign-up bonuses. So far I\u2019ve earned $1,800 this year and hope to make more than $3k before the year is out!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>6) Sell one of our cars\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With me working from home and my wife biking to work every day, we no longer need two cars. We\u2019ll keep the trusty Prius (good gas mileage for our road trips, etc) and plan to sell our Kia Soul.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has actually been on our list since last year. But we\u2019ve changed our mind a bunch of times and never made it a priority. Although both our cars are fully paid for, owning two is now pointless and registration\/insurance is probably costing us more monthly than the odd Uber trip would cost if we needed to take one in a pinch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone want to buy a 2013 Kia Soul with ~45k miles?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>7) A kid? Or maybe a couple kids?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This feels weird to talk about publicly \u2026 But hey, if we can talk about money and share intimate financial details online, we may as well share other life-changing personal events we\u2019re experiencing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I have decided to explore fostering, and possibly adopting, children. It\u2019s been an ongoing discussion ever since we got married. We\u2019d make excellent parents, have so much to give, and there are a ton of children out there in need of a loving home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the L.A. family services department is closed to in-personal group meetings, we need to take orientation online and do web-based training courses. More to come on this &#8212; my wife and I are still at the beginning of the process. Scary stuff!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Goals we\u2019ve already failed at or decided to give up on for 2020<\/h2>\n<p><b>1) Invest in a new real estate partnership, $25k (FAIL)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In early March, we <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-syndication-example\/\">partnered on a new real estate venture<\/a> to buy an apartment complex with a bunch of other investors. Our agreed portion of the deal was $25k, which we wired off to escrow after signing all the paperwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, lucky for us, the contract fell through shortly afterward and our money got refunded! This turned out to be a blessing because when the covid news started to roll out in March, we felt much safer having the cash on hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, I should have moved the money immediately into our joint brokerage account and invested in the stock market during the March\/April downturn. Shoulda, woulda, coulda \u2026 I was too nervous to make a spur-of-the-moment investment at the time, so this $25k is still sitting in cash waiting to be invested.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I haven\u2019t set a replacement goal yet &#8212; input welcome on this!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2) Sell an investment property (Remove)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January, we listed one of our investment properties for sale. I\u2019ll admit this was more just to test the waters and see if we could get a decent price in a hot market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve since removed the listing because we realized:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t have a good plan to reinvest the proceeds. Selling one property only to buy another similar investment seems pointless.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We only bought the place three years ago and should probably stick to our long-term buy and hold strategy. If it ain&#8217;t broke, don\u2019t fix it.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b>3) Spend \u201cless\u201d on alcohol in 2020 (Remove)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We spent a total of $2,117 on alcohol in 2019 and set a goal to reduce this in 2020. It was a very general goal, no specific $ amount attached.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, I\u2019m realizing we probably won\u2019t achieve this, and we\u2019re OK with that. As of right now, we\u2019ve spent $1,373 in alcohol so far this year. Oops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying home and not going out to eat has been a big factor in this. We\u2019ve only spent $122 on dining out this year! We\u2019re saving a few dollars in one category and being a little lenient in another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, beer is fun. &#x1f642;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>4) Get health insurance, via work or third party (Remove)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I were considering getting health insurance this year but have now decided against it. Our original plan was for me to get a job that included health benefits, but this isn\u2019t an option right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve been living without insurance for the past two years and have found a bunch of local income-based health providers that offer very affordable care. Last year we had a few doctor visits (and even a small surgery) and paying out of pocket has worked out cheaper than the insurance policies we were quoted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point we are happy remaining self <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/health-insurance-worth-it\/\" >insured and continuing to pay out-of-pocket when health<\/a> issues arise. We\u2019ll assess again at the end of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are your 2020 goals coming along?
