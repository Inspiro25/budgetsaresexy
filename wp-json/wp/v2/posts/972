Especially if you&#8217;ll be buying a  car or a home soon.  Whether we  like it or not, our entire credit  history will show up and be used to  determine what our interest rates  will be when we go to finance.  Of  course, if you were really a pimp  you&#8217;d just pay all in cash!, but we  all know that&#8217;s realistically  pretty hard to do ;)<\/p>\n<p>So, if you&#8217;ve ever wondered WHAT exactly  makes up these &#8220;credit  scores,&#8221; read on my friends!  The explanations  of these breakdowns were forwarded over by a good PR friend of mine (and  long-time reader) <strong><em>Erin<\/em><\/strong>,  and come from a new site out  there called <a href=\"http:\/\/zendough.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">zendough.com<\/a>.  And of  course, I sprinkle on my own thoughts at the end  of each.  Enjoy!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Six Secrets of a Credit Score:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>1. Payment History<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A history of late payments,  even by a few days, can be potentially  hurtful. Payments received  beyond 30 days of the due date are considered  late. When lenders report  credit data to credit bureaus, they typically  lump payments that are  late one day in with those that are late 59  days. <strong>ME:<\/strong> Another reason to  have a lot of this stuff <a href=\"..\/2009\/08\/automation-and-forgetting-to-brush-my\/\">Automated<\/a>!    Or at least paid manually as soon as you open up a bill&#8230;follow my <a href=\"..\/2009\/05\/look-at-bill-pay-bill-forget-about-bill\/\">Look   at Bill &#8211; Pay Bill &#8211; Forget About Bill<\/a> method if it helps.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Credit Balances<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Similar to the utilization  issue,  credit balances current and past provide insight into issues of   financial liquidity and prudent borrowing. Historically maintaining  high  balances on key credit accounts will likely have a negative impact  on a  score.\u00a0 <strong>ME:<\/strong><strong><\/strong> Which is why having a <a href=\"..\/2009\/12\/how-much-credit-could-you-get-your\/\">HIGH   credit line<\/a> &#8211; even if you&#8217;re not going to touch a dime of it &#8211; can   be important.  Owing $1,000 on a $5,000 line looks a LOT different  than  $1,000 owed on a $50,000 credit line, ya see?  Now if you&#8217;d get  yourself  in trouble by having a higher limit, then obviously don&#8217;t even  think  about it.  But if you can control yourself, then it might be  worth the  quick 3 min phone call to just ASK to have it raised.  It  really is that  easy sometimes.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Recent  Credit<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A consumer that opens a number of credit  accounts  in a narrow time frame may be interpreted as experiencing cash  flow  problems, particularly if utilization of his or her previously  existing  available credit is very high.  In addition, a large number of  credit  inquiries in a short time frame may also lower a score.  However,   multiple inquiries for a mortgage or auto loan will be counted as only   one inquiry each, enabling consumers to shop for favorable rates without   fear of lowering their score.<strong><em> <\/em><\/strong><strong>ME:<\/strong> I don&#8217;t really know much about this one   :)  I just open up cards and run <a href=\"..\/2008\/08\/getting-your-credit-reports-and-credit\/\">credit   reports (for free)<\/a> when I need them.  Unless you&#8217;re always trying   to get into something, you should be fine.  Probably best not to play   &#8220;open one card to pay off another&#8221; &#8211; eventually you&#8217;ll slip and   get slammed with God knows what.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4.  Utilization<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Having access to credit is one  consideration,  and how much of that has been tapped into is another. An  individual  who has \u201cmaxed out\u201d his or her credit cards and\/or other  lines of  credit may not be able to obtain any additional credit or  credit at the  best possible terms. The lack of liquidity will deem these  consumers  high-risk in the eyes of lenders. <strong>ME:<\/strong><strong><em> <\/em><\/strong>Falls under the same sort  of thing  as #2&#8217;s &#8220;Credit Balances&#8221; scenario.  Being maxed out doesn&#8217;t do   anything good for you.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Depth of Credit<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Having  a strong, long history of  prudent credit use is ideal under any credit  scoring model. But as  important as it is to have long-term credit  relationships, a diverse mix  of credit accounts is also beneficial. <strong>ME:<\/strong><strong><em> <\/em><\/strong>Which is why it can be  important to hold onto at least 1 credit card  or line of credit for a  long period of time, even if you never tap it  (or better yet, just tap  it once every couple of months or so just to  keep it &#8220;active&#8221;). I&#8217;ve  kept my original card from way back as a  freshmen in college &#8211; since  1997!!!! haha&#8230;I&#8217;ve only really been <a href=\"..\/2010\/03\/its-true-im-addicted-to-credit-cards\/\">using   it<\/a> the last few years, but it&#8217;s helping keep my score high as it   shows my entire history&#8230;including the times when I was late and didn&#8217;t   care back in college too &#8211; oops.  Oh, and this is also why you hear   people say to open up a card or two even if you&#8217;re not going to use it   ever &#8211; it helps build history.  Mrs. Budgetsaresexy had zero history   when we bought our house and was advised to open up a card and make a   quick purchase (and then pay it right off) to start having a base.  We   also opened all our <a href=\"..\/2009\/01\/to-combine-or-not-to-combine-finances\/\">&#8220;house&#8221;   accounts<\/a> under both our names to help establish even more of a   history.  But again, you only do this if you can control yourselves ;)<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Available Credit<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Maintaining low balances on  credit  cards and open lines of credit will be a positive factor in  generating a  score. The typical benchmark is to keep these balances at  or below 30%  of the total available credit.<strong><em> <\/em><\/strong><strong>ME:<\/strong> Basically the same thing  I&#8217;ve already  commented on twice now. haha&#8230;I guess the credit score  companies break  it all down differently?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<span>I hope this makes sense to y&#8217;all!<\/span> It may seem  a lot to grasp  at first, but once you do you get to hold onto it all  forever :)  Or at  least until the industry changes things up&#8230;either  way, I hope it&#8217;ll be  another year until I write about it again. Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh, and if you&#8217;re looking for GOOD places to  check your credit report  for free (aka places that aren&#8217;t shady),  check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.annualcreditreport.com\/\">AnnualCreditReport.com<\/a><\/strong> &#8211;   it&#8217;s the only site that I&#8217;m aware of that&#8217;s approved by the  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/freereports\">FTC<\/a>. Keep in mind though that   you only get your credit *history* for free, if you want your actual   score (which I usually do, cuz who knows when the next time I&#8217;ll go and   check it out will be?) you&#8217;ll have to pay the $6 or $10 or whatever it   is&#8230; <em>zendough.com<\/em> may be pretty cool too, just haven&#8217;t been able   to check it out yet.
