Thank you to everyone who emailed me their thoughts and were concerned about my family\u2019s well-being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some good news &#8212; starting October 1, I am now eligible for <\/span><b>employer sponsored health insurance<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As a new employee, I don\u2019t even have to wait for open enrollment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, it\u2019s not all roses \u2026 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/health-insurance-101-gallbladders-are\/\">health insurance<\/a> is expensive!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Is health insurance worth the cost?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hard question, because everyone values health insurance differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people with chronic health issues absolutely depend on insurance to cover medical expenses. Others haven\u2019t visited a doctor in decades and see little value in insurance. Some people enroll in health insurance only because they get a hefty discount (or get it free) from their employer. And sadly, many people out there simply can\u2019t afford health insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a crazy landscape. Everyone&#8217;s health situation is different. Everyone&#8217;s risk tolerance and attitude toward insurance is different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at my new health insurance options and run some medical issues and cost scenarios. You might see how hard and crappy it is for young and healthy couples to make a decision on health insurance. I\u2019ll also share some of my experiences paying for health care out of pocket the past few years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>My New Health Insurance Benefits &#8212; Plan Options<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a California resident, I get to choose between Kaiser or Anthem insurance. Both providers offer only 2 plans each through my employer. Here are the monthly costs &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63281 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Med-plan-costs.png\" alt=\"Are these health insurance prices worth it?\" width=\"599\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Med-plan-costs.png 945w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Med-plan-costs-300x125.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Med-plan-costs-768x320.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anthem HDHP 4500 plan is recommended to me and my wife based on our health profile. It\u2019s also the cheapest monthly cost to cover us both. Circled in red, this is <\/span><b>$700 per month, or $8,400 per year<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ouch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDHP stands for High Deductible Health Plan. The reason the deductible is \u201chigh\u201d is because this $700 monthly premium is considered \u201clow\u201d. &#x1f625;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\u2019s take a look at the deductible and what health coverage these plans include\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63280 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Benefits-overview-plans.png\" alt=\"Health insurance coverage options HDHP plans\" width=\"600\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Benefits-overview-plans.png 1088w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Benefits-overview-plans-300x149.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Benefits-overview-plans-1024x510.png 1024w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Benefits-overview-plans-768x383.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looks like this Anthem plan has a $4,500 deductible. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deductible\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deductible<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the amount paid out of pocket by the policyholder <\/span><b>before an insurance provider will pay ANY expenses.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So on top of the $8,400 annual plan cost, I am responsible for paying the first $4,500 (Or $9,000 for me AND my wife) in care costs <\/span><b>before I see any financial benefit<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from this insurance plan. Actually, that\u2019s not completely true &#8230; This plan will throw me a few free preventive care visits or \u201ccheck-ups\u201d each year. Apart from that, it\u2019s $12,900 in total before the insurance company chips in a single cent.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>So Is Health Insurance Worth the Cost?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, everyone defines \u201cworth it\u201d differently. Let\u2019s just look simply at the financial calculations for a moment &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me to realize any financial value from this health insurance policy, I would need to spend $12,900 in care in a single year (either me OR my wife). Or, $17,400 if we both wanted to see value from the plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I need more than ~$13k in medical service in the next 12 months? <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have no clue! (and I certainly hope not!). It depends on what goes wrong throughout the year. Let\u2019s run 3 different health care scenarios for the upcoming year and compare my out of pocket costs of having insurance vs not having insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Quick note: In the great state of California, they issue a fine for people without a health insurance policy for 2020. This fine is a maximum of $750 per person, so I\u2019ll be including $1,500 in annual fees in calculations for the non-insurance examples.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><b>Scenario #1: A \u201cNational Average Year\u201d (Not Much Health Care Needed)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the calculator on my benefits website, the national average for a married couple like me and my wife would come to 10 x doctors visits, 9 prescriptions, 0 emergency room visits and 0 surgeries.<\/span><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63285 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/onal-average.png\" alt=\"Typical annual healthcare costs\" width=\"500\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/onal-average.png 916w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/onal-average-300x110.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/onal-average-768x283.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total cost would be $2,588 in medical costs for the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now because this is less than the $4,500 plan deductible, I would be responsible for paying this cost out of pocket whether I had insurance or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Annual Cost with insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10,988 \u00a0 ($8,400 annual premium + $2,588 in care)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Annual Cost NO insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$4,088 \u00a0 ($2,588 in care + $1,500 no-insurance fines)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an average low-health-issue year like this, my wife and I would be better off without family coverage, even if we took on a $1,500 fine. This is how we have gotten by the past couple of years, which I\u2019ll explain more below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Scenario #2: An \u201cUnusually High Year\u201d (Getting Sick and Hurt A LOT)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this scenario, I added 4 x trips to the emergency room, 2 same-day surgeries, and doubled the amount of doctor visits to 20.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63283 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/High-year.png\" alt=\"expensive healthcare example\" width=\"499\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/High-year.png 923w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/High-year-300x124.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/High-year-768x316.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though a year like this has low probability, it could happen. Disaster strikes at any time and health problems affect everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Annual Cost with insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$14,400 ($8,400 annual premium + $4,500 deductible, + $1500 in additional 20% of co-pay. $6k is the plan max out-of pocket)**<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Annual Cost NO insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$13,943 ($12,443 in care + $1,500 no insurance fines)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hmmm &#8230; I didn\u2019t expect this outcome. Looks like having no insurance still works out financially better in this scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**This calc is based on either myself OR my wife having all the health issues. If we split these doctor and emergency room visits between us, we\u2019d have to cover our family deductible ($9k), so the cost would actually be just over to $18,000 total.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, now let\u2019s add a horrible in-patient surgery to the mix \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Scenario #3: \u201cHorrible Year\u201d (Major Surgery Needed)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here I\u2019ve added an in-patient surgery or major event staying overnight at the hospital. This is on top of the unusually high year scenario we just reviewed\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63284 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/inpatient-example.png\" alt=\"expensive healthcare costs\" width=\"499\" height=\"205\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/inpatient-example.png 926w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/inpatient-example-300x123.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/inpatient-example-768x315.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wouldn\u2019t wish this scenario on anyone. But unfortunately, it happens every year to people around the world. Insurance not only provides financial coverage, but also peace of mind in traumatic times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Annual Cost with insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$20,400 ($8,400 annual premium + $12,000 out of pocket family max)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Annual Cost NO insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$30,437 ($28,937 in care + $1,500 no insurance fines)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a horrible year like this, insurance would save us an additional $10,000 medical bill. It would still be an expensive year out of pocket ($20k) but we could rest well knowing that this is the worst it would get financially. Insurance pays off financially when extensive care is needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Covered California Options<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option I have is to decline medical coverage through my employer and look for a cheaper health plan elsewhere. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Covered_California\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered California<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It provides tax credits to offset private health insurance costs depending on your income level. My household size (2) is eligible for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> credits, as long as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coveredca.com\/see-if-you-qualify-for-financial-help\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our income is under ~$100k<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using their quote tool and an example income of $70k per year, here are the HDHP options available for my family coverage \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63282 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Covered-California.png\" alt=\"Covered California options for health insurance\" width=\"550\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Covered-California.png 803w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Covered-California-300x173.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Covered-California-768x443.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although two of these plans have a lower monthly health insurance premium than my new work options, the deductible is much higher\u2026 $6,900 per person, or $13,800 for our family max. Saving a few thousand in one area seems to just cost us more in the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Surviving Without a Health Insurance Plan<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care is a sensitive subject. So before going on I want to acknowledge how lucky and blessed my wife and I are to have not had any major health or financial problems the past few years. It\u2019s unfair that some people are born healthy, while others have continuous medical problems. Our decision to be uninsured was one based on our personal risk tolerance and financial situation, not because we think we are immune to health issues. Our chances of unexpected health disasters are the same as everyone else our age\/sex\/race etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I quit my corporate job in March 2018, I got a letter shortly afterwards explaining my options for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/general\/topic\/health-plans\/cobra#:~:text=The%20Consolidated%20Omnibus%20Budget%20Reconciliation,voluntary%20or%20involuntary%20job%20loss%2C\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COBRA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act). This was basically an option to continue paying for coverage at my old employer\u2019s insurance rates for up to 18 months. The problem was, this rate was $1,600 per month and had more coverage than what we needed! I never realized how much my employer covered while I was working there &#8212; something I will pay attention to next time for sure!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I declined the expensive COBRA option and planned to look at cheaper alternatives, and possibly short term health insurance to cover us for a few months in case we started work again. After searching around a little bit, it became a lower and lower priority. Weeks turned into months, and we realized we could probably stay without insurance for another year. Paying out of pocket was just easier and proved to be cheaper.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Out of Pocket Costs<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since mid-2018, we\u2019ve paid a total of $1,190 for medical services and care. (We\u2019ll also pay an additional $2,890 total in fines for having no health insurance in 2018 and 2020). So about $4k total so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, the $1,190 in care included a 1-day out-patient surgery for my wife, about 10 clinic and doctor visits, and a few physical therapy sessions. While traveling in Africa I got pretty sick with a fever, but thankfully recovered naturally by staying in bed for 2 days. My wife and I also both got bad bronchitis while traveling in Australia &#8212; but thanks to the awesome clinics down there we recovered with antibiotics that cost less than $20, and a lot of rest. We\u2019ve been extremely lucky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local clinics and student medical facilities were pretty easy to find in Los Angeles. We didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid &#8230; Even though we were unemployed most of 2018-19, our income exceeded the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthforcalifornia.com\/covered-california\/health-insurance-companies\/medi-cal\/eligibility-requirements#:~:text=Your%20household%20income%20must%20not,more%20than%20%2422%2C108%20a%20year.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medicaid limit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 (Max of ~$22k for household of 2). But, since our income was still considered \u201clow\u201d, we qualified for other financial discounts and programs. I didn\u2019t know these even existed. This is how we got my wife\u2019s surgery so cheap. Our local clinic referred us to a hospital that had crazy cheap financial plans and offered discounts to lower income households and people without insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was a little skeptical at first about the level of care at small clinics but quickly found that the services were on par, or better, than regular physician offices I\u2019ve been to in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcarebluebook.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthcare Blue Book<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an awesome website that shows typical and \u201cfair\u201d medical costs for all types of procedures, lab tests, and medicines. Check it out if you find yourself wanting to estimate your out of pocket costs, or want information to negotiate a ridiculous medical bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Health Care and Retiring Early: What Should We Budget for the Future?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our lack of insurance can\u2019t go on forever. As my wife and I get older, our health risks increase, and insurance will become more and more valuable. Having no insurance was always a temporary decision. Same with dental insurance, and vision insurance (and maybe <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-14000-dog-cooper\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pet insurance for Cooper!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will the costs be in the future? What do I put in my future budget and how do I calculate my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-my-fire-number-keeps-changing\/\">FIRE number<\/a> to cover my future needs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care is my biggest unknown. As a placeholder, I put in $10,000 per year for health care just so I could have a line item in the budget. Now I\u2019m thinking this number is horribly low. Even if we do get cheap or subsidized care during retirement via Medicare or Medicaid, there\u2019s still a lot of costs involved and potential disasters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I haven\u2019t figured it all out yet. I\u2019m no expert. My wife and I will be working for at least the next 5 years, so we have time to make changes and adjust the budget as needed. Our FIRE number is a work in progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Important Considerations I Didn\u2019t Cover Fully in This Post<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDHP plans allow you to contribute to an HSA account (Health Savings Account). HSAs are probably the most tax efficient investment vehicle, available only to those with HDHP plans. So if I utilized an HSA, my overall \u201ccosts\u201d for insurance could be lower.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I went with my employer-sponsored health insurance, the premium would come out of my paycheck on a pre-tax basis. So in my comparisons above, the annual premium would be slightly lower because it\u2019s not counted in my taxable income. Actual savings depend on your tax rate, and ours will be probably pretty small in 2020.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter if you have insurance or not, a large <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/emergency-funds-are-not-funbut-theyre\/\">emergency fund <\/a>is necessary to cover out of pocket costs and deductibles. I\u2019m calling this out because even if you have insurance, you can still have huge medical bills just meeting the deductible.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Care costs included in my examples were all estimates provided by my benefits website. In reality, prices are different from doctor to doctor, provider to provider, and sometimes \u201ccash\u201d prices are cheaper or more expensive vs. pre negotiated insurance rates. Many costs are even negotiable. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcarebluebook.com\">Healthcare Blue Book<\/a> is a wicked resource for specific cost estimates!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>TLDR &amp; Summary<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woohoo, I qualify for health insurance through my work!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it\u2019s still expensive \u2026 family coverage will cost $8,400 per year, with a $4,500 deductible each.
