That&#8217;s the whole point of being financially free &#8211; you get to prioritize stuff however you damn please!<\/p>\n<p>Before we get to my 5 upgrades I&#8217;d do though, here were some interesting tidbits Kristina shared on how other billionaires still live frugally in parts of their lives. I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;d be similar:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warren Buffet<\/strong> (worth $46 billion) still lives in the same house he&#8217;s had for over 50 years now.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg<\/strong> (worth $9.4 billion) still wears t-shirts and hoodies and drives an Acura. (He&#8217;s probably the closest thing to how I&#8217;d act if I ever hit it rich &#8211; I love me some hoodies!!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ingvar Kamprad<\/strong> (founder of IKEA, worth $3 billion) flies economy class and drives an old Volvo.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Amancio Ortega<\/strong> (founder of the Zara clothing chain, worth $57.5 billion) still eats lunch every day in the office cafeteria with his employees.\u00a0 He also lives in an apartment with his wife.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It looks like she found these over on MSN&#8217;s list of &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/money.ca.msn.com\/savings-debt\/gallery\/15-billionaires-who-live-frugally\">15 billionaires who live frugally<\/a>&#8221; who got it from The Business Insider, who now you&#8217;ll get it from me, haha&#8230; This article sure gets around &#8211; what a slut! ;)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, when I hit billionaire status here are the 5 things you&#8217;ll definitely find me upgrading:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>My house.<\/strong> It&#8217;s no secret I&#8217;m not happy at my current residence, and once we find an area we prefer better we&#8217;ll be moving and starting a new adventure in our life. But wherever we end up in this world (I hear Thailand is nice? ;)) I&#8217;d love more than anything to have a really <em>quality<\/em> house close to walking distance to shops\/cafes\/bars\/etc. It&#8217;s all about the location in my eyes, and unfortunately that tends to cost a pretty penny&#8230; You move our $300k house downtown and it automatically becomes a $1.3 million dollar house &#8211; it&#8217;s nuts. You&#8217;re paying for the location, and I&#8217;d imagine having billions of dollars can safely secure that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>My car.<\/strong> As much as I love my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/07\/i-just-bought-caddy-and-i-slapped-it-on\/\">pimp daddy Caddy<\/a>, I can only revive her a certain more number of times :( And we&#8217;re looking into getting a bigger &#8211; more family oriented &#8211; one anyways, which a ton more money can fix no problemo. I&#8217;d grab a nice luxury SUV to hit up my yard sales and antique shops going forward, landing me even *more* junk in the trunk! (Bah-dum-ching)<\/li>\n<li><strong>My clothes.<\/strong> Yeah, I&#8217;d still stick with my jeans and tees, and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/11\/no-clothes-shopping-for-year-challenge\/\">most importantly my hoodies<\/a>, BUT but BUTTTT I&#8217;d pick up way better quality ones over the brands I have now which like to fall apart after all my heavy usage :( It would be nice to swap out my duds for better made ones that can keep up my <del>lazy<\/del> rockin&#8217; style even more ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>My charities.<\/strong> Not much explanation needed here &#8211; I&#8217;d just heavily increase the amounts I give out and probably start something of my own that helps &#8220;causes&#8221; more near and dear to my heart. Like direct-to-people help over masses of people, if that makes sense? I feel like a lot of families get looked over because they don&#8217;t fit perfectly into any one specific &#8220;area&#8221; of assistance which sucks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>My dreams.<\/strong> I wouldn&#8217;t be able to sit here and keep working the way I am currently as I&#8217;d want to put my goals on steroids and do something MUCH MUCH bigger and far-reaching than I am now &#8211; not that I&#8217;d stop blogging here or anything. I&#8217;d just use my super money powers to get the word out even more and affect a wider amount of areas than I can now. I&#8217;d feel like I&#8217;d be squandering my passions\/skills\/time if I kept my dreams on the smaller side still, ya know? Not any people ever reach billionaire status so I&#8217;d feel like if I did I&#8217;d need to do something much larger with it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We still have a few more years until I reach the billions, but so far that&#8217;s the plan ;) And maybe I&#8217;ll even do it when I hit the millions, who knows&#8230;. I&#8217;ll have to make a lot of crazy decisions then but I&#8217;m pretty excited about it! Haha&#8230; There&#8217;s nothing too crazy about that stuff up there anyways, though, right? I mean, I&#8217;d only be changing out a few things &#8211; after that I&#8217;d be laying low and in heaven&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How about you though? Could you honestly sit there and do the *exact* same thing as you are now?<\/strong><\/em> Wouldn&#8217;t you treat yourself to something finer in life, or take advantage of more opportunities now that you could? Either way there&#8217;s no right or wrong answers here, of course, but do help a brotha out and fuel his curiosity, will ya? ;) Long live the dream!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>[Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/beckhamandbloom\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melly Allen<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was gonna title today&#8217;s post &#8220;Would you still be frugal if you struck it rich?&#8221; but then realized that a) 99% of you would&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/5-things-i-would-upgrade-if-i-were-rich\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[5,61],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-31758","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-life","category-millionaire-love"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>5 Things I Would Upgrade If I Were Rich | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/5-things-i-would-upgrade-if-i-were-rich\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"5 Things I Would Upgrade If I Were Rich | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I was gonna title today&#8217;s post &#8220;Would you still be frugal if you struck it rich?&#8221; but then realized that a) 99% of you would...
