Would you rather keep track of 8 or 2?<\/li>\n<li>37 investment funds or 3 investment funds?<\/li>\n<li>4 brokerage accounts spread out everywhere or condensed into 1?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So many areas where the sheer number of accounts alone can cause you to give up!<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve talked about this before, but one of the biggest moves I&#8217;ve made in my finances over the years is <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-be-minimalist-with-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">simplifying them all down<\/a> to as little accounts needed as possible. I can tell you where every last dollar of mine is snuggling, and in the off chance something happens to me one day my wife and other family members will easily be able to find it too.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have one credit card for our family<\/li>\n<li>One checking account for our family<\/li>\n<li>One savings account for our family<\/li>\n<li>One main place where all my retirement money is (Vanguard)<\/li>\n<li>One main place where all our insurances are (USAA &#8211; which also houses all our banking accounts)<\/li>\n<li>And then one main place where all my biz $$ is (Capital One &#8211; only because USAA still refuses to offer business accounts!! I raise my fist at you, sirs!!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>In other words, I basically have one main account for anything needed, which is typically housed under one main financial institution for even greater efficiency!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t reap as many rewards and bonuses as others do (no fancy cash back or free miles to travel the world), but the peace of mind and ease of use is more than enough reward to keep me happy, and even more so &#8211; SANE.<\/p>\n<p>The same mentality goes for general *life goals* too. I read somewhere once that the average person can truly only work towards <em><strong>one<\/strong><\/em> main goal at a time effectively, and anytime you start throwing on extras the odds of failing in *ALL* of them increase dramatically. Which still doesn&#8217;t stop any of us from trying because we&#8217;re wired to go for ALL THE THINGS!, but something still to be cautious of at least, especially if you&#8217;re not happy with the progress you&#8217;re currently making (or not making). Provided of course whatever I read back then was *right*, and you never do really know since I did read it off the internets ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another known fact (this time from ME, so you know it&#8217;s accurate &#8211; hah!), is that it only takes ONE thing to become a millionaire over our lifetime too!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can do more to speed it up and get there even faster, but if you literally just did <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of these things<\/a> year in and year out there&#8217;s no way for you NOT to amplify that wealth enough to hit the double comma club&#8230; Even if that club won&#8217;t be as exclusive as it is now with inflation and yada yada yada&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Those &#8220;things&#8221;?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Maxing out your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/5-ways-to-fund-your-sexy-roth-ira\/\">ROTH IRA<\/a> every year ($6,000)<\/li>\n<li>Maxing out your 401(k)\/TSP\/403(b) every year ($19,000)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/is-it-a-mistake-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-early\/\">Paying off your entire mortgage<\/a> and saving all future payments ($100,000? $300,000? $500,000??)<\/li>\n<li>Saving 50% of your income over your lifetime (assuming you work most of your life)<\/li>\n<li>And then of course, winning the lottery&#8230; you&#8217;re surest bet ;)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now some of these are a lot harder to hit than others of course, looking a you #4!, but the fact of the matter is any of these will snowball that wealth to glorious heights and it&#8217;s not that complicated in the least. It&#8217;s when you start getting <em>crazy<\/em> and trying to cut corners that often lands people in trouble!<\/p>\n<p><strong>And even if you can only hit these goals *some* of the years and not every one, it&#8217;ll <em>still<\/em> amplify your finances enough to keep you motivated!<\/strong> Especially when you see all that compounding at work! Because once that money&#8217;s *invested* it keeps compounding and compounding and then the <em>compounded<\/em> monies start compounding making even more compounded babies! It&#8217;s a compounding orgy!! (Am I allowed to say that now, Motley Fool??)<\/p>\n<p>You ever hear of the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/penny-compounding-interest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">magical penny<\/a>? It&#8217;s like that, only with a little toned down rate of return ;) Here&#8217;s what a penny adds up to after doubling for only 31 days&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/penny-compounding-interest\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38151\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/doubling-penny-millions.gif\" alt=\"doubling penny millions\" width=\"483\" height=\"663\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t that insane??? $10 MILLION DOLLARS after only 31 days of doubling??<\/strong> I couldn&#8217;t believe it until I saw it, so I had to make my own spreadsheet (above) to really prove its accuracy.<br \/>\nAnd yup! It sure is accurate!<\/p>\n<p>So all this to say that it doesn&#8217;t take a complicated plan to hit your financial goals. And in fact, the more you can simplify it the easier it just may become as you get rid of all the extra noise and can clearly see the picture before you!
