Congrats to the bloggers out there who got pimped out! Hopefully y&#8217;all liked the guest articles here on this site as well :) From the comments it looks like you did?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of business&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As we do every year at the beach, my siblings and I go over last year&#8217;s 12 month goals we previously set, and then come up with some new ones for the next 12 months as well. It&#8217;s actually pretty cool because it&#8217;s smack in the middle of the year and gets you to re-think and visit priorities in between the New Years&#8217; resolutions. A nice mid-way check, if you will, though usually these are more business\/dream like goals vs personal ones like health or habits\/etc.<\/p>\n<h2>Here were my previous &#8220;beach goals&#8221; over the years:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2010:<\/strong> Become a full-time blogger (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/full-time-blogger-goal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Success!<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li><strong>2011:<\/strong> Be a full-time blogger <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/05\/is-a-dream-job-worth-it-if-you-cant-save-any-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AND save money vs breaking even all the time!<\/a> (Success! Though I worked like a mad man to accomplish this&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>2012: <\/strong>There were <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/one-year-from-now-goals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three<\/a> this year for some reason: #1) To get my wife pregnant again (Failed. Until the next year ;)), #2) Only work on BudgetsAreSexy and one other project (Super fail &#8211; I ended up bringing on\/buying like 3 more!), and #3) Moving to a new area (Success!). 1 out of 3.<\/li>\n<li><strong>2013: <\/strong>To &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/08\/beach-dreaming-and-goal-setting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">find my next dream and cut out the crap.<\/a>&#8221; (Mostly successful, but my dream has since changed). After a failed attempt at a local website, I launched <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rockstar Finance<\/a> which has since really taken off, and then I &#8220;cut the crap&#8221; by <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/50000-richer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selling off a handful of projects<\/a> that no longer aligned with my passions anymore. So I&#8217;d give myself an A for that one :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So to recap, over the past 4 years I went from a 9-5 job to self-employment, from zero kids to two kids, moved from one state to another, and then grew from one project to 10 projects, and now back to only two projects again (I just sold the last of my non-passion sites which I&#8217;ll blog about shortly).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget about the money.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That roller coaster went from rolling in it (9-5 plus side hustles), to breaking even (just side hustles), to rolling in it again (tons of side hustles!), to now losing a little every month (<em>less<\/em> side hustles). All stuff that has mostly been thought out and planned over the years, but still quite the adventure to say the least. Never a dull day in self-employment, I tell ya.<\/p>\n<h2>Now for the 2014\/2015 year?<\/h2>\n<p>The new plan in a nutshell is to quit working 12 hour days. Which is actually pretty fascinating because up until a few weeks ago I literally had NO idea I was working that much! In fact, I was in the middle of telling some friends that I only work &#8220;about 6 hrs a day&#8221; when my wife pulled me aside and told me how much of an idiot I was (okay, she didn&#8217;t use &#8220;idiot&#8221; but she might as well have &#8211; I was delusional!!).<\/p>\n<p>She told me sit down and add up all the hours of an average week when I go home, and as soon as I did I was dumfounded. Here&#8217;s what I saw:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-40529\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/workaholism.jpg\" alt=\"workaholism\" width=\"360\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/workaholism.jpg 450w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/workaholism-300x276.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">{the first column is early morning, then mid-day, then evenings}<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wow, indeed.<\/strong> This entire year I thought I was making good progress in the workaholic department but apparently not (and yet more proof of how important *tracking* stuff is too. Like when I used to think I was <em>saving<\/em> $200-300\/mo back in the day when in fact I was <em>losing<\/em> that every month!).<\/p>\n<p>I just couldn&#8217;t believe that I was putting in that much time, and then even more so not making nearly as much as I used to when I worked less! Haha&#8230; how the hell does THAT work?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Actually, I&#8217;ll tell you. By mainly working on projects that are more fun than profitable :)<\/strong> I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again &#8211; I don&#8217;t like running businesses &#8211; I like running hobbies that happen to make money. Which is both a blessing, and a curse. It&#8217;s awesome to be able to work on whatever your heart desires (and I&#8217;ve worked <em>years<\/em> to get to this point), but when you&#8217;re also trying to support a family of 4 on one income things like money have to be paid attention to. Which all goes back to the pursuit of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at\/\">financial freedom<\/a> &#8211; so you can do whatever the hell you want without worry about money!<\/p>\n<p>So while I am &#8220;working&#8221; a lot technically, at least it doesn&#8217;t feel like <em>work<\/em> most days. It&#8217;s all fun and business mixed together. And thank God I&#8217;m still hanging out with my kids and not\u00a0jeopardizing that time in the least &#8211; all hours I work are while they&#8217;re sleeping or in daycare. Though admittedly I need to do a better job of not thinking about online stuff while with them, something I struggle with fairly often.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s never good to be glued to the internet 12 hrs a day &#8211; even if it is fun. We need to live life outside the computer more and quit staring at screens all day long burning our eyes. Or at least I do.<\/p>\n<h2>So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do about it:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m going to try cutting out evening hours after 5:30pm, saving a good 2 hrs\/day if pulled off<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m going to scale back weekend working, wiping away another 5\/6 per week<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m going to concentrate on working *smarter*, not *harder*. I don&#8217;t exactly know how yet, but if I don&#8217;t none of the above points will work out all too well!<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m going to say &#8220;no&#8221; to more projects\/requests\/etc going forward<\/li>\n<li>And I&#8217;m going to do at least one thing a day that&#8217;s personal-driven vs online business\/fun driven. If I find other things to enjoy outside the computer I&#8217;m bound to get off it more often, right? :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Anyways, that&#8217;s the plan for the next 12 months&#8230; <\/strong>It goes completely against my Hustle 24\/7 ideology, but f*ck it &#8211; I&#8217;m older and wiser now and realize there&#8217;s more to life than bragging about how much you work or make every day. There are times and phases where that&#8217;s important (the hustling\/making money part, not the bragging ;)) and right now I feel like I&#8217;m in the &#8220;being a daddy&#8221; and &#8220;slowing down time to embrace life more&#8221; type place at the moment. I don&#8217;t know what that&#8217;ll look like come next year, but for now I jump in and give it a shot. Fingers crossed!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Today&#8217;s takeaways:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s good to revisit goals as your life changes<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s better to work smarter than harder, if you can figure out how<\/li>\n<li>Beer tours are tasty!<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s life outside of work and money<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em><strong>What have you guys been working on since I&#8217;ve been gone?\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Anyone else realizing they work way too much than they should?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here are some more pictures from our trip if you&#8217;re interested&#8230; Hope you guys had a great week!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40515\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/marina-boats.jpg\" alt=\"marina boats\" width=\"550\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/marina-boats.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/marina-boats-300x179.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">{Cool marina we had lunch at}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40516\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/baby-beach.jpg\" alt=\"running away from water\" width=\"550\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/baby-beach.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/baby-beach-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/>{Baby Penny running away from water}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/old-fake-coins-tilt-arcade-game\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40517\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/arcade-coins.jpg\" alt=\"arcade coins\" width=\"550\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/arcade-coins.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/arcade-coins-300x163.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0{<a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/old-fake-coins-tilt-arcade-game\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Old coins (and fake coins) in an arcade machine!!<\/a>}<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40518\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/beach-sunset.jpg\" alt=\"beach sunset\" width=\"550\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/beach-sunset.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/beach-sunset-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">{Beach sunset}<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Remember how <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/lifes-a-beach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I budgeted $50.00 extra<\/a> for miscellaneous stuff on our trip?
