Probably because *I* left it as some like to believe! ;)<\/p>\n<p>We all struggle &#8211; don&#8217;t let anyone fool you&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re feeling down about your finances or career or anything else going on, today\u2019s post is to assure you that you\u2019re not alone :)<\/strong> And that no matter how successful you are, problems (and haters) will still find a way to get you.<\/p>\n<p>I literally got this email a few hours ago which sparked today\u2019s post:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi J. Money,<\/p>\n<p>Just one question \u2013 how are you so happy <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> the time?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been listening to your podcast and keep wondering this.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway \u2013 thanks and have a nice week. And the podcast is awesome!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>How many times have any of us felt\/asked this about someone else?<\/b> I do it at least 13x a day, and that\u2019s an improvement over the 36x I used to ;)<\/p>\n<p>I assured him that I certainly have my down times just like anyone else, and that perhaps one day <span class=\"il\">we<\/span> should do a &#8220;10 things that suck about our money\/life&#8221; episode, haha\u2026 But as much as I feel like I\u2019m good at <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/02\/blogging-business-money-fails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/02\/blogging-business-money-fails\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556382328947000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHItWpwKVIEay5MzOVOmB4tfN2a-A\">divulging <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> my fails<\/a> here on the <em>blog<\/em>, admittedly the podcast itself skews overly optimistic\/fun.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s important to remember that we all suck at times, and often others will tell you just how much whether you like to hear it or not ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here are a handful of comments off my <strong>&#8220;Hate Mail&#8221;<\/strong> doc that continues to grow as the years pass&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s post was so worthless and a waste of time&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI listen to your podcast with Paula.

Sorry, but to these old ears you sound childish.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;To be honest, I don\u2019t appreciate the way you come off in your posts. You have an error of arrogance that rubs me the wrong way; there is a fine line between confidence and cockiness and you cross it. And you use language I find inappropriate for a budget\/life blog.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The content is good, but I&#8217;m unsubscribing because I have a difficult time with the grammar style of this blog. I feel like I&#8217;m reading text messages, not trying to save for retirement.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really care to read about your life for the few nuggets of financial advice you give.

I also cannot believe you rent! You did introduce me to <a href=\"https:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rockstar Finance<\/a> though, so thanks!&#8221; (Little did they know I was the one who created it!! Muah ha ha&#8230;)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;He says really nice things but looks like a weirdo. But I guess that&#8217;s why people like him.

Haha&#8230;.)<\/p>\n<p>So basically no matter how it looks on the outside, we are ALL dealing with stuff on the inside ;) Not to mention the *actual* stuff you&#8217;re going through alongside the colorful commentary!<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things weighing on me in &#8220;real&#8221; life presently:<\/p>\n<p><b>#1. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep my projects afloat.<\/b> The more they grow the more attention they\u2019re demanding, and it\u2019s starting to effect my work\/life balance as great as the problem is. I told myself when I had kids that I\u2019m going to stop working nights and weekends, and while I\u2019m a lot closer than I used to be, the work is overflowing into them again. (UPDATE: we&#8217;re now on a 20-month-in-a-row record of not opening up my laptop on weekends!! A blogger miracle!!)<\/p>\n<p><b>#2. It\u2019s getting harder to pay attention to the money-making side of these projects.<\/b> The more I blog\/podcast\/build things, the less I want to deal w\/ making money off them because <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> of these have always been hobby first, business later. But seeing how I now have a family of four to support, I can\u2019t exactly ignore it ;) (UPDATE: I&#8217;m still ignoring it&#8230; with a family of 5 now, hah.)<\/p>\n<p><b>#3. I feel like I\u2019m not using my full potential.<\/b> Maybe I\u2019m just not thinking of things the right way, but for the past 6-12 months I\u2019ve felt like something is missing and I can\u2019t put my finger on it. It was just a small feeling at first as I know <span class=\"il\">we<\/span>\u2019re <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> trying to \u201cfigure it out,\u201d but as the months continue to pass the pangs of unsettledness has grown along with it. (UPDATE: I still feel this way many days and haven&#8217;t found a good solution to it yet&#8230;. Part of me is proud for how much I&#8217;ve unhooked from the hustling world, but the other feels like it&#8217;s squandering all the potential for really doing something GOOD in the community together, and I often miss the days of <a href=\"http:\/\/lovedrop.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Love Drop<\/a> and working towards something bigger than myself. Plus, it would be amazing to include my kids now in doing something powerful for others!)<\/p>\n<p><b>#4. My wife is having a horrible time getting back into the workforce.<\/b> It\u2019s now officially been a year since she got her PHD, and outside of a few leads and interviews here and there nothing major has panned out. On the plus side she\u2019s spending gobs of hours hanging out and loving <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> over our kids (<span class=\"il\">we<\/span> pulled them out of daycare last year to save $2,000 month \u2013 crazy!), but I can tell it\u2019s starting to get to her which of course effects our family in turn :( And only adds to the importance of me making more money from my projects! (UPDATE: She&#8217;s now been in the workforce going on 3 years with multiple raises and back to feeling her confident self again! Go wifey!!)<\/p>\n<h2>So how does one cope with it <span class=\"il\">all<\/span>? The feeling of failure and <span class=\"il\">struggle<\/span>?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, I obviously haven\u2019t figured it out yet, but here are a few things that DO help keep me a little sane&#8230; Maybe they\u2019ll work for you too? :)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>I keep a list of <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> the NICE things people say about me too.<\/b> I literally have a google doc where I copy and paste <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> the kind words people have said about me or my projects over the years. Anytime I\u2019m having an unusually hard day, I open it up and try to make myself feel better! Doesn\u2019t always work, but it definitely helps lessen the sting&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><b>I keep a list of <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> the <i>accomplishments<\/i> I\u2019ve done.<\/b> I featured some of them at the start of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/02\/100-things-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/02\/100-things-list\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556382328947000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGk5KBtbgad7_IDpmbHi3WYFKAmxw\">my 100 things list<\/a> the other month (still at #26 \u2013 another fail!), but the beautiful part about these guys is that no matter what someone does or says, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/can-never-take-it-away\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/can-never-take-it-away\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556382328947000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMJYrNq_ffZhehkqiCMLoBf9YxBw\">no one can take them away from you<\/a>. Once you\u2019ve accomplished them, you\u2019ve accomplished them, and you can forever be proud of yourself! (This helps with the \u201cpotential\u201d problem too since you can at least see how hard you\u2019ve been working :))<\/li>\n<li><b>I remember how happy I am just *to be alive.* <\/b>This is probably the biggest reason of <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> why I tend to be happier than not: any morning I wake up \u201cwith breath,\u201d as a friend likes to say, I can\u2019t help but be thankful! Incredibly cheesy, but incredibly true!! Because even on our worst of days it&#8217;s better to be FEELING $hitty than feeling nothing at all! It means we&#8217;re alive!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All this to say, everyone <span class=\"il\">struggles<\/span>. What makes the difference is <em>how you cope with it.<\/em> Sometimes we&#8217;re better at it than others, but please by no means think you&#8217;re alone in this or that it&#8217;s not normal!<\/p>\n<p><strong>You have to have the lows in order to have the highs!! They wouldn&#8217;t be highs if they were all that way!! :)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I also find it&#8217;s helpful to &#8220;stop comparing your raw footage to everyone else\u2019s highlight reel&#8221; as my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/frugalbeautiful.com\/blog\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/frugalbeautiful.com\/blog\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556382328947000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_sSY3yMZxbRaLgvf8WPIe5RCdhQ\">Shannyn<\/a> likes to say. Because rarely do you see the entire picture when it comes to blogs or Facebook or any other forms of social media that&#8217;s cropping up. No matter how awesome or happy someone looks on the outside, they\u2019ve all got their issues just like anyone else.<\/p>\n<p>So remember that you&#8217;re never alone in this.
