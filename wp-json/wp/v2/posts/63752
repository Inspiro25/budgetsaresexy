Everywhere you look, you see personal finance topics and come up with weird analogies and concepts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I was watching <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cool Runnings<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the other day with my wife. It\u2019s a favorite movie of ours (and probably one of the raddest things that came out of the \u201890s, if I may say so). If you haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s one of those life-affirming movies about perseverance &#8212; in this case, of an unlikely and hilarious Olympic bobsled team \u2026 from Jamaica.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to laughing my ass off like an 11-year-old, I started taking notes on the movie\u2019s life lessons and how they relate to the FIRE movement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some FIRE lessons I noticed in the movie.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Work for Webster, Webster, and Cohen<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the movie characters, Junior, grew up as a rich kid always trying to impress his controlling father. After college, his dad hooked him up with a 9-to-5 job working for a lifeless corporate firm called Webster, Webster and Cohen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Junior didn\u2019t want to follow the traditional path and live according to his father\u2019s expectations. He had different hopes, dreams, and skills. He wanted to be an Olympian!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Junior ran away and started a bobsled team with his friends. He ended up having way more fun, learning self-confidence, and eventually proving to his father that <\/span><b>following an unconventional path can be way more fulfilling<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you FIRE walkers already know, it&#8217;s all about figuring out what you want to do in life &#8212;&gt; and doing it. If you just go along what your parents say you &#8220;should&#8221; do (or do what other people think is the &#8220;normal&#8221; route to success), you might not be living your most authentic and best life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, figure out what your skills are and develop them. Pursue work that interests you. Spend some time looking in the mirror each day. You&#8217;ll realize you&#8217;re a bad-ass motha, who don&#8217;t take no crap off of nobody!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(On a related note, this is one of the best articles I\u2019ve read in the past few years about not following your parents\u2019 path: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/propertyupdate.com.au\/put-your-ladder-on-your-wall\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put Your Ladder On Your Wall<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>People Will Laugh in Your Face. Keep Going Anyway.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Jamaican bobsled team? It&#8217;s funny because none of the team members had ever seen ice or snow. They were completely new to the sport and had no experience in a new environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody laughed at them &#8212; investors, state officials, other athletes, the public. Everyone expected them to fail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, the Jamaican team persevered. When they fell down, they got back up. When they were treated unfairly, they fought even harder. As others tried to intimidate or pick on them, they supported one another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, they became an inspiration! Their critics conceded, the crowd got behind them, and even their biggest hater from the Swiss team started a &#8220;slow clap&#8221; at the end of the film. Very moving stuff! &#x1f602;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve had people laugh at me. You probably have, too. Being dedicated to improving your finances means making sacrifices and lifestyle decisions that go against the grain. It might not make sense to your peers. Stuff like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bringing your lunch to work instead of spending money to eat out with coworkers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working a side hustle instead of going out to the bar<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reading a personal finance book instead of watching mindless TV\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pennypinchinmom.com\/what-to-buy-at-aldi\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shopping at Aldi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the 99c store instead of Whole Foods<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saying no to flashy and expensive items<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FIRE journey might look silly from the outside, but <\/span><b>the freedom and benefits are definitely worth it in the end.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay the course. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. &#x1f4aa;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Second-Hand Bobsled Can Go Just as Fast as a New One<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jamaican bobsledders made it all the way to Calgary to compete in the Winter Olympics, but they were missing one very important item &#8230;\u00a0 a bobsled!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of financing a new one and going into debt, the coach found them a used, rusty sled for $5,000. (I just Googled how much a new Olympic-grade bobsled is, and they&#8217;re like $100k!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seemed silly to all the other teams, but the second-hand bobsled went just as fast as the competitors\u2019. The Jamaicans didn\u2019t care how it looked, they just cared that it did the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Actually, now that I think about it, the old sled broke down at the end of the movie. But that was a mechanical issue and could have been avoided with thrifty preventative maintenance. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f468;&#x200d;&#x1f527;)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, I thought the second-hand bobsled was cool because a lot of peeps in the FIRE community talk about how beat-up and shitty their car is. Finance nerds love older used cars because they know <\/span><b>automobiles are one of the biggest money pits in life<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, used cars:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depreciate in value more slowly than new cars<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost less to insure and register than newer cars<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do the exact same job as new cars (drive from A \u2192 B)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have cooler nicknames! (because they have more personality &#x1f609;)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and a quick update on the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/would-you-accept-a-car-as-a-gift-asking-for-a-friend\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would you accept a new car as a gift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> post from a couple months ago\u2026 My \u201chypothetical friend\u201d chose not to accept, staying with what he\u2019s got!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Life Isn\u2019t Fair. Accept It, and Try Bobsledding Instead.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the movie characters became bobsledders, they wanted to compete as professional sprinters. They trained tirelessly to become the fastest runners in Jamaica and believed their destiny was sprinting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one swift accident outside their control shattered their dreams. They all tripped during the qualifying race and didn\u2019t make the Olympic running team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of moping and feeling sorry for themselves, they rallied behind a new goal. They found a different route to the Olympics &#8212; bobsledding. They made lemonade out of lemons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real life is similar. <\/span><b>It\u2019s not fair.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sometimes shit happens that\u2019s out of our control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial blindsides can come out of nowhere and handicap our FIRE plans. Things like divorce, theft, illness, unexpected pregnancies, getting fired, redundancies, bad investments, stock market crashes, natural disasters, etc. No matter how hard we try, <\/span><b>setbacks can and will happen.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And these events are what separate the weak from the strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FIRE means <\/span><b>pushing forward no matter how bad your financial situation is<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s never too late to seek help, change direction, adjust your goals, and fix your financial troubles. You just gotta shift your perspective &#8230; and believe you can do it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>It\u2019s Not About Winning, It\u2019s About the Journey<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Spoiler alert* for those of you who haven\u2019t seen <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cool Runnings <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026 The Jamaicans wipe out on their last race and don\u2019t win any medals. They put in a ton of effort and tried so hard to be the best \u2026 but didn\u2019t actually win in the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet they hold their heads up high knowing that they tried their best. The crowd gave them a roaring round of applause, and they returned home as heroes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think Financial Independence is kind of the same thing (without the roaring crowd). <\/span><b>It\u2019s not a finish line, it\u2019s a journey.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as you\u2019re living by your values and working hard to experience your best life, you\u2019re successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It doesn\u2019t matter how fast you become a millionaire or what age you \u201cretire,\u201d it\u2019s about doing what you want to do in life. It\u2019s about the smile on your face.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually, that\u2019s how they named the movie &#8230; \u201cCool Runnings\u201d means \u201cPeace be the Journey.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">******<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welp, thanks for hearing me out.
