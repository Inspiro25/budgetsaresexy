Though as my wife likes to now say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s your chance to prove how awesome minimalism is!&#8221; Haha&#8230; And she&#8217;s right. If we can&#8217;t survive in that amount of space, how will we ever in an <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/02\/pros-cons-rving-across-country-how-to-do-it\/\" target=\"_blank\">RV<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/think-you-could-live-in-a-houseboat\/\" target=\"_blank\">house boat<\/a>, or my <em>ultimate<\/em> dream &#8211; a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/10\/think-could-live-in-hotel-pros-cons-living\/\" target=\"_blank\">hotel<\/a>? All at a third of that space, if not less?<\/p>\n<p>It also makes for a PERFECT chance to declutter too.<\/p>\n<p>(I remember once actually reading a blog post about how you should <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beatingbroke.com\/declutter-house-like-youre-moving-make-cash\/\" target=\"_blank\">pretend you have to move<\/a> at least once a year so it forces you to go through your stuff! Such a great idea, right?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, we started our search around the $1,800-$2,000 range, you know, hoping that would yield some decent returns, but nope.<\/strong> One was in the ghetto, and the other was way too far away. And every mile counts in the land of the commuters (we decided early on that we&#8217;re going to be living within 10 miles of Mrs BudgetsAreSexy&#8217;s work so she has more time to spend with the kids &#8211; though of course it limits our options).<\/p>\n<p>So we bumped it up to $2,000-$2,300\/mo and eventually narrowed it down to two places after our first &#8220;dream&#8221; place fell through (we fell in love with the first home we found but it had already been rented out! Just 48 hours since being on the market!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are the quick stats on both, <em>House Hunter<\/em> style..<\/strong>. Though I already gave away the answer &#8211; oops. Just ask yourself which YOU&#8217;D pick as that&#8217;s the only reason we watch these shows anyways! :)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/house-hunters-bas-edition.jpg\" alt=\"house hunters bas edition\" width=\"600\" height=\"282\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>House #1 &#8211; &#8220;The Minimalist Compound&#8221;<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>$2,200\/mo<\/li>\n<li>1,100 sq feet<\/li>\n<li>Two bedroom + tiny office<\/li>\n<li>1 Bathroom<\/li>\n<li>One story + finished basement<\/li>\n<li>Large fenced in backyard<\/li>\n<li>Walking distance to shops<\/li>\n<li>In super sought after community<\/li>\n<li>Deal directly with the owner<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong> Cozy feeling, lots of shade and quiet, kids could have their own level to themselves along w\/ all their toys (basement), updated windows and HVAC for lower energy bills, walking distance to shops which is a HUGE plus, and a very safe community that seems pretty friendly and family oriented.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong> 1 bathroom, 600 sq feet smaller than our current place, no closet space, strict yard maintenance rules, people could be more <em>uppity<\/em> than they appear?<\/p>\n<h2>House #2 &#8211; &#8220;The Diamond in The Rough&#8221;<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>$2,300\/mo<\/li>\n<li>$50 application fee (x2)<\/li>\n<li>$50\/mo cat fee (????)<\/li>\n<li>1,700 sq feet<\/li>\n<li>3 decently sized bedrooms<\/li>\n<li>2 bathrooms<\/li>\n<li>Large fenced in backyard<\/li>\n<li>Two stories + unfinished basement<\/li>\n<li>Managed by a property management company<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong> Much bigger &#8211; including a huge carpeted play area for kids upstairs, two bathrooms!, lots of character and charm as it&#8217;s an older house, plenty of space to work as I&#8217;d have my own office, nice backyard, and the kids level would be separate from ours which is great for noise and sleeping.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong> Way more expensive &#8211; especially with the fees (have you ever heard of a $50\/mo cat fee?), basement seemed kinda dangerous for kids and also creepy as hell (there were windows looking into the crawl space for some reason which were all pitch black and I kept envisioning the dead rising and peering back at me!! Haha&#8230;), and the overall cleanliness was pretty bad as it was literally a college party house. On the plus side, this is where the &#8220;diamond in the rough&#8221; part came in as anyone who watches HGTV knows to look beyond it for the potential! And this place had tons of it!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Oh, and something else both communities had? <a href=\"https:\/\/littlefreelibrary.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Free Libraries!<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Where people build these mailbox\/bird house looking concoctions so neighbors can share and swap out books to read :) How cute are these??<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48590\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/little-free-library-red.jpg\" alt=\"little free library red\" width=\"572\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/little-free-library-red.jpg 572w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/little-free-library-red-300x186.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48591\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/little-free-library-purple.jpg\" alt=\"little free library purple\" width=\"335\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/little-free-library-purple.jpg 335w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/little-free-library-purple-232x300.jpg 232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This just added to the whole community feel and made us newcomers feel a lot more comfortable with things&#8230; Though it would have been even better if these were Beer Libraries! :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So which one did we pick? The first one, of course!<\/strong> Though we were split 60\/40 on it&#8230; While I&#8217;m nervous about the size of it as we&#8217;re losing a third of the space we have right now, I AM excited to see how it goes and everyone we talk to in the area confirms it&#8217;s an excellent community. Not to mention having the ability to pick up a cup of coffee while out on a mid-day walk too &#8211; love it! It&#8217;s hard to top that without living smack dab in the city itself (where you&#8217;d literally be paying double just for the privilege).<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, we got our home and now we move on to day care and car and packing up the house! It&#8217;ll be an expensive month, but nothing that an extra full-time income can&#8217;t solve :) And I&#8217;ll never complain about $1,700\/mo rent again, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How much are y&#8217;all paying for rent or mortgage these days?

And the &#8220;only way&#8221; for them to find out what our credit score was (tip #3)? We had to click some obscure link and then fill out all our info online &#8211; YEAH RIGHT! Mrs BudgetsAreSexy then took it upon herself to find the REAL house and its address, and it was indeed up for rent, however $500 more and a totally different set of details&#8230; But man her email would have been convincing if you didn&#8217;t know what you were doing!
