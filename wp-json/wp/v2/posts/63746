I found a way we can make some extra cash together! You know those electric scooter things around our neighborhood? I just signed us up to be night chargers!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife was skeptical at first. But after a few nights of walking around our neighborhood, riding scooters together, laughing and getting paid, she was loving it! It&#8217;s the perfect side hustle for couples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was right when Bird first launched its scooter service in Santa Monica. Back then the company was paying people $5 to $20 per scooter to take them home each night, charge them, and put them back the next day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since there were hundreds of scooters within a half-mile radius of our house, it was easy money for 1-2 hours of work each night. We made about $4k &#8211; 5k in extra money over a 3-month period. Not bad!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our garage looked like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63789 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Birds_in_garage_JPG_KV-JtxuE-scaled-e1615520821389.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, after only a few months, the Bird app got really popular and more people signed up to be chargers. The effort vs. reward stopped making sense for us, so we called it quits on that side hustle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The money was good, though it\u2019s <\/span><b>the fun and memories that my wife and I remember most.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We got to hang out with each other each night, be outdoors, get some exercise, and work as a team. We\u2019ve been trying to find another side hustle we can do *as a couple* ever since.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Side Hustles for Couples<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of you might be thinking, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cwhy the heck would I want to do a side hustle with my partner!? The reason I work is to <\/span><\/i><b><i>get away from<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> them!\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#x1f923; .\u00a0 In some ways I can relate! My wife and I have completely different problem-solving methods, and she drives me nuts sometimes the way she does things (probably not as crazy as I drive her).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I gotta say, there\u2019s a bunch of cool things that can come from teaming up to earn extra money with your partner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, it strengthens you both as a money team! Encouraging each other, celebrating wins, talking about money regularly\u2026 These are all really healthy things that many life partners struggle with. Sharing a side hustle or co-owning a small business forces you to work on these things while speeding up your path to financial freedom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, as a couple, sometimes you can conquer bigger challenges together rather than jobs you could only do solo. Working with your partner gives you double the brain power (and physical power). You each get to apply your individual skills, divide up tasks, and cover more ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you get to spend <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more activity time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> together. Many people don\u2019t want to take on a second job (especially outside the house) because they\u2019d miss being home with their partner in the afternoons. Well, if you find a good hustle idea together, you can still earn extra cash without being separated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, here\u2019s a list of the best side hustles for couples, and I\u2019d love to hear if you and your partner have found a unique way of making money together. &#x1f600;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7 Best Side Hustle Ideas for Couples<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these are featured in our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">master side hustle series<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with 80+ other money-making stories. So if you\u2019re interested in any of the jobs, you can drill down and hear people\u2019s real-life experiences, pros\/cons, expected earnings, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Gardening and Landscaping Duo ($20-$100 per yard)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a love for plants and flowers and don\u2019t mind getting your hands a little dirty, creating a small landscaping business is a great hustle idea for a couple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my neighbors currently employs a husband &amp; wife duo to do weekly yard maintenance. I gotta say, it looks SO FUN! They are the nicest couple and love what they do. Both of them hold a regular full-time job during the day, then do a few gardens after-hours for extra cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you start a business with just 4 clients (2 lawns per night, 2 nights a week) and make $50 per lawn, that\u2019s $10k extra income for the year. Talking to neighbors and friends as word of mouth is usually the best way to strike deals. Once clients are locked into a schedule, you\u2019ll have recurring income.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that the more <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unique value<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you provide, the more you can charge. Upscale neighborhoods and fancier suburbs have clients who are willing to pay a higher rate for more custom gardening. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Start a Blog Together ($0 &#8211; $5k+ per month)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fair warning\u2026 If you are new to blogging, it takes a loooooong time before you realize any income. But, if you stick with it and have a unique angle that gives good information to the people of the world, you\u2019ll be successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Couples blogs are popular because they have double the personality, provide different perspectives, and are very *real.* Readers love to hear everyday stories and experiences that they can identify with and learn from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some cool niches for couple blogs:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.feedspot.com\/couple_travel_blogs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travel blogs<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/houseofroseblog.com\/top-marriage-blogs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marriage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, relationships or dating<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blogs about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thesavvycouple.com\/parenting-blogs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parenting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and dealing with kids<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/starting-a-side-hustle-food-blog-while-keeping-a-full-time-job\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food blogging<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifestyle and general fun<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home improvement and how to fix stuff<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal finance or FIRE!***<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever it is, make sure <\/span><b>you enjoy it and like writing about it<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Blogging can be a grind, so doing it with your partner can help with motivation, holding each other accountable, as well as splitting up the technical tasks and managing social media.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting a blog is pretty easy, cheap, and most things can be self-taught. You don\u2019t need to be one of those drop-dead gorgeous influencer couples&#8230; Many popular couples blogs are just regular people, writing about their passions in life and making an extra buck doing so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My buddy Pete at Do You Even Blog has an awesome <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/doyouevenblog.com\/new-blogger-bootcamp\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free beginners online course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help you choose a topic and get a basic site set up. You can always take it further and pay for an advanced online course when you\u2019re past the beginner phase and ready to go pro.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***You might be wondering, \u201cDoes the world really need another FIRE blog out there?\u201d My answer is YES. The majority of humans in this world are horrible with finances, and every different perspective and situation helps others. If you\u2019re good at personal finance, find a way to help others.***<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Start a Podcast or YouTube Channel Together<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This side hustle is similar to blogging but is more for couples who are cool with their voices being recorded or being on camera. Again, you don\u2019t need to be good-looking influencer models (it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt) &#8230; Audiences respond more to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">authenticity and entertainment value.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This side hustle is another one that probably won\u2019t provide any income right away and will actually cost a little extra money to start up. To have quality video or sound recordings, your equipment should be of decent grade, and there\u2019s a bunch of technical details that need to be learned. Needless to say, it\u2019s handy if one of the partners has a little knowledge or enjoys the technical aspect behind the scenes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as earning potential, it all depends on your listener base. Podcasts make money from sponsors and affiliate marketing, which require a decent size audience to attract. I\u2019ve read that on average, for every 10,000 downloads, you can probably <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thebestmedia.com\/how-do-you-make-money-podcasting#:~:text=However%2C%20you%20could%20also%20approach,per%20episode%20in%20affiliate%20sales.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expect $500-$900 in affiliate sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is an amazing amount of money, but you\u2019ll need a popular niche that you\u2019re passionate about and a commitment to stay consistent with producing content. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in getting started, a recommended first step would be to reach out to someone in your network who has already started a podcast or YouTube channel. Get to know the common beginner mistakes you can avoid and the highest-value tasks to prioritize for quicker success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Pet Sitting, Dog Walking or Child Care ($25\/hr or $75+ night!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For couples who work from home and have a large backyard, consider hosting dogs for day-sitting or boarding on a long-term basis. Apps like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rover.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rover<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.wagwalking.com\/signup\/welcome\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wag<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> make it really easy to manage your own schedule, negotiate your rates, and work on your terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking after 1 dog isn\u2019t too hard, but to make really good money pet-sitting, you need to start hosting 3-4+ animals at a time. This is why <\/span><b>couples make great pet sitters. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can divide and conquer the tasks while also paying more attention to the pets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take it from me &#8212; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-14000-dog-cooper\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooper<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is my \u201cfur child\u201d &#8212; and I pay a premium to board him with sitters who have multiple dogs (more play time for Cooper) and full-time attention from the sitters (peace of mind for me). If you provide more value, you can charge more for your service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Couples make great child &amp; babysitters too<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially for big families with multiple kids to look after! One of my friends has 3 crazy kids, which is a handful for any single babysitter\u2026 So they love finding couples who want to babysit for a night! <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.care.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Care.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a site where you can offer all types of home services as a couple.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Open an Online Store, Like an Etsy Shop ($250+ per month)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend of mine recently bought a jewelry-making kit and some cool-looking crystal stones. Every night <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartcentsmom.com\/crafts-you-can-do-while-watching-tv\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while watching TV<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with her husband, she pulls out this kit and handmakes little necklaces, bracelets and earrings. It started as a fun hobby making gifts for her friends, but one day her husband started taking photos of the finished jewelry, and created an Etsy store to sell them online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love hearing about people turning their art hobbies into side hustles! Even if the income isn\u2019t huge, it\u2019s getting paid for things you like to do anyway. Win\/win!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartcentsmom.com\/starting-an-etsy-shop\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etsy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there\u2019s also boutique places like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artfire.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ArtFire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sell.amazon.com\/programs\/handmade.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Handmade<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artpal.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ArtPal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (more for paintings) where you can set up an online business to sell your stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your skills and craft, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theworkathomewife.com\/how-to-sell-digital-downloads-on-etsy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital downloads are an awesome product to sell<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because it creates residual income. You only need to make a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital art<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> piece 1 time, then it can be sold thousands of times over. We\u2019ve featured this type of great idea before: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-selling-printables-on-etsy-for-passive-income\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling printables for passive income!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Invest in Real Estate &#8212; Together\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m kinda hesitant calling this a \u201cside hustle\u201d because it requires a fair bit of capital, and it\u2019s not something you can just pick up one day and call quits the next day. It\u2019s a big commitment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great couples activity! Most real estate investors build a \u201cteam\u201d to handle investment projects, and who better to have on your team than your own partner? You can learn together, support each other, and each bring a different set of skills to the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since there are so many strategies for investing in real estate, <\/span><b>I recommend matching your skill sets to the type of activities that are required<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/financialbestlife.com\/what-its-like-to-start-on-an-entirely-new-career-path-at-33\/\"><b>Fix &amp; flip real estate<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Great if you have skills in building, renovating, designing, finding and buying discount materials, negotiating, managing contractors, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Buy &amp; hold rental property investing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Requires analytical skills, heavy research, spreadsheet modeling, number crunching, managing tenants, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Wholesaling or contract selling:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you\u2019re good at sales, marketing, negotiating, relationship building, managing lists, multi-tasking, advertising etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/theworkathomewife.com\/make-money-airbnb\/\"><b>Vacation rentals<\/b><\/a><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Requires a bunch of social media and marketing skills, interior design and lifestyle vision, managing tenants (LOTS of them!), managing contractors and cleaners, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate investing is exciting, romantic, and addictive. Just be careful how emotionally attached you get when taking on a project, as emotions can lead to making bad decisions. This is another reason why working with a partner &#8212; your partner &#8212; can help keep you focussed on the financial goal! &#x1f3e1;&#x1f3e1;&#x1f3e1; = &#x1f4b0;&#x1f4b0;&#x1f4b0;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. House Sitting: Locally or While Traveling (You Set Your Rates)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For couples who like to travel, explore new places, or just having a change of scene once in a while, consider advertising yourselves as a house-sitting duo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get paid a few different ways for looking after someone\u2019s house. Sometimes it\u2019s a flat per-day payment, and sometimes people house-sit in exchange for free lodging when traveling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.housecarers.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House Carers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (previously housesitters.com) is great for local house-sitting opportunities. Now that the pandemic has transitioned many people to working from home, this is a great way to stay local, continue working your day job, and make money literally while you sleep! I believe this site has an annual membership fee of $50.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.housesittersamerica.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House Sitters America<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has both free and paid house-sitting opportunities. (This site also has a $50 membership fee each year.) Probably best to check the listings in your area and see what the going rate is for a sitter before you commit to anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustedhousesitters.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trusted House Sitters<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is another cool site. It\u2019s more for global travellers and payment is usually in the form of free accommodation. There\u2019s a higher fee to join this site, like $120 a year, but it opens the door to worldwide connections and international house-swaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also it\u2019s good to note that house-sitting goes hand in hand with pet sitting. Most people who need house sitters also want you to watch over their pets!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any of you got a side hustle you do with your partner?
