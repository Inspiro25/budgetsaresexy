I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s collecting marbles to hawk or running barefoot to work every day to save a couple of bucks (though that would be something!). You do what you need to do to reach your goals and let the people ogle. What does it concern them?<\/p>\n<p>Not to be <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/05\/the-miser-and-his-gold-aesops-fables\/\" target=\"_blank\">Aesop&#8217;s #1 fan<\/a> this month, but here&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.taleswithmorals.com\/aesop-fable-the-man-the-boy-and-the-donkey.htm\" target=\"_blank\">another great story<\/a> which captures this nicely:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A man and his son were once going to the market with their donkey. As they were walking along by its side, a countryman passed them and said: &#8220;You fools, what is a donkey for but to ride upon?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So the man put the boy on the donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: &#8220;See that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So the man ordered his boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn&#8217;t gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the other: &#8220;Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well, the man didn&#8217;t know what to do, but at last he took his boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking son?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The man and boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, &#8217;till at last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey&#8217;s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders.<\/p>\n<p>They went along amid the laughter of all who met them &#8217;till they came to a bridge, when the donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge and his fore-feet being tied together he was drowned.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That will teach you,&#8221; said an old man who had followed them.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>The moral, of course:<\/strong> Please all, and you will please none.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Or again, my version:<\/strong> I&#8217;m gonna do me and you can suck it.<\/p>\n<p>People will hate and wonder and poke fun at you for the rest of your life. It&#8217;ll never change because people are just a$$holes sometimes. And while it can hurt and sting, do try your best to remember this story of the poor donkey and his carriers. You can&#8217;t please everyone, but you really don&#8217;t need to either &#8211; you just need to please yourself! (And, well, maybe your mother ;) Unless she&#8217;s the one doing the poking, in which case just smile and nod, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>If either of these mantras are too long to remember, just go with: <em>whatevs<\/em>*.<\/strong> Brush that dirt off your shoulders and move along with your debt-kicking, wealth-growing, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/retiring-early-means-being-financially-free\/\" target=\"_blank\">early-retirement-career-loving<\/a> ways!
