This is the same friend who got <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/02\/finding-real-and-fake-money-on-ground\/\" target=\"_blank\">duped by that fake $100 bill<\/a> a while back, haha..<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the question he posed <\/strong>&#8211; I thought it was a pretty hard one after thinking about it for a bit:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Would you rather have $1 billion dollars now &#8230;OR&#8230; be able to go back in time to re-live the last 15 years of your life?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now at first those 15 years look AWFULLY good as that&#8217;s a lot of extra life to get back, especially during your prime if you&#8217;re in your 30s like me!), but after taking a few steps back I realized it&#8217;s not *as* sexy as it may sound.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For one, you&#8217;re messing around with the whole space time continuum or whatever it&#8217;s called.<\/strong> The whole &#8220;step on a bug and your entire future changes &#8211; as does everyone else&#8217;s around you&#8221; type deal. Just like that Simpsons episode or even that (freaky) movie <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B8_dgqfPXFg\" target=\"_blank\">The Butterfly Effect<\/a> ft.\u00a0Se\u00f1or Kutcher. And I&#8217;d hate to go back and F up my past 15 years only to get back to my 30s and have a worse off life than I did. Especially knowing you blew a chance at $1 Billion dollars to top it off!<\/p>\n<p>This would also put me back to my late teen years when I was lucky enough to come out alive during some of the stupid things I did back then. Like drink myself to oblivion or hang out in areas I really shouldn&#8217;t be at with people I really shouldn&#8217;t have been friends with. I&#8217;d be a lot smarter going back in time with the knowledge I have with me now, but that could be even more dangerous ;) Though also very lucrative! (I&#8217;d be able to make tons of $$$ before the internet boom, and crash, and boom again, avoid the stock market during the right times, and even know the answers to most big sporting events!). I&#8217;d probably become filthy rich and then end up dying on the side of the lone lonely missing all my friends and future baby would-be&#8217;s since they&#8217;d only be memories of days never to come.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At this point I change my mind and tell my friend I&#8217;ll take the Billion dollars now, please :)<\/strong> In hopes of bettering my future instead of screwing up my past (plus: I happen to like how my life turned out so why go back and re-live it?). Of course a billion dollars comes with its share of problems too, as <del>Puff Daddy<\/del> <del>P Ditty<\/del> Ditty and B.I.G. once so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gUhRKVIjJtw\" target=\"_blank\">eloquently stated<\/a>, but hopefully everyone reading this blog is much much smarter than they were before they got to this site ;) So I&#8217;d have faith any of us would be able to safely enjoy a nice future with tons of money in the bank like that.<\/p>\n<p>So as it stands, my answer would be the solid $1 Billion dollars.<\/p>\n<h2>Changing it up a bit&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>I then threw my friend for a loop and asked if it would change anything tacking on an extra 15 years of life *going forward*, instead of\u00a0 backwards? So, either $1 billion now, or an extra 15 years to live later?<\/p>\n<p>This brings up a whole other set of variables such as &#8220;would you *really* want to live an extra 15 years if you&#8217;re like 90 and grumpy??&#8221; and &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t $1 billion allow me to live a much happier life than extending it for a little while longer?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Again it comes down to a question of happiness and the odds of our own mortality.<\/strong> As it stands, any of us could wake up tomorrow and die on impact (I&#8217;ll let your imaginations figure out how). So even if you got that $1 billion all your doing is dying a lot richer. You take that 15 years, however, and you just *guaranteed* yourself that you&#8217;d be living at LEAST until 2029. And more than likely much longer than that since most of us will still be around this time tomorrow :)<\/p>\n<p>So today I pose two questions for your brilliant minds to ponder.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>1) Would you take $1 billion dollars now, or go back in time 15 years and relive your life again?<\/p>\n<p>2) Does your answer change if you gained the 15 years *ahead* vs behind?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m still sticking with the $1 billion for question #1, but I&#8217;ll happily opt for the extra 15 years for question #2. I don&#8217;t think a ton more money would make me as happy as a ton more of time &#8211; especially as our babies continues to grow &#8211; and it would be nice to secure a daddy for them for at least another 15 years :) And with any luck I&#8217;d be able to turn that extra time into more money anyways.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How about you?
