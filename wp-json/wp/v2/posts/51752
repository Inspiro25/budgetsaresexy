Haha&#8230; The full circle of financial life! And here to amaze us with all his artsy wizardry, is Michael Bonard &#8211; founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/Money-Rings.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Money-Rings.com<\/a> who shows us how to make rings out of coins.

But I had never worked with small metals before.<\/p>\n<p>After years at a dead end job where my artistic abilities were undermined, I eventually became frustrated enough to actively go searching for more creative ways to make money. I thought about being a production glassblower focusing on ornaments, to starting to make my own chocolate where I had a great idea for custom molds they would be poured into, to even blown glass clocks! \u00a0I wasn\u2019t giving up.<\/p>\n<p><b>Then one day I attempted to make a ring out of a penny just to see if it would work.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t look pretty, but it definitely worked! And once I found out it wasn\u2019t illegal*, I started planning my exit strategy and eventually quit my 9-5 within a year to focus exclusively on making rings and jewelry out of money. Which I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m now doing full-time.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Make Rings Out of Coins<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51768\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/hand-made-coin-rings.jpg\" alt=\"hand made coin rings\" width=\"478\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/hand-made-coin-rings.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/hand-made-coin-rings-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are the abbreviated step to give you an idea.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What you need: space, tools, time and lots of patience. \u00a0Oh \u2013 and the best part \u2013 spare change!

It&#8217;s at this point you&#8217;re able to change the shape of the metal.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have you ever used aluminum foil? \u00a0Well, it&#8217;s actually made from one solid ingot that&#8217;s run through a heated press over and over and over again until it&#8217;s stretched into one humongous roll. Pretty wild.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51760\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coin-mallet-process.jpg\" alt=\"coin mallet process\" width=\"603\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coin-mallet-process.jpg 700w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coin-mallet-process-300x77.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To stretch the coin into a ring, the least expensive way to do it (and how I started out myself) was with a ring mandrel and a rawhide or plastic mallet (harder mallets will mark the coin).<\/p>\n<h3>Strike the coin repeatedly and as evenly as possible<\/h3>\n<p>Once it stretches a couple sizes, reheat the coin and repeat until you get the desired size.\u00a0 Then, make sure to flip the coin around and hammer the walls in so the now top ridges are equal with the bottom.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51763\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coin-ring-process.jpg\" alt=\"coin ring process\" width=\"600\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coin-ring-process.jpg 708w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coin-ring-process-300x106.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At this point the cut part of the metal will still be rough, so you&#8217;ll then need to sand and bevel the edges so they&#8217;re smoother. Next, use a steel wool or Brillo pad to sand all the <em>relief<\/em> parts of the coin to bring out the shine and show off the lettering\/designs of the coin.<\/p>\n<h3>You now have a ring you can wear, give away or sell!<\/h3>\n<p>And it&#8217;s at this point you determine how much more energy and money you want to pour into the trade, or if you&#8217;re okay just doing it as a fun hobby for family and friends. It takes a bit of work to produce a single coin, but there are ways of speeding up the process the more you practice and research, and of course the more you drop on fancier tools too ;)<\/p>\n<p>You also get better results in the end:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-51766\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/state-quarter-rings.jpg\" alt=\"state quarter rings\" width=\"621\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/state-quarter-rings.jpg 621w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/state-quarter-rings-300x117.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(The coins on the left are from the process we just went over, and the one on the right is with my current process after years (and literally 1,000+ hours) of working on my craft)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>How Much Can You Earn Making Jewelry Out of Coins?<\/h2>\n<p>Okay \u2013 Let\u2019s break down the numbers. \u00a0The popular state quarter ring sells anywhere from $20-$50+, depending on the quality of it and which person\/retailer is selling it.\u00a0 The amount of profit you take away will depend on how productive and inventive you can be with the process, but you&#8217;re looking at anywhere from <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$20-$100+ an hour<\/strong><\/span>, less the cost of resources and tools.<\/p>\n<p>I built my business for wholesale when I started, but knew that I needed 4 revenue streams and one of those streams was retail through fairs and festivals. It is something that is definitely a hustle and a ton of work setting up and tearing down, but a typical 2 day festival was\/is equivalent to a month at my old job. And sometimes it just takes one day!<\/p>\n<p>Though the retail costs usually go up with the denomination of the coin, especially if it is made of silver, I still let the market (you) ultimately dictate the final price. I\u2019ve created over 100 designs made from coins, many of which never made it to market because they ended up not working out visually or financially. It can get tough turning a hobby into a business, but you really have to hustle hard if you want it to work.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of downsides&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>The Cons to This Gig<\/h2>\n<p>This goes for any business owner, but the biggies were having to sacrifice my hobbies, my art and my nights and weekends to make this work full-time. \u00a0Gary Vaynerchuk explains it well with his \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NK3sEX5Z35M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stop binge watching house of cards<\/a>\u201d explanation<\/p>\n<p>You can also seriously injure yourself! \u00a0I\u2019ve had may fair share of cuts and burns over the years, but on one special occasion I almost chopped off my thumb while making earring displays with my table saw. Luckily my \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xDF6NEoJNiE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Assistant<\/a>\u201d was sleeping in my studio the whole time while I drove to the hospital to get stitched up. \u00a0I was unable to use my thumb for 2 weeks, and had to adapt fast to continue production for a festival the next week.<\/p>\n<p>Another con: with sites like Pinterest, there is a lot of copyright violations going on. People start to think they can copy designs and sell it under their own name. Once you start shaping the metal into different and unique designs though, the creator of that design is the owner of it. I&#8217;ve had problems on <a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/moneyrings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my Instagram page<\/a> where people would start to (try to) copy my earring designs and then use the same titles and copy descriptions of the products! Definitely a headache, and definitely a con to the business.<\/p>\n<h3>Other potential down sides:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you end up developing methods similar to mine and do a lot of polishing, you can say goodbye to your hand modeling days&#8230;. Your nails are shot.<\/li>\n<li>This doesn\u2019t go for everybody, but I consistently created fine art for 12 years and making jewelry from coins is heavily frowned upon within the community. So be prepared to be shunned which can really suck big time.<\/li>\n<li>And lastly, if you&#8217;re <a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a coin collector<\/a> (sorry J. Money!), it may be tough for you to punch a hole through such beautiful coins.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>How You Can Get Started<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Honestly, the best thing you can do is just that &#8211; get started! Try it out at home, and then follow it up with some good old fashion researching.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, one night I remember working late in my studio and deciding to take a coffee break. When I jumped onto Youtube there was a trending video titled (if you can believe it) \u201cHow to Make a Ring out of a Quarter!\u201d My stomach dropped! Partly because the process was very counter-productive, but also because I knew everyone would now want to start making quarter rings themselves to sell everywhere. I remember pulling two all-nighters that week to bump up my product designs to stay on top of my game.<\/p>\n<p>So what I\u2019m saying is that you don\u2019t have to spend the countless hours of trial and error and coming up with new processes necessarily, because there&#8217;s a community out there you can already start learning from. I recommend trying out a number of processes as there are so many ways to get from point A to B in this industry. And maybe you will come up with an even better way!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Final Thoughts About How to Make Rings Out of Coins<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Though I never became the full-time artist I wanted to be, I have found a way to create things for a living and I&#8217;m having a blast expanding my jewelry line. I\u2019ve put aside my other bodies of work to focus on Money-Rings exclusively, and I\u2019m truly grateful for my current situation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Give it a shot!

I get that question so many times at big festivals that I have auto-response answers, some of which are pretty funny&#8230; So if you ever see me at a festival, ask that question and see which one you get :) But yes, the real answer is that it is illegal to deface currency <em>if your intent is to fraud the government<\/em>. An example would be turning a $5 bill into a $50 bill or a nickel into a quarter and passing it off. \u00a0Another example is shaving metal off of a coin to profit from the shavings, and then spending the shaved coin. \u00a0Ever wonder why ridges exist on coins?<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Michael Bonardi <\/strong>has been crafting coins into unique jewelry for over four years.
