Penny<\/strong>.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>If I had\u00a0hair, I&#8217;d pull it out.<\/strong> In\u00a0fistfuls. Until all that&#8217;s left  is a pink hue and a snow-white scalp freckled with black dots where hair  used to be. Mark my words, Sexy readers,\u00a0a recent\u00a0experience with the  <a href=\"http:\/\/bankofamerica.com\">bastardly Bank of America<\/a> made me want to pull\u00a0whatever hair I have left out and donate it to the George Costanzas of the world (it&#8217;s a tax ride-off!).<\/p>\n<p>I wonder: Have you ever had to deal with a bank  so devilish, so insanely unprofessional, it made you want to\u00a0scream  something fierce? Have you every been passed around like a dirty bong at  a fraternity party? I have, and it sucks.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>My point: Bank of America blows.<\/strong><\/span> If you&#8217;re a member or an employee of this bank, I offer no leniency. I do, however, seek reparations in the form of apologies and Tootsie Rolls. Before I digress about the pricelessness of customer service and the extreme ineptitude of  ignorant people,\u00a0you should know that I&#8217;m a mild-mannered person.  Almost Magoo-like. I can count on one hand how many times I&#8217;ve been  irate at customer service representatives, and it&#8217;s a very small  hand.\u00a0That said,\u00a0I bring you a barrel full of lessons learned. Because I heart bullet points, and they&#8217;re hella easy to follow, here&#8217;s a brief narrative of my recent battle with Bank of America:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I find out I can refinance my home mortgage. Per some <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/operation-refinance-denied-making-home-affordable\/\">Obama  affordable-housing plan<\/a>, the condo I bought for $149,900 in 2007 (the  one that&#8217;s now worth $115,000 at best) makes the grade. Barely. And they  say Democrats serve no purpose!<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m assigned a loan manager with thirteen vowels in her last name. Reminds me of that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Indian guy<\/span> from &#8220;Office Space.&#8221; Naga, naga, not\u00a0gonna work here anymore! Loan  officer tells me closing costs will be roughly $3,500. It negates what  I&#8217;ve paid off since 2007, but screw it &#8230; I&#8217;m saving $107 a month and  going from 7.25% interest to 5.85% on a 30-year, fixed rate. Short-term  pain for long-term gain. (That&#8217;s what she said).<\/li>\n<li>Haven&#8217;t heard from my loan officer in weeks, so I e-mail\/call\/send a  carrier pigeon for an update. Nothing. Maybe she&#8217;s getting married?<\/li>\n<li>I finally reach her. &#8220;Weird,&#8221; she says, a month and a half later.  &#8220;We&#8217;re not hearing back from your title company. Want me to use ours?&#8221;  <strong>Unbelievable.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Weeks go by. I call\/e-mail\/hand her a folded note in fifth period  asking: Will you refinance me? Circle one: Yes, No, Maybe. No answer.  Maybe she&#8217;s giving birth?<\/li>\n<li>I finally get a response. I&#8217;m refinancing on October 7th. I&#8217;m told I  don&#8217;t have to pay October or November&#8217;s mortgage payments. Two months?  Nice surprise!<\/li>\n<li>In late September, I tell Bank of America to suspend my automatic-withdrawal payments, as I don&#8217;t have to make the next two. Done.<\/li>\n<li>Not done.\u00a0Bank of America\u00a0debits  $863.33 from my BB&amp;T account and makes the October payment. I call  and complain, and they say they&#8217;ll refund it with proof. I got yer  proof.<\/li>\n<li>October 7th: Sign here, dot here, X here, etc. Wait a tick &#8230;  what&#8217;s this? My closing costs are almost $2,000 more than anticipated?  Egad!<\/li>\n<li><strong>My loan officer, she of many vowels,\u00a0tells  me it&#8217;s expected, that these things happen.<\/strong> I ask about the random cost  on line 1008. &#8220;Oops, that&#8217;s on the wrong line,&#8221; she says.\u00a0What should  have been a deduction was an addition. Mother trucker.<\/li>\n<li>My loan officer answers my many questions, only she&#8217;s 83% wrong. I&#8217;m forwarded to a new loan officer.<\/li>\n<li>The new loan officer seems competent, has few vowels. She fixes  everything, tells me the truth and lines up the title. &#8220;What about the  $863.33 being credited back to my account? Since it&#8217;s already been  applied to the old loan I&#8217;m refinancing, don&#8217;t you have to do entirely  new paperwork?&#8221; I ask. No,\u00a0she doesn&#8217;t.<\/li>\n<li>Still no response from Bank of America&#8217;s  finance department. Where&#8217;s my money? &#8220;We can&#8217;t credit your account,  sorry.&#8221; But you erroneously took it out! They tell me there&#8217;s nothing  they can do about the withdrawal. It&#8217;s already been applied to the old  loan and the papers are drawn up. I&#8217;m &#8220;out&#8221; $863.33, which I was going  to put in my emergency fund. Le sigh.<\/li>\n<li>I\u00a0sign the new title reflecting the 1008 line change and say whatevs, let&#8217;s get this thing over with.<\/li>\n<li>The\u00a0very same day, in my car ride home, I&#8217;m listening to Yanni and dreaming about bath beads. No more worries! But wait &#8230; Bank of America  calls and tells me they CAN credit the\u00a0money back to my account.  Seriously? After I signed the forms and submitted the title? I quickly  call my loan officer and again ask if this means the forms need to be  redone. They don&#8217;t, she says.<\/li>\n<li>They do. After talking to six employees for three hours, getting  transferred back and forth between departments and doing the legwork my  loan officer is neglecting to do (&#8220;I have\u00a0a lot of  customers, you know.&#8221;), I finally get some answers. If they credit the  $863.33 back to my account, I won&#8217;t get it for a week. Thus,\u00a0I risk  refinancing in time and I may not get November&#8217;s mortgage payment  for\u00a0&#8220;free.&#8221; Oh, and Bank of America is going to put a freeze on all foreclosures and refinances any day now. Gotta bite the bullet and push forward.<\/li>\n<li>I\u00a0didn&#8217;t want them making more mistakes, so I finalize the loan and tell them to put this ugly baby to bed. Burn in hell, Bank of America.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The point of this story is not to paint Bank of America  as the financial bogeyman (they are),<\/strong> <strong>or say that refinancing is  terrifically hard (it&#8217;s like The Situation&#8217;s abs).<\/strong> Rather, it&#8217;s to  stress the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/06\/why-i-work-in-customer-service\/\">importance of customer service<\/a>,\u00a0<em>especially<\/em> when it comes to something as important as refinancing a mortgage. When  it comes to home loans and real estate, I&#8217;m a young chickadee, cute and  fluffy and desperate to suckle from the teet of  wisdom. Nurture me, big banks! Walk me through the process. This is a  big step in my life, so hold my hand. I shouldn&#8217;t be the one helping <em>you <\/em>figure out how to resolve <em>your <\/em>mistakes. You want me as a customer? Earn it.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, this entire experience was volcanic: Several  mistakes on my title, an egregious error on the financial side, no  accountability, a lack of communication between Bank of America departments, and worst of  all &#8230; people ignoring me when all I needed were answers to push  forward, close the deal, buy a pistachio ice cream cone in celebration.  What&#8217;s worse, I know there&#8217;s going to be countless others who have to  endure the exact same thing.<\/p>\n<p>I guess what they say about global  business\u00a0is true: Customer service is the lubrication that makes  business run. In my case, I got screwed without lube, and I can still  feel the pain. Now I know better. Now I&#8217;ve learned a few important  things I&#8217;ll apply to future financial situations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;ll never do business with Bank of America again.<\/strong> Period.<\/li>\n<li>Always, always stand up for yourself. It&#8217;s your money, it&#8217;s your  life. If you let people walk all over you and your finances, you deserve  it.<\/li>\n<li>Leverage management. After being bounced around like a ping-pong  ball for hours between departments, I contacted management and got real  answers.<\/li>\n<li>Never underestimate the power of a complaint. Customer retention is key in any business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never plan for money until you have it;<\/strong> line things up, sure, but never bank on getting money until you have it in your hands.<\/li>\n<li>Never assume. Always ask questions if you&#8217;re unsure. Your mistakes will cost you, and no one else. Ask, and ask often.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In today&#8217;s turbulent economy, people need all the help they can  get, financially and otherwise. Even though the proverbial financial  waters are rough right now, throwing a lifeline out to folks and  addressing their needs is tantamount to getting this economy (and\u00a0one  another) back on its feet.<strong> I believe customer service is the foundation  on which this economy should be rebuilt, and it all starts with  businesses like Bank of America.<\/strong> I hope they get their\u00a0stuff together, because I&#8217;m hearing a lot people  express similar complaints.<\/p>\n<p>As for my situation, it sucks that $863.33  made me lose what&#8217;s left of my hair, but I consider myself blessed. Refinancing when I&#8217;m underwater, saving $30,000 + interest over the life of  the loan and knocking my interest rate down significantly for a few  grand rolled back into the loan ain&#8217;t bad. And hey, at least I have my  back hair!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<strong><em>T.

He says there&#8217;s really zero chance I&#8217;ll get the $863 back, considering it was applied to my loan and brought my loan down before refinancing.
