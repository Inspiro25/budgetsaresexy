Hah!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But back to the moving situation. <\/strong><strong>When I say he wanted us gone ASAP, he meant in 10 days<\/strong> &#8211; of which 6 were already eaten up by weekends &amp; Thanksgiving break.\u00a0 So really, I had 4 days to figure out a way to move allllll our stuff, and to make sure we had some movers that were GOOD.\u00a0 And to my boss, good = fast, efficient, FRIENDLY (that was my addition) and most importantly &#8211; cheap.\u00a0 Of course, because we&#8217;re living in perfect land!!!\u00a0 Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So in 4 days we had to be packed, moved, and then re-setup again with totally working internet &amp; phones &amp; everything else that comes into play with changing locations.\u00a0 <strong>I won&#8217;t get into all the utility problems, but I will say I absolutely HATE Verizon with a passion.<\/strong> Even more so than <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/10\/how-bank-of-america-made-me-bald\/\">Bank of America<\/a> if you can imagine that! :)\u00a0 I honestly think Verizon pushes away business on purpose &#8211; I have never seen so many LARGE mistakes pulled by a company like that in quite some time.\u00a0 They should seriously win an award! Luckily my co-worker was in charge of most of this stuff, which left me focused on the physical move.\u00a0 And finding a (good) company that can do it on such fast notice!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>This is where Yelp comes in.<\/strong><\/span> I hadn&#8217;t the slightest clue as to how to find decent movers, and every time I googled it there was <a href=\"http:\/\/yelp.com\">Yelp<\/a> right at the top!\u00a0 I honestly couldn&#8217;t search around w\/out it creeping up on me ;)\u00a0 But for once that&#8217;s exactly what I needed. \u00a0 I wanted the top 10 movers people recommended in the area so I could literally call them, one by one, until we totally exhausted the list &amp; I found our winner.\u00a0 And that alone took 3 of my 4 days :)<\/p>\n<p>But what was incredible about this whole thing, was how RIGHT Yelp was.\u00a0 As someone who&#8217;s NEVER used them before ever (I know, what century am I living in??) I was sooooo freakin&#8217; happy I came across them.\u00a0 And no &#8211; this is not an ad.\u00a0 They rocked this $hit out! Seriously, I wasn&#8217;t expecting it at all. I always thought fakers were rating things high in order to push their own companies up there to the top.\u00a0 And maybe there&#8217;s some truth to that, I really don&#8217;t know, BUT what I can say is that I was simply amazed at what people were saying about all these moving companies.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FIRST &#8211; Who says great stuff about movers??<\/strong> It&#8217;s not supposed to be &#8220;easy!&#8221; haha..<\/li>\n<li><strong>SECOND &#8211; How did all the mom &amp; pop shops fill the majority of the top-rated spots?!<\/strong> That&#8217;s incredible.\u00a0 I honestly didn&#8217;t recognize one name in the top 6 or 7 spots on this thing &#8211; they were all smaller outfits who just really KILL at customer service and promptness.\u00a0 I probably called 7 small guys and 3 big guys, and every single one of the smaller shops either answered right away or called me back within the hour.\u00a0 THE HOUR!\u00a0 The larger ones?\u00a0 1 called back within 24 hours (and then failed to follow up with me AT ALL), and the other 2 were so incredibly expensive that I couldn&#8217;t even believe anyone would use them.\u00a0 Their customers must not use Yelp :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But you want to know what I loved the best about this whole learning experience? That all these smaller companies <em><strong>watched each others&#8217; backs<\/strong><\/em>.\u00a0 Every single one of them recommended that I talk with 1 or 2 of the others I had found on that list &#8211; no lie.\u00a0 Some even flat out said they weren&#8217;t the best fit for us!\u00a0 Imagine that?\u00a0 Now I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some sort of referral system they&#8217;ve all put in place and what not, but still &#8211; that&#8217;s a total win-win for both customer AND company.\u00a0 And the group we ended up going with was nothing short of exceptional.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>In the end, everything worked out great.<\/strong><\/span> So thank you, <a href=\"http:\/\/yelp.com\">Yelp<\/a>!\u00a0 You saved me stress, you saved me money (to the tune of $2,000), and more importantly &#8211; you saved my ass.\u00a0 I will never doubt you again, new friends, and I look forward to our next adventure :)<\/p>\n<p><em>(Boxes by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/karensmonsters\/\">karensmonsters<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know the times when your boss makes you do something you REALLY don&#8217;t want to do?
