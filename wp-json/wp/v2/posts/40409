Proof again that it all adds up! And that you&#8217;re never too young, or old, to get started&#8230;]<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>At age 21 I graduated college with $100,000 sitting in the bank. <\/strong>Scratch that &#8211; most of it was invested elsewhere&#8230; but you get the point.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not writing this post because I think I&#8217;m cool (beatboxing skills, aside ;)). I didn&#8217;t earn $100k before even getting a &#8220;real job&#8221; because I&#8217;m special &#8211; I was just <em>intentional<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>What I don&#8217;t get is most people wait until a\u00a0<strong><em>quarter of their life<\/em>\u00a0<\/strong>is gone before they start worrying about money. I didn&#8217;t wait until I was halfway through my 20&#8217;s and deep in student and consumer debt to start paying attention to my finances. I blog to help other people create wealth early in life.<\/p>\n<h2>How Did I Get Here?<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I worked, saved, and invested of course!\u00a0 How else does one create wealth? I started working early and often. So early that I used to measure my money in the amount of Skittles packets it could buy!<\/p>\n<p>I had 3 requirements for my jobs and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">side hustles<\/a>: must be fun, pay well, and look snazzy on my resume. Tick, tick, tick and I was\u00a0<em>almost<\/em>\u00a0always eager to get out of bed! Whenever I worked borderline illegally long hours, I did so because I wanted to. I began investing the money right away at age 10.<\/p>\n<p>I had so few expenses as a kid. I didn&#8217;t need to work or invest. Heck, birthday money would cover any &#8216;expenses&#8217; I accrued. The reason I worked was because I knew life outside my parents\u2019\u00a0house\u00a0came with expenses. I\u00a0wanted to be ready. Why fall out of the nest when you can soar?<\/p>\n<h2>Everyday I&#8217;m Hustlin&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>As I got older, I\u00a0sold a lot of stuff on eBay, forums, and Craigslist. My stuff, my parents\u2019\u00a0stuff (for a commission), stuff I would flip&#8230; \u00a0clothing, electronics, you name it. I started doing this before I could legally have a PayPal account!\u00a0 I convinced mom to create one using my email. To this day, my PayPal homepage greets me with, &#8216;Hi again, Victoria!&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>I asked my parents to pay me for any crazy odd job they had available. I remember picking dandelions for 5 cents per head. It was great because they grew right back! \u00a0Talk about job security! \u00a0However, they soon told me my position had been eliminated&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>In one of my gutsier moves,<\/strong> I found stuff in the attic, garage, outbuildings that\u00a0mom didn&#8217;t use anymore. I announced a garage sale outside where she could buy back her\u00a0stolen\u00a0forgotten goods.\u00a0 Making money as a kid is way easier than as an adult. To seal the deals, I would include free home delivery.\u00a0 Good thing I was a cute kid.<\/p>\n<p>When I was 14, I found a neighbor who hustled like crazy. He took early retirement from the FDIC to start 3 businesses. I wanted in on the excitement. I knew he likely needed help. With a lot of encouragement from mom, I created a resume and gave the guy a call. I learned a lot about how to win at life from that man <em>and<\/em> he paid me! He even let me live in his investment house for free after college.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fast and Furious Side Hustle<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In high school, I started a pawn shop out of my high school shop class. Kids who &#8216;needed&#8217; money for whatever silly reason would sell their stuff to me. I had cash. Business eventually got so good I started making them do the market research to prove I could resell their stuff online for at least a 50% profit before we would make a deal. Easy and very fun! The only downside was how mad mom would get when every few days I filled the living room with packing peanuts and car parts&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Work and Pay Should Correlate<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In college, I would schmooze alums to donate money to my school. They would give to our\u00a0scholarship\/ campus renovation\/student organization programs. My target age group was 40-60-year-old ladies. We had a great time chatting and I made my school a lot of money &#8211; which helped keep tuition down.<\/p>\n<p>It felt like being self-employed. I earned commission in this role. Seeing my efforts directly correlate with my earnings has always been motivating to me. I worked every night I could. Again &#8211; <em>having fun<\/em> while working. I really miss talking with some of those ladies!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Cashing Checks and Fighter Jets<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I had some pretty awesome internships. One was a financial advising firm (go figure) and the other with the U.S. Strategic Command (I think it&#8217;s okay to tell you about this?).<\/p>\n<p>Working for the financial firm was okay but honestly, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vanguard<\/a> &gt; traditional financial\u00a0salespeople &#8211; I mean &#8211; advisors.<\/p>\n<p>Working on an Air Force Base gave me a shot of adrenaline each time I pulled through the gates. Armed soldiers, jets ready to scramble, security clearances, top brass&#8230; oh yeah. That&#8217;s the stuff. Once, while going to a base picnic, we crossed a runway and had a pair of F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets come in for landing right above our car. This job was fun, paid well, and boosted my resume!<\/p>\n<h2>Ways I Saved<\/h2>\n<p>My biggest purchase prior to my car at age 16 was a $40 stereo I bought from my cousin. \u00a0Honestly, I was sweatin&#8217; bullets after the purchase because I felt like I wasted a mountain of cash. \u00a0Good thing I still use that sucker today!<\/p>\n<p>Most kids buy all sorts of stuff on a whim. \u00a0But our hobbies and passions change fast as a kid. \u00a0Buying a lot of stuff is pretty silly.\u00a0 I always thought to myself, if I want it bad enough, I can wait for my birthday or Christmas. \u00a0Cap gun obsession followed by NERF\u00a0obsession followed by airsoft obsession followed by paintball obsession&#8230;\u00a0 Makes me tired just typing out all the ways I could have piddled away my $100k! Seriously!<\/p>\n<p>Man, I could go on and on about what I did to save&#8230; Maybe J. Money will let me guest post again. <em>Hint, hint, comment below.\u00a0<\/em>:)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Paying for College<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I hustled through college in 3.5 years (not impressive, anyone can get a bachelor&#8217;s degree in 3 full-time years).\u00a0 I took summer classes to keep the costs down &#8211; apparently getting the same education in the summer is 80% cheaper!\u00a0 I used some tricks to get A&#8217;s from professors almost no matter what &#8211; that freed up my time for earning money and learning about investing.\u00a0 Retaking classes was definitely never an option. \u00a0It was a private school which gave me a good education. I hacked my way through college in a million different ways.\u00a0 That\u2019s another post for another day.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Back to Present Day<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As I write this, I&#8217;m 24-years-old still hustling to earn, save, and invest my way to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at\/\">financial freedom<\/a>.\u00a0 My current savings rate is 85%.\u00a0 I should quite easily become FI by 30.\u00a0 But all in all I&#8217;m pretty normal.\u00a0 My views align pretty closely with J. Money&#8217;s (is that normal???). \u00a0Sometimes I want to buy something useless but I stop myself. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/anyone-can-buy-that\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I would rather buy freedom<\/a> than pointless stuff.<\/p>\n<p>That initial $100,000 was not that difficult to achieve. \u00a0Most people just don&#8217;t bother putting in the effort.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to my early efforts, I have huge head start in life.<\/strong> \u00a0Compound interest should not be underestimated. That $100k will stay in my investment account forever &#8211; helping sustain my eventual life of freedom. \u00a0My portfolio is similar to a restaurant that frames their first earned dollar bill.\u00a0 But by age 67, it&#8217;ll look more like a $3.2 million dollar bill!<\/p>\n<p>Now what&#8217;s stopping YOU from hustling your a$$ off?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Will Lipovsky<\/strong> writes about money at FirstQuarterFinance.com, where he helps others create lifelong wealth ASAP.
