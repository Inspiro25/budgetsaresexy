It&#8217;s official &#8211; our shower area has black mold in it!<\/strong> Just when we think we&#8217;re in the clear for a bit, something else in this house jacks up. Reason #3,001 to set aside money for stupid house stuff! Arghhh&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But as much as I&#8217;d love to blame the previous homeowners on this one, I really can&#8217;t put it ALL on them&#8230; Yes, they did a shoddy job re-tiling the tub and grouting the whole dang thing, but we weren&#8217;t that much better in keeping it in tip-top shape either.\u00a0 So naturally with a concoction like that you&#8217;re bound to come across a mess or two. Or in this case, mold :( So it&#8217;s a good thing the Mrs. got on it!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s actually pretty funny &#8211; it seems the pregnancy has completely increased all levels of awareness within her :)<\/strong> Like, some new super power or something &#8211; mixed in with an unhealthy obsession of obsessing! haha&#8230; So every time something gets in her brain now, she can&#8217;t stop thinking and worrying about it until we physically DO something about it. Like with the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/04\/water-heater-problems\/\">water heater<\/a> the other week (double arghhhh). And continually freaking herself out with 1,001 worries about our baby, and what could potentially happen to him too. (That part I&#8217;m not too thrilled about &#8211; cuz then it freaks ME out!). Overall it&#8217;s been a pretty interesting thing to watch though. Some people have cravings for weird food or drinks, and others can smell a problem a mile away :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which leads us into the &#8220;solving&#8221; of this new moldy bathroom situation.<\/strong> And how fast, exactly, we can make it happen &#8211; since the last thing we want is our baby bump breathing all that nastiness in!\u00a0 I never personally thought it was a really *that* bad, but apparently people can die from it :(\u00a0 Including one of my favorite actresses from back in the day, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/thr-esq\/brittany-murphy-death-mold-275478\">Britney Murphy<\/a>!\u00a0 So sad.<\/p>\n<p>So we started the process of finding a good handyman in our area &#8211; once again &#8211; and after a couple of hours of superb research, the Mrs. found a good one to hit up and so we did.\u00a0 And we figured we might as well ask about upgrades to it as well, since they&#8217;re already gonna have to start gutting stuff anyways, right? :) (Right).<\/p>\n<p>These are what our options looked like by the end of our researching\/meeting with him:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do only the necessary work <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">($1,100)<\/span>.<\/strong>\u00a0 This includes all demo work (the mold is in our bathroom ledge, not the walls), treating and clearing out all mold, re-building of this same ledge, re-tiling it all, and then fixing all other crap tiling\/grouting issues around the rest of the tub &#8211; all compliments of the previous owner. Oh, and we&#8217;d need to pick up a few extra things outside of this too, like replacement tiles and new shower unit stuff &#8211; as those are also moldy :(<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do necessary work AND re-tile entire shower <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">($1,800)<\/span>.<\/strong>\u00a0 This includes everything in option #1, but also going in and re-doing the entire walls with our own hand-picked prettier ones. And way more modern ones at that &#8211; which should def. help sexy up the house for a later selling of it too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Upgrade again and put in a 2nd shower head! <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">($3,000)<\/span>.<\/strong>\u00a0 This one we threw in just to see what would happen. We obviously don&#8217;t *need* another one, but I&#8217;d be lying if I said we wouldn&#8217;t enjoy the hell out of it ;) How awesome would this be??<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All in all it wasn&#8217;t *as* expensive as I honestly thought it would all be, but it&#8217;s still a lot more than $0.00 which is where it was at until <em>Super Wife<\/em> picked up the scent ;) And either way, we HAVE to at least do option #1 and get rid of that mold anyways- ESP with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/12\/im-gonna-be-a-daddy\/\">the baby<\/a> on its way, so def. better to do sooner than later here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>After a lot of thinking and going back and forth with all the pros and cons, etc, we decided to run with the middle ground.\u00a0<\/strong> It&#8217;s no fun at all dishing out $1,100 for pretty much the EXACT same thing we already have right now (except with less mold), so we might as well spend a little more and be EXCITED about it.\u00a0 Get new tiles and make it a &#8220;thing&#8221; ya know? That way not only could we enjoy it all going forward and get it all done at one time (rather than upgrading later at a different point), but it would also have major re-sell value too.\u00a0 As long as we don&#8217;t do anything crazy like pimp it out and scare off the conservatives or something ;)\u00a0 But the Mrs. wouldn&#8217;t let me even if I tried, haha&#8230;. (how bad ass would it be to put &#8220;J. Money&#8221; in mosaic tiles though?? Or dollar signs all over??)<\/p>\n<p>Also, while it kills me yet <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/04\/water-heater-problems\/\">AGAIN<\/a> to pull from our cash savings, I did promise Super Wife that we could allot some of it towards <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/update-mortgage-payoff-plan\/\">house improvements<\/a>.\u00a0 I just didn&#8217;t want to do that now before the baby comes out and what not&#8230;\u00a0 but what are you gonna do?\u00a0 Every day can be an adventure with home ownership so you might as well sneak in some perks while you can and not drive yourself crazy.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a good reminder too to be blessed with the amount of money we&#8217;ve been able to save up over the past few years as well&#8230; it would have been a nightmare had we been caught 5 years ago!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Any one else have anything break since I last asked you 2 weeks ago? ;)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> When it&#8217;s done I&#8217;ll show pictures!!!!\u00a0 At least I get some interesting blog posts outta it, eh?<\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/aka_kath\/\">aka Kath<\/a>.
