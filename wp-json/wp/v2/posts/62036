Doesn&#8217;t matter if the item is a dollar or ten &#8211; they always manage to walk away with something without cracking their piggy banks!<\/p>\n<p>Which of course is<em> financially<\/em> great and super sweet of the sellers, but after the first few weekends I realized a disturbing trend was occurring&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our house was getting bombarded by junk!!<\/strong> Because anytime something is &#8220;free&#8221; all decision-making goes out the window and you grab it because IT&#8217;S FREE!! Whether you actually truly need it or not! I literally saw my oldest bargain down a guy from $2.00 to a nickel last weekend (yes &#8211; an actual nickel!!) and because it wasn&#8217;t <em>free<\/em> my kid turned it down and walked away&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And let me tell you something&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>IF YOU CAN&#8217;T SPEND A NICKEL ON SOMETHING, YOU DON&#8217;T NEED IT!!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Haha&#8230; Which is exactly what prompted this rule and stopped the onslaught of junk ;) Now any time someone offers an item for free &#8211; whether provoked or not &#8211; my kids are to say &#8220;thank you, but I&#8217;d like to give you a little for it instead&#8221;, and then they can choose how much. And I $hit you not, for the rest of that morning my oldest didn&#8217;t pick up A SINGLE THING he wanted to spend money on!! Amazing!!<\/p>\n<p>(My kids btw use their own money to buy things at yard sales, except for *books* or other items that help them learn or add value to their lives&#8230; Such as an art easel I recently picked up for them so they can paint &#8220;like real artists&#8221; as they like to say ;))<\/p>\n<h2>Rule #2: For every new item you bring in the home, you must get rid of another<\/h2>\n<p>This one will sound familiar to minimalists out there, but for whatever reason I&#8217;ve always been bad at following this, so of course my kids have been too. But since I was on fire with that Freebie Rule I just enacted, I decided to tack on this one as well and hit them with a 1-2 punch ;) After all, if you don&#8217;t want more stuff in your house, this is a surefire way to make it happen! They can go out and buy 100 new things now if they wanted &#8211; and could afford it &#8211; but if they do they&#8217;re getting rid of 100 other things so nothing *extra* is piling on top anymore!<\/p>\n<p>And similarly to the first rule, this one&#8217;s been working great as well so far. I&#8217;d say my oldest has now gone from bringing home about 5 or 6 items a weekend down to 1-2, while my middle child is still adapting and has maybe dropped from 6-7 things to 4-5. But unlike his brother, he has no problem shelling out his money so that&#8217;s a whole other topic that needs tackling later ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The other thing I love about this rule is that it simultaneously gets rid of the stuff you no longer like or use anymore, and instead replaces it with that which brings you joy! <\/strong>So you&#8217;re constantly increasing the ratio of stuff you <em>appreciate more<\/em> in your home vs that which you don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also finding that the mere act of *searching* for things to get rid of is not only helping us to become more organized (we&#8217;re finding hidden stashes everywhere!), but it&#8217;s also re-uniting my kids with long-lost toys that I&#8217;m now seeing them playing with again&#8230; And when they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s an immediate sign that it should be next to go!<\/p>\n<p>And if you think my kids aren&#8217;t holding ME accountable to these rules too, you&#8217;d be dead wrong ;) I think they actually get more joy out of seeing me scramble around for things to donate than when they bring home something new! Haha.. And I&#8217;m not gonna lie &#8211; it&#8217;s hard sometimes! Especially as someone who&#8217;s been shedding things <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/living-minimalist-lifestyle-is-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for over 9 years now<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>But I&#8217;m sticking to it!<\/strong> And if you&#8217;ve got similar problems in your household, I encourage you to consider testing out one or both of these as well&#8230; We can be just as bad as kids with *wanting everything* and taking freebies left and right (conference swag, anyone?!), but the more we pause for a bit and really ask ourselves if it&#8217;s worth it, the better our wallets and our lifestyle will be.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted with how it sticks!! Only three weeks in but so far so good!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52432\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-money-signature.gif\" alt=\"j. money signature\" width=\"150\" height=\"34\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Morning!!
