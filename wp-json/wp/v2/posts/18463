I haven&#8217;t fired anyone lately?&#8221; (Or, ever, really) but as I read on I quickly understood the reason behind it (besides to grab my attention, of course).<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>J$,<\/p>\n<p>How have you been doing ever since you got <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\">let go from your previous job<\/a>? As for me, I am working on writing my former boss a thank you letter. Yeah, a thank you letter!<\/p>\n<p><strong>After getting fired:<\/strong><br \/>\nI started listening to motivational CDs in the car<br \/>\nMade a vision board<br \/>\nCreated 112 goals (I previously had 0!)<br \/>\nStarted a gratitude journal<br \/>\nStarted using a goals checklist<br \/>\nImproved my attitude in the morning<br \/>\nStarted reading 1 book a month<br \/>\nDecreased TV time<br \/>\nStarted lifting weights again<br \/>\nWent to my first World Series parade<br \/>\nSuccessfully organized me and my wife\u2019s bedroom closet<br \/>\nStarted a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustles-theyre-not-just-about-extra-money\/\">side hustle<\/a><br \/>\nDiscovered my purpose<br \/>\nDoubled my hourly pay rate. Literally doubled it! :)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wow. Now THAT is what you call getting back up and DOING SOMETHING about your situation!<\/strong>\u00a0 I love it.\u00a0 And it really inspired me to not only come up with my own &#8220;thank you&#8221; letter (which I&#8217;ll share in a bit) but also to take a few minutes to actually ALLOW it all to sink in.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been so go-go-go this entire year that I sometimes forget to stop for a second and recall any accomplishments big or small. This email was a nice reminder to do so! (Do you all have that problem too, or are you pretty good at acknowledging all your wins?)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I mustered together:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear jackals,<\/p>\n<p>While you were a mess to deal with the past 3 months of our relationship (my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/01\/its-official-my-ex-employer-is-bananas\/\">last paycheck<\/a> is still in the mail, right?), I must admit I&#8217;ve never been happier without you.\u00a0 You know how you told me that it wasn&#8217;t ME, but you? Well, you coulda just been straight up because it actually WAS me! Yeah I was gonna quit 2 weeks later anyways, but your push out the door quickly solidified my dreams and got me working on it a heckuva lot faster.\u00a0 And for that, I thank you.\u00a0 Without you lighting that fire under my a$$ I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wake up and blog in my underwear (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not doing that now)<\/li>\n<li>Work on as many projects as I want, knowing it all helps the business of ME.<\/li>\n<li>Travel the country <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovedrop.us\/total\">helping people<\/a>, and going to some of the coolest conferences around<\/li>\n<li>Learn to BELIEVE in myself, and what I&#8217;m truly capable of (and what I&#8217;m not)<\/li>\n<li>Learn to believe in OTHERS, even when they like to test you<\/li>\n<li>Understand that life changes quickly, but things will always turn out OKAY if you adapt<\/li>\n<li>That there are more important things than money (*gasp*)<\/li>\n<li>But that money CAN make your life much much better! Especially when you work your ass off earning it&#8230; (it&#8217;s all about that *freedom* baby!)<\/li>\n<li>That when you&#8217;re income gets cut in half, you automagically learn how to get more frugal ;)<\/li>\n<li>And most importantly, that every day is a NEW OPPORTUNITY to go out there and do (or not do) whatever it is you&#8217;re searching for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you hadn&#8217;t sucked it up and fired me, I still might be slaving away helping you earn millions and billions of dollars without even so much as a paycheck (I know, I know, I&#8217;m still <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/won-lawsuit-lost-money\/\">stuck on that<\/a>, aren&#8217;t I?).\u00a0 Wherever you are, though, truly know I&#8217;m forever thankful.\u00a0 I will never forget what you&#8217;ve done for me, and I can&#8217;t wait to never work for you again ;)<\/p>\n<p>Yours truly,<\/p>\n<p>J to the Motha F&#8217;n $<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>I think my email friend would be proud :)<\/strong>\u00a0 All joking aside, though, doors really DO open when others close. But it&#8217;s what happens AFTERWARDS that&#8217;s the most important.\u00a0 Once that dust settles and all your tears dry up (I always allow myself to feel bad for at least a day or two cuz ya gotta let it out!) you then gotta dust yourself off and start looking for ways to take advantage of your situation! Whether it&#8217;s with careers, money, friendships, personal goals, whatever.\u00a0 There are always pros to all sides, it just takes a while sometimes to find them.<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of something a friend once told me &#8211; that &#8220;<strong><em>everything in life is temporary<\/em><\/strong>.&#8221; It&#8217;s kinda freaky if you really think about it, but it&#8217;s also very much TRUE.  How many jobs or houses or even boyfriends\/girlfriends have you gone through since living your lives so far? A lot, right?  And at any point did you ever think &#8220;This is my life. This is how it&#8217;s gonna be.&#8221;?  I know I did.  Every single time. (Though I also have major problems with forecasting far into the future, haha&#8230; I tend to live in the &#8220;now&#8221; except when it comes to money for some reason ;)). The beauty of it all, though, is that it&#8217;s totally up to US on how fast we adapt to these next &#8220;phases&#8221; we&#8217;re given! Those are the times we can really excel, and it&#8217;s a perfect opportunity to prove it to ourselves each and every time &#8211; no matter how scary it is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So if you&#8217;re currently going through one of these changes as we speak, keep on fighting through and make sure to record your journey along the way!<\/strong>  You don&#8217;t have to write up a pretend letter like my boy and I just did or anything (unless you want to &#8211; it&#8217;s really kinda fun!), but at least do your best to reflect on all the awesomeness that&#8217;s come out out of your recent situation so far.  Life will always be throwing curve balls at us, but the longer we can hold onto that mental ammunition, the faster we can better overcome them.<\/p>\n<p>And as always, if there&#8217;s anything I can ever do to help, be sure to let me know! I may not have my total act together, but I sure can lend perspective ;) Have a great Monday, everyone!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>PS:<\/strong> I don&#8217;t actually recommend sending a &#8220;thank you&#8221; letter like these to any of your previous employers.  It&#8217;s fun as hell the think about, but better to not burn any bridges or cause even more trouble for yourself down the road.  Instead, frame it and put it on your desk as a reminder of all the blessings that have come out of the situation!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/27282406@N03\/\">vistamommy<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I got an interesting email last night, and the title of it was, &#8220;Thank you for firing me.&#8221; Haha&#8230; at first, I was like &#8220;What&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/thank-you-for-firing-me-note\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3,45,90,5],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-18463","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blogging","category-career","category-inspiration","category-life"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>A Thank You Note For Firing Me? | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/thank-you-for-firing-me-note\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"A Thank You Note For Firing Me? | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I got an interesting email last night, and the title of it was, &#8220;Thank you for firing me.&#8221; Haha&#8230; at first, I was like &#8220;What...
