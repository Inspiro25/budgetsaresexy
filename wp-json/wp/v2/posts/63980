We lucked out big time finding this lil guy!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Defining All the Estate Planning Terms<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, here are some words that I had to google. You might know this stuff already but I thought I\u2019d share anyway \u2018cause I found it helpful!<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Probate:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a <\/span><b>legal process<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where a court decides how a deceased person&#8217;s estate is going to be administered. If there is a will, the court decides whether the will is valid. If there is no will, the court will follow intestacy laws. &#x1f447;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Intestacy (or \u201cintestate\u201d):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For people who <\/span><b>die without a will<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, each U.S. state has a set of laws that determine who inherits the assets. Usually this is heirs, relatives, descendants, etc., but it can get pretty complex if there are step-children, in-laws, undocumented partnerships and stuff like that. Many people get screwed by sucky state laws, so having a will is &#x1f4af; better!<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Last Will &amp; Testament:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a legal document with the wishes of the deceased person. It lists how they want their property to be divided, and also *who* they want to help manage the distribution.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>\u201cLiving\u201d Will:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is different from a will for when you die&#8230; A living will is for when you are still alive but are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incapacitated <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or can\u2019t handle your affairs. It\u2019s also called an Advanced Healthcare Directive.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Executor:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Person (or people) chosen to carry out the transfer of assets. If there is a will, the executor is usually named already and they follow whatever the will says. If there is no will, the court appoints an executor (usually a relative), and they have to follow whatever the court deems is the correct transfer for the assets.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Beneficiary:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is the person who will receive the benefit of stuff. They can be named inside the will, a trust, or with financial institutions directly designated within an account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Trust:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is kind of like a will, but it\u2019s a more custom and hardcore legal document to pass assets between people. Having a trust can bypass probate, keep transfers private, and can have tax deferral\/avoidance measures. **Note** A trust cannot decide who will be the guardian of children; only a will can name guardians for kids.

There are a couple of ways I can help do this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Listing beneficiaries directly at financial institutions:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If I can pass assets directly to my wife legally through bank accounts, retirement accounts, etc., then she can take ownership without going through probate court. (I\u2019ve already done this for our checking, savings accounts and retirement accounts.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Having joint ownership for assets and properties:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For our duplex, other rentals and joint brokerage account, my wife is already a co-owner. Owning assets jointly means if one of us dies, the other survivor takes ownership and in most cases doesn\u2019t have to go through probate.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Getting a living trust:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Having a trust can avoid probate&#8230; But, ALL assets need to be transferred into the name of the trust for this to be applicable. This seems like a real pain in the ass to do, and might be more applicable if we had kids.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, I think the majority of our assets &#8212; and certainly the most valuable ones &#8212; are going to be easy to transfer without probate if one of us dies. I\u2019m feeling MUCH BETTER knowing all this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**If you haven\u2019t done this already, add it to your to-do list ASAP\u2026 Go through ALL your accounts\/assets and call the bank\/broker\/county to make sure your designated beneficiaries are up to date. Only takes a few minutes, and could save a HUGE amount of time for your loved one if you die.**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64263 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IMG_0320-e1634860003573.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"733\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooper and I took photos like this every couple weeks, but soon enough he couldn\u2019t even fit on my lap anymore. :)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Writing a Will<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I have already thought through the scenario if one of us dies, but <\/span><b>what will happen if BOTH of us die at the same time?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Weird to think about, but this is actually a very possible scenario being that we travel together and do almost everything together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a basic will and testament would help whoever cleans up our financial mess and inherits our stuff. I certainly don\u2019t want to leave it up to the government to decide!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is, writing a will doesn\u2019t seem as hard or as scary as I thought it\u2019d be. In fact, we could even write one ourselves pretty easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found this article helpful: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2017\/06\/24\/should-you-write-your-own-will.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should you write your own will?<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 And also this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/statelaws.findlaw.com\/estate-planning-laws\/wills.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">list of basic will requirements per state<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In California, the basic requirements for having a legal will are:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a) be 18 or older<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b) not be drunk\/on drugs when it\u2019s written<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c) signed by a couple of witnesses<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we could do it ourselves, given the size of our estate, it\u2019s prolly a good idea to have some professional help. Also, it seems that estate planning software covers a handful of other scenarios if disaster strikes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.legalzoom.com\/personal\/estate-planning\/estate-planning-bundle.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LegalZoom<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one I\u2019ve been looking into.

My biggest fear is that in a probate situation they might determine that a will is not valid, in which case I\u2019ll have done all this work for nothing. So having professional help is nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for a trust, I don\u2019t think my wife and I really need one at this point. This might change as our family grows, but for now we\u2019ll just start with getting basic wills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read this if you\u2019re wondering <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/pf\/06\/revocablelivingtrust.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you should set up a trust<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64259 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Cooper-Mirror-scaled-e1634859970377.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figuring out how mirrors work ;)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>You\u2019ll Need to Have Hard Conversations About Inheritance<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welp, here comes the hard part for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was just about to start the LegalZoom process, but then it hit me\u2026 <\/span><b>My wife and I still need to talk about who the heck inherits our mess if we die!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this &#8212; I think &#8212; is the hardest part of anyone\u2019s planning process.
