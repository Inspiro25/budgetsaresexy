Confrontations multiplied with the growing number of people I encountered, combined with the familiar existential question, \u201cWhat do I want to DO with my life?\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Turns out <em>stress<\/em> and I wouldn\u2019t be formally introduced until 2009.<\/h2>\n<p>From the moment I signed my first binding agreement with loan monster Sallie Mae, I\u2019d kept a tally of the ever-increasing number I was borrowing in the back of my mind. Some days it would freak me out, but most of the time I figured I would get a firm grasp on the situation when the time was right &#8212; whatever that means. Again, I had other things to be concerned about \u2013 like, my roommate leaving her bowl of last night\u2019s macaroni and cheese on the counter! Bigger problems, you know? By the time I graduated in 2009, the number tying me to Sallie Mae for the next 30 years was <strong>$200,000<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Some days I couldn\u2019t sleep, I cried, I looked for reassurance, I sought advice \u2013 I always came up empty, as no one really knew what to say. I don\u2019t blame them; how do you tell someone they\u2019ve already made severely poor choices, by the age of 23? The total amount of $200,000 was jaw-dropping and it still amazes me that it didn\u2019t stun me the way it stunned everyone else.<\/p>\n<h2>The Game Plan<\/h2>\n<p>I created a website after about a year of moaning and racking my brain for a solution. This website cut right to the chase: <em>I was asking someone, anyone, to donate to my student loan debt.<\/em> My expectations were low, but I figured if Karyn Bosnak could create <a href=\"http:\/\/savekaryn.com\">savekaryn.com<\/a> and crawl her way out of $20K in credit card debt, I could do the same. After all, wasn\u2019t an education a noble thing on which to spend your (borrowed) money?! It turns out, \u201cnoble\u201d or not, debt is debt.<\/p>\n<p>My best friend and I were thinking of posting fliers around town, in train stations, and at Starbucks to advertise my new no-budget site, aptly called twohundredthou.com. The site explained, in pretty basic terms, who I was, how I got into such a pickle, and included a few predetermined FAQs. However, thinking the fliers route just wouldn\u2019t cut it, I decided to e-mail NY-based blog Gawker, who wrote <a href=\"http:\/\/gawker.com\/5696300\/what-200000-in-student-debt-looks-like\">an article about the site<\/a> instead.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I WAS ON MY FAVORITE NEWS SITE. MADNESS! (It then hit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2010\/11\/22\/kelli-space-two-hundred-thousand-in-debt_n_787074.html\">The Huffington Post<\/a>)<\/p>\n<h2>My Life Now<\/h2>\n<p>I can truthfully say that since that day my life has changed, 100%, 180\u00b0. Not only have I received a total of <em><strong>$10,630 in small donations<\/strong><\/em> from people all around the world, but I\u2019ve received encouragement, support, and advice, as well. I\u2019ve become hugely interested in personal finance, more specifically, paying off my debt: I had a few smaller loans with CitiBank, and have paid them off entirely. The feeling that accompanies making a final payment on a debt is like no other. It\u2019s addicting, really, and I\u2019ve since taken on a bajillion more projects, hours at work, etc., just to keep making those payments and seeing those numbers dwindle. Did I mention strangers gave me $10,630? Because I\u2019m still in awe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019ve also largely changed my day-to-day habits.<\/strong>\u00a0 Well, first and foremost, I read <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\">Budgets are Sexy<\/a> <em>(Yay!!)<\/em> as soon as I wake up each morning ;). I bring my lunch to work and, if I happen to forget, I\u2019ll buy a bagel for $2 or soup from Duane Reade. I still live with my parents, so that completely takes the expense of rent off the table (although I do help them out from time to time). I\u2019ve altered my commute so that my monthly train passes total only $100! I pay less on my commute per month than people living in NYC pay for their subway pass. That makes me feel like I\u2019m cheating the system a little bit, but it feels good! I sell random stuff on eBay as much as I can, and it\u2019s been working so far. I\u2019ve been working 60+ hours per week, due to an additional 20 hours of overtime as my employers are wonderful people willing to help out. In any case, I work a lot. I love working a lot. I want more work!<\/p>\n<h2>Still Stressed, But Productive<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, I\u2019m still <em>stressed out<\/em> on a daily basis, as well. Having numbers so large staring you in the face each day does not make for an easy routine. On my commute, I\u2019m writing, be it e-mails, blog posts, tweets, or ideas. Throughout my work day, I\u2019m rushing to get my work done so I can sneak a peek at a new personal finance post, hoping to find something that might help me or change my perspective. At home I\u2019m busy wishing I was living on my own, as much as I do appreciate my parents for letting me in and helping me cut my costs. It\u2019s never easy to move back home, as I\u2019m sure many of you know, or can imagine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking back, I always wonder what was going through my mind throughout college, as I was just chugging along and <em>accumulating all that debt<\/em>.<\/strong> Sure I thought about it; sometimes I cried and phoned home for something to assuage my anxiety, but still I stayed at Northeastern. I know the fact that I was the first to attend college in my family played a role, as did the idea that the <strong>best<\/strong> school that offered you admission was the one you would attend, no questions asked. These were obviously misconceptions that I had to learn the hard way, as clearly no one else was going to correct me along the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At any rate, that\u2019s all in the past now.<\/strong> Moving forward, I\u2019m trying to make the best possible decisions, financial and otherwise. I want to help others do the same! Thinking about the day that I make my very last student loan payment motivates me to want to do better, want to understand my choices, and want to be a more responsible adult. If twohundredthou and its \u2018supporters\u2019 have taught me anything, it\u2019s that I <em>can<\/em> make it happen, and the more I work, the harder I work, the faster it will come.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>Article by <strong>Kelli Space<\/strong> &#8211; A 2009 graduate of Northeastern University, with $200,000 in student loan debt.
