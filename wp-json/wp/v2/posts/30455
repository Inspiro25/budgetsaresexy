Probably because we weren&#8217;t\u00a0 *acting* on any of these desires and only thinking about them. But now that we&#8217;ve got a handle on baby stuff and the holidays are drawing near (more fun to explore before Christmas than after! :)), it&#8217;s time to get out there and see what&#8217;s up!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will Wilmington be the next place for us?<\/strong> Or maybe Durham, which we&#8217;re gonna try and hit on the way down too? I don&#8217;t know, but we&#8217;re gonna find out more in a few hours :) From my understanding Wilmington&#8217;s like a small Charleston, SC which I absolutely LOVED during <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/04\/bachelor-party-costs-priorities\/\">our bachelor party<\/a> earlier this year &#8211; esp that old-town feel next to the water. And our friends say Durham has grown into a much more younger and &#8220;hipper&#8221; town too over the years, so we&#8217;re really looking forward to seeing what they offer. As much as we can on a quick weekend trip, anyways.<\/p>\n<p>Then we also still have Nashville, Phily, and maybe L.A. on the list too, though something tells me moving across country with a baby won&#8217;t fly so well with the grandparents ;) But we&#8217;re not ruling them out quite yet!<\/p>\n<p><strong>And as far as finances go, it&#8217;ll all cost us a pretty penny after all the trips are completed.<\/strong> Albeit pennies that are worth spending ;) Here&#8217;s how our trip this weekend will probably add up:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$150<\/span> for <del>Car<\/del> SUV Rental.<\/strong> We were initially gonna just take our small Toyota on the road, but after our last fiasco during beach week (where it took like 3 hours to pack!) we decided to upgrade to an SUV instead so we can not only <em>save<\/em> on the wear and tear of our main family car, but ALSO do some good test-driving while we&#8217;re at it too ;) Hopefully with a Jeep Grand Cherokee or similar, which we&#8217;ll get to in a minute&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$200-$250<\/span> for gas.<\/strong> A lot more than the $100-$150 it would have cost w\/ the Toyota, but if you&#8217;re gonna do it right then you gotta get a good feel for how gas would cost us too in the future w\/ an SUV, haha&#8230; so it&#8217;ll be money well spent\/learned ;) And still cheaper than flying in the end.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$100<\/span> for random stuff.<\/strong> I like to have a random category like this because without fail we WILL spend more money than we think on all kinds of stuff. Lunches out, snacks, souvenirs, rental down payments? ;) It&#8217;s also nice to give yourself some slack on vacations like this too and not try and account for every single penny &#8211; one of the benefits of rocking it throughout the rest of the year!<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">$0.00<\/span> for hotel.<\/strong> The best part! A family friend of ours is opening up her home to us so we can save hundreds of dollars on our adventure! Which also prompted us to just &#8220;do it&#8217; as Nike says. Gotta take advantage of the opportunities when they come up! (Also, even cooler is that our friend lives a little ways OUT from Wilmington which means we get to explore another area by default :))<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So a grand total of around <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$500<\/span> for the next 3 days on the road<\/strong>&#8230; Not the best in the world, but also not the worst &#8211; especially since we got those accommodations <del>on the cheap<\/del> free. And we hit 3 birds with one stone too! Adventure, future-home exploring, and test-driving. Or maybe even 4 if you count testing our sanity with a baby on board for 400+ miles, haha&#8230; <em>that<\/em> should be interesting ;)<\/p>\n<p>Two other things here as well:<\/p>\n<h2>1. When we decide to move, wherever it is, we&#8217;re going to rent<\/h2>\n<p>A) Because it will give us time to acclimate and see if we really do enjoy the area we decided to try out, and B) there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m having TWO house payments, bleh. We&#8217;d have to rent out our main house since it&#8217;s still <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/07\/house-loses-value-still-underwater\/\">too underwater to sell<\/a>, so we&#8217;d basically be trading one rental for another and hopefully saving money in the process.<\/p>\n<p>We believe we can get around $1,800 in rent for our house now, so moving anywhere that&#8217;s not DC or NYC or LA should mean we save more ;) Our target rate right now is $1,500\/mo, though we&#8217;d be willing to spend more if it was a nice walking distance to some cafes and shops. Or if it was just an awesome freakin&#8217; place.<\/p>\n<h2>2. I&#8217;m gonna try and work a little magic with our car rental :)<\/h2>\n<p>Anyone who uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.enterprise.com\">Enterprise<\/a> will know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about. Here&#8217;s the trick: When you know what type of car you&#8217;re looking for (like, say, in our case a mid-size SUV like a Cherokee), you make a reservation for the one right below it. Which of course will be much cheaper, especially the longer out you rent the car for. If we were to lock in a mid-size SUV for the next 3 days, it would cost us a little over $200. But if we did the next level down &#8211; the &#8220;intermediate&#8221;aka entry-level size SUV &#8211; it&#8217;s only $150. Saving us 25% right out the gate! And this is where the magic happens. Usually&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons I love Enterprise so much besides the fact they pick you up from your house and they have killer customer service (which reminds me a LOT actually of USAA in that regard), is their <em><strong>constant upgrading for free<\/strong><\/em>. Two out of three times I&#8217;ll get asked if I want to upgrade to the next level as a courtesy &#8211; either because I&#8217;m really really charming (hah!) or &#8216;cuz they do it for everyone as a way to better earn your loyalty ;) Which is fine by me either way!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now normally it doesn&#8217;t matter all too much whether I get that upgrade or not,<\/strong> as it usually just becomes a &#8220;surprise&#8221; perk, but in cases like these when we WANT the bigger car to begin with, it becomes way more important. &#8216;Cuz while in theory you could still upgrade anyways and just pay the $50 or whatever for it like normal people, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily *guarantee* that the car you truly want will be on the lot :( Since, after all, you never made a reservation for it! Not that that actually matters all the time anyways, haha&#8230; remember that hilarious <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A7uvttu8ct0\">Seinfeld episode<\/a>? ;)<\/p>\n<p>All that said though, we gave it a shot and we may or may not be riding in our bigger cheaper car right now, haha&#8230; I&#8217;m actually writing this last night in a rush to get everything done before our trip tomorrow (today?), and I&#8217;m grabbing the car early in the morning :) But I&#8217;ll let y&#8217;all know if it worked out as soon as I&#8217;m back on the computer! Wish us luck!!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Anyone know of other awesome places we should check out?<\/strong> <\/em>Or maybe you want to pitch us YOURS? :) Just think &#8211; we could become neighbors and talk about money face-to-face over coffees! Or beers! Or both! Hah&#8230; If you know of any other car rental tricks too, I&#8217;d love to hear those as well&#8230; Maybe one that works *all* the time and not just when the odds are in your favor ;)<\/p>\n<p><em>Happy Weekend all!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>[<strong>UPDATE:<\/strong> See the results of our trips <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/12\/road-trip-recap-results-of-enterprise-car-rental-trick\/\">here<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>[Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/shoshanah\/\">Shoshanah<\/a>.
