Easy! Just do $27.40 of mindless impulse spending each day for a year.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone falls victim to some type of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/impulse-buys-are-the-devil\/\">impulse buying<\/a>. For me, it\u2019s usually at the brewery right before I pay the bill and leave. I see those fancy branded pint glasses with the brewery logo on it&#8230; Suddenly I convince myself that it\u2019s important to \u201csupport the brewery\u201d (as if paying $9 per beer wasn\u2019t already enough!) so I add a few little mementos to my purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then when I get home I realize I\u2019ve somehow been tricked! My cabinet is already full of ~80 other impulse purchase beer glasses that are just sitting there collecting dust.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do I keep doing this!!? How can I stop?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some surveys show <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dacgroup.com\/blog\/retail-therapy-and-the-power-of-the-impulse-buy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">almost 90%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of us make impulse purchases somewhere, somehow. And not just cheap stuff. Most people admit to buying things in the $100+ range for impulsive buying! Covid seems to have both helped and harmed our spending habits. While some people have become more frugal, others are increasing their online retail therapy. In the USA we are buying more video games, toys, home improvement stuff, and electronics.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What triggers impulse spending?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always thought impulse spending was something you can control internally. But just when you think you\u2019ve got your emotions under control, retailers come out with new marketing tricks, tactics, and methods that beat your internal programming. Those crafty buggers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have to be aware of both our own emotional spending habits as well as watch out for retailer trickery.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Personal triggers for impulse purchases<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><b>Our mood: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impulse spending mostly happens when we are extremely excited (~50%) or bored (~30%). Shopping while intoxicated doesn\u2019t help! &#x1f37b; And shopping while hungry doesn\u2019t help either!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Our age: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The younger you are, the more likely you are to make an unplanned purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cStatus awareness\u201d: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who notice what other people own or are doing tend to buy things quickly to feel included.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Instant gratification: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This happens when you mix <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wants<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">needs<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with \u201cright now!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Subconscious habits: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grabbing a candy bar at the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/dont-go-to-the-grocery-store-hungry\/\">grocery store<\/a> checkout is a common spending habit people do without realizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>E-commerce vs. retail environment: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most impulse shopping used to happen in-person when the shopper was holding the physical product in their hands. However, our online buying is growing so the \u201cthought of owning\u201d is one of our spending triggers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Retail trickery that encourages impulse buying<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><b>Store design or walking path: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physical shops are designed to make you walk near, past, through, under and over high demand items! They\u2019re placed in areas easy to see and pick up. Things placed near the check-out lines are put there to trigger impulse buying. Online stores do this too, via a \u201cvirtual click path\u201d while you are checking out!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Music, fragrance, and sexy signage: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stores will do anything to put you in a happy, relaxed and buying mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Time limits &amp; urgency: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we read \u201cpromo ends in 12 hours\u201d this triggers our fear of missing out on a deal. Also things like \u201cOnly 1 left in stock\u201d makes us want it even more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>30-day money back guarantee: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These offers make us think there\u2019s no harm in buying, because we can easily return it if we decide later we don\u2019t want it. Usually, we are too lazy to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/are-you-good-at-returning-things\/\">return things<\/a>, even if we don\u2019t need them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cFREE shipping\u201d or \u201cBuy one get one FREE\u201d:\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes the word FREE, even if we have to pay for it!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Personalized and targeted ads: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all online advertisements are personalized via your location, internet search history, things you \u201clike,\u201d your demographics and more. It\u2019s scary how much information is collected on you over time and used against you to encourage you to impulse buy. Don&#8217;t even get me started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0\">The Social Dilemma<\/a>!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Tips on how to stop impulse spending (or at least reduce it!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limit social media use! I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve heard of Facebook or Instagram\u2026 They are cool apps you can download on your phone that let you look at ads whenever you feel like it. &#x1f923; But seriously, social media is designed to excite you, then sell you stuff. Limiting usage limits your impulse buying.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Log out of Amazon, or whatever online stores you regularly buy from. When you are forced to enter your Username and PW manually, it becomes less convenient to buy things and gives you time to second guess your purchases. The \u201c1-click-buy\u201d buttons encourage impulsive spending!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carry cash or a debit card instead of credit cards. I know, this seems so inconvenient! But, a bunch of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/credit-cards\/credit-cards-make-you-spend-more\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research proves<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> credit cards make you spend more, and makes unplanned spending less painful. Using cash or a debit card makes you think of the immediate impact on your savings account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use apps and plugins to help limit spending! <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.finder.com\/icebox\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Icebox by Finder.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a Chrome extension that changes the \u201cBuy\u201d button to a \u201cPut it on Ice\u201d button. This gives you time to re-think your purchase and stops impulse shopping. Another cool chrome extension is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/amazon-contemplate\/cepclempoeggcpgbmomhpalbcekpnccl?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Contemplate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that ads a 30-second wait time before you can go through with a purchase. In this wait time you can think about if you really need it!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get a credit card sticker or decal. When you pull out your cc to make a purchase, you\u2019ll be reminded by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/780773250\/joe-exotic-tiger-king-i-am-never-gonna\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe Exotic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/780784428\/terry-credit-card-decal-2-pieces\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terry Crews<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/790241325\/credit-card-skins-if-youre-reading-this\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other fun messages<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that impulsive shopping is bad, and saving instead is good!

You can share your budget with a friend, make commitments, and hold each other accountable. People do less spending when they are being watched. :)\u00a0 (My wife and I share a Mint.com login &#8211; we see each other\u2019s transactions and keep one another in check).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For holiday shopping, go in with a list! Impulse purchases happen when you have no particular item in mind. Start a \u201cgift ideas\u201d list and keep it on your phone. Throughout the year when you see cool stuff that you want to buy others, jot it down in your list. When the holidays come around you will be more prepared for specific spending vs. unplanned spending.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculate the cost of things in time or work-hours, instead of dollars. For example, if you earn $20 an hour and you see a $40 t-shirt you want to grab, that would cost you 2 hours at work to buy. Is it worth it? This method applies more logic to your decisions vs. emotional spending.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Return stuff! Over half of people who do impulse shopping admit they feel regret or remorse when they get home. If you fall in this category, make yourself return the items. Many people feel embarrassed or are too lazy to go through the return process\u2026 Don\u2019t be one of them! Return policies exist if you change your mind &#8211; take advantage of them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start a good ol\u2019 fashioned no-spending challenge. If these seem boring and hard to do &#8211; that\u2019s because they are supposed to be! When I do a 60 day no alcohol challenge, my chances of buying excess crap at the brewery drop to zero. No spending challenges can be done with specific categories like clothes, fast food, or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/biggest-guilty-pleasure\/\">guilty pleasures<\/a>, or try not spending anything at all!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>How do <em>you<\/em> resist temptation and cut back on impulse buying?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you know how easy it is to blow $10,000 in 1 year on useless crap?
