But man, i shiver just thinking about it! Thank goodness i&#8217;m a bit older and wiser now&#8230;or at least older ;)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, I was reminded of it when I got a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/files\/cost_of_free.pdf\">press release<\/a> from someone over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.truecredit.com\/\">TrueCredit.com<\/a>. They commissioned Zogby International to do a survey of college graduates and came out with a pretty interesting list of stats regarding credit card usage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here was the most interesting quote i saw:<\/strong> <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The TrueCredit.com survey also revealed that four in 10 people have signed up for a credit card to receive a free gift or special offer. More than half of those respondents (52 percent) left college with credit card debt. &#8220;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>FOUR in TEN! I knew giving away free stuff worked, but my damn that&#8217;s some good marketing. I always fell for the shirts that had our school logo or something similar on it &#8211; it beat spending $35 on one from the bookstore anyday! haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could remember all the card details, but sadly it&#8217;s been too long. There was ONE, however, that started charging me monthly for it!!! I was smart enough to cut up the card, but sadly forgot to call and cancel it right away &#8211; after i got the free gift of course. I think i had like $40 on it that I &#8220;owed&#8221; but i called and bitched and got them to wave it AND cancel it&#8230;although looking back it was totally my own fault. i never read anything! ha ha, how many times have we heard that one before :)<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:130%;\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/files\/cost_of_free.pdf\">survey<\/a> also said that 1 in 4 students leave with more than $5,000 in credit card debt!<\/span><\/strong> That makes me sad :( I seriously doubt this is all because of a few free t-shirts, but it certiainly helps.<\/p>\n<p>When will middle and high schools start teaching about personal finance?! Maybe they&#8217;ve started already, i&#8217;m not sure, but even just ONE class can go a loooooooooong way. The kids won&#8217;t remember everything because sometimes you have to learn on your own, but i gaurantee they&#8217;d pick out at least 1 or 2 things that struck them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m just glad i&#8217;m over the free t-shirt thing&#8230;<\/strong>and it turns out i can get shirts basically free from TJ MAXX, Rugged Wearhouse, thrift stores, you name it! Yeah it may be a few more dollars, but no way in hell you&#8217;re getting me to sign up to any more funky credit cards again. Now, if they start handing out Saucony running shoes or gift cards to Amazon, i might be in trouble ;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;-<br \/><em>ps: Funny enough TrueCredit.com offered me a free tee just for posting about this survey! haha&#8230;I turned it down, but i still wanted to share it with you because i thought it was pretty cool. just thought I&#8217;d throw that out there in case you were wondering if this was a sponsored post or anything, which just so you know i never do.
