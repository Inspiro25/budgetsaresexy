You can find part #1 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/ooma-review-free-home-phone-service\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;re back!<\/strong> Last article we went over how to get <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/ooma-review-free-home-phone-service\/\" target=\"_blank\">home phone service for practically free<\/a> by using Ooma, and this time around we&#8217;re tackling the heated Cable\/TV part of the telecom trifecta. And just like with our home phone line, I unfortunately screwed myself multiple ways in this department too &#8211; one of which out of frugality itself!<\/p>\n<p>(See that big honkin&#8217; TV up there? That&#8217;s ours. It&#8217;s large, paid off, 10 years old and absolutely beautiful. Except when it&#8217;s not and your hacking attempts go to $hit. Sigh&#8230;)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Let&#8217;s start with <em>why<\/em> we were messing around with TV in the first place<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Plain and simple, we&#8217;re tired of paying $170+ for cable\/internet\/phone every month. We still want all three parts in our lives (notice the &#8220;want&#8221; there and not &#8220;need&#8221; &#8211; except for the internet), we just know there are cheaper ways to go about it if you harness creativity and newfangled technology. So just like with our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\">cell phones<\/a> last month, and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/car-insurance-challenge-call-and-pay-less\/\" target=\"_blank\">car insurance<\/a> and home phone service this month, we set out to tackle the TV portion of this outrageous bill all in the spirit of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/challenge-all-expenses\/\" target=\"_blank\">challenging everything<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And why do we still want cable TV?<\/strong> Well, I&#8217;ll let my wife answer that part:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you know what it&#8217;s like to grow up as a kid without cable? You can&#8217;t take it away from me now that I have it &#8211; I love it! And you can tell your blogging friends that too.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s reason #1 :) Obviously outside of my control, unless I fancy myself a divorce. Reason #2 is that I too enjoy a handful of the offerings TV and premium channels serve up. I can live without them no doubt about it, but I&#8217;d be lying if I said I don&#8217;t enjoy my reality shows and HBO\/Showtimes to catch some of my favorite series. Shows like Game of Thrones, Homeland, True Detective, The Leftovers, and more recently Ray Donovan. My wife calls him my current man crush, and I wouldn&#8217;t totally disagree with her &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0000630\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liev Schreiber<\/a> is a bad ass now! Like the complete opposite of Cotton Weary from back in the old Scream days, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, the point is we&#8217;re not ready to get rid of TV&#8217;s luxuries all the way yet, but we are wanting to scale back and save some dough in the process.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Here was the plan on how to accomplish this<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>First, find a way to get Netflix\/internet onto our TV like all other modern rock stars. I get the appeal of watching it on your laptop, but after 12 hour days behind a computer it&#8217;s the last thing I want do when unwinding. The second step &#8211; call up Verizon and simply ask them to cut channels out and lower our bill (Hah! As if it were that easy).<\/p>\n<p>We figured if we could find a way to substitute our shows\/movies over time by using the internet instead of Verizon, we&#8217;d save a nice stash of cash like many of you are already doing and have the best of both worlds going on. Then, maybe, just maybe, my wife would be singing a new tune with those dollars in her pockets?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to stream internet to your TV, way #1<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>So off I went&#8230; I looked on Amazon for ways to hook up my TV to the internet, and came across <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=tv%20internet&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=A62Y56UKJDZBS2KU&quot;&gt;Name%20Your Link\" target=\"_blank\">a slew of options<\/a>. There was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00BGGDVOO\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BGGDVOO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkId=7VYELZV7PWLZMTP2\" target=\"_blank\">Roku<\/a>, Sungale, Apple TV, Amazon Fire and a ton more which I eventually got inundated with until I noticed that many Blu-ray DVD players now come with built-in wifi? Who knew?!<\/p>\n<p>I had never heard of this as we never watch DVDs, but if you can stream the internet on it at the same time while saving that money I was &#8217;bout it &#8217;bout it. And since I thought you needed a DVD player to watch Netflix, it killed two birds with one stone. (That was mistake #1 &#8211; you don&#8217;t need a DVD player necessarily &#8211; you can STREAM shows\/movies through Netflix too! Oops.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I looked around and landed on the highly rated <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=Sony%20BDP-S5100%203D%20Blu-ray%20Disc%20Player&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ASony%20BDP-S5100%203D%20Blu-ray%20Disc%20Player&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=IZIA4PMUS5QMBZTD\" target=\"_blank\">Sony BDP-S5100 3D Blu-ray<\/a> that had built in Wi-Fi<\/strong> for $87.03 &#8211; on sale from $129.99 which it&#8217;s currently at. That was mistake #2. Not because it&#8217;s a bad product or anything (the reviews are great!), but because IT DIDN&#8217;T WORK WITH OUR TV! I just assumed it would because why <em>wouldn&#8217;t<\/em> it, right?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s our TV again in case you mysteriously missed it the first time:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40691\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/large-old-tv.jpg\" alt=\"large old tv\" width=\"500\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/large-old-tv.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/large-old-tv-300x195.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s large as $hit (60-something inches!) and rocks HDTV surprisingly enough, but it never occurred to me that it had long met it&#8217;s prime w\/ technology. I of course knew it was ancient, but who looks at the\u00a0 ports in the back when buying this stuff? How would I know it didn&#8217;t have the much-required HDMI hookup that&#8217;s apparently quite important with streaming and internet badassity? I never thought twice, and because so paid a hefty penalty in both time and money w\/ this lame hacking attempt of mine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then there was mistake #3:<\/strong> waiting two months to open it up and try connecting everything. Meaning, I didn&#8217;t realize it wasn&#8217;t compatible until it was way too late to return it, thereby losing a cool $87 on the spot, ugh&#8230; Of course, I can still hawk it and probably recoup most of that money since it retails for $130 again, but still. Moving in the opposite direction here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>But wait for mistakes #4, #5, #6, and #7 first:<\/strong> I thought I could outwhit myself and find a way to jigger around different cords and contraptions to see if that would save this debacle. So first bought a\u00a0coaxial cable to see if that would do the trick (the Blu-ray and my TV both had slots for it) but of course that didn&#8217;t work &#8211; you need HDMI! Then I picked up an HDMI cord (getting closer) and tried plugging that into the DVD player which also connected the cable box, which then connected to the TV. That&#8217;s gotta work right? Nope.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=Sony%20BDP-S5100%203D%20Blu-ray%20Disc%20Player&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ASony%20BDP-S5100%203D%20Blu-ray%20Disc%20Player&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=IZIA4PMUS5QMBZTD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40706\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sony-blu-ray-dvd-cords.jpg\" alt=\"sony blu-ray dvd cords\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sony-blu-ray-dvd-cords.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sony-blu-ray-dvd-cords-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>I should have stopped there and ate the loss, but unfortunately I went on&#8230;<\/strong> I wondered if you could somehow up convert the old stuff into the new stuff, and came across a handful of reviews saying you could by buying a converter doo-hicky for those wanting to use new equipment with old TVS (like DVD players). Exactly what I needed! So I tried my hand at that dropping another $25 to get the well-rated Mini HDMI to 3RCA Composite AV Converter &#8211; along with the appropriate cables (another $5), and off I went to convert.<\/p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t work either. Though, I did muster up some resemblance of a conversion as I could at least then program the DVD player into the TV screen, however it was all pretty blurry and I managed to shrink the viewing size of the TV in half too. Damn.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At the end of the <del>day<\/del> month, I was out another $50 and chalk full of cords and contraptions.<\/strong> So if anybody needs any&#8230;?<\/p>\n<p>And here is what we&#8217;ve learned so far:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you research before picking up electronics!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t wait for forever to see if it works<\/li>\n<li>Hold onto your patient pants and don&#8217;t go dumping more money into something with a tiny % of working.

Simply use an Android phone, tablet, iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae, Mac or Windows laptop, or Chromebook to cast your favorite entertainment and apps right to the big screen.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Hell yeah!&#8221; I said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking for a new way to stream internet on my TV cuz my dang Blu-ray sucks balls. Send me one to test and then I&#8217;ll give one away too!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>But I quickly notice the &#8220;plugs into the HDMI port&#8221; part again, ugh&#8230;<\/strong> Yet another time my awesome TV screws me! Why can&#8217;t I just be like everyone else and splurge on a huge (new) flat screen?? It would solve all my problems!!! :)<\/p>\n<p>I once again tried attaching it to my frankenstein concoction of cords I&#8217;ve since built in the hopes of capturing that miracle all gamblers hold on to, but yet again no dice (see what I did there?). It then occurred to me that &#8211; crap! I actually HAD a newer TV I picked up while pimping out my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/02\/j-money-target-diy-library\/\" target=\"_blank\">blogger lair<\/a> a few years back! Maybe I could try that?? It&#8217;s 1\/10th of the size, but hell &#8211; I might actually be able to pull something off for once!<\/p>\n<p>I ran upstairs to our master bedroom where it sits all alone waiting for action (we never use it), plugged it in to that sexy HDMI port that I&#8217;d never had the pleasure of seeing before, downloaded the app onto my smartphone (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\">Android Moto X<\/a>) And BAM! I was watching episode after episode of Elmo&#8217;s World with my baby boy in no time. Best feeling EVER.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I had the internet in the palm of my hand\/TV, baby!

For a whopping $35 bucks. Then you work yourself away from cable and instant savings!<\/p>\n<p>As for us, we&#8217;re still up a creek without a paddle. We could move our smaller TV down into our main room if we wanted to have access to everything, but that kinda sucks (first world problems, right?). Orrrrr we can cave in and pick up a new sexy TV to then stream everything to and slowly de-tach ourselves from Cable, but pending a change in the Mrs&#8217; seas, that&#8217;s pretty out of the equation right now too. Though, I must admit it would be nice to free up some space up in here and replace that honkin&#8217; thing right up on the wall a la Cribs style! I totally get why normal people do that now &#8211; they don&#8217;t want to be the next Jay-Z, they just like room to walk around their family room! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the deal in the end?<\/strong> Well, you&#8217;ll have to wait for the last part of our series to drop next week and find out (sorry!).
