So I thought it was worth sharing today and getting your take on it as well.<\/p>\n<p>My advice to her was pretty much what you&#8217;d expect from reading this blog for more than a day (aka <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">hustle hustle hustle<\/a>!), but hopefully with your fresh perspective\/tips it&#8217;ll give her an overall better picture of what she needs to do to overcome this phase of her life :)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s her email copied and pasted below, followed by my response to her with thoughts. It&#8217;s pretty long, so feel free to read just the first sentence and then advise from there, haha&#8230; Thanks guys!<\/p>\n<h2>Our dear reader&#8217;s email:<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p><b>Long-story short:<\/b> I went bankrupt at 28. How can I maximize my money when I still feel like there&#8217;s never enough leftover to save?<\/p>\n<p><b>Long-story Long:<\/b>\u00a0 I was married from 2006-2009 to a guy I ended up divorcing. To that point, I had good credit. Not great &#8211; It was fine. I bought a car here and there but my income was fairly volatile, as a nanny. My credit was GOOD, though.<\/p>\n<p>When I left my ex, I moved back to my hometown and into my childhood home. I had no income and a small amount of debt from student loans (less than three grand) which I was able to defer (and continue to defer with income-based repayment through January 2014).<\/p>\n<p>I consulted with a bankruptcy attorney for advice and decided to move forward after being served by a company with whom I&#8217;d supposedly had a credit card. I did some digging and found so many delinquent accounts that I had no idea what was happening. I can only assume that my ex let everything go down the drain when I moved away.<\/p>\n<p>It has been almost two years since my bankruptcy was finalized and since then, I have opened checking and savings accounts with USAA and obtained a secured credit card. I recently became eligible to participate in my company&#8217;s retirement savings plan and I invest 10% of my income automatically. I have the small CD attached to my new credit card, but I&#8217;m still wondering how to maximize my income when it feels like I never have anything leftover?<\/p>\n<p><strong>I make just over $35,000 a year and remarried last summer.. my husband makes just over $38,000 .. <\/strong>Combined, we look like we make a good amount of money compared to the cost of living. I am trying really hard to educate myself by using all the tools available to me.<\/p>\n<p>We own our house (which he purchased in 2005 for $87k @ 6% .. ew) with a second loan. (approx $20k @ 8.5% with a ten-year balloon payment. EW!) We&#8217;re in the process of renovating this 1895 home and our finances. I have $10,000 in student debt; my husband owes approximately $16,000 between his car loan, a line of credit we&#8217;ve used to finance house projects, and a couple of credit cards&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We are always spending to zero from week to week, but I can&#8217;t really find anywhere to trim our expenses. HELP? We pay all costs related to our restoration with cash unless they&#8217;re really high-ticket purchases (like the furnace of 2011). At this rate, our house will never be finished and we&#8217;re going to work until we die because we can&#8217;t ever save! What do we do!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks &#8211; for reading, basically, my entire life story &#8211; now I feel like a creep! ha&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>My message back to her:<\/h2>\n<p>Hey new friend! You&#8217;re not a creep &#8211; just passionate about figuring out a plan &#8211; I dig it :)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to advise on a situation without knowing your personality, or all other details outside of what you&#8217;ve put here, BUT, from a first glance it looks like the #1 thing either of you can do to speed things up is fairly obvious: <strong>earn more money<\/strong> (notice I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;easy&#8221; ;)).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure we could pick apart your budget and cash flow and come across a few ways to save a few bucks, but that&#8217;s really not going to do anything major I feel like in your current situation. Unless there&#8217;s a way to combine and refinance your loans at much lower rates without you having to dump a ton of money into it in the process? But I&#8217;m guessing\/hoping you&#8217;ve already looked into that&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s back to getting higher incomes :) How can you guys bring in more which at this point would all become &#8220;extra&#8221; that you can apply towards all your goals? Can either of you <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">take on a 2nd job<\/a> a few hours a week? Can either of you ask for a raise? Can any of your offer any services or build something that someone can pay you money for?<\/p>\n<p><strong>All this money stuff comes down to two things: expenses and income.<\/strong> If you feel you&#8217;ve done your best to limit the expenses, then it&#8217;s time to focus on the income. Even just hustling to make an extra $200 a month would probably do wonders with your situation :)<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s really all I have for you to be honest. Again, nothing mind-blowing or new to you I&#8217;m sure, but it is the reality of the situation at least from where I&#8217;m standing. I will congratulate you on overcoming all that nonsense in the past, though, and also investing so much of your income right now &#8211; that&#8217;s great. Also with going with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa\">USAA<\/a> too, which I strongly have an attachment to :)<\/p>\n<p>I wish you the best either way. You&#8217;ve come really far and you can still keep going!! Just keep in mind that all of this is just a phase, and do your best to hustle hustle hustle.<\/p>\n<p>=============================================================<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you guys think? Anything I missed and didn&#8217;t see? Would you advise differently than just &#8220;make more money?&#8221;<\/strong> Haha&#8230; I tend to always skew that way being biased with it myself (I&#8217;m not a big &#8220;save every penny and it&#8217;ll all add up!&#8221; type guy when we&#8217;re talking major life changes\/needs here), so thoughts from varying experiences\/plans from you all will probably help shed more light on her situation.<\/p>\n<p>Again, I think this problem of never having money leftover at the end of every month is pretty damn common in this world of ours today &#8211; so your tips may very well help hundreds, if not thousands, of other people reading this too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So thank you x 100, guys! Or, possibly x 1,000! ;)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>Photo cred: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/aprily\/\">aprilskiver<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I got a pretty common (and in depth) email shot my way this week on something most of us are trying to get better at&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-maximize-money-never-enough-leftover-save\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[74,98,5,134,12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-36348","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-advice","category-debt","category-life","category-reader-mail","category-saving"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Help a Reader: &quot;How can I maximize my money when I feel like there&#039;s never enough leftover to save?&quot; | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-maximize-money-never-enough-leftover-save\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Help a Reader: &quot;How can I maximize my money when I feel like there&#039;s never enough leftover to save?&quot; | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I got a pretty common (and in depth) email shot my way this week on something most of us are trying to get better at...
