Happy Friday!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a confession to make. I\u2019ve been a naughty investor. I just entered into a highly speculative, extremely risky, might-never-see-my-money-back-again kind of investment. It was only a modest amount <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(not gambling the whole farm or anything!)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, given to a start-up finance company I learned about recently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason I\u2019m telling you all this is to be transparent about *both* the smart and dumb places I put money and openly share the results over time. As a personal finance writer, I\u2019m a big advocate for conservative and simple investment strategies (index funds, buy-and-hold real estate, etc) and I rarely venture outside of that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But sometimes curiosity gets the better of me&#8230; And sometimes when I get told NOT to do something over and over again &#8211;&gt; it makes me want to try it even more! So, this is what\u2019s happening and here is why I\u2019m taking an unnecessary risk&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Does Angel Investing Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Angel investing is when you give money to a business (typically a start-up or early stage company) in exchange for a piece of ownership in the company. It\u2019s also referred to as seed investing or series A\/B\/C funding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is that if\/when the business grows, so does your investment. Returns can be quite lucrative if a start-up is highly successful. Think of companies like Facebook and Uber\u2026. People who invested in them at the very beginning are multi-millionaires now because of the wild success of the businesses they helped fund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, if the business fails or has no growth, your investment will be worth nothing. And since *most new businesses fail,* most angel investors lose their money. This is why it\u2019s extremely risky and kind of like gambling.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My Angel Investing Experiment<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investment I made is with a start-up called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifegoalinvestments.com\/about-lifegoal.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LifeGoal Investments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They were one of the vendors <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/3-fintech-innovations-i-want-you-to-know-about\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met at FinCon<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and after researching them more and more I\u2019ve become really impressed with the founders and vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LifeGoal builds and manages ETFs. Their mission is to help families and individual investors save for specific life goals by giving them low-risk funds to protect and grow their savings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I know that this business will be wildly successful?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I don\u2019t. This is a risky investment for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned from my (very limited) private partnership experience and research, it\u2019s that any business idea can look great on paper\u2026 It\u2019s more about *who* the plan is executed by and *how* it\u2019s rolled out that makes the biggest difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for me, the team members who actually run the show and their competence is what I\u2019m really putting money towards. They are the reason I\u2019m willing to take the risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll share more about this company over time (and any good\/bad results that come from my funding) but for now, here is why angel investing is typically a bad idea for most people, as well as the potential upsides that could come out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Downsides of Angel Investing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the crappy things about angel investing and why I might never see my money back.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Most start-ups fail:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Can\u2019t argue with the facts\u2026 About <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/040915\/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90% of businesses fail<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for all types of reasons. Needless to say, I won\u2019t be tracking this investment as an \u201casset\u201d in my net worth sheet, as it could potentially be worth nothing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Seed money is tied up for a looong time:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Private partnerships are not liquid investments. The only way to get my money back is if the company starts turning a profit or is bought out by someone else later, which could take years or decades!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>No control in the business:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most angel investors are Limited Partners, meaning they have no voting rights in what the company does or how money is spent. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Personally, this is OK with me. If I got involved in business decisions I would almost certainly screw it up. &#x1f602;)<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Share dilution and lower- than-expected returns: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the business grows, it may need to take on many more investors, which can dilute your percentage of ownership.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>The \u201cunicorns\u201d are already funded:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Typically, the biggest and best start-ups are already plucked by Silicon Valley venture capital firms. Getting an invite to the best private parties requires connections and a lot of moolah.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And\u2026 there are probably 100 other reasons why angel investing is a bad idea that a novice like me doesn\u2019t even know about yet. If things crash and burn with my investment, I\u2019ll be sure to blog about all the lessons learned.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is Angel Investing Worth It? (Potential Upsides of Investing in a Start-Up)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, given all the reasons I <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shouldn\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> invest in a start-up, why am I still doing it anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>High risk = high returns:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If things go well and the business grows, I might make a decent little profit one day. (It\u2019s way too early to tell in my scenario what type of multiple return I could get, but the potential is quite high and fun to think about!)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>More opportunities, connections, and learning:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Being a part of private deals like this exposes me to conversations I\u2019ve never been a part of and people I wouldn\u2019t have met otherwise. Watching things unfold behind the scenes is a huge learning experience for me &#8212; whether it\u2019s successful or not.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Funding something I believe in:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019ll get into this more another time, but I honestly believe that LifeGoal Investments is ultimately helping people invest their money better and achieve big family purchase goals. I\u2019m personally attached to this mission.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>It\u2019s kind of fun:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019m a curious money nerd who loves contracts and seeing how things work behind the scenes of businesses.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should also note\u2026 the reason my wife and I felt OK investing at this stage in our life is because it\u2019s not a huge percentage of our overall net worth. Some people recommend investing <\/span><b>no more than 10% of your net worth in risky ventures<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; our amount is waaaaay less than this. So if things don\u2019t work out, it won\u2019t really impact our lifestyle at all. &#x1f91e;&#x1f91e;&#x1f91e;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So there you have it. I did something really risky and might fall on my face publicly. Ah well, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any of you ventured into angel investing? Anyone have experience with SeedInvest or AngelList?
