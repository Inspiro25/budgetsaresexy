Every month 20% gets deducted from my pay check (employee contribution) while my company matches another 17% (employer matches 85% of our own contribution), so every employee here in Singapore has mandatory savings of at least 37% every month. Plus, I save another 30% out of my leftover (take home) pay check, so essentially I save total 67% of my monthly pay check.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Can you imagine that? If everyone was *forced* to save 37% of their income at a MINIMUM?<\/strong> Oh man&#8230; our economy here would shut down and everyone would become rich, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>More:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our retirement money in the CPF earns risk-free return of 3.2% perpetually, but we have the option of using part of the money to invest in stocks if we choose to.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>So not only does the gov&#8217;t <em>force<\/em> you to save, but it gives you a *guaranteed* rate of return too?<\/strong> Incredible! Sure you can get much better returns in the markets or elsewhere and of course <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/inflation-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-this-topic\/\">inflation<\/a> will wipe out a lot (all?) of that, but still. Guaranteed is better than no guarantee :)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Income tax in Singapore is almost negligible for middle income folks like us, for me and wife we probably pay about <b>0.2%<\/b> of income tax annually per person\u00a0(this is not a typing error) on average for the past 10 years since 2005. <em>(Update: My friend says their tax rate is so low because of government rebates for having 2 kids and supporting aging parents. He says the average rate is around 4-5% for people.)<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>How are we not all moved out and living there now????<\/strong> I don&#8217;t know what the downsides of living there are yet, but so far count me in :) He only told me one scary thing, though a whopper it was at that:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Singapore government imposes high taxes on car ownership because we are a small country with limited land, thus a Toyota Camry costs a mind boggling S$200,000 (USD $142,000) after interest and fees. Yet there are people taking out car loans and &#8220;happily&#8221; using it for their daily commute.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>OH. MY. GOSH.<\/strong> My piece of crap caddy would be like $100,000 over there! Haha&#8230; I&#8217;d need to invest in a new pair of walking shoes :)<\/p>\n<p>And, lastly,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Living in modern &amp; fast paced Singapore, one would need lots of emotional discipline not to follow the crowd. Young people (under 50 y\/o) easily incur up to about 10 years of their annual salary on their million dollars apartments and ridiculously priced cars. So we are considered weirdos in this city of opulence and show-offs.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Welcome to the club, brotha&#8230; Why do you think we all congregate online to talk about this stuff? :)<\/p>\n<h2>Credit scores, loans, and debt in Denmark<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48385\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/denmark-flag.jpg\" alt=\"denmark flag\" width=\"500\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/denmark-flag.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/denmark-flag-300x227.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>This was left on an article here about credit scores two years ago&#8230;<\/strong> Particularly on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/does-your-credit-score-matter-if-you-dont-do-debt\/#comments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whether or not it matters if you never plan on taking on debt<\/a>?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In Denmark we don\u2019t use credit scores. If you rent an apartment or need a loan, you provide them with your recent income statements. If it\u2019s a big loan, like a mortgage, they also require tax documents and a budget.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t pay your bills, creditors can have you signed up in a register which will make future loans almost impossible until the debt has been paid.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>They require a budget!! YES!!!<\/strong> We all know credit scores don&#8217;t really tell you whether you can <em>afford<\/em> anything or not &#8211; just that you&#8217;re great at paying your bills! &#8211; so factoring that in would do people a WORLD of a favor&#8230; And again, would also scare the pants off our economy here! Though investment bankers sure would have a ton more to invest for people, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I also love that there&#8217;s a &#8220;list&#8221; people go on when they get themselves in trouble&#8230; reminds me of those old <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/06\/net-worth-increase-487k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debtor prisons<\/a> from back in the day, though thankfully more modernized :)<\/p>\n<p>Thx for the info, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pengepugeren.dk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/www.pengepugeren.dk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1464187806909000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlHX0zcOqXQghFAJ0I88n12RxiYw\">Pengepugeren<\/a>!

You have to earn at least 3 times the loan repayment amount, net. If you earn \u20ac1,000, you can take a \u20ac333 mortgage. If you earn \u20ac1,000 and already pay \u20ac350 in rent, you can\u2019t borrow anything. If you make \u20ac1,000 and have a \u20ac200 mortgage, you can take consumer loan as long as the repayment is less than \u20ac133 a month.<\/p>\n<p>This criteria is very strict and limits the number of bankruptcies. It also makes it a nightmare to get a mortgage those days, with the price of real estate in Paris\u2026 Often your parents have to cosign your mortgage, and at 35 it is quite the experience.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On student loans &#8211; which are &#8220;very rare&#8221;:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you can\u2019t afford to study, you\u2019ll get a scholarship. Public university costs roughly $2,000 a year, business school can be up to $20,000 a year and that is one of the rare occasions when students would take on a loan. All business schools have work\/study agreements with major companies, like I did, the company paid my tuition and I worked for them in return&#8230;&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>BOOM! Education AND a job rolled up in one &#8211; gotta love that.<\/strong> Unless you realize midway through that you actually <em>hate<\/em> the avenue you&#8217;re going down and then want to change, eh? How does that work? I switched from international business to graphic design in college and I reckon I would have had a problem, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>On credit\/debit cards:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The vast majority of people in France own a \u201ccarte de cr\u00e9dit\u201d. That means credit card, but in reality it works like a debit card with an overdraft on the account&#8230; We get charged around \u20ac40, a cool $50 per year, for the privilege of owning one such card. A debit card! There are 60 million French people, I\u2019ll let you do the math\u2026&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Probably a LOT cheaper than handing those 60 million people a *real* credit card though!<\/strong> It&#8217;s scary how normal it is to pay HUNDREDS of dollars in interest every month here in the U.S&#8230; I&#8217;m sure any of them would gladly swap it out for a $50 charge to have their credit cards swapped out. (Oh wait, they can (and for free) but they don&#8217;t! Womp womp.)<\/p>\n<p>On <em>actual<\/em> credit cards in France:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since almost no one goes into debt and pays 19.99% APRs on their cards, we don\u2019t get travel rewards, hotel points, cashback. Zilch. Just a yearly fee, that usually includes purchase protection and identity theft cover, period.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Again, a good price to pay for the lack of debt :)<\/strong> I&#8217;d imagine you can &#8220;hack&#8221; a lot more out of travel with all that cash you&#8217;d be saving too instead of throwing it away!

I\u2019m from New Zealand where it costs around 7k per year to study, but we get interest free student loans (so long as we don\u2019t leave the country, interest applies when we move overseas for longer than 6 months).
