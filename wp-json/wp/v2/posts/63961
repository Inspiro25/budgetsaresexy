I just added it up and realized I\u2019ve earned $9,114 in extra money this year, on top of my regular salary. Woohoo, gig economy!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn\u2019t a huge amount of extra cash, but it\u2019s pretty dang good considering I haven\u2019t been \u201chustling\u201d that much this year. It\u2019s been more of a collection of random gigs I\u2019ve found or stumbled across in my spare time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a breakdown of earnings from side jobs, and more importantly <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how I came across<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> these opportunities in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$130 &lt;&#8212;- buying and selling stuff online<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$419 &lt;&#8212;- selling *my friend\u2019s* stuff online<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$150 &lt;&#8212;- \u201cconsulting\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$400 &lt;&#8212;- modeling<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,000 &lt;&#8212;- new bank account bonuses<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,100 &lt;&#8212;- new credit card bonuses<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$5,925 &lt;&#8212;- extra SEO work for my employer<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>$9,114 Total<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><b>Make Extra Money by Asking for More Work From Your employer<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By far my biggest extra bucks have come from additional contract work at my employer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, I\u2019m a freelance writing contractor, so I can work for multiple companies at the same time. But I\u2019ve only ever had 1 client &#8212; and I\u2019d prefer to keep it this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late December last year, I emailed my boss\u2019s boss out of the blue and requested a 15-minute \u201ccatch up call.\u201d It had been a while since we had spoken so I thought I\u2019d say happy holidays and do a quick self-performance review.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**BTW &#8211; I encourage everyone to reach out to your senior management and request 15-minute calls once and a while. As long as you don\u2019t waste their time, it helps you stay connected, front of mind, and it\u2019s a great opportunity to share information with each other up and down the company food chain. This kind of initiative can boost your earning potential, too.**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, right at the end of my call, I dropped this simple line:\u00a0 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHey, by the way, I have some spare time up my sleeve and have an interest in SEO work. If there are any teams you know of that could use my help, I\u2019m available &#8212; and keen.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lo and behold, 2 weeks later another team manager reached out to me requesting some help with random SEO (search engine optimization) tasks in addition to my &#8220;day job.&#8221; Although I don\u2019t really have any experience with SEO as a technical skill, I\u2019m an excellent out-of-the-box thinker and have unmatched enthusiasm for new challenges. They offered me a whopping $75 per hour, and so far this year I\u2019ve worked 79 hours on this freelance job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best part is that I can manage my own schedule, working a few hours here and there when I\u2019m free. Since I get up at 5am every day, I can knock out a couple hours in the morning on Saturdays or Sundays without interfering much with my daily life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely realize how lucky I am and that these types of high-paying hourly jobs don\u2019t grow on trees. But whenever friends ask me how I found work like this, I tell them \u2192 <\/span><b>because I asked for it.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><b>Get Supplemental Income From Credit Card and Bank Account Bonuses<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I have signed up for 3 new bank accounts and 4 new credit cards so far in 2021. Here are the bonuses we\u2019ve received:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$200 &#8212; PNC Bank checking account bonus<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$400 (x2) &#8212; Capital One 360 Checking account (me and wife)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$300 (x2) &#8212; AMEX Blue (me and wife)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$200 &#8212; BOA Cash back credit card<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$300 &#8212; Capital One SAVOR credit card<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I typically only recommend<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/churning-bank-accounts\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bank account churning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or opening new credit cards if you are extremely detail oriented, are good at taking notes, and can handle credit responsibly!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of these accounts take less than 15 minutes to set up, a little coordination to make sure you are hitting criteria to qualify for the bonus, then less than 15 minutes to shut down the account afterwards. Over the past 3-4 years my wife and I have opened 30+ accounts, and probably have earned close to $10k in extra cash. It\u2019s not a huge amount, but for the time trade off, we think it\u2019s always worth it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find the best current bank bonuses, I check<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.doctorofcredit.com\/best-bank-account-bonuses\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this Doctor of Credit website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regularly.

He worked at a bank, and I told him I write about finance. We exchanged emails in the water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months went by, then I received an email from him. He wanted to learn more about the FIRE movement, and get some feedback on a financial app he\u2019s building&#8230; He asked for a phone call, and offered to pay me $150 for 30 minutes of my time. Whoa! &#x1f633;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve never been a \u201cconsultant\u201d before. But just by striking up random conversations, weird opportunities have started landing in my lap.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Get Additional Income by Modeling<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the $400 my wife and I made modeling, we landed this by just staying in contact with old friends. About 10 years ago we did some small photo shoots for a gal here in LA, and she reached out to see if we were interested in a quick private gig. It took about an hour to shoot, and they came to our house so there was no traveling time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, the shoot was private so the photos will never be seen publicly. But, here\u2019s an old one of me and my wife back in 2013 &#8212; someone spotted us on a marketing billboard at a real estate conference\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64169 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Joel-realtor-photo-rotated-e1629085083200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were posing as a new couple buying a house.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><b>Make Extra Money Buying and Selling Stuff Online<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding and selling stuff online is probably my lowest pay per hour hobby. But I love it! I don\u2019t care if I only profit a few dollars&#8230; It amazes me that one person\u2019s trash is another person\u2019s treasure, and the lucky middleman can make a profit just by connecting people and negotiating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this year I found a free surfboard, a compost tumbler, and an antique pocket watch at an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-find-estate-sale-deals-from-a-beverly-hills-bargain-hunter\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estate sale<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nearby. I made a little over $100 from selling these on Craigslist and OfferUp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my neighbors down the street caught wind that I liked selling stuff and asked me to help clear out some of his storage locker. He gave me a few boxes of stuff (mostly old Lladro figurines) and offered to split the profits with me if I sold them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far this year I\u2019ve made $549 selling stuff online. Not a huge amount, but it pays for a month&#8217;s worth of groceries for us. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Work That I *didn\u2019t* take = $4,000+?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a fun email I got from a buddy a few months ago\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64170 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Friend-Job-Opp-e1629085091701.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"288\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(If you can\u2019t read it, the offer was to get paid to go buy buckets of pool chlorine at Costcos.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I\u2019d love to make quick cash for a few days, I cannot think of a more horrible second job than shopping at Costco. I turned this down and referred some other friends to help out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another opportunity I got was to work as a personal assistant (PA) on some photo shoots for a production company here in Los Angeles. I used to work odd jobs for a friend a few years ago and the pay was quite good! $350 per day, and the job of a PA is to just drive people around, get coffees on set, order lunches and run general errands. I really liked being a PA, but the timing didn\u2019t work out for this particular gig.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, there you have it. That\u2019s how I made an extra $9,114 with side jobs so far this year &#8230; by asking for work, striking up conversations with strangers, keeping up with old friends, taking advantage of bonuses and just generally keeping my eyes open for opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>More Ways to Make Extra Cash<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budgets Are Sexy has a mega list of<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">side hustle ideas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your inspiration.
