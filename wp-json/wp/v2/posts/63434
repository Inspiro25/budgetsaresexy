Actually, there\u2019s no national holiday even like it down there. After moving to the USA, Thanksgiving quickly became my favorite holiday. This will be my 13th year celebrating!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I love most about this holiday time is seeing everyone actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">showing and expressing thanks, together as friends and family<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><b>Giving is addictive<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it\u2019s one of the quickest routes to personal happiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve written about ways to include <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-include-charity-in-your-budget-and-other-ways-to-give\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">charity in your budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and giving methods in the past. Here\u2019s a few more cool ideas and methods to help get you thinking about giving more this holiday season&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Pay Off Someone\u2019s Layaway Toys<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This note came from reader Jess:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every year for Thanksgiving my mom goes to a store and speaks to the customer service department, explains what she&#8217;s doing, and asks then to search through their layaways for a list that is unpaid but <\/span><\/i><b><i>mostly children&#8217;s toys<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Then she pays it off. This way she knows she&#8217;s helping a family who&#8217;s struggling to pay for holiday gifts for the kids.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What a beautiful thing, and I like that it\u2019s anonymous! It lets you dream and wonder what type of family you are helping out. Picturing the parents\u2019 surprise at the store, as well as the kids&#8217; faces when they open their presents almost brings me to tears. What a rewarding way to care for strangers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t visit big box stores much in person (like me!), there are some cool online charity organizations like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/payawaythelayaway.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay Away the Lay Away<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that make it easy to donate online! Same idea, they just pool together all the money donated and give to places like Kmart, Burlington, Walmart, and Navy Exchange during the holidays and back-to-school time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Become an Elf With USPS Operation Santa!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/merry-christmas-10-original-santa-jokes-for-you-%f0%9f%98%b1-%f0%9f%8e%85%f0%9f%8e%84%f0%9f%a4%b6\/\">year, hundreds of thousands of kids post letters to Santa<\/a>. And the US Postal Service has now set up an online system for people to \u201cadopt and respond\u201d to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check it out here: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspsoperationsanta.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USPS Operation Santa<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Typically the letters selected are written by underprivileged kids, who are asking for small gifts that their parents can\u2019t afford. Starting Dec 4th, you can commit to responding to a letter (or a bunch of letters) and post gifts to the children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can read some of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspsoperationsanta.com\/letters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">letters online here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> **might want to have a box of tissues standing by**, and it looks like they\u2019ve made a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dearsanta.movie\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">documentary movie<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the whole process which comes out on Dec 4th too!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Buy Someone\u2019s Medical Debt (for Pennies on the Dollar), Then Forgive It!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first learned this idea from The Wealthy Accountant who wrote <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/wealthyaccountant.com\/2019\/09\/16\/20-million-change-the-world-giveaway\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a blog post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about buying a $20 million bundle of medical debts for about $50k, then <\/span><b>not collecting any of the debts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Really interesting stuff!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you buy debt? And can you do it in small amounts?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Check out these sites like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ripmedicaldebt.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RIPMedicalDebt<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/rollingjubilee.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Jubilee<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These nonprofits basically pool everyone\u2019s donations together and buy MASSIVE chunks of packaged debt, at huge discounts. Then they \u201cforgive\u201d the debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps the world in a couple ways:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It relieves the debts of people that simply can\u2019t afford to pay. Hopefully without these massive hanging burdens, they can start rebuilding and strengthening their financial situation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It hurts the ugly organizations that profit off of other people\u2019s financial burdens. Debt collectors typically buy large packages of debt at discounted rates, then chase all the people that owe money to make a profit. It\u2019s sad because most people fall into debt for living necessities (medical, education, housing).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Activate Amazon Smile (FREE) for Your Holiday Shopping!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are you\u2019re ordering at least some gifts online this year\u2026 This is a way to make a difference while doing the exact same shopping activities you are already doing anyway!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply visit <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smile.amazon.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 It looks <\/span><b>exactly the same as the regular Amazon site. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same products, same prices, and no extra costs. The only difference is Amazon will donate 0.5% of all eligible purchases to your favorite charity when you check out!\u00a0 Make sure the Smile Logo is at the top of the Amazon page, and you\u2019re good to go!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to activate this on your Amazon cell phone app?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I just did it, it\u2019s easy!\u2026 Open the Amazon App \u2192 Go to Settings \u2192 click Amazon Smile. Then click the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTurn on Amazon Smile\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> button. It looks like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63502 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Smile_app_png_OoU8bxy--e1606112105888.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"893\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, there is <\/span><b>no cost to you<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! While 0.5% might not seem like a lot for Amazon to give, every cent counts! You also get to choose which charities your shopping supports! &#x1f397;&#x1f397;&#x1f397;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Help Out at a Local Food Bank, or Host a Food Drive<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharing holiday meals is a beautiful thing. And helping provide food for others is a good way to appreciate the basic things in life that many take for granted! This can be a great family activity also (better check first with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.feedingamerica.org\/find-your-local-foodbank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your local food bank<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make sure you can bring kids along. Some volunteering activities are for people of 18 years and older.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might be thinking, \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what about COVID!!?\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to congregate in big groups right now\u201d&#8230;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty much all food banks and meal related charities have adopted wicked health practices so they can continue their mission in helping people, even through this pandemic. Masks, gloves, distancing, shift work, and other best practices help both the volunteers and clients stay safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I volunteer at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meals on Wheels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> every Friday. A year ago, I remember being huddled in a tiny office, working shoulder to shoulder with 20 other volunteers, handling raw fruit and veggies&#8230;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, how times have changed!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, they only allow 1 person to enter a room at a time. All the food is pre-sorted, packaged, disinfected and grouped by delivery route. I can pick up and deliver 20 meals without being close to anyone. Safety is #1 because most of the clients that need food are elderly and are in a high risk category. &#x1f642;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Donate Your Airline Miles &#8211; They May Be Expiring Anyway!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might not feel comfortable traveling right now due to COVID\u2026 Or perhaps your airline miles are about to expire? Consider donating them!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally I have about 4,000 United Airline Miles. That\u2019s not enough to pay for a 1-way ticket, and I never fly that airline anyway. Donating my miles (even though it\u2019s a small amount) can be grouped together with other mileage donations and help someone else get their travel wish granted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/wish.org\/travel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a Wish Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says that 75% of all their requests include air travel! This site lists some of the major airline\u2019s Helplines and Guidelines for gifting miles. Easier than I thought!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Gift a Side Hustle!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my friends has a birthday coming up, right around Christmas time. I was thinking about giving her money, because she\u2019s struggling a bit financially&#8230; But then I thought, maybe I could get her a <\/span><b>gift that helps her make more money on her own<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking through our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mega list of side hustles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I noticed some have a small start-up cost. My thinking is that if I cover the start-up fees as a birthday gift, she\u2019ll follow through and be able to start making some extra cash on the side (provided she enjoys doing whatever I sign her up for &#x1f923;)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I might get my friend some voiceover acting lessons (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/make-money-voice-over-actor\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side Hustle #60 &#8211; Voiceover Acting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, this holiday season if you can\u2019t think up any good gift ideas, think about a side hustle that your person might enjoy, and buy them whatever is needed to get started. Stuff like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Someone who might like a blogging side hustle&#8230; Buy them a domain name and hosting plan for a year (under $100)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend who would be great as a Podcast host or YouTube video creator\u2026 Grab them a microphone, selfie light ring, or online coaching courses. ($50-$100)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artistic friends or family members that could start their own online stores\u2026 You could buy them art materials like jewelry making kits, stained glass supplies or whatever! (Under $50)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the entrepreneurial spirited\u2026 they might be interested in a land-flipping course or real estate investing coaching ($100 &#8211; $500)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just a few random ideas. The main point is that helping people realize their full potential empowers them and gives them confidence in a way no regular material gift ever can!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Build a Donation Machine<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This last idea is a bit random, but I wanted to include it as something to think about for future gifting. It came from a reader: R.S\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne approach I\u2019ve taken is creating a specific brokerage account where any dividends from the shares are donated. So in a nutshell it involves putting money regularly into the account and any dividends are automatically paid back into a bank account where the funds are then transferred to a charity through a bank transfer. I\u2019ve gone into <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.vixre.co.uk\/building-a-donation-machine\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more detail here<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is kind of like setting up your own private \u201cfoundation.\u201d But instead of having billions of dollars like the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rockefellerfoundation.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rockefellers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you just build it slowly and start small. The idea is that instead of donating money directly to charity, you invest the money instead. Slowly when the investments pay dividends, they are given to charity, as well as the initial capital increases the size of the donation machine over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I might try building one of these in 2021!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a great Thanksgiving week!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The giving season has begun!
