We\u2019ve always been decent budgeters, savers, etc., but three years ago was when it really clicked for us\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe can retire early!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all came down to us figuring out our \u201cFI number\u201d and realizing it was reachable in our 40s.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why the 4% Rule for Retirement Doesn\u2019t Always Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most FIRE enthusiasts follow the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/number-needed-retire-safely\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4% rule of thumb<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to figure out how much money they will need for retirement. It\u2019s pretty simple, you just take your annual expenses, multiply them by 25, and there you have it &#8212; that\u2019s your FI number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s a great rule when you\u2019re first starting out, but as you grow older and life throws you more changes, you realize <\/span><b>that your FI number is actually a <\/b><b><i>moving target<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It changes as your future expenses change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason my wife and I don\u2019t have an exact FI number is because we don\u2019t know what our exact future expenses are gonna be. There are too many variables. And not just small variables, BIG ones, like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We currently don\u2019t own a home. We\u2019ve accounted for rent, but this number could change drastically.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t know which city we\u2019ll live in. Heck, we don\u2019t even know which country we\u2019ll live in.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care costs are a huge unknown.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t have kids yet. No clue how much they will cost.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of these expense variables has a 25x impact on how much we need to save for comfortable retirement. So, instead of shooting for an exact magic number, my wife and I are mostly shooting for a \u201crange.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are our thoughts and some rough calculations&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Figuring Out Our FI Number: Constants and Variables<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before jumping into what we don\u2019t know, here\u2019s some of our living expenses we kinda do know. These are <\/span><b>annual expenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> based on what we reckon will be a fairly comfortable lifestyle for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food: $6,000<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Booze: $3,000<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet: $840<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phones: $1,200<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cars: $2,400<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gifts\/Charity: $5,000<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pets: $2,000<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amusement: $1,200<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travel: $5,000<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miscellaneous: $2,400<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>TOTAL: $29,040<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m a round numbers guy, so let\u2019s just call this $30,000 per year in fixed and constant living expenses. (Yes, this number will increase with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/inflation-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-this-topic\/\">inflation<\/a> year after year. At this point, all I care about is Year 1 numbers in retirement.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$30k x 25 = $750k needed in retirement funds to cover these expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, so now we have to add in 3 x variables\u2026 <\/span><b>Housing, health care, kids.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Housing and Future Rent Guesstimates<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since my wife and I aren\u2019t ready to buy a house, we\u2019ll include monthly rent in our living expenses. This is where ranges come in, depending on the city we want to live in and size of our house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Low estimate:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In Los Angeles, we can happily rent a 1 bedroom apartment in a good area for ~$2,500 per month. (We pay less than this now thanks to a sweetheart deal, but that won\u2019t last forever.) So, total annual would be $30,000 as a safe bet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>High estimate:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever live in a McMansion, but if we need an extra bedroom and wanna be in a good school district or something, let\u2019s say it\u2019ll be $4,000 per month to rent a place. That\u2019s $48,000 annual in rent on the high end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low rent:\u00a0 $30k x 25 = $750k needed in retirement<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High rent:\u00a0 $48k x 25 = $1.2 million needed<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we get the warm and fuzzies and want to purchase a home somewhere, as long as the monthly payments and expenses are less than $4k for housing, we\u2019re covered.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Health Insurance and Health Care Variables<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one is the toughest for early retirees to figure out. Last year we had an awesome post from the Dragons On FIRE about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/budgeting-for-healthcare-in-early-retirement\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthcare in early retirement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is a pretty thorough guide to trying to work out future healthcare costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Free option: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my wife and I, if we end up moving back to Australia, we could potentially get by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/transferwise.com\/us\/blog\/healthcare-system-in-australia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">paying $0 for healthcare<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. 100% of Australian full time residents have Medicare, and pay nothing for hospitals and doctors appointments. (Private health insurance is also an option, and apparently the average cost is only $2000 per year per person!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cCheap\u201d Healthcare:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Last year I spent some time evaluating <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/health-insurance-worth-it\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health insurance vs. having no insurance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and paying out of pocket for care. My wife and I skated by for almost 3 years without insurance, only paying ~$4k during that entire time ($3k of which was government fines). Per the \u201cnational average\u201d for us, our costs apparently would be about $4,000 per year (including fines).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, I know many of you are going to disagree with this, but <\/span><b>I\u2019m gonna use $10k per year<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as our low annual estimate. This would cover either a basic high deductible health plan (HDHP) premium with low care use, or living without insurance and paying $10k out of pocket per year for fixes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>High healthcare budget:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Also in last year\u2019s post I calculated a HDHP insurance plan for my wife and I and worked out that it would cost a <\/span><b>max of $20,400 per year<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This covers all premiums for the policy as well as maxing out the family deductible every single year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low healthcare: $10k x 25 = $250,000 needed in retirement<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High healthcare: $20.4k = $510,000 needed in retirement<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Future Kids Cost<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick update on our foster\/adopt process: We\u2019ve completed all the pre-approval Zoom classes and most of the onboarding homework. A social worker came and did 1 home inspection so far, and we\u2019ve got a few more inspections, as well as interviews and more qualifying stuff to get through. All in all, I\u2019d say we\u2019re 50% of the way through the county approval process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>If we decide not to have kids:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Then our cost is $0 and it doesn\u2019t really affect our FIRE number at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Average cost of raising a child in the U.S.: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on 2019 numbers, the average total cost that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/090415\/cost-raising-child-america.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">middle-income parents will spend on a child<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from age 0 &#8211; 18 is $284,570. If my wife and I adopt a child, I can safely say our expenses will be lower than this, because the state provides free healthcare, a small monthly stipend per child, a TON of support for education services and stuff like that. For our estimate purposes, I\u2019m gonna go with an annual cost of $12,000 per child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cost for 1 kid:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $12k x 25 = $300k<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cost for 2 kids:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $24k x 25 = $600k<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alright, let\u2019s add this all up\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Annual Expense Totals and FI Number Range:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63720 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Joel_FI_Examples_jpeg_RWAxKrI8-e1613159788127.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"222\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the low end, it looks like we would need $1.75 million in assets for retirement.
