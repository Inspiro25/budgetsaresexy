But first, <b>let\u2019s have a little Budgets Are Sexy competition<\/b> &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Do you think you could win one of these engagement ring categories if you\u2019re stacked up against other Budgets readers? Keep in mind that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weddingstats.org\/cost-of-an-engagement-ring\/\">average engagement ring cost<\/a> was $5k (WOAH) this year, and the old marketing adage is that you should spend two months&#8217; salary on &#8212; what else? &#8212; the biggest diamond you can afford. (Feel free to share your opinion about either of those things in the comments &#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>OK, on to the contest:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Most Frugal Engagement Ring or Wedding Band: <\/b>What\u2019s the lowest price someone (either you or your partner) paid for an engagement ring? Must be greater than $0.01 &#8212; can\u2019t be a gifted or stolen ring. If it\u2019s homemade, what were the materials, costs, etc.?<\/li>\n<li><b>Most Expensive Engagement Ring \/ Wedding Ring: <\/b>Don\u2019t worry, no shaming here (and if you want to remain anonymous, that\u2019s cool!). Shoot me the $ amount and a photo of that multiple-carat sucker! And I&#8217;m curious \u2026 does it get worn around everywhere, or does it mostly stay in a jewelry box? &#x1f929;<\/li>\n<li><b>The *Oldest* Engagement Ring. <\/b>Do you have a family heirloom? Did you score an antique gemstone from somewhere else? A diamond is forever, apparently \u2026 Is anyone rocking a diamond ring from the 19th century \u2026 or earlier?!<\/li>\n<li><b>Funniest Engagement Story: <\/b>Did you screw up or embarrass yourself? And did your partner still say yes? (<i>I would have asked for the *cheesiest* engagement story, but I might win that one by default with my \u201cring at the bottom of champagne glass\u201d proposal &#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;. Not my finest moment, but my wife said yes, which is all that matters!)<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK, you have four categories to enter. If you want to play, drop a comment in this blog post (or reply to this email). The winners will get a homemade gift from yours truly (it&#8217;s not made from cubic zirconia I promise!), plus some serious bragging rights. Announcements to be made soon &#8212; and I\u2019ll share my sappy ring story then, too.<\/p>\n<h2>A few fun engagement ring facts I found while googling around \u2026<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Elizabeth Taylor holds the world record for having the most expensive engagement ring &#8230; It sold for a whopping $8.8 million 10 years ago after she passed away. She used this same ring at two of her eight weddings. Yes, <b>EIGHT<\/b> weddings.<\/li>\n<li>In 2016, an Aussie billionaire gave Mariah Carey a custom engagement ring with an insanely huge center stone. The whole thing was apparently worth a cool $10 mil &#8230; But, they called off the wedding less than a year later, and the ring was sold to an LA jeweler for <i>only<\/i> $2.1 million.<\/li>\n<li>In 1951, Warren Buffett spent 6% of his net worth on an engagement ring for his bride. Of course, that 6% wasn\u2019t a lot back then because he was only 21 and this was well before he made his massive fortune.<\/li>\n<li>But in 1993, Bill Gates flew to Omaha to visit his friend Warren. They went engagement ring shopping (Bill was planning to propose to Melinda at the time). While they were shopping, Warren tried to persuade Bill to also spend 6% of his net worth on a ring \u2026 but Bill declined because he was the richest man in the world at the time and 6% would have been about $370 million! <i>(Would you spend 6% of your net worth on a ring?)<\/i><\/li>\n<li>Do you know why most people wear wedding rings on the fourth finger of their left hand (the &#8220;ring finger&#8221;)? Because that\u2019s where ancient Egyptians believed the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vena_amoris\">vein of love<\/a>\u2019 was located, and that finger is directly connected to the heart &#x1f91a;\u2192&#x2764;&#xfe0f;. How romantic.<\/li>\n<li>Note to all you single folks out there: If you\u2019re trying to pick someone up in Greece, Russia, Germany or India, be sure to check the person\u2019s *right hand* for a ring, not the left. Because that\u2019s where wedding rings are more commonly worn in those places. You don\u2019t want to accidentally hit on someone who\u2019s spoken for!<\/li>\n<li>Think you\u2019re too old to get married? Think again. George and Doreen Kirby from the UK got hitched on George\u2019s 103rd birthday. Doreen was 91 at the time. He proposed on Valentine&#8217;s Day and tells the story: <i>\u201cI didn\u2019t get down on one knee, because I don\u2019t think I would have been able to get back up!\u201d<\/i><\/li>\n<li>Did you have a long engagement? Well, a poor woman named Adriana Martinez holds the world record for longest engagement. She was engaged to her man for 67 YEARS before they got married! Almost seven decades of cold feet :(<\/li>\n<li>The largest diamond ever found (on Earth) was in 1905 in South Africa. This thing was 3,106 carats and weighed 1.3 pounds! It was given to King Edward VII as a present for his 66th birthday. Some bday gift!<\/li>\n<li>In 2004, astronomers discovered a planet in the Milky Way they call \u201c55 Cantri e.\u201d It\u2019s made mostly of dense carbon, and they believe it\u2019s about 1\/3rd pure diamond! That\u2019s like a million gazillion carats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And lastly &#8230;.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you know that the singer Neil Diamond used to be called Neil Coal until the <i>pressure<\/i> got to him? &#x1f923; I know, it\u2019s a lame dad joke &#8230; I just threw it in for those who miss J$ and his crappy jokes. Miss you, J!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Got a ring story to share? Frugal tips? Expensive mistakes?

I don&#8217;t remember how much a pack of Cracker Jacks cost in 2008 but let&#8217;s say about $1. Our engagement was spontaneous, and I had no interest in an engagement ring, but then his mother complained that he didn&#8217;t give me a ring, so he handed me this one from a package we found in the car. It ended up being my one and only engagement ring.

Thank you insurance policy, I had a check in hand within days to replace the lost ring.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In what I thought was a romantic gesture my husband decided to design another one of a kind ring for me with the replacement insurance check.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently he decided to try one last time to use the stone (now multiple stones, set in his wedding band).<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a month after losing my original engagement and wedding ring, my husband took me out for a fancy dinner and presented to me a new wedding ring set made with the stones from his short lived wedding to the Las Vegas stripper that I refused to wear and had set into his wedding band.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ring was a pale shadow of a set compared to the original ring he had made for me and gone was his band I had made for him replaced with a plain gold band.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I couldn&#8217;t believe his nerve and was so angry I left the restaurant without him and when he returned later I angrily asked him what he did with the rest of the insurance money as it was very obvious he didn&#8217;t use it all on my new ring and he insisted that he spent the same amount of money on my new ring. That was his story and he was sticking to it as the saying goes.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well his story unraveled when he came roaring up to our house only a few days later on a brand new motorcycle &#8230; guess where the down payment for the bike came from &#8230; yup the remainder of the insurance money.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things only went downhill from there, he began working out of town a lot and I suspected and later found out for certain he was cheating on me.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We split and our divorce was long and complicated and expensive. I ran out of money about two years into the divorce proceedings and then late one night while sipping some wine w my girlfriend a thought occurred to me.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day I went to the jeweler where he had my first and the infamous second rings made. Fortunately we had become very friendly over the course of our marriage and ring making process.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They offered to buy back the second ring from me for a handsome price, honestly I think they felt sorry for me.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used that money from his wedding ring from his marriage to the stripper, the refuted proposal to me, the necklace I never wore and the band I had made, and my second wedding ring set to fund the remainder of the divorce proceedings!!!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The irony there is just too delicious.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We finalized the divorce a few months later and didn&#8217;t speak for a few years as we had no children only property together which was divided in our divorce settlement.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 3 and a half years after our divorce was final a mutual friend texted me a link to an engagement photo in the local paper.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right there smiling and holding her hand outstretched wearing my second engagement ring was my ex-husband&#8217;s new bride to be.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess it could have made me mad but instead I just roared with laughter.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I couldn&#8217;t help myself but to text him my congratulations and he asked me if I noticed the ring and I said yes of course and then he said that he laughed when he went to the jeweler to have a ring made for his new fiance only to find my second ring in the jeweler&#8217;s case.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We laughed a bit and thus ended the whole ordeal of that damn stone.
