I&#8217;m keeping it!<\/strong> Literally just deposited the check seconds before starting this post (thanks USAA for deposit by phone!), and the whole car crash dilemma is now officially behind us :)<\/p>\n<p>For everyone new to the story, here&#8217;s a recap:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/got-in-a-car-accident-yesterday\/\">I crashed my car into a girl&#8217;s car<\/a> (her fault)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/car-considered-total-loss-by-insurance\/\">And Progressive (her insurance) considered my car a &#8220;total loss.&#8221;<\/a> Forcing me to decide whether to keep it and pocket $2,100, or ditch it altogether and walk away with $3,500 instead. Something I was REALLY torn about because I really do enjoy riding my car (a &#8217;93 Cadillac Deville)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>I went back and forth with the decision<\/strong> &#8211; reading each and every one of your opinions and advice &#8211; and at the end of the day it felt MUCH much better holding on to it than it did having more money and being car-less. Something I&#8217;m not quite ready to experience just yet after being without it for 4 days as a mechanic checked it out determined the costs (I felt so naked!).<\/p>\n<p>That was really the remaining variables to be figured out &#8211; <em>Could the car be back to being safe again? And at what cost?<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Well I happily learned that, yes, it sure can! <\/strong>(It ended up being truly cosmetic) And no, not for a super high amount either. At\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$830<\/strong> <\/span>it would get her back to looking as close to brand new as possible (at least with safety and being street legal again, haha&#8230;), so I paid the man quickly and began taking celebratory rides <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/were-officially-virginians\/\">around our new place<\/a> as soon as I had it in my possession again :) I felt like it made my decision much much easier in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Here were some other interesting nuggets I found out too!<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The accident only caused $400 of what needed to be fixed. <\/strong>Which means I would have had to pony up $430 moving into the state right out of my pocket! ACK!<\/li>\n<li><strong>The mechanic fixed my AC!!!<\/strong> He said he didn&#8217;t really do much other than jiggle a few things (that&#8217;s what she said?) but that&#8217;s fine with me &#8211; it&#8217;s now pumping out cold ass air again! First time in two years &#8211; freakin&#8217; awesome.<\/li>\n<li><strong>My title will NOT be getting a &#8220;totaled&#8221; designation!<\/strong> Which means I can sell it or trade it in at any point later whenever the time may come :) Turns out the rep who helped me hadn&#8217;t boned up on his knowledge there all the way so it was quite a surprise to come into :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>My settlement check only came out to $2,000 &#8211; instead of $2,100.<\/strong> That same rep above seemed to not be good with numbers either. He forgot to exclude some fees that didn&#8217;t relate since I chose to keep the car instead of give it to them&#8230; $100 is a $100, but not a big enough mistake for me to change my mind.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So when all was said and done, I came away from the accident with a few scratches (on the car, not me!) and <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$1,170 extra dough<\/strong><\/span> in my pockets<strong>.<\/strong> And with a much more appreciation for my car too, I&#8217;ll tell you what. That saying of letting things go and seeing how you feel? Man how there&#8217;s some truth to that. As soon as the possibility of losing this car entered the picture I started realizing how good I had it with her all these years, and how much I really wanted to keep her going forward. Not so much only a sentimental feeling either, but more of a &#8220;this car gets you from point a to point b, and in style!&#8221; type way. Along with having no car payments to boot ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here were some of the points <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/car-considered-total-loss-by-insurance\/\">y&#8217;all brought up<\/a>, by the way, for *not* keeping the ride.<\/strong> Which as I mentioned I did take into consideration and appreciate, but as you&#8217;ll see from my thoughts they weren&#8217;t enough to really sway me against keeping it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s a gas guzzler.<\/strong> 100% accurate (AND you have to put *premium* gas in it!), but since I drive it maybe once a week &#8211; and for only a few miles &#8211; it&#8217;s not really that much of a variable.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s bad for the environment.<\/strong> Very true too, as most cars are, but probably LESS so in my hands than someone else driving it on a daily basis. Or sitting in a junk yard somewhere :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don&#8217;t need a car.<\/strong> Also pretty much true! I don&#8217;t really *need* one, but I definitely *want* one. At least for the immediate future. The thing I am putting on pause, however, is the desire to <em>upgrade to a nice SUV<\/em> like I really want to do. I think I&#8217;ll just have to wait for our finances to settle in a bit more though, and then see how things are going in this great new state we&#8217;re living in. The nice thing about the caddy is it sure can hold a lot of stuff in the back of that trunk! Mobsters don&#8217;t ride around in them for nothing you know ;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now eventually I&#8217;ll of course have to move on to bigger and better rides as time goes on &#8211; she ain&#8217;t that young anymore! &#8211; but for right now I&#8217;m completely happy. We get to explore a whole new city together, and I now have over a thousand extra dollars in my pockets to help pay for the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/new-home-renovation-costs-18000\/\">house renovations<\/a> we got into last month. Not too bad of an outcome if I do say so myself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s not <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/car-considered-total-loss-by-insurance\/\">$3,500<\/a>, but it does feel &#8220;right.&#8221;<\/strong> And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll always go with at the end of the day. Feelings can be just as important as the numbers in my book, and I&#8217;d rather be happy on both sides of the equation than only one. So here&#8217;s to happy endings!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WOO!! I&#8217;m keeping it!
