Some of you said they really helped, so hopefully it&#8217;ll spark even more good thinking today :)<\/p>\n<p>And this time we started allllll the way in the back which proved to be much more entertaining for me as it was like teleporting 5 years into the past! In fact, the last draft (#602) was entered on May 19th, 2011, almost 5 years to this day exactly! Here&#8217;s what it said:<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Compounding interest trick &#8212; annoying!&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; Blog about how you find this trick annoying &#8216;cuz you never get to enjoy spending any of your money! From reader:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A Warren Buffett nugget from a biography I read: he used to protest when his wife wanted to spend, say, a hundred bucks on a dress because in his mind he would automatically compound that cost over 2 decades and would say something like, &#8220;is it really worth 1,800 bucks?!?&#8221; That&#8217;s just the way he always thinks.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Haha yup! I feel pretty much the same now about it than I did back then &#8211; it would be exhausting analyzing all your expenses like that! I get it for the big ones &#8211; I do the same &#8211; but I&#8217;d go mental thinking about all the potential growth being thrown away on every day items&#8230; But perhaps that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s the billionaire and I&#8217;m only a thousandaire? ;)<\/p>\n<h2>Here are a bunch of other unpolished observations and ideas that never saw the light of day either&#8230; Until today :)<\/h2>\n<p>Hope it helps!<\/p>\n<p>(Draft titles in bold, followed by quick thoughts)<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Where I&#8217;ve Been. Where I Am. Where I Want to Go.&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; I saw an old blogger friend break down her bucket list this way and always thought it was a cool idea. Here were my answers at the time: Where I&#8217;ve been: Broke. Where I am: In limbo.\u00a0 Where I want to go: At the end of the day, I just want to be happy. Whatever that happens to mean at the time. &lt;&#8211; That&#8217;s the dream we&#8217;re all fighting for, right? And the paths are always changing?<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;From now on, you must address me as Future Millionaire&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; Haha&#8230; Someone once called me that and I thought it was perfect since we&#8217;re ALL future millionaires so long as we continue working hard and paying attention :) Sounds much sexier than anything else we might be called, eh?<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to bitch when you need to.&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; Have you ever been having a really horrible day and you say something about it, only to hear back something to the affect of, &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be complaining &#8211; people in _____ have it much worst than you&#8221;? Drives me crazy. Yes, there will ALWAYS be someone (or some nation) that has it way worse off than we do, but why does that mean we&#8217;re not allowed to vent? Are we not allowed to have our own problems while simultaneously appreciating others&#8217;?<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Edison $1.00 bill&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/artdaily.com\/news\/68741\/One-in-a-billion--The--1-that-launched-Edison-and-GE-on-offer-at-Bonhams-New-York#.Vztseb7kpvn\" target=\"_blank\">this dollar bill<\/a> that went up for auction a couple years ago &#8211; the first one collected from Edison Electric Light Company i.e. GE i.e. Thomas Edison&#8217;s company to purchase electricity! I don&#8217;t know how much it ended up going for, but it was estimated to be valued around $8,000-$12,000 at the time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48294\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/first-dollar-edison-company.jpg\" alt=\"first dollar edison company\" width=\"600\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/first-dollar-edison-company.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/first-dollar-edison-company-300x126.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Work Hard, Party Hard&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; If there&#8217;s one thing I learned in college, it was that studying all the time was NOT the way for me to succeed. I studied my a$$ off, but more importantly I also partied my a$$ off :) And hung out with friends, interacted in my community, and pretty much did everything I could to enjoy those 4 glorious years before having to go into the real world. In comparison, I had friends that studied 24\/7 and ended up not only with subpar grades, but also stressed and unhappy! You have to find that happy medium as going in either extreme can be bad for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;When do you have &#8220;enough?&#8221;&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; The ultimate question right? Someone once left this in the comments and I&#8217;ve always liked it so I saved it: &#8220;The key is finding what is &#8220;enough&#8221;. You\u2019ll never have all the money in the world, and anyone could live on beans and rice in a broken down RV on $7,000\/yr. But figuring out exactly where in between those two extremes is &#8220;enough&#8221; for you is the secret to being and feeling wealthy. When you have &#8220;enough&#8221;, you are then wealthy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Just start telling people!&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m constantly amazed at how simple some things become once you start telling people about them. Not only is there a better shot of you hitting your goals once they&#8217;re out into the world, but you get a host of new accountability partners as well! If there&#8217;s anything you REALLY want to do\/get\/achieve right now, start telling people as you never know how they might help!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;All the treasures I found while cleaning up my basement&#8230;&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; For a month I had gone on a basement-cleaning binge and wanted to list everything I found and got rid of\/donated. However it looks like I got sidetracked as the only thing I had listed was &#8220;my lost comic book collection&#8221; haha&#8230; Which only amounted to approximately $20 bucks after then researching it\u00a0 &#8211; womp womp.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Tupac quote&#8221;<\/strong> &#8212; I love this &#8211; he was so grounded despite his own rise to fame!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There\u2019s no way that Michael Jackson or whoever Jackson should have a million thousand droople billion dollars and then there\u2019s people starving.

I know you got 40 billion dollars, but can you just keep it to one house? You only need ONE house. And if you only got two kids, can you just keep it to two rooms?

I used one of those credit card checks &#8211; gasp! But of course I had a plan :) First, to lock in a low interest rate (landed on 3.4% w\/ USAA), next, make sure to get a good deal on it (I bought it for only $3,100!), and lastly, pay it off sooner than later (I think I took 3-4 months to preserve some cash flow). Usually slapping a car on a credit card is a major no-no, but there are times where it may make sense!

And now we sleep on a $1,000 Tempurpedic! Haha&#8230; I kept meaning to blog about this to y&#8217;all as there are a TON of blog giveaways going on at any time &#8211; particularly in the mom blogger niche &#8211; but I guess I eventually forgot.

Which was great for all their readers so we could learn about other awesome $$$ sites too, however once the &#8220;business&#8221; of blogging came around people started phasing them out because it was &#8220;bad for SEO&#8221; and they didn&#8217;t want people leaving their own blogs and yada yada yada&#8230; Thankfully some bloggers still do roundups which helps, but man &#8211; I miss them! Was such a great way to find other blogs in the world!
