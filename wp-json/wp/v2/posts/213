I couldn&#8217;t believe it!  This is the same brother that needed to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/07\/i-loaned-my-brother-1230-and-i-will-be.html\">borrow money<\/a> to help finance his condo, and whom needed help erasing his debt &#8211; i love it!  The teacher is now learning from the student ;)<\/p>\n<p>I really think there&#8217;s something to that quote . DOING something about it instead of WORRYING is the ultimate way to go in my opinion, but on a general level (say, after you&#8217;ve already put a game plan in action), I believe he&#8217;s got it right. Get ready for word vomit:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Last Friday I opened up my mailbox, and there was a lovely card from mom in there.<\/span><\/span> Now, usually she sends me stuff for holidays, birthdays, etc in the mail, but i couldn&#8217;t quite figure out what was coming up. I tear open the envelope, and out drops a check! WTF? She already gave me her wedding gift (for $<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/06\/wachovia-bank-of-america-pnc-are-really.html\">1,000<\/a>!) so I was confused. As always, i wanted to read the card first before seeing how much was written on that bad boy. This is hard to do, mind you, but it&#8217;s always important to read it first ;)<\/p>\n<p>It turns out it was a thank you note! A what? What have i done lately that didn&#8217;t require anything selfish? haha&#8230;.Wellllll, it turns out to be a thank you for helping her win a potential lawsuit! You see, my late grandpa had some pretty shotty care over at a nursing home last year, and the facility didn&#8217;t seem to care. There was a lot of back and forth talk between my mom and the managers there, but ultimately they told her to just F off (they didn&#8217;t put it that way, but they might as well have!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>All my mom wanted was a sincere thank you, and half off one month&#8217;s rent there &#8211; about $1,200 I believe.<\/strong> I told her to basically say she&#8217;ll sue (in hopes they meet her request), but they just shrugged it off. My mom was pissed off, but wasn&#8217;t about to push harder as it was becoming too stressful. Well, I personally wasn&#8217;t too happy with that.<\/p>\n<p>It just so happened that Mrs. Budgetsaresexy worked directly FOR a lawyer, particularly one who manages unlawful injury cases, so we had her run it by her boss to see what he thought. And what do ya know, he thought we *might* have something here! He promised to draft a letter (which Mrs. Budgetsaresexy actually did for him), and said that the nursing home&#8217;s legal representation could either throw it in the trash, OR they could rebuttle and try and settle this thing w\/out going to court &#8211; something the letter mentioned, but something we def. weren&#8217;t gonna do.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:130%;\">Well, with everything in life, you never know unless you try right?<\/span><\/strong> And that we did. And a few months later, after a few back and forths and a LOT of heavy researching by the Mrs., the &#8220;case&#8221; settled! Would you like to know how much my Mom\/Grandma got out of the whole thing? $75,000! Can you believe that? All my mother had wanted was that sincere apology with a measely $1k credit, and they snubbed her. But look who got it now b*tches! haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So yeah, it was a thank you for the Mrs. and i doing all of that for her ;) I kinda went overboard w\/ this post a bit here (at least i warned you), but it does have some points! <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ask<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> for what you deserve.<\/span> You may not always get it, but it sure doesn&#8217;t hurt trying. And you might even get surprised every now and then!<\/li>\n<li><strong>E<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ncourage <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">your family members and friends.<\/span> Even though your parents are your parents, they don&#8217;t know everything out there, and sometimes we can help teach THEM ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong><\/strong>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Stop worrying<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> about money\u2014 you&#8217;ll get it when you least expect it, and you&#8217;ll lose it when you least expect it.<\/span>&#8221; That check my mom sent us? It was for $500 smackers!!! Woo-hoo FREEEEEEEEEEE Money! he he&#8230;we, of course, tried to refuse it, but you know how moms are&#8230;so here we are, $500.00 richer and another mark down for growing a pair and speaking up.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ll be posting this before i get off on another tangent&#8230;.which is very bad considering i&#8217;m at work right now and couldn&#8217;t tell you a thing that&#8217;s been going on around me in the past 30 minutes.
