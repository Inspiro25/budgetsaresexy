The one that&#8217;s staring me right in the face 3 feet away.\u00a0 Wow.<\/p>\n<p>I stand there for about 15 seconds running through all the possibilities of what&#8217;s about, or not about, to happen &#8211; and then I walk in.\u00a0 The whole time I&#8217;m climbing up those stairs, I just keep thinking &#8220;Today could be your last day. Today could be your last day.&#8221; I was a little giddy, and I was a little nervous. (okay, a LOT nervous)<\/p>\n<p>As soon as I walk through that door I&#8217;m called into &#8220;the office.&#8221;\u00a0 I&#8217;m told to take a seat, and I say something stupid like &#8220;is that the seat for fired people?&#8221; and I refuse to sit down ;)\u00a0 And then he Donald Trumps me.\u00a0 &#8220;Restructuring&#8221; he says. &#8220;Aka our company is flat broke,&#8221; I think. Goes on to tell me 1\/2 of the start-up is canned, and that he&#8217;s sorry it *had to be* done now, right before Xmas. No talk of severance, no signing of anything, no insurance mention, nothing.\u00a0 Just a 1-2-3 out the door you go.\u00a0 (after turning over my keys, of course.)<\/p>\n<p>5 years at the company over. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/05\/what-would-you-do-if-you-lost-your-job-tomorrow\/\">Just like that<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>What I did over the next hour<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of things that go through your mind at this point &#8211; but the one thing I didn&#8217;t want to do was burn any bridges. \u00a0 After all, a man&#8217;s gotta keep his reputation!\u00a0 Do you want to be known as the guy who told you to F*ck off and that he hates your face? Of course not.\u00a0 You want to leave that joint as smoothly and smartly as the first day you signed on.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, as far as my situation went, who the hell was going to MAKE all the stuff our company was selling? All those websites and baubles and widgets, etc? I&#8217;m the only designer?? They hadn&#8217;t thought about that yet (you&#8217;ll see why in a bit), so I promptly emailed everyone in the company &#8211; from my personal email since my work email had been disabled &#8211; and let them know it was a pleasure working with them.\u00a0 And it had been &#8211; for the most part :)\u00a0 And then I called my CEO (who wasn&#8217;t the one who fired me) and thanked him as well. Because I think it&#8217;s an important thing to do, and it also shows respect.<\/p>\n<p>But ultimately, all that thanking and ass kissing helps set you up for one thing, and one thing only &#8211; future business.\u00a0 Maybe off a reference, or a lead, or even with the same company down the road &#8211; you just never know. So within all the thank yous and &#8220;let&#8217;s grab beers&#8221; sometimes, I planted the seed that the Design Shop of J$ is now open for business! Even though I have no idea if it is, or if I&#8217;d even want to be associated w\/ the company ever again.<\/p>\n<p>And guess what happened?\u00a0 <em><strong>The same guy that fired me 4 hours earlier called me up and said he needed my help?!!!<\/strong><\/em> HAH!\u00a0 Didn&#8217;t see that one coming ;)\u00a0 Who knows if anything will come of it (we&#8217;re still in talks to see if this new relationship makes sense &#8211; aka if they want to pay my now higher freelance rates!), but the point is you just really never know.\u00a0 And if you can be proactive about it, and let people know how you can benefit THEM &#8211; even when they&#8217;re least expecting it (like when they&#8217;re firing you) or they don&#8217;t even know they need you &#8211; the chances of success becomes much higher.<\/p>\n<p>It was then time to pack up, and get out of there.<\/p>\n<h2>My Newly Designed Lifestyle<\/h2>\n<p>So now what? What happens when you&#8217;re now part of an ugly statistic of unemployment? Party time &#8211; Wooooo!!!!\u00a0 Haha&#8230;.\u00a0\u00a0 nah, this ain&#8217;t the old J$ anymore ;) While I did consume 2 adult beverages with a friend right after, I simply went into survival mode and powered up Plan B.\u00a0 The plan I was trying to pull off come January 1st, and the one I&#8217;d been <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/my-new-savings-goal\/\">saving up $50,000 for<\/a>.\u00a0 You know &#8211; The &#8220;<em><strong>be the boss of me<\/strong><\/em>&#8221; one!\u00a0 We&#8217;re two weeks ahead of schedule, and about $4,000 off (boooooo) but reality is what it is and you&#8217;ve gotta do what it takes to make $hit happen.<\/p>\n<p>I called up my girl who&#8217;d been holding a desk for me at her awesomely sexy design studio (where I&#8217;m currently typing this out) and I told her the time has finally come.\u00a0 She welcomed me in, I signed my new $500\/mo office lease, and one hour later I was unpacked and working out of the new J.
