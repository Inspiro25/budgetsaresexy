(But&#8230;)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Welcome to Friday, hustlers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You know how everyone&#8217;s always talking about &#8220;keeping up with the Joneses,&#8221; and how it&#8217;s best to not compare yourselves to others? Well, this <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/would-you-rather\/\" target=\"_blank\">Would You Rather<\/a> we&#8217;ve got for you today will test you on just that ;) I reckon most of you will vote the financially smart way considering you&#8217;re on this site, but do try to answer this honestly so we can get a good discussion going.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You ready for it? Here we go&#8230;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Would you rather&#8230;. Have a salary of $50,000 where everyone around you only has $25,000 &#8211; OR &#8211; Make $100,000 but everyone around you makes $200,000?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Haha&#8230; Not as clear cut is it? Obviously making more is the best answer for you and your goals\/family, but what happens when everyone around you is making double? For presumably doing the same amount of work as you are? (There&#8217;s a ton of factors that would go into this of course, so let&#8217;s just assume everything else in life is the same besides the salary people are making).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would you be able to comfortably live your life when everyone&#8217;s blowing more $$ on fancier cars, houses, vacations, toys, etc?<\/strong> Which odds would go in that direction since a vast majority of people aren&#8217;t as sexy with their money as you are? How would the quality of your life change? Or would it? (Also, what happens to everyone else&#8217;s life in the reverse? $25k is not much for most people.)<\/p>\n<p>Initially I chose the $100,000 off the bat, but then I stopped and pictured exactly where I&#8217;m living now and pretended that all my neighbors, friends, etc were all making $200,000. Would that make me feel funny? Truthfully &#8211; yes. It definitely doesn&#8217;t make me feel BETTER, haha&#8230; But why? Do I care about fancier stuff or what others are doing? Not really. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/ignore-stock-experts\/\" target=\"_blank\">I ignore most everyone<\/a>. But the idea that I&#8217;d be the only one with 1\/2 of what everyone else gets just feels weird. And again, in this situation it&#8217;s not like I could work more or get a better job\/etc to pump up the $$$ &#8211; we&#8217;re all magically stuck at our salaries!<\/p>\n<p>And perhaps that&#8217;s the problem I have with this. It strips away the level of effort or smarts we all have. Everyone gets a flat $200,000 instead of those of us who choose $100,000 no matter how awesome or sucky we are at our jobs. You&#8217;re forever earning 50% less!<\/p>\n<p><strong>But then I close my eyes and focus on what a lifestyle of earning $100,000 would mean.<\/strong> Would I be able to live an awesome life? Hell yeah! In fact, I&#8217;ve earned $100,000 or more two out of the last three years, and I can damn well tell you it&#8217;s better than making $50,000 :) The ratio of lifestyle and happiness isn&#8217;t an incredible amount (it doesn&#8217;t take much for me to enjoy my life), but it&#8217;s certainly noticeable. And frankly, much more desirable. With an extra $50,000 you could speed up your goals an\u00a0extraordinary amount.<\/p>\n<p>[Of course, the main problem w\/ this whole question is that we&#8217;re not all making the same amount of money right now so depending on where you are on the scale, $100k might sound lame if you&#8217;re making more, and $50k might sound incredible if you&#8217;re making less. But just play along anyways and assume this morning that everyone&#8217;s salaries got wiped away and now 99.9999999% of the world will make the same amount, and then there&#8217;s you ;)]<\/p>\n<p><strong>When all things are considered however, I&#8217;d opt for the $100,000 in the end.<\/strong> Yeah the emotions might take some getting used to, but ultimately I&#8217;d need to do what&#8217;s best for me and my family. And we can live a much better &#8211; less stressed &#8211; life at $100k\/year than we could at $50k. We could make $50k work too if needed, but with a magical fairy doubling it on the spot why not? Also, wouldn&#8217;t that mean my wife now makes $200,000? ;) Ooooh!!! Yet another factor to consider! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>The Harvard Study: Is More Always Better?<\/h2>\n<p>Before I turn it over to you to get your thoughts, let me tell you where this whole thing came from&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I was reading one of my newer favorite blogs, <a href=\"http:\/\/awealthofcommonsense.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">A Wealth of Common Sense<\/a>, and one of the articles Ben wrote was on <a href=\"http:\/\/awealthofcommonsense.com\/relative\/\" target=\"_blank\">a study that Harvard researchers did<\/a> on how people (and monkeys!) compare themselves to others. They asked this same salary question to their subjects, and here were the results:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In the end 52% of the respondents preferred the $50K scenario. These people would accept half as much money in absolute terms as the second option just so they could make twice as much as their neighbors&#8230; Unfortunately, perception matters when money is involved. The problem is that there will always be someone getting richer at a faster pace than you are. Stating the obvious, this is not a great way to live your life.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So more people chose the $50,000 option than the $100,000 option! WOW! I figured it wouldn&#8217;t be a total win for the $100k&#8217;ers, but to LOSE the battle in the end? Pretty incredible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;d like to see the entire story by Harvard, I dug it up here [PDF]:<\/strong> Is more always better?: A survey on positional concerns<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of garble in there (ie. stuff that only smart people would follow ;)), but here were some other interesting choices they gave people:<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> You have 2 weeks of vacation; others have 1 week.<br \/>\n<strong>B:<\/strong> You have 4 weeks of vacation; others have 8 weeks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Your IQ is 110; others average 90.<br \/>\n<strong>B:<\/strong> Your IQ is 130; others average 150.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Your physical attractiveness is 6; others average 4.<br \/>\n<strong>B:<\/strong> Your physical attractiveness is 8; others average 10.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Your child has 12 years of education (high school); other people&#8217;s children have 8.<br \/>\n<strong>B:<\/strong> Your child has 16 years of education (college); other people&#8217;s children have 20 (graduate degree).<\/p>\n<p><strong>This must have been one fun study :) Here are the choices I would have made:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vacation:<\/strong> More! I could really care less about others here (my wife agreed)<\/li>\n<li><strong>IQ:<\/strong> I was torn 50\/50. I hate feeling stupid around people, even if I&#8217;m smart at 130 (wouldn&#8217;t the scales not matter anymore if everyone else is smarter than you thus making you not smart?)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Attractiveness:<\/strong> Same problem I have w\/ the rating here too, but I&#8217;d def. choose 8 :) Would be hard to erase what we consider attractive after living a life having a perception of it already.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Child&#8217;s education:<\/strong> More every time! As much as I don&#8217;t care much about other people in normal situations (ie, not in weird magical land like this one), I DEFINITELY don&#8217;t care at all about other children&#8230; Wait, that sounded bad, haha&#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t care whether they&#8217;re smarter\/better or worse than mine. I just want my boys to be happy and healthy and live a great life!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Okay, <em>now<\/em> it&#8217;s your turn.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>What would you rather have? $50k while everyone else has a $25k salary, or a $100k salary when everyone else has $200k?
