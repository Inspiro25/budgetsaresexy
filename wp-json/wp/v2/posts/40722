And boy did those markets rally! A $13k gain for us without lifting a finger. Talk about the power of investing!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also got a call set up today for my 4th (possibly) new money coaching client too. I&#8217;ve been having a blast since <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/official-money-coach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starting this<\/a> the other month, and I&#8217;m learning a ton about human behavior and how we all think and deal with our own money in the process. It&#8217;s incredible how different we all are, yet our wants and goals in the end are relatively the same. Some of just just go about it in realllllly weird ways, haha&#8230; the &#8220;detours of life,&#8221; if you will :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And true to what the vets told me when asking for advice<\/strong>, you never know what you&#8217;re gonna get on the end of some of these calls! My last one (client #3) was taken in a tattoo parlor by the guy &#8211; and not because he worked there or owned it. HE WAS GETTING A TATTOO! While literally on the phone with me talking about debt! Haha&#8230; I could hear the needle humming the entire time in the background, what a riot :) And before you ask, the tattoo was a gift.<\/p>\n<p>But enough about me (for now). Let&#8217;s talk about another guy who randomly left his pay stub on the street for passerbys like me to find and look at (who wouldn&#8217;t?). I&#8217;m always on the hunt for fun cool stuff on my daily walks (last year I found a letter from a convict in jail to his &#8220;boo&#8221; crumpled up on the sidewalk), and this time we came across some fiscally sexy stuff &#8211; check it out:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40729\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/found-pay-stub.jpg\" alt=\"found pay stub\" width=\"600\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/found-pay-stub.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/found-pay-stub-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Any guesses as to what this guy does? His taxes are low! I cropped out all the personal stuff like his name and partial social security number (!!!!) but I&#8217;m always fascinated by the income of others so thought you guys would like this too. The interesting part was that this guy got paid *daily* which leads me to believe it&#8217;s some sort of temp work going on.\u00a0 Though the yearly &#8220;to date&#8221; is quite high for that to be the case? Some months I feel like I only get paid $8.00 an hour to be blogging myself, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another reminder to KEEP YOUR PAPERWORK SAFE though!<\/strong> You don&#8217;t want randos like me picking your stuff up and doing who knows what with (blogging it to the world, perhaps? :)). If you don&#8217;t want to file it away, at least *shred* them so they don&#8217;t walk away into the wrong hands&#8230; The sad part is that I found <em>another<\/em> pay stub a mere 8 blocks away from the first one, and when I looked at that one too IT WAS FROM THE SAME PERSON! So either this guy really throws caution to the wind, or the wind literally decided to have some fun that morning&#8230; Either way, it&#8217;s not meant to be on the streets.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Okay, now to the numbers&#8230; Here&#8217;s how August broke down:<\/h2>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CASH SAVINGS<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$3,763.02)<\/span><\/strong>: Another month of negative cash flow. Now weakened even more with baby #2 now going to daycare, ugh&#8230; That tacks on an additional $1,000\/mo meaning we now pay more for day care ($2k\/mo)\u00a0 than we do our own roofs over our heads! How crazy is that? Of course we knew it coming into the month so it&#8217;s not like it was a shock or anything, but still. Stings just as hard. On the plus side, this means the Mrs. now has her days back which means dissertation time and then soon another full-time income in the mix! WOOHOO! Sound the alarms!!! haha&#8230; Saying I cannot wait is an understatement ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">529 College Savings<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$130.30)<\/span><\/strong>: The rest of the net worth here is looking mighty tasty. Starting with our 529 college accounts that went up due to the market rising this month (we didn&#8217;t put any extra in, at least yet). We&#8217;ll be hearing soon about that inheritance on my wife&#8217;s side as well, so if that comes through we&#8217;ll be dumping it straight into here per the wishes of the relative who passed.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IRA: ROTH(s)<\/span><span style=\"color: #008000;\"> (+$3,164.33)<\/span><\/strong>: Our Roths also went up without any new money injected. We wait until the end of every tax year to dump in our maxes (since our income is so sporadic over the year), so we won&#8217;t have any extra contributions for quite some time.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IRA: SEP<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$13,109.38)<\/span><\/strong>: BAM! That&#8217;s nice! If only we had tons of money to put in it last month while it was lower ;) But similar to our Roths above, we don&#8217;t inject any money here until the end of the tax year as well &#8211; even more so because it&#8217;s tied to business profit (which is lower than normal this year). I always set some aside to max out what we&#8217;re allowed to put into my SEP though, so regardless of the income at least it feels good to be able to invest into our future for many years to come. And I purposely put our $$ into accounts that penalize you for pulling it out early so it forces me <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/no-touchy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to keep my fingers off it<\/a>! You should consider it too if you have a problem letting stuff sit and grow over time&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the total return we&#8217;ve gotten so far <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">since moving to Vanguard<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40723\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/vanguard-graph-aug-14.jpg\" alt=\"vanguard performance\" width=\"311\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/vanguard-graph-aug-14.jpg 311w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/vanguard-graph-aug-14-300x290.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">AUTOS WORTH (kbb)<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$329.00)<\/span><\/strong>: Another month of doing what cars are supposed to do &#8211; lose value every month&#8230; And for once <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/franken-caddy-car-keeps-making-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Franken-Car<\/a> hasn&#8217;t gotten into any accidents &#8211; a new record! ;) Here are the values of both our cars:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pimp Daddy Caddy: $1,000.00<\/li>\n<li>Gas Ticklin\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/toyota_before_after.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toyota<\/a>: $6,362.00<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">HOME VALUE (Realtor)<\/span> <\/strong><strong>($0.00):<\/strong> Still set at the $300k <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/net-worth-update-may-449k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our realtor advised us it&#8217;s around<\/a> when asked the other month. We don&#8217;t have plans on selling it anytime soon, but we&#8217;ll probably reconsider once it&#8217;s time to renew our tenant&#8217;s lease again come next year. I know real estate is primo importante when it comes to building wealth, but man. I just don&#8217;t like having something &#8220;out there&#8221; that can go wrong at any time, ya know? Feels like it goes against my wannabe minimalism ways too. I wonder how many true minimalists own multiple homes? Even as investments? Would be an interesting study to research!<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MORTGAGES<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(-$678.33)<\/span><\/strong>: Our equity is finally building again with each and every month! Two months ago we finally crossed that milestone of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/net-worth-update-june-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no longer being underwater<\/a> anymore, and I can&#8217;t tell you how AWESOME that feels. It sucks that the $60k we&#8217;ve dumped into it over the years is probably gone forever, but at least we never have to pay it back again!<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the crazy part about homes\/investments &#8211; the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/money-vs-moral-values-part-2\/\">values<\/a> can change all over the place even though it&#8217;s the EXACT SAME THING. Nothing happened to our house (except for upgrades!) to warrant it being worth more or less, but as the market and economy changes so does values slapped upon it. So even though you paid $XX for a house doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s worth that anymore. Hopefully y&#8217;all were a lot smarter than we were though having bought it on a whim right before the crash &#8211; d&#8217;oh.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the balances on both our mortgages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/05\/we-refinanced-our-mortgage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1st Mortgage<\/a>: $271,137.19 (30 year conventional @ 5.5%)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/07\/personal-finance-lesson-learned-hard\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2nd Mortgage<\/a>: $27,494.84 (HELOC @ variable 2.8%)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&#8217;s how the last year&#8217;s been going&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40726\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-12-months-aug-14.jpg\" alt=\"net worth past 12 months\" width=\"509\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-12-months-aug-14.jpg 509w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-12-months-aug-14-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" \/><\/a><strong>And that wraps up another month! <\/strong>I believe we&#8217;re now moving onto month #80 since first tracking this over 6 and 1\/2 years ago &#8211; pretty wild huh?
