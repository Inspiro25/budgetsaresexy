Show him some love if you like this at the end, and watch out for that inner rockstar of yours this weekend! :)]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***************<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever felt stuck between doing what\u2019s good for you, and doing what\u2019s right?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been grappling with this issue <a href=\"http:\/\/familymoneyplan.com\/slaying-mortgage-dragon-paid-off-mortgage-320k-6-years\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">since we paid off our mortgage<\/a>. You see, I wanted to jump right into pursuing financial freedom but\u2026 I\u2019m also ready to stop living frugally and just say \u201cScrew it, party time!!!! I\u2019m going to go and buy everything I want for a while!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are these two opposing forces inside of me, and they are pulling different ways&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>In this corner, we have the Accountant<\/h2>\n<p>Meet the Accountant. I call him Andrew, he\u2019s good with money, and wouldn\u2019t know fun if it poured tequila down his throat. This guy is a minimalist at heart. If you ask him how to be financially free, his answer is going to be something like this:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Cut out everything, reduce expenses, buy a cheap house, or no house at all. Live off the grid and syphon your utilities from your neighbor, or better yet don\u2019t have any utilities at all.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Phone plan? <\/strong><em>&#8220;Why bother you don\u2019t need friends, they just cost money.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Internet? <\/strong><em>&#8220;People got along fine for 2,000 years before it, probably a fad, forget about it.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Clothes? <\/strong><em>&#8220;One outfit will do. Hey, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/keep-learning-keep-growing\/why-steve-jobs-wore-the-same-outfit-every-day-f792072f7ecf#.mo6zyyg8l\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it was good enough for Steve Jobs<\/a>! Wash it in the rain and dry it in the sun. You don\u2019t need any more clothes than that. You got rid of your friends, remember?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The accountant would keep slashing every expense until there was nothing left to slash. That\u2019s good, to an extent. We need to be an Accountant once in a while; otherwise we would go off the financial rails and never return.<\/p>\n<h2>In the other corner\u2026 the Rockstar!<\/h2>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the Rockstar inside of me. I call him Andy. His thoughts go something like this:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Nothing to do tonight? Let\u2019s go to Fiji!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Got a spare half hour? Let\u2019s call up anyone, or even better yet&#8230; Call EVERYONE! Let\u2019s go out for a drink and see where the night goes!&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Hey! Here&#8217;s a great idea\u2026 lets have 20 drinks and buy everyone in the bar a couple of rounds. Let&#8217;s live it up all day long, and live for the moment, like tomorrow may never come. That\u2019s why we are here right? Life is meant to be lived, not shackled to financial sensibility. You can\u2019t take it with you. What if you got hit by a bus?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We all have the Rockstar inside of us. You may have buried him\/her deep down, but it\u2019s in there. Go on admit it, it\u2019s just you and me here. Sometimes that fun loving carefree live-for-the-moment, &#8220;It\u2019s Only Money&#8221; personality needs to come out. Ain\u2019t nothing wrong with that.<\/p>\n<h2>Then There\u2019s Me\u2026 The Referee<\/h2>\n<p>Then there\u2019s me. Stuck in the middle, with these two guys pulling me in opposite directions. Sometimes the Accountant wins. Sometimes it\u2019s the Rockstar with a knockout. Other times it\u2019s a draw.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many times that I just want to say: &#8220;Forget the future! I want what I want, and I\u2019m going to have it.&#8221; Whether it\u2019s a cup cake when we\u2019re abstaining from carbs, or buying a huge TV that I just can\u2019t stand seeing anymore in the store because I\u2019ve been looking at it every day for a year&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the levy breaks and the Rockstar wins. Other times it&#8217;s the Accountant whose rationalizations win out: &#8220;You can\u2019t get that, it\u2019s not prudent&#8221; hey says. And, &#8220;Wait a little longer &#8211; it&#8217;s not time.&#8221; He\u2019s the one looking at our cable bill daily asking, &#8220;Why haven\u2019t we slashed this yet?&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What it looks like in the end&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen the extremes at the end of these guys&#8217; lives. I\u2019ve actually worked with the old Rockstars and the old Accountants.<\/p>\n<p>The Rockstar is broke, working a part-time gig as a minimum wage worker in their 70\u2019s because they don\u2019t have any savings and are in way too much debt. But there\u2019s a never-ending pile of stories that are almost too wild to believe. Their financial situation is, well, let\u2019s just say it isn\u2019t pretty. Non-existent is the word that comes to mind.<\/p>\n<p>The Accountant will be better off financially in the end. Living in a tent, wearing his one outfit cut off from the world. But they&#8217;re always thinking: \u201cI should have taken more risk\u201d, or \u201cI should have done more when I had the chance.&#8221; Not bad, but not great.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to have \u201cWhat ifs?\u201d when I get older.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>So what\u2019s a guy to do?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Personally, I like to nurture them both. You see, without my Accountant-side I\u2019m going to be in deep debt before the end of this article. (Amazon is always a click away!). Accountant Andrew needs to know he\u2019s got a say.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, if we keep Rockstar Andy locked up for too long, when he finally gets out he\u2019s going to hit the credit cards harder than two kids in a mosh pit (for those of you too young for mosh pits, you missed out\u2026 big time).<\/p>\n<p>So he needs to come out and play once in a while. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but when you let him out life seems a little more fun. Expensive, but fun!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to keep the Rockstar from going all &#8220;Kanye&#8221; on your wallet<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48134\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kanye-face.jpg\" alt=\"kanye face\" width=\"550\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kanye-face.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kanye-face-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember when I told you the Rockstar is waiting to blow the lid off this place? Here\u2019s some tips on managing him:<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. Celebrate the Little Wins.. A LOT!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the Accountant keeps tightening the guitar strings, eventually they are going to snap. We don\u2019t need the Rockstar showing up with the band at 3:00 am ready to party like&#8230; well, like a Rockstar. You need to release the money tension as you go. Celebrate a little, and do it often.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll tell you something I haven\u2019t told anyone before.<\/p>\n<p>When we were paying off our $320K mortgage for those 6 long years, it was hard. We had to throw everything at the mortgage in order to do it. If we didn\u2019t have a reward system in place, we never would have made it. Our reward system kept Rockstar Andy in check.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t have a lot of money left over, so we would find ways to treat ourselves with whatever made sense. It didn\u2019t have to be big, but our efforts did need to be celebrated.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, I love cinnamon buns. I love them the way Accountant\u2019s love calculators. So every time we put an extra payment down on the house&#8230; Boom! Cinnamon buns! The Rockstar was in his happy place. So simple&#8230; so sweet&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. Give yourself some party money<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Even with all the little treats, when we were paying down our mortgage there were times the Rockstar would get so loud that it was deafening.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI want this new toy.\u201d <\/em> <em>\u201cMan would a trip to Cabo be sweet right now.\u201d<\/em> <em>\u201cLet\u2019s buy that new TV!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s so hard to not listen to him. All those ideas sound awesome. You aren\u2019t going to make it very far unless you show this guy some love once in a while.<\/p>\n<p>Give yourself some play cash, or \u201cbeer money\u201d as the Rockstar calls it, every month. Hell, or \u201cHeck\u201d as the Accountant says, it can be as little as a 20 bucks. Go out and enjoy the moment! Do what ever you want with that cash. Rockstars don\u2019t answer to anyone.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230; When that money is gone, that\u2019s the end of it. Don&#8217;t ever give the Rockstar the credit cards. Living for the moment means <em>paying for it<\/em> in the moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. If all else fails&#8230; Compromise<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wanna party like it\u2019s 1999? Great! Call up your friends and have a House Party, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1FhRhzAWzLA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like the Sam Hunt song suggests<\/a>. All the fun without the cover charge, and you don\u2019t need to pay for a cab. Plus, the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/is-brewing-your-own-beer-cheaper-than-buying-yes-after-261-beers\/\">beer is a lot cheaper<\/a> at home.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of going somewhere tropical, jump in the car and see where a tank of gas gets you for a one-night getaway. Nurture the fun side, without blowing the budget.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>So who wins out? The Rockstar or the Accountant?<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing, both are necessary.<\/p>\n<p>You can try to keep your Rockstar buried deep down inside you, and it might be all-good. Maybe all-good for a very long time. But he\u2019s in there waiting. Waiting for you to have a moment of weakness. Waiting to blow the roof off and have a Whole Lotta Fun!<\/p>\n<p>Planning for the future is essential, but so is having fun. Your life isn\u2019t about your bank account; it\u2019s the experiences you have and share with others around you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let the Rockstar out once in a while, and enjoy life\u2026 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Just make sure the Accountant is the one who wakes up in the morning :)<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>******<br \/>\n<em>Andrew Daniels blogs over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.familymoneyplan.com\/\">Family Money Plan<\/a>, where he writes about how he paid off his $320,000 mortgage in 6 years and is now focused on finding financial freedom.
