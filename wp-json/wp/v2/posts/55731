Sometimes you just need a little accountability and to make sure you&#8217;re headed in the right direction! Which $$$ coaches are perfect for!<\/p>\n<p>(And which doesn&#8217;t require having gobs of money to invest either, something financial advisors are notorious for only caring about&#8230; Money coaches will help you whether you have $0.00 or $1,000,000 laying around, but set you up so you *can* invest later in the future whenever you&#8217;re able\/ready to!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s better &#8211; these sessions by Capital One are shaped around your *life* and *goals* vs the money itself, since that&#8217;s going to be the driving force behind your success anyways.<\/strong> <strong>The &#8220;why&#8221; as they say!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know what you TRULY want to get out of life, ain\u2019t no money planning going to help you as you need that set of values and priorities down right. And this money coaching they offer is set up to guide you in exactly this manner.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/local\/moneycoaching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what they cover<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Session 1:<\/strong> &#8220;Get Clarity&#8221; &#8212; You&#8217;ll explore what matters to you, and where you want to go with your life and money.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Session 2:<\/strong> &#8220;Remove Roadblocks&#8221; &#8212; You\u2019ll uncover what\u2019s weighing you down and keeping you from making changes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Session 3:<\/strong> &#8220;Make a Plan&#8221; &#8212; You\u2019ll create a plan with your coach so you can do more to reach your goals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So yeah &#8211; if that sounds like something you need in your life right now, you can learn more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/local\/moneycoaching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>, or check out their list of Caf\u00e9s which offer these free coaching sessions <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/local\/moneycoaching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*********<\/p>\n<h2>I also caught a bunch of stats from their &#8220;2018 Financial Freedom Survey&#8221; which you also might find interesting&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Nothing TOO crazy in them, but if you find yourself in the majority of the win section here, it&#8217;s something to feel pretty proud about for sure :) Be thankful you&#8217;ve come this far!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Nearly half of non-retired Americans are still struggling to save money for the future and don\u2019t think they earn enough to save sufficiently for retirement &#8211; same as in 2015.&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(This is why it\u2019s sooooo good to get started EARLY on this mission!! Get used to diverting some money early on before you miss any of it, and then gradually increase it as you go and get raises\/bonuses\/promotions\/etc. Lifestyle inflation is the devil!)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&#8220;While most (69%) non-retired Americans are saving some amount for retirement, just 15% are saving more than 15% of their income for retirement.&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Better than 0% though! Or 10% &#8211; which is the industry &#8220;standard&#8221; for some reason? It, of course, depends on what stage you are in all this, but the faster you can bump those numbers up, the better chance you have at living that ideal lifestyle of yours and hopefully being able to retire at a decent age\u2026 or at least work on the stuff that <em>really matters<\/em> to you and not have to worry or think about $$ as much! Which is the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/retiring-early-means-being-financially-free\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ultimate goal of financial management<\/a> \u2013 dealing with money <em>now<\/em> so you don\u2019t have to deal with it later! :))<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Only one-fifth of women (22%) say they are very confident they\u2019re sufficiently saving (compared to 39% of men).&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(I don\u2019t know enough to guess why women and men are so different [and not going to dare guess, haha\u2026] but if you\u2019re a woman here reading this, please chime in below and we\u2019ll discuss :))<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&#8220;63% are willing to give up meals at restaurants and 61%, big ticket items. Millennials and Gen X are most willing to give up these luxuries.&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Good!!! That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have to do if you want to build up that $$$ faster! Unless of course it\u2019s your #1 or #2 priority \u2013 which is fine \u2013 but <em>only<\/em> if you\u2019re cutting back on all the stuff that *isn\u2019t* in that case. I don\u2019t care if you blow all your money on stuffed animals or marbles \u2013 just make sure it\u2019s going towards something that makes you happy and not stuff that doesn\u2019t!)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&#8220;If Americans had access to an extra $1,000, more than half (52%) would save it or use it to pay down debt; only 10% would use it to buy something special.&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Gotta love it :) It\u2019s not 70% or 80%, but hey \u2013 baby steps! Although what people *say* they\u2019d do and what they\u2019d *actually* do are usually quite different, haha&#8230; It\u2019s much harder to not spend all that cash when it\u2019s smack in your lap than when some magical genie pops up and asks you about it ;))<\/p>\n<h2>So basically&#8230;<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention to your money <i>now<\/i> vs later for the best shot of success!<\/li>\n<li>Align your life with your goals\/values, while keeping the <b><i>Big Picture<\/i><\/b> in mind \u2013 since that\u2019s really what you\u2019re after in the end, not the dollars and cents!<\/li>\n<li>Remember to be proud of how far you\u2019ve come over the years, even if it\u2019s not as far as others. (And spoiler alert \u2013 you usually never know how *well* everyone else is doing anyways &#8211; they&#8217;re good at putting on a show!)<\/li>\n<li>And lastly, if you can benefit from some good ol&#8217; fashion accountability, make sure to take advantage of Capital One&#8217;s free money coaching sessions hosted at a number of their Caf\u00e9s!
