Because we are the ones who are actually giving\u00a0YOU\u00a0money!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s very much true.<\/p>\n<p>After literally YEARS of trying to figure out how to best harness our community here TO DO GOOD,\u00a0my partner-in-crime and I (<a href=\"http:\/\/natestpierre.me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nate St. Pierre<\/a>, who you might remember from our <a href=\"http:\/\/lovedrop.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Love Drop<\/a> days) finally come up with an idea that we think is half genius\/half crazy. And thankfully we already know it\u00a0works because we tested it last month :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>We handed out fifty $20 Visa cards (what we&#8217;re dubbing #GivingCards) to people in our forums, with the only rules being that they have to go out and use it to better someone&#8217;s life, and then come back and tell us what they did.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And what they did was AMAZING.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/communityfund.lovedrop.us\/total\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50400\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rockstar-giving-cards.jpg\" alt=\"rockstar #givingcards\" width=\"600\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rockstar-giving-cards.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rockstar-giving-cards-300x215.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>We hit roughly half of the entire United States, all the way through Canada and even as far as\u00a0India (!!).<\/strong> <strong>One person\u00a0even snuck a few into the White House for random acts of kindness.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yup, the\u00a0White House.<\/p>\n<p>(Last we checked it was still sitting in a coffee table book right outside the Oval Office &#8211; hah)<\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t even make up this stuff because it was all done by people in our community dropping love in their own personal way.\u00a0Here were <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/community-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some other things <\/a>they did that completely blew us away:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One person turned the $20 into over $300 from her own community, and then anonymously used it to pay off the overdue lunch accounts at their local middle school for underserved kids. (Which ended up landing on the front page of their town&#8217;s paper!)<\/li>\n<li>One giver used it to help make a\u00a0Syrian refugee&#8217;s resettlement house feel a little more like home.<\/li>\n<li>And then another person went totally personal and custom-made a pillow for a grieving widow, using shirts from her late husband (!!). I&#8217;m not going to lie &#8211; I teared up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>All of these were done with just $20 and putting in some thought. Proving once again that small acts of kindness stretch far!! Especially when you do it in a way that&#8217;s meaningful to <em>you<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s what our new Community Fund is all about. Helping people give in a fun and meaningful way. And to help facilitate that we&#8217;re starting\u00a0with three simple projects:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The #GivingCards Project<\/strong> &#8212; What I mentioned above, where every month we hand out a stack of $20\u00a0Visa Cards\u00a0to whoever wants them, so long as they promise to use them for Good and share what they did.<\/li>\n<li><strong>#DebtDrop<\/strong> &#8212; Where we look for people struggling with debt, and then shoot them a\u00a0no-strings-attached $50 to give them a little hope for the day and let them know they&#8217;re not alone. This project was inspired, and\u00a0is led by Melanie Lockert of DearDebt.com who has been doing this behind the scenes on her own blog going on a year now (and having given out over $900 already!).<\/li>\n<li><strong>And then lastly, our Just-In-Time Giving\u00a0initiative<\/strong> &#8212; Where we set aside a little money to be used on the fly anytime we see a need for it in our community. For example, last month we found out that fellow blogger Athena Lent was diagnosed with cancer, so we were able to quickly give some money to her fundraising page for future surgeries. It&#8217;s nice having money set aside to be able to help fast!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>And that&#8217;s what our Community Fund is in a nutshell:\u00a0 a pot of money to be able to help those around us in a direct, and powerful way &#8211; every single month.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whether through one of our current three initiatives above, or future ones we are inspired to fund that are sent to us by our members. So if you have an idea of your own you&#8217;ve always wanted to do (or are currently doing and want to amplify it!), let us know! We&#8217;re thinking of the entire initiative really as an &#8220;incubator of good&#8221; :)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/community-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50404\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rcf-heart-logo.jpg\" alt=\"rockstar community fund\" width=\"367\" height=\"127\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rcf-heart-logo.jpg 407w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rcf-heart-logo-300x104.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>There are\u00a0other ways to get involved as well if it&#8217;s something that\u00a0moves you.<\/strong> Here&#8217;s our main page with details\u00a0&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/community-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Involved With the RCF<\/a>\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0but the\u00a0thing we REALLY need the most right now is just <em>getting the word\u00a0out<strong>.<\/strong> <\/em>The bigger we can make this thing, the more good we can do month after month after month.
