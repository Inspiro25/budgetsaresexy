I even discovered a trail down the street full of creeks and boulders and these cute little waterfalls!<\/p>\n<p>Now my runs weren&#8217;t Forrest Gump impressive or anything (the first one lasted 3 minutes, and we&#8217;re now up to the 20&#8217;ish mark) but hey &#8211; I *started*. And more importantly than that &#8211; I haven&#8217;t given up!! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which brings me to the point of all this humble bragging: sometimes you have to hear things over and over again until it finally moves you to take action.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So with that in mind, I&#8217;m going to post those 7 habits again below in hopes they spark something inside of you too! The 7 habits that have a high rate of return in life, via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JamesClear\/status\/1005821705980465152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">James Clear<\/a> (I swear I&#8217;m not obsessed with him&#8230; or am I?):<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sleep 8+ hours each day<\/li>\n<li>Lift weights 3x week (I substituted this for &#8220;exercising&#8221; 3x a week)<\/li>\n<li>Go for a walk each day<\/li>\n<li>Save at least 10 percent of your income<\/li>\n<li>Read every day<\/li>\n<li>Drink more water and less of everything else<\/li>\n<li>Leave your phone in another room while you work<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>BOOM. Solves so many areas in life with those!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now unfortunately there was only *one* bullet dedicated there to <em><strong>finances<\/strong><\/em> which we all know is cuckoo, so the second point of today&#8217;s post is to share what a list focused on that might look like.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The 7 *financial* habits that have a high rate of return in life<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-58302\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/donald-duck-money-gif.gif\" alt=\"donald duck money gif\" width=\"306\" height=\"368\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#1. Tracking your money every month<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">budget<\/a> or prefer tracking <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/is-net-worth-tracking-the-new-budgeting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your net worth<\/a>, you have to know where your money&#8217;s going if you want to improve! And getting into the habit of doing this monthly can have a profound effect on not only your wealth, but your mindset as well. It&#8217;s amazing what a little paying attention can do over time!<\/p>\n<h2>#2. Grabbing those (FREE!) 401(k) matches<\/h2>\n<p>It still blows my mind that people leave thousands of dollars on the table every year just because they don&#8217;t think they can live without the 2% or 3% siphoned from their paychecks. EVEN IF YOU PUT MONEY IN YOUR 401(K) AND THEN CASHED IT OUT AFTER GETTING THE MATCHES AND WERE HIT WITH ALL THE PENALTIES, YOU&#8217;D *STILL* COME OUT AHEAD VS NOT PARTICIPATING AT ALL! Not that I&#8217;d ever &#8211; EVER &#8211; recommend that, of course, but financially speaking it just doesn&#8217;t make sense to not take advantage of this perk.<\/p>\n<p>Jack up your contributions *at least* to what your company is matching, and even if you never do a thing again with it at least you&#8217;re doubling &#8211; or coming close to it, depending on the plan &#8211; your contributions. And it&#8217;s pre-tax so you&#8217;ll feel it even less! (If at all!)<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Paying off your credit card(s) in full<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t care if you put $10,000 on there or $1.00 on there, if you can pay it off <em>every single month<\/em> you will be a financial ROCK STAR and people will swoon all over you&#8230; Bonus points if you can hack the system too and score mad credit card rewards along the way! (But don&#8217;t you dare dance with the devil if you don&#8217;t trust yourself! Better to be DEBT-FREE with no rewards than DEBT-FULL with them! &#x1f483;&#x1f608;)<\/p>\n<h2>#4. Automating your savings\/investments<\/h2>\n<p>I won&#8217;t try to put a % here as we&#8217;re all in different stages with this stuff, but obviously the more you can manage to stash away the better. And more important than<em> that<\/em> is getting into the habit of *increasing* it over time so that snowball keeps compounding as it rolls! All the while keeping that wretched lifestyle <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/inflation-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-this-topic\/\">inflation<\/a> at bay!<\/p>\n<h2>#5. Setting aside &#8220;fun&#8221; money<\/h2>\n<p>I know this sounds the opposite of what I just said, but unfortunately we have these things called &#8220;emotions&#8221; as humans, and the last thing you want to do in your financial journey is burn out :) If you can set aside X amount of money to blow every month, it&#8217;ll not only help keep you sane throughout the years, but it&#8217;ll also make this stuff more FUN because who just wants to hoard it all the time and never be able to touch it?? You have to have a release valve with this stuff, and so long as you&#8217;re keeping it within reason you&#8217;re not going to get arrested by the money police. Enjoy your spoils a little!<\/p>\n<h2>#6. Experimenting, experimenting, experimenting!<\/h2>\n<p>This is my favorite of the bunch, just because there&#8217;s an ENDLESS supply of ways to get from A to a Million, and once you stumble across something that works it feels rewarding as hell. Whether it&#8217;s finding a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good side hustle<\/a>, dabbling in stocks or real estate, trying your hand at a &#8220;No Spend&#8221; month, rocking a new <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-savings-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">savings hack<\/a>, or simply taking on a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/use-this-chart-to-save-1000-this-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fun challenge<\/a>. The more you experiment, the better chances of finding that game changer!<\/p>\n<h2>#7. Learning to be content with what you have<\/h2>\n<p>This is probably the hardest habit of them all, but also the most rewarding as you go. The less you &#8220;need&#8221; in life, the more options it opens up for you! In terms of both finances (savings) as well as lifestyle (freedom). There&#8217;s a reason so many money people are also minimalists: they realize owning more is not the answer to happiness &#8211; being content is! And the more you can get in the habit of remembering this, the quicker you&#8217;ll reach your FIRE goals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So those are my 7 favorite financial habits! What I miss? Can you check off a number of these? Can you check off these &#8211; AND &#8211; the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/7-habits-that-have-a-high-rate-of-return-in-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other 7 habits<\/a> too?<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;d be a rare breed if so, but a rare breed I&#8217;d very much enjoy being friends with ;) Perhaps we could even be running buddies, if that&#8217;s a thing?
