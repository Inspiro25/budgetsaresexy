For today I\u2019ll start with some backstory on my IRA, my out-of-pocket contributions, and what the future might hold for this account.<\/p>\n<p>Next week I\u2019ll deep dive into the rental property backstory and other stuff.<\/p>\n<h2>Index Funds Inside a Rollover IRA &#8211; The Backstory &#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>I moved to the USA in late 2007, when I was 22. And for the first ~5 years living here, I had no clue what a 401k really was. Maybe I was told about it at work, but just the thought of having my money \u201clocked up until I turn 67\u201d scared me off. Silly me. If only I knew then what I know now!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, in late 2012 I got my act together and started my first 401k account. My workplace at the time offered a great incentive &#8211; to match my retirement contributions of anything up to 4% of my salary. This later fluctuated between 2%-6% matching as my employers chopped and changed their benefits programs.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of employer matching, I contributed extra bits here and there from my paychecks, and in 2014 I think I added my entire December paycheck to 401k.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how much I contributed over the years, <strong>before employer matching<\/strong>: (Had to dig back into my old W2\u2019s to find these figures! &#8211; <em>Shows in Box 12b, Code D on your W2, if anyone\u2019s wondering where to find this info<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p>2013 contribution &#8211; $3,977<\/p>\n<p>2014 contribution &#8211; $12,308<\/p>\n<p>2015 contribution &#8211; $6,596<\/p>\n<p>2016 contribution &#8211; $7,041<\/p>\n<p>2017 contribution &#8211; $10,542<\/p>\n<p>2018 contribution &#8211; $1,887<\/p>\n<p><strong>Total: $42,351.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Woot woot! Kind of cool to see this number &#8211; this is the first time I\u2019ve calculated it. That\u2019s like saving an average of $136 per week, before tax. Maybe ~$100 a week after tax.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m finding it tough to figure out what my employers contributed. It doesn\u2019t show on my W2\u2019s or old tax filings. Since they changed benefit plans and providers constantly, I don\u2019t even know if I can find this old information!<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, it\u2019s nice to know that I personally contributed ~$42k in pre-tax money to an account that is now worth ~$109k.<\/p>\n<h2>Converting Old 401k&#8217;s to a Rollover IRA<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s my current Fidelity IRA snapshot:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-63077\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IRA-snapshot-300x126.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IRA-snapshot-300x126.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IRA-snapshot.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In April 2016 I left an employer and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/everything-need-to-know-ira-rollover-rules.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rolled over my 401k<\/a> into this IRA. The balance was about $45k at the time. Then I did this again in March 2018 when I left my last job &#8211; that was another $31k rolled over. The light blue line in the chart represents how much the account <em>would be worth<\/em> if my contributions remained in an all-cash position, while the dark blue line is the actual balance.<\/p>\n<p>There are a bunch of reasons I left my old 401k programs.<\/p>\n<p>First, I had a really bad taste in my mouth from my old 401k providers. I mentioned my employers switched benefit plans a lot &#8230; and each change came with a clunky new web portal, limited investment options, a new set of hidden fees, and incompetent customer service reps. All in all, I never felt like I had control of my money.<\/p>\n<p>In a 401k, my employer always had the power to change how I was invested. In a self-managed IRA, I have more control over my investment and retirement options.<\/p>\n<h2>Future Contributions and Options for This IRA Account<\/h2>\n<p>Currently, my wife and I are not contributing to any 401k\u2019s or pre-tax retirement accounts. This is due to us both having no employer benefits right now, as well as our income being fairly low for 2020. Any excess savings we are keeping in cash, and plan to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/max-out-roth-ira\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fund our <em>Roth<\/em> IRAs<\/a> again early next year. This may change, but for now, that\u2019s where we are!<\/p>\n<p>So, this Fidelity IRA will probably be left alone for the next few years. Its growth is solely dependent on the overall stock market. That\u2019s a scary thought! But, we\u2019re in it for the long run so these uncertain times don\u2019t worry us.<\/p>\n<h2>Accessing These IRA Funds \u201cEarly\u201d (and Maybe Even Avoiding Future Taxes)<\/h2>\n<p>Back in my 20s, I was under the impression that you can\u2019t touch pre-tax retirement accounts until you\u2019re over the age of 60. So my intentions in starting my first 401k were to never make any changes for ~40 years.<\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019ve since learned there are definitely ways to access these funds earlier in life &#8211; some methods even involve no fees and\/or low taxes!<\/p>\n<p>Even though we don\u2019t <em>need<\/em> to access this IRA money early (wife and I have enough post-tax assets to live off if we retire early), it might be a good idea to move money out of this IRA account into a more tax-efficient investment vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been reading up on \u201cbackdoor\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/roth-ira-conversion-rules-4770480\">Roth conversions<\/a> &#8211; moving money from a Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. I\u2019m no genius, but from my understanding I could convert this IRA money penalty-free, as long as I: a) pay taxes on the money when it\u2019s converted and b) don\u2019t <em>withdraw<\/em> the money after conversion for <a href=\"https:\/\/fairmark.com\/retirement\/roth-accounts\/roth-distributions\/distributions-after-a-roth-ira-conversion\/#:~:text=As%20a%20general%20rule%2C%20you,you%20may%20incur%20a%20penalty.\">at least 5 years<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Given that my wife and I are in a low tax income bracket (and maybe soon we will have another gap year with NO income) this could be a great time to do a backdoor Roth conversion. Paying little taxes now would mean no taxes later. Even a partial conversion is a great option while our tax bracket is low.<\/p>\n<h2>TLDR \/ All Things Considered<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I am an idiot and should have started my 401k earlier in life.<\/li>\n<li>Employer matching is wicked, take advantage of it if you can!<\/li>\n<li>This IRA currently has ~$109k in it, and was built with only ~$42k of personal contributions over 6 years.<\/li>\n<li>Converting this $ from a pre-tax to a post-tax investment account could save me money on taxes later in life.<\/li>\n<li>Next post, I\u2019ll share the rental property backstory and compare the numbers to see if it\u2019s grown faster than this IRA. (spoiler alert &#8211; it hasn\u2019t).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts\/comments\/advice?
