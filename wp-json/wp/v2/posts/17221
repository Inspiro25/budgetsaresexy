She recently launched a new course aptly titled &#8220;Make Sh*t Happen,&#8221; and it turned out a case study I had helped her out with was getting a lot of positive feedback, thus the reason for the email &#8211; to thank me, and to totally make my day! (WOO!) Here&#8217;s what one person had to say about it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>All of the case studies have had some idea or thought that caught my attention, but this one I identified with completely. The fears, the path&#8230; and hopefully, eventually, the success.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It then got me thinking &#8211; maybe YOU guys would get something out of this too? After all, it&#8217;s mainly BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS that I am here following my dream of full-time blogging to begin with :) So while it&#8217;s long, and definitely in-depth at times, you&#8217;ll find the entire discussion we did together down below &#8211; unedited and pretty much exactly what comes out of me after a few beers and contemplating life. If you ever need help &#8220;keeping it real,&#8221; that&#8217;s certainly a good way to do it ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the story of how I accomplished my dream of blogging full-time&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Tell us about your goal: What did it involve? What inspired you to go after it?<\/h2>\n<p>Oh man, it involved a looooot of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/my-new-savings-goal\/\">saving up<\/a> and making sure it *was*, indeed, what I truly wanted to do. But the second the seed was planted I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my brain! \u00a0It was seriously like love at first site&#8230; errr&#8230;. type?<\/p>\n<p>So as soon as I knew I wanted to go for it, I saved up roughly $40,000 and dove in. \u00a0Actually, funny story real quick &#8211; the day before I went to give my two weeks notice (I had a &#8220;normal&#8221; 9-5 making $70k) I got called in and told <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\">I was terminated<\/a> ;) \u00a0So all those inklings of &#8220;what if&#8221; disappeared and I knew at that point that I was 100% on the right path of my life. \u00a0The worst thing for me is to wonder if I was making the right choice or not, but when things align like that you can&#8217;t help but to take it on full- force and just go for it. \u00a0And it&#8217;s a good thing too, or else I&#8217;d have been left out in the cold w\/out a job!<\/p>\n<h2>COURAGE: How did you build the courage to actually do it? How did you know it was time?<\/h2>\n<p>I kinda cheated in that I planned for it far out ;) \u00a0The second I started making money from what I thought could only be a hobby (my blogging), I pushed harder and harder to keep doing better and making more until the end goal of going full-time was in clear view. \u00a0It took 3 years total to get to that point, but it wasn&#8217;t until year 2 when I realized it was possible. \u00a0And as soon as you allow an ounce of possibility to enter your brain, sometimes you just can&#8217;t stop until you make it a reality :) \u00a0It&#8217;s scary, and you second-guess yourself a lot, but there&#8217;s nothing like taking big risks out there and SEEING what your potential is like. \u00a0The worst thing in the world for me is to have an idea and not act on it &#8212; I&#8217;d rather fail and dust myself off again. \u00a0Most people in this life become complacent and just do enough to get by at work (not all people, but a lot of people), and I was like that once too. \u00a0But when you get empowered and realize you can change your course by putting in some extra work &#8211; AND that it could be in a field you&#8217;re passionate about! &#8211; it all starts flowing naturally. \u00a0You get on a rhythm and just keep on going until you reach that end point! \u00a0Or in this case, the beginning.<\/p>\n<h2>VALUES: Why was this goal important to you? What purpose did it serve? What underlying values did it honor?<\/h2>\n<p>It was important because it was a dream that meant giving up everything I knew about the working world. \u00a0No one in my family starting anything on their own, or built a business or anything, so I grew up thinking a traditional 9-5 was the only way to live in this life. \u00a0Which is totally fine, and I completely respect it &#8212; this life is DEF not for everyone &#8212; but as soon as I realized I could actually CHANGE it and make my own path, I was mesmerized. The idea that I could make money at doing something I actually ENJOYED was incredible. \u00a0It took a lot of work to get here, and I&#8217;m literally in the middle of a 16-hour day as I type this, BUT I can confidently say that I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. I wanted my work to actually *matter,* and be something I could stand by and be proud of, and for the first time in my working life I have achieved that :) \u00a0I don&#8217;t ever want to go back.<\/p>\n<h2>SUPPORT: Who held you accountable to your goal? Were friends and family supportive, or did they think you were crazy?<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone thought I was crazy except for my close family and my blog readers. \u00a0EVERY time I mentioned quitting or thinking about going full-time I got nothing but positive feedback and support. \u00a0No one knew the income I was bringing in or not (though I share all my financials on my blog, due to the nature of it) but the idea that I&#8217;d be totally fine in their eyes REALLY gave me ammunition to keep on striving for it. \u00a0And even the people that were kinda worried about me, were only that way due to not understanding the business. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been at this for 6+ months now and I STILL get questions as to what, exactly, it is I &#8220;do.&#8221; Haha&#8230; \u00a0But as crazy as our ideas are sometimes, only YOU know what you truly want out of this life, and only YOU have the power of going for it or not. \u00a0There are haters all over the place trying to bring us down, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s OUR lives, not theirs. \u00a0Better to give things a shot than to just wonder all the time&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>FEAR\/DOUBTS: What were your biggest fears, doubts and insecurities before starting? What barriers (real or imagined) were in your way?<\/h2>\n<p>I had two biggest fears:<\/p>\n<p>1) \u00a0<em><strong>That I&#8217;d run out of money.<\/strong><\/em> \u00a0I thought I&#8217;d be worrying every single day whether I was making enough, but it turned out it&#8217;s actually the farthest thing from my mind. \u00a0I think because I literally work alllll the time and I&#8217;m always concentrating on the project ahead of me, but also because I saved a boat load of money before delving in too. \u00a0Mix that with my cutting down of my lifestyle, and the fear has just kept at bay this whole time&#8230;. well, only 6 months since I started, but I feel like that&#8217;s a good sign ;)<\/p>\n<p>2) The second thing I got worried about was that <em><strong>I&#8217;d get lazy or not motivated enough<\/strong><\/em> to keep pushing forward. \u00a0I can honestly say that it&#8217;s probably the farthest thing from the truth now :) \u00a0If anything, I work too much! \u00a0But you really just don&#8217;t know until you actually get out there and TRY it.<\/p>\n<p>As for barriers, yeah, there are a few like not growing fast enough to sustain the business or something happening (like Google shutting down traffic to my sites) that would be pretty scary, but I&#8217;m really working hard on diversifying my &#8220;products&#8221; now so that if one falls through, i have some others to keep me going&#8230; that whole &#8220;don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket&#8221; type of thing. \u00a0I&#8217;m trying to set everything up so that I never have to return to the corporate world again.<\/p>\n<h2>THE DIP: Was there ever a moment\/period of time that you felt you had hit a dip (felt like a failure and\/or wanted to quit)?<\/h2>\n<p>Nope, not since achieving (or starting?) my goal. \u00a0I&#8217;ve had some pretty rough days over the course of J. Money 2.0, but never once have I doubted whether I made the right choice. \u00a0Cuz even if I &#8220;fail&#8221; and have to go back to work, I&#8217;d still be glad I gave it everything I got before having to concede like that.<\/p>\n<p>Although, maybe you&#8217;re asking us about the time BEFORE we went all out? \u00a0In that case, I did question myself. \u00a0In fact, I questioned it every single day for 1+ years because it was all in theory until the big day came! \u00a0And that&#8217;ll drive a man bonkers! \u00a0The worst for me is just simply &#8220;not knowing.&#8221; \u00a0I&#8217;d much rather just find out and see what the results are than to keep going filled with questions.<\/p>\n<h2>SUCCESS! How did you feel after accomplishing your goal? What did you learn about yourself in the process? What are you most proud of?<\/h2>\n<p>Refreshed!!! And really, just ALIVE! \u00a0Time has slowed down sooooo much since going full-time w\/ my blogging, and it just completely feels like a new world for me. \u00a0Full of possibilities and growth all over. \u00a0The great thing about *this* accomplishment is that it continues to give back :) \u00a0It wasn&#8217;t the end point of anything, but rather the beginning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learned about myself:<\/strong> That I hate wondering &#8220;what if&#8221; (as I&#8217;ve mentioned probably a million times already writing this, sorry), and that I can change my path any single day I want. \u00a0Going the entrepreneurial route gave me something that I haven&#8217;t had since the good ol&#8217; college days, and that is FREEDOM. \u00a0Freedom to work on the projects I want, and that are important to me, and freedom to give it all up or change routes any time I damn well feel like it. \u00a0I set the schedule, and I set the projects, and if I ever get tired of it I can go back to a &#8220;normal&#8221; 9-5 and take orders from someone else again :) \u00a0Ultimately I learned that we are much more powerful than we think sometimes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Most proud of:<\/strong> \u00a0DOING IT. \u00a0Not thinking about it, or working toward it, but actually getting up one day an DOING it. \u00a0All the preparation and planning doesn&#8217;t mean a thing unless you get out of bed and do it. \u00a0And the beauty after that is that you then have a benchmark to compare and track things by! \u00a0(if &#8220;it&#8221; wasn&#8217;t a 1-time event, of course). \u00a0I talked about quitting my job all the time for the 6 months leading up to it happening. \u00a0And I saved, and I planned, and I did everything I thought I needed to do to reach this final result. \u00a0But had I not pulled the trigger at that point (or, in my case, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\">my employer<\/a> pulling it for me), it wouldn&#8217;t had mattered cuz I&#8217;d still be thinking about how it might &#8220;one day&#8221; be in theory.<\/p>\n<h2>ADVICE: What advice would you give to future make sh*t happeners? What would you say to those who are afraid to start or afraid to fail? What advice would you give to others in pursuit of a similar goal to yours?<\/h2>\n<p>To just do it. \u00a0(I sound like a broken record! Haha&#8230;) Seriously though, you just never \u00a0know what potential you&#8217;re holding back until you get out there and give it a shot! \u00a0Yeah it&#8217;s smart to plan a bit and make sure you&#8217;re not doing something really really stupid in life, but at the end of the day it all comes down to making the decision to go for it or to just keep on thinking about it. \u00a0<em><strong>And I&#8217;m not gonna lie and say it&#8217;s an easy choice to make &#8211; it&#8217;s not.<\/strong><\/em> \u00a0But the only way people become great is by challenging ourselves and forcing ourselves to grow. \u00a0Anyone can sit back and let life happen to them &#8211; 90% of the population is doing that now. \u00a0But if you want something GREATER than yourself, and something you can be proud of and smile about every day, you&#8217;ll have to get up and start changing the way you do things. \u00a0And it all starts by taking a step. \u00a0It could be a big one, or it could be a small one, but if you don&#8217;t put yourself out there and start going for it, you&#8217;ll never really know your potential. \u00a0It&#8217;s cheesy as hell, I know, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact it&#8217;s true. \u00a0The worst thing someone can do is not fully embrace their potential &#8211; so please don&#8217;t let that happen to you!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Advice to others with goals of blogging full-time:<\/strong> \u00a0I&#8217;ll keep this one simple: \u00a0IMMERSE yourself into the community. \u00a0Read all the blogs in your niche, comment all over the place, follow people on twitter, connect on facebook, do a butt ton of guest posts, and really just ask questions and try and follow what the successful people are doing. \u00a0You&#8217;ll have to pick up on SEO and monetization and all that kinda stuff too (the boring parts, I like to say), but it&#8217;s really about surrounding yourself w\/ those who are living out their dreams already and in the position you one day hope to be. \u00a0Once you build some rapport with one or two of them, ask them if they could mentor you. \u00a080% of the things I&#8217;ve learned (and most of the important stuff) came from others explaining it to me. \u00a0I still had to put their advice into motion and figure it out in my own time, but they were the ones who guided me and kept me motivated. \u00a0If you can find a good person to ask questions to or ping ideas off of, you&#8217;ll reach your goals much more faster.<\/p>\n<h2>SPECIFIC TIPS: What specific tips do you have related to your goal that someone pursuing that same goal could benefit from? Are there any tools or resources you recommend?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Always be yourself.<\/strong><\/em> \u00a0You\u2019re gonna get jealous of the others, and always compare YOUR blog to the big guys out there, but if you HAVE TO stay true to yourself and blog\/write\/talk about whatever it is that\u2019s interesting to YOU. \u00a0That\u2019s why people come to your stuff every day &#8211; to hear what YOU have to say, not for summaries on others ;)<\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Be passionate.<\/strong><\/em> \u00a0Do it cuz you love it, and not to make money\/friends\/etc. \u00a0Of course, if you\u2019re gonna try and go full-time you DO have to make money, haha, but that shouldn\u2019t be the reason for the goal. \u00a0Love what you do, and do it well.<\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Watch what others are doing.<\/strong><\/em> \u00a0Don\u2019t copy them as I mentioned in #1, but def. read their stuff and see what they\u2019re up to &#8211; esp the bloggers who are full-time like you want to be. \u00a0And even better, ASK THEM for tips or advice or any questions you have on this stuff! \u00a0Most of what I originally learned came from talking with them and picking their brain. \u00a0And everyone likes sharing what they know :)<\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Comment\/network\/share\/give back to everyone in your niche.<\/strong><\/em> \u00a0Help others when they come to you, and always share the love and be *nice* to everyone. \u00a0There\u2019s plenty of money\/link juice to go around &#8211; don\u2019t hoard your ideas\/tips.<\/li>\n<li><em><strong>BE YOURSELF.<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Resources:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are a ton of \u201cprofessional blogging\u201d tips out there, but I tend to stick with <a href=\"http:\/\/DailyBlogTips.com\">DailyBlogTips.com<\/a> (my fave), and sometimes <a href=\"http:\/\/ProBlogger.net\">ProBlogger.net<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Other than those, it\u2019s really about checking out other successful bloggers in your niche, or in general, and just poking around and asking them questions.
