And what that new car smell, smells like??<\/p>\n<h2>#1. How I&#8217;ve never bought a new car or house or almost anything big brand new before, and why.<\/h2>\n<p>Up until recently it never occurred to me that I&#8217;ve never owned a new car or house or anything substantial* for that matter, but a recent chat with a USAA colleague changed that. We hopped on the phone so I could learn more about their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaa.com\/inet\/wc\/car_buying_services_products?akredirect=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">car buying service<\/a> they&#8217;ve just re-launched (for anyone new here, I&#8217;m a hardcore fanboy of USAA and literally have 14 accounts with them!), and somewhere along the conversation I was asked what I thought about used vs new cars.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Used all the way, baby!&#8221; I said out loud. &#8220;That&#8217;s how I roll!&#8221; (Okay, I didn&#8217;t really say that &#8216;cuz I&#8217;m not that clever on the spot, but I did say I prefer used all the way ;)) And it was at that exact moment that I realized I&#8217;ve never owned a new car EVER in my life before, nor do I even know what that feels like?<\/p>\n<p>I then mentally went down the list of all the cars I&#8217;ve owned in the past 20 years since having my license to make sure I was correct<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>1988 Chevy Corsica<\/strong> &#8211; Used! (8 years old when I got it, hand me down from my parents)<\/li>\n<li><strong>1993 Geo Tracker<\/strong> \u2013 Used! (4 years old when I got it, the first car I ever bought!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>1988 Honda Prelude<\/strong> \u2013 Used! (11 years old when I got it &#8211; I &#8220;needed&#8221; a faster one ;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>2001 Ford Mustang<\/strong> \u2013 Used! (3 years old when I got it, and when neon yellow was in fashion (it *was* in fashion, wasn&#8217;t it??)<\/li>\n<li><strong>1993 Cadillac DeVille<\/strong> \u2013 Used! (13 years old when I got it &#8211; no more car payments, woo!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>2005 Toyota Highlander<\/strong> &#8211; Used! (2 years old when I got it, car payments again &#8211; womp womp)<\/li>\n<li><strong>1993 Cadillac DeVille<\/strong> aka <strong>FrankenCaddy<\/strong> &#8211; Very used! (15 years old when I got it, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/bye-bye-frankencaddy-hello-car-payments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">looked like 115 years<\/a> when I donated it)<\/li>\n<li><strong>2008 Lexus RX350<\/strong> &#8211; Used! (8 years old when I got it, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/thoughts-on-owning-lexus-luxury-car\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots of surprising effects so far<\/a>!)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It was a fascinating exercise to go down &#8211; I highly recommend it :) I then wondered how much I&#8217;ve saved over the past 20 years going this way too? Or if all those total costs would add up to *one* decent brand new car? (Answer: not one, unless it was super luxurious, but probably 2 or 3 average cars. So basically for the price of 2 or 3 new cars I got 8!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>I then started rattling off all the reasons why I&#8217;ve only bought used over the years to myself, full well knowing I&#8217;d be blogging about it soon ;)<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>They&#8217;re much cheaper, obviously<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;re able to afford MORE of a used car, if you wanted to upgrade or something special<\/li>\n<li>You don&#8217;t have to worry about dings and dents and smashes as much (you&#8217;ll always worry, but odds are your 5, 10, 20 year old car already has them, so what&#8217;s another one (or ten?))<\/li>\n<li>You don&#8217;t lose as much when you go to resell them (the used car market is thriving! And you don&#8217;t get that wallop of depreciation the second you drive it off the lot either)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/cars-of-personal-finance-bloggers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All cool bloggers rock used!<\/a> (And really, isn&#8217;t that all that matters? ;))<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a trade off to this too (more miles, more problems? No\/less warranty? No knowledge of previous ownership?), but financially speaking used is almost always better than new. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with going that route if you value it (it&#8217;s your money!).<\/p>\n<p>I feel like I&#8217;m missing something here, but you get the point. Used is sexy.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. A special offer USAA has for its members who go through their car buying service<\/h2>\n<p>(For any non-military-connected\/non-future-car buyers, avert your eyes now and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/funny-money-jokes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click this<\/a> instead!)<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned above, this all started when USAA reached out to tell me they&#8217;re offering a special deal for people who find their next car through their car buying service. Specifically, financing rates <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>as low as 1.9%<\/strong><\/span> until July 9th. Here&#8217;s the portal if you&#8217;re interested:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaa.com\/inet\/wc\/car_buying_services_products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.usaa.com\/inet\/wc\/car_buying_services_products<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s basically a place on their site where you can sort through an aggregated list of cars for sale, compare prices\/costs connected to TRUECar data, check out CarFax reports, and even estimate insurance through USAA (pretty handy if you have all your accounts with them too!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you end up finding your car through them, you get the special rate, and if you don&#8217;t &#8211; but still finance through USAA, you get their normal rate. Which fortunately is still pretty good (my Lexus loan is at 2.75%).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In fact, going back through my list of cars over time, I&#8217;ve ALWAYS ended up w\/ a loan through USAA. Whether starting out with them (like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/i-just-bought-caddy-and-i-slapped-it-on\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when I slapped my 1st Cadillac on my credit card<\/a> &#8211; hah!), or when I finance first through dealerships for whatever reason, and then end up refinancing later.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly I&#8217;ve never been smooth enough to pick up a car in all cash :(<\/p>\n<p>So yeah, this rate doesn&#8217;t apply to everyone, but hopefully it helps those members looking to get a new ride sometime soon. If you&#8217;re not sure if you&#8217;re eligible to join USAA, you can check <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaa.com\/inet\/pages\/pub_eligibility_task_entry?ds_s=CPC&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_c=BrandUSAA_SRMK_Keyword_NoIMCO_MBM&amp;ds_ag=USAA+EXT_DMP_ADMAudience_Control&amp;ds_k=%2Busaa&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1a3KBRCYARIsABNRnxuCpMF4effUiq5x5QZj4fShrUaIp7iMnUEgbWnahJmqIznSKSY3veAaAp1lEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=COLB0M7g0dQCFUMsHwodV-wO6A&amp;akredirect=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.
