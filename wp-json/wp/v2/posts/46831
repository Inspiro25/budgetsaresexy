Good thing the internet is still here :)<\/p>\n<p>Well, we didn&#8217;t reach our glorious goal of becoming a half-millionaire this year, but we did end up roughly $20k higher than we were at this time last year, so it&#8217;s hard to complain all too much. Still, to make myself feel better I went back further through the 8 years of tracking this stuff to see how even farther we&#8217;ve come.

Not too shabby at all. And a MUCH more exciting story than a $20,000 bump!<\/p>\n<p>So while we missed the mark of crossing into the $500k&#8217;s, as well as hitting our $50,000 yearly growth average for the second time in a row, at least we&#8217;re on the up and up and can try harder in the new year. I won&#8217;t make excuses for why we didn&#8217;t hit it, but needless to say we have some work to do.<\/p>\n<p>(Okay, hell, yes I will :) In the past few years our household <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/back-to-living-off-one-salary-again-womp-womp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">went down to 1 income<\/a>, we <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/01\/total-spent-on-house-last-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">converted our house to a rental property<\/a> which sucked up a bunch of cash, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/how-make-money-online-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I re-focused my business<\/a> on stuff I&#8217;m passionate about vs stuff just for money, and we *ahem* <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/03\/how-much-babies-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">had kids<\/a>. All stuff we consciously decided to do, but still financially-wise stung.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So for 2016 it&#8217;s all about hitting $500k, and hopefully by the end of it around $550k. <\/strong>But I&#8217;ve long since given up money as the #1 priority in my life, so if we get there we get there and if we don&#8217;t we don&#8217;t. True happiness, I&#8217;m finding, is in enjoying your daily lifestyle more so than the # of zeros in your account. Though of course I&#8217;m still gonna chase that ultimate freedom ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how the entire year panned out from start to finish:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-46838\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-graph-2015.jpg\" alt=\"net worth graph 2015\" width=\"509\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-graph-2015.jpg 509w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-graph-2015-300x134.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hopefully you&#8217;re tracking yours too so you can easily review as well!<\/strong> This is seriously one of the best perks to tracking your net worth consistently &#8211; getting the snapshots of your money frozen in time. It&#8217;s a powerful thing to be able to look back and see how far you&#8217;ve come. I really hope you try it out if you aren&#8217;t already (tools to help you do this are down at the end of this post if you need some).<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&#8217;s how the month of December broke down:<\/h2>\n<p>(PS: To all new readers here, I share our entire finances at the end of every month in hopes it makes talking about money easier for people. It&#8217;s not about showing off or patting myself on the back &#8211; there was a time I had barely $50 to my name! &#8211; but more so showing what happens when you actually care enough to make some changes in your life. And hopefully this inspires you to do the same!)<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CASH SAVINGS<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$3,146.02)<\/span><\/strong>: This is a temporary bump due to a better than expected month of business, but a great sight to see no less and helps recoup some of the $$ we&#8217;ve poured into our house to get it ready to sell. And more on that here in a bit (though, spoiler alert, it&#8217;s never fun paying for an empty house!).<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">DIGIT SAVINGS<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$392.59)<\/span><\/strong>: In other savings news, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\">Digit<\/a> continues to not disappoint either. I haven&#8217;t lifted a finger since signing up last January, and our account is now well over the $2,500 mark!<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CHALLENGE EVERYTHING<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$302.64)<\/span><\/strong>: Another solid month here too, bringing our total (easy) savings to $1,200 after just four months. I haven&#8217;t listed a thing on Craigslist lately, but we continue to catch extra money coming in like this year&#8217;s USAA dividend check they send out to members, and a little Christmas cash too. We just keep stashing it away in hopes of maxing out another ROTH Ira this year like we did last year when finishing up <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the first round of this challenge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">ACORNS (BROKERAGE)<\/span><span style=\"color: #008000;\"> (+$9.25)<\/span><\/strong>: A nice little increase here too. All money being invested from rounding up our daily transactions via <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/acorns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Acorns<\/a>. If you&#8217;re looking for an easy &#8211; and non scary &#8211; way to start investing, this could be a possible route.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MOTIF (BROKERAGE)<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$10.03)<\/span><\/strong>: This will be the last time you see these guys here as I just cashed out our holdings and will be forwarding over the money into our Vanguard account shortly. This comes after a 12 month test of seeing if it helps me get excited about dividend investing (it didn&#8217;t), as well as playing in a friendly blogger competition of picking the best stocks for a year :) Hint: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/motif-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I lost<\/a>. You can see the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/01\/motif-investing-review-dividend-portfolio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full review of Motif I wrote<\/a> as they are a clever way to invest, but it just reinforces my strategy of keeping things simple and being &#8220;all in&#8221; with index funds. Plus, the game of investing is all for the long haul anyways, not short, so the whole competition was pretty silly from the start.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IRA: ROTH(s)<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> (-$1,766.27)<\/span><\/strong>: Nothing too snazzy going on in this department. Just the markets doing what they do, while it waits for us to invest again&#8230; We&#8217;ll probably max this out in one fell swoop come March or early April after taxes get sorted through.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IRA: SEP<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$7,239.64)<\/span><\/strong>: Same with this guy. As soon as we wrap up the tax year and see how much we can invest (it&#8217;s tied to company profits for the year) we&#8217;ll go in and fill &#8216;er back up again. Here&#8217;s a snapshot in the meantime of how our funds have performed since <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/say-hello-to-vanguards-newest-member\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moving to Vanguard<\/a> over a year ago:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-46832\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/vanguard-returns-12-15.jpg\" alt=\"vanguard returns\" width=\"307\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/vanguard-returns-12-15.jpg 307w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/vanguard-returns-12-15-283x300.jpg 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">AUTOS WORTH (kbb)<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$8.00)<\/span><\/strong>: Nothing too exciting going on here.

We&#8217;ll leave the value of our house @$300,000 until anything&#8217;s official, but as we all know the only true value of property is the amount someone will pay you for it ;) All the calculators and home sites can only give you an estimate.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MORTGAGES<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(-$716.45)<\/span><\/strong>: In the meantime, we just keep paying off our mortgages as if nothing&#8217;s going on to avoid any ugly surprises down the road&#8230; Always better to be safe than sorry with these things as nothing&#8217;s locked in until it&#8217;s locked in.
