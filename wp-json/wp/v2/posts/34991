She calls police and finds out a bank (not her own) repossessed it and got rid of all her stuff. The reason? It was an accident.<\/p>\n<p>Turns out the repo team went to the wrong house (&#8220;because the gps took us there and there was long grass on it&#8221;), and now this poor woman has to figure out a way to get reimbursed for it all. And so far the bank, according to her, is not cooperating &#8211; making it even more of a nightmare.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You can read more about it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.10tv.com\/content\/stories\/2013\/07\/22\/athens-county-woman-wants-possessions-back-after-bank-tried-to-repossess-wrong-house.html\">here<\/a> at WBNS-10TV News,<\/strong> and watch their 2 min. interview they did on the story too. Some pretty messed up $hit.<\/p>\n<p>After reading\/watching I then had to take to Twitter, of course, and pass on this crazy news &#8211; maybe hoping it would help her out in some small way ;) Only time will tell on that one, but in doing so I found out mistaken foreclosure isn&#8217;t as uncommon as you&#8217;d think. A friend (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/katie_lake\">@katie_lake<\/a>) saw my tweet and jumped right in saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Something similar happened here but homeowners were home. Called lawyer\/police while company cont to remove contents.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t that crazy???<\/strong> One day all is good in the world, and the next someone is (incorrectly) trying to steal your stuff? AND house?! It probably does no good thinking about what you&#8217;d do in that case, or how to even prevent it since the odds it&#8217;ll happen to any of us is STILL rare, but it did get me thinking about my &#8220;stuff&#8221; in general.<\/p>\n<p><em>How much would I really miss if it disseapared one day? What do I TRULY need\/want from it all? Would I even NOTICE half the stuff I&#8217;d be missing at the end of the day?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I took a hot minute to think about it, and then came up with a list of the stuff that would REALLY upset me to lose. And that list wasn&#8217;t all that long, incredibly enough:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>My coin collection<\/strong> &#8212; Half of which I inherited from my grandparents.<\/li>\n<li><strong>My baseball\/<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/08\/what-i-learned-from-collecting-basketball-cards\/\">basketball card<\/a> collection<\/strong>&#8212; Sorta for the value, but also for the memories it brings back too. And I really want to pass them down to the wee one later on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>My metal detecting finds<\/strong> &#8212; Same with these. Semi-valuable coming from the Civil War and all, but mainly a memory inducer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>My photo albums<\/strong> &#8212; Or rather, the *photos* themselves. The ones all pre-digital age ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>My work computer<\/strong> &#8212; I back everything up, but the idea of someone else having\/stealing it with all its content scares the bejesus outta me. If I ever lose it I hope it&#8217;s from a fire over a dumb repo.<\/li>\n<li><strong>My safe<\/strong> &#8212; Where you can find said backup, as well as other important docs like passports, birth certificates, and a big wad of cash. You know, just in case of emergencies like this ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>My boxes of notes from middle\/high school<\/strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m gonna come off as a giddy little school girl with this one, but the truth of the matter is that I&#8217;d miss all those guys for a while. They&#8217;re really the only things I have left from traveling the country\/world growing up in the military life, and some small part of me I reckon holds on to them since nothing was ever stable. I could probably do without them if push came to shove, but I&#8217;d need at least one last day to read over them all again. Preferably with my old high school friends if I could find them ;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s that &#8211; 7 things? All of which could fit in the back of my trunk? That&#8217;s not too bad, I don&#8217;t think&#8230; And in reality I could live without all of that too, if I really had to. Now granted you&#8217;d *need* more than that to exist in this world like clothes and food and some sort of furniture to sit\/sleep on, but all that stuff can be easily replaced without any attachment-problems. Same with all the decorations in our house really, minus maybe <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/12\/new-art-collector\/\">the Santa painting<\/a> ;)<\/p>\n<p>I thought I&#8217;d take it a step further and ask what the Mrs. would miss too, and her answers were a bit more&#8230; ummm&#8230; non-minimalistic? ;) Here&#8217;s what was on her list &#8211; after I rudely awoken her from her nap so I could get this post finished, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Our $2,000 mattress\/bed<\/strong> &#8212;\u00a0 &#8220;It&#8217;s soooo comfortable!&#8221; (She had won it in a contest years back &#8211; don&#8217;t think we would have bought that thing elsewise ;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>All her makeup<\/strong> &#8212; &#8220;It was hard to put it all together!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>All her clothes<\/strong> &#8212; See above<\/li>\n<li><strong>All her research books\/notebooks on her dissertation topic<\/strong> &#8212; All stuff needed to help her writer her paper and some pretty hard to come by.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Her dissertation computer<\/strong> &#8212; Where all her other notes and writings are.<\/li>\n<li><strong>All her jewelry<\/strong> &#8212; mainly her <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-went-mining-and-made-my-wifes-unique-engagement-ring-the-best-1390-ive-ever-spent\/\">engagement ring<\/a> (she doesn&#8217;t wear a lot cuz it scratches the baby), as well as my grandma&#8217;s old passed down jewelry to her.<\/li>\n<li><strong>All our baby&#8217;s stuff<\/strong> &#8212; &#8216;Cuz she picked it all out and &#8220;it&#8217;s all so perfect for him!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>And a handful of other &#8220;memory&#8221; items&#8230;<\/strong> I won&#8217;t bore you with the details of those though. (Read: too embarrassing to post)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So a little different than my take on this, but I think we&#8217;d manage okay if we had to clear the house at any given point in time. Minus, let&#8217;s say, the big ass bed ;)<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s all rather interesting to step back and think about whenever you get in that type of mood. And I forever think about George Clooney&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B2tZEA55Y5U\">&#8220;backpack&#8221; speech<\/a> too now cuz of that dang Up In The Air movie, haha&#8230; That backpack DOES get heavy in our lives!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anywho, all good stuff to think about over the weekend&#8230;<\/strong> Maybe it&#8217;s time to de-clutter a little and make some side money getting rid of a few things? What do you think you could comfortably let go of, either now, or later, when your house gets randomly foreclosed on? ;)<\/p>\n<p>I pray a thousand times over that it&#8217;ll never happen to any of us, but this world sure is crazy and I wouldn&#8217;t put it past it anymore&#8230; Better to think about what&#8217;s important to us now, than later!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday I came across a headline so ridiculous sounding that I thought it was fake: &#8220;Bank Accidentally Steals Woman&#8217;s Belongings, Refuses To Make Restitution&#8220;.
