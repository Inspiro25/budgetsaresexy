This one comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynalden.com\/about-lyn-alden\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lyn Alden<\/a>, a newer blogger on the scene who puts out some great\u00a0in-depth financial guides on her site. Today she dives inwards and shares a part of her own journey with us, and what she&#8217;s learned about money and happiness throughout it. Hop on over to her site when you&#8217;re done and show her some love!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<p><strong>When I was a child, I was homeless for several years.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While most kids my age were starting elementary school, my mother and I were living in homeless shelters, cheap motels, and at the worst point, in a car for a while.<\/p>\n<p>We washed ourselves in public restrooms (sometimes we had to sneak in to do it, in the early morning when people weren\u2019t around), and whether we ate enough or not was based on the kindness of strangers. \u00a0I jumped around between schools a lot during kindergarten and first grade, and had some multi-month schooling gaps. \u00a0A homeless guy taught me how to play chess.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually my luck improved a bit, and I went to live with my elderly father in a trailer park, where I grew up until I left for college at 18. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have much money, so I had to rely on $50,000 worth of student loans and part-time work to fund it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That all <em>sucked<\/em>, but now at 29 my finances are solid.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My student debts are a thing of the past, I have a large six figure investment portfolio that I continue to pour money into, there\u2019s plenty of cash set aside for liquidity, and I financially support my mother to help her make ends meet.<\/p>\n<p>The combination of a great income from engineering and finance, always maintaining a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\">side hustle<\/a>, having a minimalist (but admittedly not frugal) lifestyle, and consistently investing, has worked well.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of people don\u2019t like talking about money. \u00a0Especially for things that feel awkward to admit, like having been in poverty. \u00a0But for me, these experiences were incredibly valuable, and it\u2019s worth sharing what I learned from them.<\/p>\n<h2>#1. It\u2019s the uncertainty, not the lack of comforts, that causes suffering<\/h2>\n<p>Being homeless sucks, but it\u2019s not necessarily for the reasons we might assume.<\/p>\n<p>In extreme circumstances, like people in cities literally out in the cold streets for prolonged periods, or life in certain developing countries, the lack of comforts really does cause physical suffering.<\/p>\n<p>But most poverty in the developed world causes a different kind of suffering: constant stress and uncertainty.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, many well-off people use their vacations to go camping. \u00a0They PAY MONEY to live as though they\u2019re broke for a week, and it\u2019s fun! \u00a0And that\u2019s because it\u2019s just a game; we can enjoy the upsides of roughing it out in nature without experiencing any of the uncertainty and difficulties of people who don\u2019t have a choice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Although it became scary and unhappy at the end when I was living in a car, for most of my time homeless, I was happy. \u00a0Kids don\u2019t need much in life to feel joy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One day, a bunch of us children in a shelter were bored, so we decided to make a circus for our parents. \u00a0We did a survey of our available skillsets, got some markers and cardboard and random odds and ends, and put on a show.<\/p>\n<p>Other times, my mother would take me to museums, which are cheap. \u00a0She always had me reading, going to the beach, or otherwise doing something of value.<\/p>\n<p>But for her, I\u2019m sure it was a lot less fun. \u00a0She had the constant stress of uncertainty, of never feeling in control, and of not knowing where herself and her child were going to live next, or who might give us food. \u00a0And trying (and succeeding) at being a good parent even in the worst of circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>People don\u2019t necessarily need to be homeless to have those stresses, either. \u00a0A significant percentage of the population is living paycheck to paycheck, not knowing for sure how they will pay their bills next month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We can apply this concept to our daily life to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynalden.com\/build-wealth\/\">build serious wealth<\/a>. \u00a0Voluntary simplicity is joy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Living simply, when it\u2019s a choice, doesn\u2019t have to detract from happiness at all. \u00a0Material comforts have relatively little impact on happiness beyond a certain point. \u00a0Living in simple conditions, cooking your own food, going to the beach or library or museums or hiking for your pastimes, and saving a ton of money in the process, can be a lot of fun. \u00a0And it\u2019s <i>healthy<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, when your simple lifestyle allows you to build up your retirement savings, start an emergency fund, or pay off your debts, you begin to feel free. \u00a0When you have enough money stashed away to cover your expenses for a long time, along with diverse income streams, it provides peace of mind. \u00a0And considering that money problems are possibly the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/02\/04\/money-is-the-leading-cause-of-stress-in-relationships.html\">leading cause<\/a> of relationship fights, good money habits can make for a more joyful partnership as well.<\/p>\n<p>When I was living with my father, family vacations consisted of him driving me and a friend to a local beach town, where we stayed in a little motel and spent time on the boardwalk. \u00a0He would give me a big pile of spare coins that he had saved up for months as my vacation allowance to spend on arcades.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, I\u2019ve upped the scope of my vacations in more recent years, like spending three weeks in luxury hotels in Hong Kong, enjoying rooftop bars, fancy restaurants, and gorgeous mountain trails the whole time. \u00a0But what I learned firsthand, at least for me, was that the fun of a trip is almost 100% based on who you are with, rather than how classy you travel.<\/p>\n<p>Luxuries are just the sprinkles on the sundae.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. You need <em>all<\/em> parts of your financial house in order, not just some<\/h2>\n<p>In her youth, my mother earned a high income and had a sports car. \u00a0But when things went (really) sour and her income stopped flowing, she had no savings.<\/p>\n<p>My father was the opposite. \u00a0He lived in a trailer and never had a high income, but always had a fully stocked emergency fund and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynalden.com\/how-to-improve-your-credit-score\/\">his credit score was 848<\/a>. \u00a0\u00a0No joke, he literally complained to me wondering why they took off those two points.<\/p>\n<p>His only money problem was that he never had a wealth-building mindset. \u00a0He paid every single bill on time without fail, and never spent more money than he earned. \u00a0He had a pension to rely on for retirement, and always had five figures of cash stashed away so that liquidity was never a problem. \u00a0He was generous to me, to neighbors, and to friends.<\/p>\n<p>(And to his girlfriends; he was a bit of a stud in his old age!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But he never deliberately saved extra money, and never compounded it to make it grow.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In fact, he sold all his stocks in his small 401(k) at the bottom of the market during the 2001\/2002 recession, and stayed in cash. \u00a0Rather than holding onto his investments, he got turned off by the volatility and went to cash forever, and missed out on the recovery.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve financial freedom, all three components need to be in order: \u00a0Income, Saving, and Investing. \u00a0Not just one or two.<\/p>\n<p><b>#1. Income: <\/b>It\u2019s important to earn enough money to make an impact, however that is defined for you. \u00a0Whether through education, entrepreneurship, or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\">side hustles<\/a>, a bigger stream of income will lead to financial security more quickly.<\/p>\n<p>For example, someone who makes $30,000\/year in after-tax income and has $20,000\/year in expenses will have $10,000\/year to use for paying off debt and saving for retirement.<\/p>\n<p>But if she can earn just $500\/month after tax on the side, then although it only increases her income by 20%, it increases her potential savings rate by a full 60%. \u00a0That makes a huge difference.<\/p>\n<p><b>#2. Saving: <\/b>Whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\">keeping a budget<\/a> or something else, find a pattern that fits for you and that keeps your savings going up.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of pro athletes make millions and then go bankrupt five years later. \u00a0Johnny Depp made more money than a hundred people do in a lifetime, but spent it all buying things like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2017\/05\/everything-johnny-depp-wasted-his-money-on.html\">$5 million cannons<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>No amount of income can fix poor spending habits.<\/p>\n<p><b>#3. Investments: <\/b>This is where a lot of people go wrong. \u00a0They spend decades working and aren\u2019t much richer than the day they started, because they haven\u2019t been investing. \u00a0Then they find themselves vulnerable to layoffs and pension cuts.<\/p>\n<p>Investing every month like clockwork, and achieving a good rate of return from a diversified portfolio, will allow you to reach financial freedom early.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to really push yourself to build wealth is to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\">track it<\/a>. \u00a0Most people don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Wealth-building isn\u2019t always a smooth process<\/h2>\n<p>I started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynalden.com\/how-to-invest-in-stocks\/\">investing in stocks<\/a> when I was 16.<\/p>\n<p>Admittedly, I had NO IDEA what I was doing, since to me, a stock was \u201cundervalued\u201d if it dropped a lot in price recently, since it was less valuable than before, and that\u2019s what Warren Buffett said to do, right? \u00a0Or something like that.<\/p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t know about price-to-earnings ratios, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynalden.com\/discounted-cash-flow-analysis\/\">analyzing the discounted cash flows<\/a>, or any other way to fundamentally value an investment like people who wear suits do.<\/p>\n<p>But it was a start.<\/p>\n<p>I was tired of being broke, and of always being uncertain about the future or how I would afford things like school. \u00a0I saw the two halves of my parents, and wanted to put their strengths together in such a way that I wouldn\u2019t have the same struggles they did.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, I read every book I could find on investing. I got excited about spreadsheets, and turned on by compound returns. \u00a0Warren Buffett (and Batman, let\u2019s be real) was my hero.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I was in college, I had it all figured out. \u00a0I knew what the typical starting salary for an engineer was, could figure out all the basic expenses of life and how to keep them small, and calculated that if I put $2,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars away per month, and achieve a 7% average return on my investments, my money would grow like this over my career:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52823\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/awesome-wealth-projection.jpg\" alt=\"awesome wealth projection\" width=\"533\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/awesome-wealth-projection.jpg 772w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/awesome-wealth-projection-300x266.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/awesome-wealth-projection-768x680.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>But in my mid-twenties, my father passed away.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I encountered health problems of my own as well, which lasted for a few years and resulted in big medical bills that weren\u2019t fully covered by insurance, which wasted many thousands of dollars while I was trying to work and save. \u00a0And my mother started needing financial support.<\/p>\n<p>I hadn\u2019t accounted for all that in my projections&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So, I started to go off track, and had a couple years where my wealth didn\u2019t grow at all, and even went down one year. \u00a0My income was stagnant due to my lack of time and focus, and my expenses grew.<\/p>\n<p>I eventually got it back on track, and started pushing my income up and expenses back down.<\/p>\n<p>What I learned here was that we can\u2019t compare ourselves to others. \u00a0I saw examples of people hitting a million dollars by age 30, or people whose net worth seemed to only go ever upward, and I thought, \u201cwhat the hell!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But everyone encounters different curveballs in life, and the worst thing you can do is let a temporary setback drive you permanently off course.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. Experiencing both the good and the bad in life is valuable<\/h2>\n<p>Most of us go through life fearing certain things, and financial topics are near the top of the list.<\/p>\n<p>We worry that we\u2019ll lose our jobs, we worry about debt or retirement, we worry about recessions, and many of us imagine the worst &#8211; what if we\u2019re out on the street? \u00a0What if we\u2019re <i>homeless<\/i>?<\/p>\n<p>In ancient Greece and Rome, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stoicism\">Stoics<\/a> used to practice voluntary discomfort as a form of self-improvement. \u00a0They would identify things that they feared, and deliberately go out and experience them. \u00a0At that point they could say, \u201cis this what I feared?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Being homeless in my youth let me experience at least some small part of the rougher side of the spectrum. \u00a0All these years later, it still helps put things into perspective when I encounter day-to-day problems.<\/p>\n<p>If not for that experience, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be as committed to wealth-building and financial freedom as I am today. \u00a0But rather than stop there, I made a habit of practicing voluntary discomfort from time to time:<\/p>\n<p><b>MMA Fighting<\/b> &#8212; I spent 12 years doing mixed martial arts, especially during my teenage years.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been held down and punched repeatedly by a man twice my weight, on more than one occasion. \u00a0My left knee was broken in a sparring match and still makes some interesting sounds to this day. \u00a0I fractured my right thumb when I hit a guy in the ribs with a hook punch and accidentally clipped his blocking elbow during my swing. \u00a0I\u2019ve been choked to submission and slammed to the floor more times than I can count. \u00a0A professional fighter 15 pounds heavier and 15 years older than me beat me at a tournament so badly once that I cried a little.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, it all makes a lot of things in life seem less scary.<\/p>\n<p><b>Fasting<\/b> &#8212; I used to think that if you don\u2019t eat, you just keep getting hungrier and hungrier, which frightened me. \u00a0So, I decided to try a 3-day fast, with just water.<\/p>\n<p>As it turns out, once you cross a certain point of not eating, the body starts to tap into its own body fat for fuel more readily. \u00a0\u00a0If you go long enough, your brain starts running on ketones instead of glucose, which is known to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25402637\">suppress hunger<\/a> in many people, and give you a sense of alertness. \u00a0Many people fast during religious or spiritual experiences, partially because it creates a sense of mental clarity and even mild euphoria. \u00a0I was less hungry on day 3 than I was on the first day, and I still occasionally do 1-day fasts. \u00a0(Disclaimer: Maybe check with your doctor first before trying any weird eating habits, especially if you\u2019re on meds.)<\/p>\n<p>That experience ended up coming in handy, because a few months later, my town was struck by a thunderstorm deadly enough to have <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/June_2012_North_American_derecho\">a Wikipedia page about it<\/a>. \u00a0I was about to go grocery shopping that morning, so literally the only food I had in my apartment when the storm hit was a single chocolate bar.<\/p>\n<p>Power was out for miles, stores were closed or emptied out, and more fallen trees than I had ever seen in my life were blocking roads. \u00a0Three people were dead not too far away, and the county was declared a federal disaster area. \u00a0But because I had already experienced what fasting really felt like, I didn\u2019t feel like there was much to worry about, and just thought calmly about how I should best approach this and get supplies from somewhere, eventually.<\/p>\n<p>It would have been a lot more stressful had I not already experienced what not eating is like.<\/p>\n<p><b>Lack of Control<\/b> &#8212; I\u2019m an orderly person that likes to plan everything in advance and have multiple backup plans. \u00a0The idea of not being in control is unappealing.<\/p>\n<p>So, I once flew to Argentina without telling a single person where I was going, and rented an apartment in a middle class non-touristy neighborhood of Buenos Aires for three weeks. I don\u2019t speak a word of Spanish, and English isn\u2019t very common there.<\/p>\n<p>The whole trip consisted of me trying to navigate around the city to see things, with everything being 10x harder than usual because I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and couldn\u2019t speak very well. \u00a0But it was memorable, and reminds me how easy life is with a car, and where I can speak to people and read signs.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Final Words<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a Chinese proverb that goes, \u201cwealth never survives three generations\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>From what Money Magazine <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/3925308\/rich-families-lose-wealth\/\">has reported<\/a>, it\u2019s true. \u00a0A full 70% of wealthy families lose their wealth by the second generation, and 90% lose it by the third generation.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s an astounding statistic if you think about it. \u00a0Not only do most of them not continue to build wealth from their starting point; they actually <i>lose<\/i> what they already have.<\/p>\n<p>Partly that\u2019s because, according to the same article, 2\/3rds of people don\u2019t disclose almost anything about their wealth to their children. \u00a0As the next generation grows up, they often don\u2019t have any of the money habits or hard work ethic of their parents that originally built the wealth from the ground up.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, parents want to give their children a better life than they had. \u00a0But often in doing so, the next generation becomes soft and pampered, unable to appreciate their money that they didn\u2019t have to earn themselves, and never developing the skills to maintain and build what they have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, if you don\u2019t have a lot of money and didn\u2019t come from a well-off background, then take heart!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although you may be disadvantaged in some ways, in other ways you have an advantage, because you\u2019re <i>hungry for more<\/i>, and you have to create what you want from scratch. \u00a0Not a lot of people set out on a wealth-building lifestyle, but once you get on that train, you\u2019ve got all the money habits in place that should keep you going up.<\/p>\n<p>And if you did come from money, and don\u2019t want to fall prey to the statistics, then try to continually rekindle that sense of energy and passion and vulnerability so that you can maintain all the advantages of having money without having the downsides of complacency. \u00a0Practicing voluntary discomfort is useful in that sense.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, it\u2019s important to push yourself, to stay fresh by experiencing multiple sides of the world, and to put yourself in new and uncomfortable situations to learn and grow from them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But live below your means and save and invest like hell, so that as much of the discomfort as possible that you experience in life is by <i>choice<\/i>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>******<br \/>\n<em><strong>Lyn<\/strong> blogs over at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynalden.com\/\">LynAlden.com<\/a><i>, and holds a bachelor\u2019s in electronics engineering and a master\u2019s in engineering management with a focus on engineering economics.
