And since they&#8217;re independently run and not associated with any insurance companies, they&#8217;re free to be nice and transparent.<\/p>\n<p>But what I REALLY LIKE that they offer, mainly just because I love taking polls\/quizzes\/games and seeing how good I&#8217;m doing, haha, is their <em><strong>Insurability Score&#x2122;<\/strong><\/em> tool. Which analyzes a bunch of data you enter, and then spits out how &#8220;insurable&#8221; you are to companies. As well as how to improve your standing if you happen to not score as high as you&#8217;d like :)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a clip off <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/insurability-score\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their site<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Car insurance companies use more than 43,500 factors to calculate your risk and determine your rates \u2013 but they don\u2019t tell you how they do it.

Haven&#8217;t changed or looked for different insurance in approximately 20 years (USAA for life, baby!), but it was fun to see where I fell in case the apocalypse ever hits ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was really cool though, was that they show you *how your rates change* with every question you answer as you&#8217;re filling it out so you can see how they all play a part. The goods, the bads, and the so-so&#8217;s.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I missed it the first time I took the questionnaire (it&#8217;s in the upper right hand corner of the site), but I started over and retook it again, just so I can take notes and give y&#8217;all the play-by-play ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it went down, with the starting point being <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$141\/mo<\/strong><\/span> for the &#8220;Minimum&#8221; plan which the below changes are based off&#8230; I also included my answers in the first set of parentheses, along with the changed rate as I went along in the second set of parentheses so you can see how it affects one another.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here we go!<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much do you drive yearly? (&lt; 7,500 miles) &#8212; dropped by <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$7.00<\/strong><\/span> ($134.00)<\/li>\n<li>Where do you live?
