A few people reached out and asked why I was selling, so here are my thoughts and feelings on the matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll begin with some background info on which hopefully provides a more complete picture of how I got to where I am today.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>A Real Estate Focused Upbringing:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My grandpa was a successful realtor. My favorite uncle was a successful mortgage broker. They both owned a handful of rental properties, and I grew up wanting to be like them. I heard from school friends that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cmost rich people are rich because of real estate\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whether that\u2019s a right or wrong statement, I didn\u2019t care. I was always focused on owning real estate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was 18, my parents had an opportunity to buy their first investment property. I jumped at the chance to invest with them, and put all my hard earned <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/crappy-jobs-on-my-path-to-fire\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">savings from McDonald\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to work. I was finally the proud owner of \u00bc of a little 2 bedroom townhouse. Mum made me manage the books, and I quickly learned how cashflow worked. I loved it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember my uncle sat me down one day when I was 19. He said, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJoel, you should save up enough money to buy out your parents\u2019 share of the rental. Then, save up and buy a full place on your own. Then buy 2 more properties, then another 4 properties after that. <\/span><\/i><b><i>Real estate multiplies.<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0This didn\u2019t really make sense to me at the time, but now I understand. I pretty much followed his exact advice, and 15 years later I owned over 20 doors (some myself, some with investing partners).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, the reason I am so real estate heavy today is because I had tunnel vision growing up. I never learned another way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>There Are Other Ways To Build Wealth?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owned 3 properties before I really learned how a 401k worked. I had zero knowledge about mutual funds, index funds, or how to evaluate publicly traded companies (still don\u2019t know how to do that actually). I was almost 30 before I began educating myself on other types of investments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started hanging out with a new crowd at work. These people were maxing out their 401ks, always talking about the stock market, and they seemed to be making money hand over fist. (This was in the mid-2010\u2019s). This was the moment I realized I should probably have a broader view about how to build my fortune.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, I recall 2 moments that humbled me:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ran some numbers on the very first investment property I bought when I was 18&#8230; I compared its performance over 15 years of ownership to how the stock market performed over that same 15 years. Guess what I found? If I invested my cash in the SP500 back then instead of buying that rental, I would have earned almost the exact same ~9.5% YoY return (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/first-investment-property\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comparison figures posted here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you\u2019re interested).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realized saving up cash for many years to build up a down payment had great opportunity cost. It took me about 7 years to save up 60k for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/yes-you-can-buy-a-rental-property-in-another-state\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my duplex<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If I had been trickling that money into an index fund instead (better yet, inside a tax advantaged account like a 401k), I would be in a much better position today.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While investing in real estate matched my experience, personality and skills earlier in life, I\u2019m not sure it matches my future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, here are the list of reasons &#8212; some technical, some emotional &#8212; why I\u2019m slowly transitioning away from rental properties.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1) I don\u2019t really find it fun anymore<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is listed as reason #1 intentionally. When my heart\u2019s not 100% in on something, it\u2019s very difficult for me to wake up every day and try to be a master at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to dream about buying large apartment complexes. In my sleep I would create imaginary rent rolls, vacancy rates, maintenance costs, and try to calculate the ROI in my head. (I know, this is really nerdy! But I couldn\u2019t help it. That\u2019s just where my mind drifted.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, I don\u2019t fantasize about real estate any more. I dream about other weird problems. Like, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why are so many people out there in consumer debt? How can I help this situation? Why isn\u2019t personal finance taught as a mandatory subject in middle\/high schools? How can I help change this?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2) Trying to better adjust my asset allocation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably gathered this from my backstory&#8230; I am heavy in real estate holdings and need to play catch up on the stock side of my portfolio. Some experts recommend having a 20% steak in real estate investments (not including your primary home). I\u2019m like over 50% currently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since my wife and I don\u2019t have great incomes right now, we can\u2019t contribute huge amounts of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> money into the stock market to correct our asset allocation. Selling a few rental properties and reinvesting that money into stocks is a quicker way to lower our overall real estate percentage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephen Covey says, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cbegin with the end in mind\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you asked me 10 years ago what my end goal was, I would have told you I wanted to own 100 x rental properties. These days, my perfect retirement portfolio is more like ~$1M in a pre tax IRA, ~$1M in a after-tax brokerage account, and 2 small rental props.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since my end goal is changing, my strategy is accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3) It\u2019s more work than I thought it would be<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owning a rental property is not \u201cpassive income\u201d. It requires ongoing work. Owning 2 properties requires double that work. Owning 3 starts to bog you down more, and the problem only gets worse from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are certainly systems and automated processes to help you manage scaling, but those systems also require more money and maintenance. All businesses reach a point of diminishing returns, and I\u2019ve hit mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t get me wrong &#8211; I\u2019m not scared of hard work. I actually love working hard. But I\u2019m chewing so much right now I don\u2019t have room to bite into other projects I want to pursue. So I need to spit a little bit out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this realization &#8212; and this is completely my fault &#8212; is messing up on property classification. A few properties I bought thinking that they were \u201cB class\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be much effort or hassle. Turns out they are more like \u201cC class\u201d properties, and have more maintenance and issues than I accounted for. Another time I\u2019ll go into the massive differences between A, B, C, and D class properties, and why it matters greatly!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>4) I own a couple of sub-par performers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My plan is to keep the best performing properties with the most prosperous outlook, and sell some of the lower ones that give me the most headaches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They aren\u2019t terrible investments, but they certainly aren\u2019t winners either. My feeling is that I can make the same amount of returns with that money invested elsewhere, for less ongoing efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve asked other investors and mentors about holding onto low-performing investments, and I get split responses\u2026 Some people say, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJust wait. If you hold property long enough it\u2019ll eventually make money\u201d. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other investors say, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGet out ASAP. Sitting, waiting, and hoping for appreciation isn\u2019t a good investment strategy\u201d.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I kind of agree with both sides. So I\u2019m going to do both. I\u2019m going to keep a few rentals and sell a few rentals. Only time will tell if I\u2019ve made the right decision. I\u2019m not worried because my wife and I will survive either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>5) Emotional Simplification :)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might not make sense to some of you, but it\u2019s weighing on me more and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you own rental properties, you take on a certain amount of responsibility for other people\u2019s livelihood. I have 20+ families living under roofs that I own&#8230;\u00a0 And even though I\u2019m not responsible for them living their life, I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s something more I could be doing to help them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes running a business means turning off your emotional side. It\u2019s about numbers, profit, and what makes sense for the business. But, I am finding it harder and harder to do this. I\u2019ve tried to play the role of ruthless asshole unemotional landlord &#8211; and it\u2019s just not me. I don\u2019t like doing business that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe it\u2019s the pandemic. Maybe it\u2019s all the late rent, job loss stories, squatters, and evictions that are getting to me. Offloading some of my properties to another young enthusiastic entrepreneurial investor would be a win\/win.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6) My relationship with \u201ccash\u201d is changing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I\u2019m learning more about investing, earning less income, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/slow-down-fire-is-not-a-race\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slowing down our route to FIRE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, my feelings about cash are changing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to LOVE storing up huge amounts of money in my checking account (it gave me freedom and flexibility to jump on new opportunities). But now, I feel the opposite. <\/span><b>Any cash I hold is money that isn\u2019t working for me.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s a burden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 2 problems I have with real estate investing and cash needed:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, any new real estate purchases require a good sized cash deposit to begin. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(yes, I know all about the $0 down options and OPM strategies &#8211; they are not for me)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since my wife and I have lowered our income, it\u2019s difficult for us to save up a large deposit. Saving up money in cash over many years means it\u2019s not earning good compound interest in the meantime. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, owning rental properties means you gotta have large amounts of <\/span><b>cash reserves for each property<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you own. It feels good when you only own a few places, but as you scale you realize that you\u2019re holding onto multiple emergency funds. I\u2019m uncomfortable with how much cash reserves I\u2019m sitting on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7) I can always buy more real estate later, and in other ways.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buy and hold rental properties isn\u2019t the only way to invest in real estate. There are a ton of strategies out there, each with different pros and cons. Private partnerships, money lending, REITS, crowdsourced investing, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve got decades to study, learn, and experiment with different methods of buying more real estate. While none of these excite me right now, that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t change my mind and invest more later.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My reasons don\u2019t need to be your reasons!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorry if some of my dot points above sounded complain-y. They are all good problems to have! Hopefully you have insight now into why I\u2019m transitioning away from owning individual rental properties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But just cause I\u2019m selling stuff, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be buying stuff! Real estate has been a wicked (and fun!) vehicle for me so far in life, and I LOVE helping beginners roll up their sleeves and get involved in new rental projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would love to hear from you guys with similar experiences, or opposing views.
