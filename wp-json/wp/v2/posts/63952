I couldn\u2019t change the town and as an older man, I tried to change my family.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, as an old man, I realize the only thing I can change is myself, and suddenly I realize that if long ago I had changed myself, I could have made an impact on my family. My family and I could have made an impact on our town. Their impact could have changed the nation and I could indeed have changed the world.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My great-great grandfather wrote this passage! Just kidding, I found it on the internet somewhere. (But since I\u2019ve searched for hours and still can\u2019t find the true source, you can\u2019t say for certain that it <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wasn\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an old relative of mine back in the day &#x1f61c;.) Many sites credit this passage to \u201cthe Unknown Monk.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of who wrote it first, what a cool reminder that <\/span><b>big changes begin with self-improvement and small personal habits. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things naturally pick up steam from there and compound over the years to a much larger scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Pay Yourself First, Even If It\u2019s Starting Small<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend of mine here in Los Angeles said something similar to the passage above. But his context was about money and personal finance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend is in his 50s and is the classic case of \u201cincome rich \/ asset poor.\u201d He earns an admirable annual income &#8212; more than $350k per year! &#8212; but hasn\u2019t accumulated very many assets in life. He is only now realizing he will have trouble retiring without making some pretty drastic lifestyle changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He started out with big ideas and goals\u2026 As a young college grad he dreamed of building a successful business and selling it for millions of dollars. He wanted to have a big house, vacation homes, and provide a rich life for his family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When his dreamy business plan didn\u2019t work out, he focused on trying to get a job with a massive salary. He thought that with a huge annual income, he\u2019d certainly become a millionaire. But while his salary grew and grew, so did his cost of living. His kids adopted expensive tastes and were (and still are) large financial liabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend realizes now that if he had learned some basic saving techniques at a young age, he could have built extreme wealth throughout his life. Paying himself first &#8212; just a small amount from each paycheck &#8212; would have compounded over time, and he certainly would have been the multi-millionaire he set out to be. His kids might have even been, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a millionaire starts with learning how to make, save, and invest $1. Then repeat that process a million times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Donations and Volunteering: Start Small<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the majority of humans <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be as generous as possible. Sure, there are takers out there, but I believe the majority of people in the world are givers &#8212; or at least desire to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I\u2019ve noticed though is that people tend to hold back their giving, until they can give in larger ways&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you spare 100 bucks to give to charity? &#8212;&gt;<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cI could, but I\u2019d rather wait until I\u2019m a millionaire and give a $10k donation. A larger donation later will have more impact.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you volunteer at a vaccine site next Saturday for a few hours? &#8212;&gt; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWell, my few hours probably wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference&#8230; But once I\u2019m retired I\u2019ll have lots of free time up my sleeve, so I plan to volunteer a bunch!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m not writing this to guilt people into giving more. I\u2019ve had this type of mindset, too! Just like the unknown monk story, I think many people have grand dreams to save the world, but instead should start small and locally. Giving has a ripple effect!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Big Changes Start From Within!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you\u2019re going about your day today, working toward your lofty goals in life&#8230; keep in mind that massive changes begin with personal development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What small steps are you taking to change yourself today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy Friday my friends,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love, Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;When I was a young man, I wanted to change the world.
