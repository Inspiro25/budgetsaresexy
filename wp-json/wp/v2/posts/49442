I&#8217;m not sure if he ended up getting kicked out of his house or not, but he did stumble across something that I think is actually a pretty damn good idea for him. Would you agree?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since our initial talk I have sent my application of for the Royal Navy and just passed my entry test a few days ago (it&#8217;s essentially an IQ test) with many more tests to come. So if all goes well I could be at boot camp in a years time from now give or take a few months.<\/p>\n<p>If you were to look at my credentials then you would realise how suited to a military career I am, and I would be fully going into it with a clear vision of what military life is like &#8211; not some rose tinted patriotic bullsh*t. I plan on signing up for 6 years initially making me around 24 when my contract is up so if I hate it I can leave but if I&#8217;m in love then I can extend my contract. My first choice of job is aircrewman so that is basically flying around in the back of helicopters (badass) but they have high standards for everything. My second is seaman specialist (interesting name) which is essentially a typical sailors role tying knots and grafting hard.<\/p>\n<p>Your responses were read and appreciated 1,000,000% and definitely helped put some of my questions I had to rest.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Now to our guy, Dave, who was <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/08\/get-comfortable-investing-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\">having trouble investing his hard-earned cash<\/a>&#8230;<\/strong> He was worried about needing it in an emergency, and although we never found out just how much he had stored up, I think his update gives us a clue :)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thank you for the advice. I took it and have started moving it into investment properties. It&#8217;s something I have always wanted to do and have found some properties I can put it in.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t see that one coming! Haha&#8230; Glad he followed his passions, but wow&#8230; He went all in, didn&#8217;t he? Hopefully by &#8220;moving it into&#8221; he means &#8220;doing lots of researching and planning and finding real estate mentors\/deals&#8221; than just pouring the money right in&#8230; At least he&#8217;s taking action though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Next up &#8211; WE GOT AN ANTENNA AND IT WORKS MAGNIFICENTLY!<\/strong> 32 free stations including all the major networks and most importantly &#8211; NFL football!!

All attempts at our old house didn&#8217;t work out so well, and we weren&#8217;t sure which of the half dozen options &#8211; ranging from $12-$90 &#8211; we&#8217;d end up going with at the end&#8230; Ironic that it was the old-school bunny ears that did the trick! And I&#8217;m told the picture quality is actually <em>better<\/em> over airwaves vs cable too because cable compresses it.

Some boxes have taken a lot longer than we&#8217;ve wanted, while other times I&#8217;ve forgotten and then had to double up to make sure we&#8217;re still on track (which is much harder than just doing one a week!).<\/p>\n<p>At any event, we&#8217;ve gone through about 8 and 1\/2 containers now and it seems like we&#8217;re averaging a 30\/30\/40 ratio: 30% we keep, 30% we donate, and 40% we just chuck\/recycle.

And while I&#8217;ve gone in my phases of &#8220;sleeping in&#8221; until 6 am some months, I&#8217;ve generally stuck to waking up much earlier &#8211; typically 5:15&#8217;ish &#8211; than I used to, and still very much appreciate the perks that come with it (so much so that it&#8217;s now habit!):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking in the stillness &#8211; and beauty &#8211; of the mornings<\/li>\n<li>Appreciating life more, and slowing down<\/li>\n<li>Setting your own tone for the day vs anyone\/thing else!<\/li>\n<li>Being much less stressed than normal (doesn&#8217;t solve all of it, but certainly nicer than more of it :))<\/li>\n<li>Feeling like you&#8217;re a part of something bigger (there&#8217;s a whole group of early risers!)<\/li>\n<li>Having the pure &#8220;alone&#8221; time (no distractions, obligations, people pinging you)<\/li>\n<li>Being able to work\/think more efficiently<\/li>\n<li>And one of the best perks of them all &#8211; sleeping much more soundly at night&#8230; I still get (and remember!) the wildly vivid dreams every single night too!
