(here&#8217;s my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/03\/self-employment-update-being-the-boss\/\">3-month update<\/a> on self-employment so far, wouldn&#8217;t change it for the world!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>With your change in regular income have you done anything to lower your bills such as starting a garden, using solar flood lights or landscape lights, or grocery shopping for the month to take advantage of volume discounts?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nope, not yet &#8211; but I DO like where you&#8217;re going with this!!\u00a0 I&#8217;ll tell you something funny though, because I&#8217;m workin&#8217; so hard on all my projects every day, I&#8217;ve actually started spending way less *by accident* haha&#8230; because I pretty much work out of my home now, I&#8217;m not tempted by all the stores around me or by what my friends are doing that day\/night, so I rarely spend any extra money right now besides the bills :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your dream vacation? What has been the best vacation you have been on to date?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oooooh, my dream vacation has always been Australia :)\u00a0 But I only wanna do it with all my friends w\/ me so we can all experience it together.\u00a0 I&#8217;d also like to start hitting up more tropical places too, haven&#8217;t been to many places like that lately.\u00a0 Best vacay ever?\u00a0 Last year&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/06\/im-baaaaaaaaaaack\/\">Eurotrip<\/a>!\u00a0 My favorite city in the world is now Prague &#8211; freakin&#8217; love that place! (and beer only costs like $2.00, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>My husband and I are expecting a baby in June. Should we focus on consumer debt or all debt (student loans included) until that time? We have an Emergency Fund in place and will be creating a Baby Emergency Fund ($1,000 just in case we are short on cash with our zero balance budgeting). We are also currently lined up to pay off 4 credit cards (one a month) in the next 4 months, so that will greatly diminish our consumer debt.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would totally save every last penny I could and build up that Emergency Fund as plump as you can make it. I think what you&#8217;re doing w\/ the debt is INCREDIBLE, and very very smart (1 credit card a month?\u00a0 Dang!) but kid stuff scares me and I&#8217;d want access to as much liquid cash I could get my hands on if needed.\u00a0 The sucky part about paying off your debt is that once you &#8220;spend&#8221; that money it&#8217;s gone, whereas when you save it you still have options to do whatever you want with it &#8211; including paying off debt if need be.\u00a0 But again, that&#8217;s me &#8211; always hard to &#8220;advise&#8221; when you don&#8217;t know each other well ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think it\u2019s possible to save too much for retirement?

What are the key things you did to build your blog when you frist started? 2. What are your top income streams (blog and non-blog)?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1)\u00a0 I immersed myself in it completely &#8211; I read every single blog post I could from others, I left comments and emailed back and forth with &#8217;em, I did carnivals every week, guest posts every other week, and above all I forced myself to be consistent.\u00a0 If I didn&#8217;t blog at least once a day, M-F, there coulda been a good chance I would have gotten lazy over the years ;)<\/p>\n<p>2) Adsense and direct text links (the &#8220;sexy sponsors&#8221; section over there) &#8211; something I need to quit doing because not only is it not sustainable, but it looks like trash. Other streams:\u00a0 graphical ads, blogging for other websites\/companies, side projects, and in theory, Love Drop.\u00a0 But when you give away all your company&#8217;s money, it&#8217;s hard to pay yourself anything ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are a couple of your biggest fears as it pertains to life and income? Do you think you\u2019ll ever go back to full-time work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Life:\u00a0 That I just burn out from workin&#8217; so hard.\u00a0 If I didn&#8217;t get laid off from my 9-5, It coulda happened pretty much at any point and who knows how effective I&#8217;d be then.<\/p>\n<p>Income:\u00a0 That I&#8217;d have to go back to working a 9-5 :) As crazy as it sounds, I am MUCH happier now making 50% less than I was rolling in the money. I know I have to start ramping up my income again sometime in the future, but right now as long as I&#8217;m making enough to pay the bills I am feeling a-okay.<\/p>\n<p>Going back to work: No, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever go back to a typical 9-5 again, BUT after this year&#8217;s over (I&#8217;m going 12 months without applying to a single job to see if I can do it) I might entertain consulting and\/or jobs that aren&#8217;t really job-like, if you will ;)\u00a0 If there&#8217;s a company out there building something great and I really believe in what they&#8217;re doing, I&#8217;d certainly consider it if they can use my help. I&#8217;m just never taking a job again just cuz I need the money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever considered a Podcast?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, but I&#8217;m not good thinking on my feet :)\u00a0 What I would have a lot more fun with, is doing a show based on *anything* in life over specifically money.\u00a0 Kinda like today&#8217;s &#8220;live&#8221; blogging Q&amp;A.\u00a0 This is fun as $hit! I&#8217;d def. want a sidekick too so the audience can have more than just 1 viewpoint. Nate and I have joked about it before, but mainly so we can prank each other on-air ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now that you\u2019re no longer anonymous with the Love Drop videos, have you considered swapping the GW goatee pic with one of you and that awesome mohawk?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, kinda.\u00a0 I still feel pretty anonymous here though cuz not everyone cares, or knows, about Love Drop all the way so it&#8217;s still kinda sneaky-feeling. Which I love :)\u00a0 I&#8217;d never give out my real name though cuz it&#8217;s a) boring, and b) I still need that sense of privacy going on&#8230; but yeah &#8211; I&#8217;ll eventually kick out the ol&#8217; George Washington and swap in my real mug.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your favorite PF blogs (please say me, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thousandaire.com\/\">please say me<\/a>) and what\u2019s your favorite non-PF website?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Haha, I actually DO enjoy yours a lot.

(and yes, it was a real document, not drugs or anything, haha\u2026)<\/p>\n<p>2) I used to wash wrecked cars that were about to go up on auction. A quick $5 car wash (that takes 7 minutes) and dumping of inside trash brings in at LEAST $200-$300 more for each car. Even though it\u2019s totaled and will be taken apart for parts. Interesting, huh?<\/p>\n<p>3) Most embarrassing might have been when I had to be Old Navy\u2019s official \u201cgreeter\u201d in downtown New York City during xmas. I always got chosen cuz I loved talking to people, but I felt like an a$$ due to the stares I\u2019d get from customers walking in. Especially since I had a diploma. But then again, I was living my dream at the time so I was putting up with a lot to be there ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of Retailer Reward Cards that are linked to your personal accounts and can be used as a debit cards at their locations?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Woah!\u00a0 I think that sounds both AWESOME and SCARY at the same time ;)\u00a0 Although do you mean &#8220;rewards card&#8221; as in a separate credit card from the retailer?\u00a0 Or a rewards card like one you scan at Safeway to get you $X off?\u00a0 If it&#8217;s the latter, I&#8217;d be all about that and attach ALLLLLL my rewards card to my 1 account cuz I never remember to bring all those cards and I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it again.\u00a0 Of course, I&#8217;m very trusting and would hope that they don&#8217;t have access to my accounting info, etc where they can F something up.\u00a0 If that&#8217;s a possibility, then forget it.\u00a0 Also, if you&#8217;re not good at managing your money\/cards,\u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t recommend signing up to any rewards cards at all (if you&#8217;re talking about the &#8220;Credit card&#8221; types).<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you had to leave the country and never move back, where would you live?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would have to travel around the world first and stay at different places for a month to see what I like the most :)\u00a0 But if I had to pick before that, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a tie between Puerto Rico (if that&#8217;s allowed), the Carribean, and England.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You were handed 1milli in cash and were told you must spend it by end of the day\u2026 your plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would give our Love Drop family $100,000, my sister $100k, my brother $100k, I would pay off our house, and then I&#8217;d ask my friends what their fave causes are and I&#8217;d donate the rest there.\u00a0 If I can&#8217;t give any away and had to actually buy &#8220;stuff&#8221; (which I assume is what you&#8217;re asking? haha&#8230;) I&#8217;d buy myself a car and a new laptop, then throw a massive party somewhere and invite all my blog friends out for us to get it all outta our system so we can go back to being frugal again! hahaha&#8230;.\u00a0 and then find a way to buy things for the less fortunate. Which I know is one of those &#8220;stock&#8221; answers, but I&#8217;d for real do it.\u00a0 I&#8217;d have to punch myself in the balls if I didn&#8217;t give back because right now in my life it means more to me than it ever has.

Does that make sense?\u00a0 To me it doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;m making, say, $100,000 from 10 jobs or from 1, it&#8217;s still $100,000 that will somewhere be reflected in my net worth updates :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>If your financial cushion wasn\u2019t as large when you lost your job, would you have done anything differently?
