He brings up something good to consider while y&#8217;all are out there looking for new side hustles!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Most personal finance sites I read have at least 1 post (or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">entire sections<\/a>) about having a side hustle.<\/strong> The reasons behind why you should do this usually falls into &#8220;diversify your income streams&#8221; or simply, &#8220;increase your income.&#8221; The two ideas go hand in hand so it really doesn&#8217;t matter which reasoning you are using because all apply.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been told that the best side hustles are doing something that you are <em>passionate about<\/em>. If you enjoy graphic design, creating websites on the side might be a good idea. If you like to find bargains at flea markets, then maybe you should open a shop on eBay or Amazon with what you find. If it&#8217;s something that you enjoy, then you get to enjoy the experience along with making a side income &#8211; a win-win scenario.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I have always been reluctant to find a side hustle.<\/strong> Personally, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.work-to-not-work.com\/2014\/03\/im-buying-my-time.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I view my free time as valuable<\/a> so whatever hustle I do has to either moderately pay me back, or have the potential to really pay me back. It would be great to have a hustle that I really enjoy and happens to make me money, but if I have to\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0do it over and over again then it will probably turn something I enjoy into &#8220;work&#8221; pretty quickly. And I&#8217;m not really trying to ruin my hobbies.<\/p>\n<p>I also think that the only things that I would enjoy doing are not really things that other people would actually pay me for. Sure it would be great to get paid to watch NetFlix but honestly, I <em>pay<\/em> to do that, no one is going to pay <em>me<\/em>. (Though maybe I should look into the Nielson company and see if I can get paid to watch regular TV? That would be worth my time!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, a few weeks ago my friend who happens to be an artist had a painting party for her birthday.<\/strong> Since I used to be really into collecting art (an expensive habit I might add), I was excited to be the one painting something for once. I don&#8217;t consider myself to be very artistic, especially in comparison to those painters I would regularly go see at galleries, but it sounded fun. Since I knew the actual quality of my painting would not be very good, I decided to make a painting that was funny, that way people might still enjoy it even if it looks like something a 7 year old painted in school.<\/p>\n<p>Before the actual party my friend told us to send her a picture of what we wanted to paint and she would sketch it on the canvas for us as a guide to paint over. To make a long story short, I think my painting turned out pretty well. It&#8217;s funny and the actual &#8220;painting&#8221; part of it is not too bad:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-P-gncWiOSKY\/UyaA7Upr8hI\/AAAAAAAAAEo\/_Mnp8UKrEAQ\/s1600\/Bronies.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38460\" alt=\"bronies before hoenies\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bronies-before-hoenies.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bronies-before-hoenies.jpg 450w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bronies-before-hoenies-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Since I enjoyed painting it so much, I decided that I wanted to hang it up on my walls.<\/strong> Which in turn,\u00a0made me decide to frame it. This required me to paint the frame because honestly the color of frame that I was looking for would not be readily available. I did a first coat on the frame in a neon pink, then once that dried I put over a crackled layer of green so you could still see the pink through it.<\/p>\n<p>It took a few extra days to do all of this and learn how to frame\u00a0something on canvas, but\u00a0I had a lot of fun creating something and learning new skills. Here&#8217;s a picture of it after framing:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-fSLrGTGfvSE\/UyaA5hn5INI\/AAAAAAAAAEg\/oYL-cMrzwNw\/s1600\/BRONY.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38461\" alt=\"bronies before hoenies framed\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bronies-b4-hoenies-framed.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bronies-b4-hoenies-framed.jpg 450w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bronies-b4-hoenies-framed-242x300.jpg 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As more people have seen it, a few have suggested that I could sell it. Since I followed the art scene I know where I could do this probably pretty easily, and if all else failed I could always try Etsy or eBay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But here&#8217;s my problem: I like it too much to want to sell it!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I realize that I did not originally set out to make this a side hustle, so maybe it&#8217;s not a total fail,\u00a0but I could easily see myself trying to make a fun activity into income.\u00a0Some people at work have even said they would buy paintings from me when I joked about making a zombie hello kitty painting. [Editor&#8217;s Note: I know I would! Haha&#8230; I love this type of painting style!]<\/p>\n<p>The problem is, I&#8217;m too attached to what I create. Their personal worth to me is much greater than a dollar amount I could reasonably stand to receive. And this is why I&#8217;m terrible at the whole side hustle business that other bloggers are always talking about. I think it&#8217;s a great idea for some people, but for me it just doesn&#8217;t seem to work because doing things for <em>passion<\/em> means I&#8217;d want to keep what I produce, not sell it.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Are there any artists out there that have this same issue?\u00a0Is it possible I started doing something I&#8217;m too passionate about?<\/strong><\/em> We will see what the future holds, but for now I am enjoying the spot near my desk at work where it&#8217;s currently hanging.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Zee<\/strong> is a personal finance blogger in San Francisco. You can find more of his writing at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.work-to-not-work.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Work To Not Work<\/a> where he writes about his journey to reach financial independence and escape the corporate workplace. He is not a Brony.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:<\/strong> I think Zee brings up a REALLY good point. And I&#8217;m willing to bet a ton of others have this same problem too &#8211; at least in the art scene. As I mentioned to Zee, I wonder if this would change if you got paid *ahead* of the process of the artwork? Like, would it reduce temptation since you&#8217;re making it or someone else right off the start? AND you already have the money in your hands so now you&#8217; *have to* hand it over? It&#8217;s interesting to think about for sure.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, however, there are a ton of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OTHER great ways to rock a side hustle<\/a> too. Particularly by offering *services*. So don&#8217;t give up quite yet, Zee and others in the same boat! Maybe you guys can find a way to drum up some cash in a more boring way? ;)<\/p>\n<p><em>[Neon passion sign by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pinkmoose\/178865612\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Anthony Easton<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[We&#8217;ve got a great article today by my boy Zee from Work-to-Not-Work.com.
