Got a great post for y&#8217;all today by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mamafishsaves.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mama Fish Saves<\/a> who tells us what it&#8217;s like to work on Wall Street. And spoiler alert: it&#8217;s not as glamorous as it sounds ;) When you&#8217;re done reading the article make sure to stop by her blog and say hi! She&#8217;s a newer blogger on the scene!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<p>As a lifelong finance nerd, there was nothing more exciting than stepping foot into one of the biggest investment banks in the world as a full-time employee. I was right out of school, as green as they come, and working on Wall Street! What I learned about money and investing over the next several years could fill books. But the lessons that stuck with me most aren\u2019t what you would expect.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>A little bit of background<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I started my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mamafishsaves.com\/about-me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">career on Wall Street<\/a> as an intern in the summer of 2009 working on a trading desk at a major bank. The company was still adjusting from the mass layoffs and walkouts of the global financial crisis. It was an eye opening and scary intro to the world of finance.<\/p>\n<p>The following summer I moved to equity research at a top investment bank and accepted a full-time position for post-graduation.\u00a0 After graduating from a small liberal arts school with a double major in economics and mathematics, I moved to New York City for my new job.<\/p>\n<p>As an analyst in equity research, I had the opportunity to interact with other analysts, traders, investment bankers, corporate management teams, and portfolio managers from around the world. It was like spending three years trying to drink from a fire hose. Then I moved to a hedge fund in Boston to begin investing actively. In my career, I\u2019ve had amazing mentors, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2-big-investing-mistakes-that-actually-made-me-smarter\/\">made mistakes<\/a>, and learned incredible amounts about the market and investing. But I think the most valuable knowledge I\u2019ve gained has been from observing my colleagues.<\/p>\n<h2>The expertise needed to win at stock picking is measured in years, not days<\/h2>\n<p>Most retail (personal) investors that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mamafishsaves.com\/stock-market-101\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invest in single stocks<\/a> say that it isn\u2019t risky if you take the time to understand the company.\u00a0 \u00a0While this is probably true, it takes years of experience and expertise to\u00a0<i>actually<\/i>\u00a0understand a company and how that company\u2019s stock trades. (And years to figure out that a company and its stock can be different things.)<\/p>\n<p>Over the past seven years, I\u2019ve spoken to dozens and dozens of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2-big-differences-between-successful-and-unsuccessful-investors\/\" >investors<\/a> who have been in the game for decades. But I know only one person who has consistently beat the index trading stocks. He is incredibly intelligent, focuses on his portfolio full time, and his path isn\u2019t easy to follow.<\/p>\n<p>This individual started his career in private equity, became an investment banker focused on mergers and acquisitions, then worked as a proprietary trader for a top bank investing their cash for profit. When I talk to him about a company, he can give me a 20-year history of their management, acquisitions, performance and initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, when he buys a stock he has read all the regulatory filings, spoken to researchers, met with the management team, and has typically visited at least one of the company\u2019s locations.\u00a0 He\u2019s spent decades watching market cycles and understanding what moves a stock day to day.\u00a0 Even if you researched for weeks on a single company, you couldn&#8217;t replicate his knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>This man has become one of my closest mentors. I value his insight immensely. But I will never invest like he does. I\u2019m not willing to put in the years and years of time. I won&#8217;t commit my life to it.<\/p>\n<h2>Income is not the same as wealth<\/h2>\n<p>On Wall Street, well over half of your annual income comes in the form of a bonus. And every year at bonus time someone was unhappy. In fact, most years, a lot of people were unhappy. It didn\u2019t matter that most bonuses were in the six-figures. It didn\u2019t matter whether the number went up or down from the year before. In general, people just wanted more.<\/p>\n<p>In my second year, one of my more senior colleagues had his first seven-figure year, and he\u00a0<b><i>complained<\/i><\/b>. He was disappointed that more of his bonus wasn\u2019t cash as opposed to stock. I was floored listening to his 1% problems. I knew <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mamafishsaves.com\/more-money-same-problems-breaking-the-cycle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income and wealth<\/a> were different things, but I didn\u2019t understand how anyone could lose so much perspective where they are disappointed with a seven-figure income.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, I have seen many situations like this. I have had more than one colleague that lives paycheck to paycheck. I have had colleagues that can\u2019t afford their mortgages without their annual bonus. Multiple people didn\u2019t contribute enough to their 401k to get our full match! There was even one person who had seven storage units around New York City. Seven storage units were full of expensive crap he couldn\u2019t even fit in his apartment.<\/p>\n<p>These people were amazing investors and well educated, intelligent individuals. But they were also terrible budgeters. Many of them allowed an expensive lifestyle they didn\u2019t even enjoy become a necessity. Their high salary right out of school convinced them they didn\u2019t need to worry about money, so they ignored their spending until they actually did have to worry.<\/p>\n<p>Working in this environment was a real lesson in keeping up with the Joneses. I had the chance to see exactly why more people in the Millionaire Next Door weren\u2019t bankers and lawyers. Bankers, at least, feel the need to live like bankers.<\/p>\n<h2>We were exchanging our health for money<\/h2>\n<p>In my third year on Wall Street, I was sitting at my desk one morning when I suddenly couldn\u2019t feel my left hand. An hour later, I had lost feeling in my entire arm and the left side of my face. I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss, so I headed down to the company\u2019s clinic. (Yes, we had doctors in the building. It was a bit like Hotel California.) At 23, the doctors thought I might be having a stroke and sent me to the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>It took a week of CT scans, ultrasounds, blood tests, and MRIs to get an answer. My now-husband and I had only been dating a few months, and he was more than a little freaked out. I\u2019ll never forget sitting across from a neurologist and being told\u00a0that my symptoms were stress induced. The doctor even had a cute name for it, \u201cstockbroker\u2019s syndrome.\u201d I wasn\u2019t the first he had seen with my symptoms, and I probably won\u2019t be the last.<\/p>\n<h2>The cause of &#8220;stockbroker&#8217;s syndrome&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Before I moved to my current job, where things are a bit less crazy, I worked 15 hour days six, sometimes seven, days a week. My colleagues and I got yelled at by clients and managers. As a second-year analyst, the head of the department spent 15 minutes screaming at me in front of a room of VPs. For no real reason. When you made a bad trade, you weren&#8217;t just losing the money of the ultra-wealthy. You were impacting returns of pension and retirement funds.<\/p>\n<p>I knew three people in my department of maybe 65 that were in their forties and diagnosed with rare forms of cancer. One of my peers collapsed at their desk at 8 pm on a Friday night. We sat on an open floor plan and listened to colleagues fight with their spouses about not being home for dinner again. One of my desk mates missed Halloween with his kids six years in a row.<\/p>\n<p>The stress was real and had a very real impact on my life, and the life of my colleagues. But we weren&#8217;t curing cancer or saving lives. We were making money into more money, for ourselves and our clients. Seeing what that took, the money wasn\u2019t worth it for me.<\/p>\n<h2>How my experience changed how I think about money<\/h2>\n<p>Today I take comfort in the fact that long-term I can\u2019t beat the market trading stocks. It means one less thing to manage actively, more time with my family, and a whole lot less stress. I automate my family\u2019s investments into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mamafishsaves.com\/what-is-a-mutual-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">low-cost index funds<\/a> and forget about it. Less stress means better health and that is the best I can hope for.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how my compensation changes, I focus on living well within my base salary and keeping my bonus a bonus. I never want to be dependent on something I can\u2019t control. My husband and I do our best to keep perspective and appreciate what we have. Each year at bonus time, we first discuss what charities we want to donate to. I remind myself that money can\u2019t buy happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, I am in full speed pursuit of FIRE. Sitting in a New York City hospital room with no feeling in half my body was a terrifying experience and not one I want to face again. It taught me to place joy ahead of money and learn to chase the life I want. \u201cStockbroker\u2019s syndrome\u201d can kiss my ass.<\/p>\n<p>******<br \/>\n<em><b>Chelsea<\/b> is a mother, wife, investment professional, and personal finance nerd.
