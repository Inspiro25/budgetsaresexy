I didn&#8217;t know why we were okay with paying so much over time, but it just seemed &#8220;normal&#8221; so we never second guessed it (even as a personal finance blogger!).<\/p>\n<p>But then we launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Challenge Everything<\/a> project and it completely changed the game.<\/p>\n<p>Most of you are probably tired of hearing about it so I won&#8217;t get too into it again, haha, but for those new to the site it&#8217;s where I decided enough was enough and started tackling my recurring &#8220;normal&#8221; bills to figure out how low we could get them while still enjoying your lives. A handful of months into this and we&#8217;re now saving almost $200 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/12\/challenge-savings-account-1k\/\">EVERY SINGLE MONTH<\/a> completely changing my financial mindset.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But while we knocked our cable down from $170 to $120&#8217;ish<\/strong> &#8211; roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/saving-money-cable-bill\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$50\/mo in savings<\/a>, I knew we could do better. Especially after hearing how many of you frugalers pay next to nothing for it, <em>if<\/em> you even have cable at all.\u00a0 (Spoiler alert: we still have cable because we LOVE it! *gasp*)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The New Plan&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After a month or two of sitting on my ass and patting myself on the back, we finally decided to pull the trigger on the last remaining idea we had to finally lower it as much as we can right now. And that was to scrap our 10 year old perfectly-working-but-outdated-large-screen-tv for a more-compatible-with-new-technlogy-smaller-screen-tv to take advantage of all the online streaming capabilities for free&#8217;ish entertainment. And by &#8220;small&#8221; I mean &#8220;42 inches&#8221; instead of 62 (TWSS?)<\/p>\n<p>You see, not only did mammoth TV not have any HDMI ports to get us hooked up &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/watch-tv-internet-media-free-chromecast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the bane of my existence<\/a> &#8211; but it also didn&#8217;t even have a cable chord connector if you can believe that. And the kind folks over at <a href=\"http:\/\/gomohu.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mohu<\/a> had just sent me a few of their top-rated antennas to try out after following our series here, but without the cable jack I couldn&#8217;t even see if getting free stations was an option. So if we were going to <em>make sure<\/em> to save as much as we could here, again without nixing TV altogether, then we needed to be able to use our Chromecast or Wifi DVD player to connect us to the dang internet.<\/p>\n<p>So I ponied up the $300 to upgrade us into modern technology with a new TV (<a href=\"http:\/\/bensbargains.net\/bargain\/sharp-lc-42lb261u-42-1080p-120hz-hdtv-300-at-best-buy-130188\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sharp 1080p 120Hz HDTV<\/a> on sale from $480 at the time, thanks Brad!), and we were on our way to future savings&#8230; Even though, yes, we had to shell out $300 to get there.

With the last 1 1\/2 stations comprising of 3 that only worked 1\/2 way ;) Though, to be fair, I didn&#8217;t exactly go up on my roof and mount it to truly test it out &#8211; something I didn&#8217;t want to do unless I knew it was going to be a game changer. Also important to note is that I don&#8217;t live smack dab in a large city anymore so that could very well be the reason they failed alone&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>At either rate, free cable was now officially off the table.<\/strong> And if anyone wants to try out any of these antennas I have sitting here now, just <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">give me a shout<\/a> and I&#8217;d be more than happy to mail one over to you.

Is there anything we can do to make this happen?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>And magically it was done :) Dropping our cable bill another $30-$40 to <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$90&#8217;ish<\/span> now &#8211; woo!<\/strong> That&#8217;s a total savings of $80 since we first started this journey by literally making a few phone calls and re-thinking our setup! NICE!<\/p>\n<p>(Okay, well that made it seem all to easy which it kinda was, but *only* if we had just made these calls and decided on this route from day #1 &#8211; which of course we didn&#8217;t. Not only did we have to dick around with trying to scheme the system before we even called up our provider initially (see <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/ooma-review-free-home-phone-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our post on Oooma<\/a> and trying to cancel our home phone line, or the time <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/watch-tv-internet-media-free-chromecast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we attached 101 devices and chords<\/a> to our degenerate TV in order to &#8220;upgrade it&#8221; which blew up in my face), but it took months of really thinking hard on whether we wanted Cable at all in our lives anymore, and then to finally pull the trigger on the real TV upgrade.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So yes &#8211; what actually got us to save a ton of money technically only took a handful of minutes to incorporate,<\/strong> it was more of a monthly journey to get us from step a to step z. And now I&#8217;m thankful I don&#8217;t have to think about it again for quite some time :)<\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the crazy thing. We still have our phone, our internet (which actually got upgraded in the process) and our cable (lower tier now), and it costs almost the same as just having internet-only. And I know this because I priced it in case that was gonna be our final decision! <em><strong>$170 down to $90,<\/strong><\/em> freaking love it.

I don&#8217;t watch a ton of TV really (an hour or so a night?) but I love the break from reality it gives me and realized I&#8217;m quite okay with not saving every last penny if it means increased happiness. Especially if it&#8217;s only a few dollars more than what internet-only would end up costing which I <em>definitely<\/em> couldn&#8217;t cut!<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>I get addicted to *any* show pretty easily, haha&#8230;<\/strong> My biggest concern with dropping HBO et al was that I&#8217;d lose some of my favorite shows like Ray Donovan or Homeland, or God forbid Game of Thrones! Which, admittedly I do miss, however they&#8217;ve since been replaced with Orange is The New Black, House of Cards, and now Friday Night Lights ;) So apparently I adapt easily! [<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">UPDATE:<\/span> Y&#8217;all reminded me that HBO is coming out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/business\/wp\/2014\/10\/15\/hbo-is-launching-a-stand-alone-streaming-service-in-2015\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with their own stand alone service<\/a> soon too!

(Here are some other <a href=\"https:\/\/millennialmoney.com\/best-alternatives-to-cable-tv\/\">cheaper alternatives to Cable TV<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Modern HDTV is much better than 10 years old HDTV :)<\/strong> You can&#8217;t see it in that picture there up at the top, but I hooked up both our TVs to our cable box to see if I could tell the difference. And the answer was, Hell Yeah you can!<\/li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s nice to be able to use stuff you paid for.<\/strong> My DVD player I picked up for $100 during my bone-headed moments was deemed unworkable on our old TV. So now we&#8217;re able to finally use it! Or, rather, my son is as he likes to play Cars and Happy Feet on rotation ;) (Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t let him watch that close to the screen like that &#8211; he snuck in when I was caught up trying to snap a decent pic of the thing, haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I still prefer 62 inches over 42&#8230;<\/strong> not gonna lie.<\/li>\n<li><strong>And lastly, my wife didn&#8217;t kill me when she found out what I did :)<\/strong> (I can thank Orange is The New Black for that, and the fact I didn&#8217;t kill ABC now that The Bachelor is back &#8211; hah)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All this to say there&#8217;s always room to cut down costs.\u00a0 You may have to do some soul searching and phone calls in the process, but if my 3 for 3 scorecard is any indication (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we&#8217;ve saved on cable, insurance, and cell phones so far<\/a>), I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll have decent success too.
