Who not only lives on a freakin&#8217; boat (!!!), but who&#8217;s also rockin&#8217; a nice side hustle on TOP of her 9-5. A pretty interesting setup if you ask me &#8211; and hopefully you enjoy this as much as I did :)]<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A few years ago, my significant other Chris and I had a quaint little house in a great neighborhood in Nashville, with comfortable jobs, yet we weren\u2019t satisfied and we needed a big change. We talked about a move to another state, but still felt as though we might just be making a lateral move, and we figured if we were gonna upset the apple cart, we might as well tip the damn thing over.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, being avid sailors, Chris suggested that we move onto a sailboat and do some traveling.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I told him he was crazy, to which he agreed, and then he said,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We may end up in riches, we may end up in ruins, but I promise you one thing&#8230; it will never be boring.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With that, I hopped on board, so to speak, and we sold the house and almost everything we owned. And, along with our dog Jet, <a href=\"http:\/\/savingtosail.com\/the-cost-of-sailing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moved onto a 35\u2019 sailboat<\/a>. Which means our actual living space is about 115 square feet, or the size of many of your master bathrooms. (Just think about that the next time you\u2019re complaining that you don\u2019t have enough space!)<\/p>\n<p>We love the fact that we are traveling by five-thousand-year-old technology, and that under ideal conditions, we could essentially sail around the world without using a single drop of fuel, powered purely by the wind and sun. Every day, we have a million dollar view without the million dollar price tag, and if we don\u2019t like our neighbors, we move!<\/p>\n<p>Like anything, it has its challenges, and it\u2019s certainly not for everyone, but for us it\u2019s an amazing life.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: -10px;\"><strong>How I Got Started With Side Hustling<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I was fortunate enough that I was able to keep the promotional marketing job I\u2019ve had for the past seven years, since all of my work is done via email and phone. I have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=Verizon%20Jetpack&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verizon Jetpack<\/a> which is basically a mobile modem that allows me to connect to the internet as long as I\u2019m within range of a cell tower, which is great. But it also means we\u2019ve been limited to traveling up and down the East Coast in order for me to stay connected.<\/p>\n<p>As grateful as I am for my full-time gig, we still have dreams of traveling more extensively, and would love to do the Caribbean and make our way south to Panama or Mexico one day.<\/p>\n<p>A year or so ago, I discovered J-Money\u2019s blog and I learned the term &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Side Hustle<\/a>&#8220;, and I\u2019ve been hustling ever since! My goal is to save enough money to allow me to cut the full-time employment umbilical cord so we can do some serious sailing.<\/p>\n<h2>Being a Virtual Assistant<\/h2>\n<p>My <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustles-theyre-not-just-about-extra-money\/\">side hustle<\/a> of choice is being a Virtual Assistant (or VA for short). This means that companies or individuals hire me for a range of things that don\u2019t require me to report to an office &#8211; everything is done remotely, using just my computer or a phone. This is perfect for me because it allows me to find side work no matter where I am.<\/p>\n<p>I also love that there\u2019s a lot of diversity in the work I find. One minute I might be building a WordPress site for someone, the next minute I might be doing research or data entry. By far, my most interesting VA job was <a href=\"http:\/\/savingtosail.com\/side-income-series-story-dirty-old-man\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">typing someone\u2019s X-rated novel<\/a>.\u00a0 Yep. I totally went there.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: -10px;\"><strong>Fifty Shades of Grey (Hair, That is)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-38189\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dirty-old-man-cartoon-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"dirty old man cartoon\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dirty-old-man-cartoon-300x240.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dirty-old-man-cartoon.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><strong>You see, it all started with Craigslist.<\/strong> (I bet lots of interesting stories begin like that.)<\/p>\n<p>I responded to an ad in the computer gigs section from a guy who needed someone to type his novel. His ad explained that he was not tech-savvy so he hand writes everything and needed someone to type it up in a word document. It sounded easy enough, so I took the gig after confirming via a writing sample that I could read his handwriting. At this point he mentioned that his book was an erotic novel.<\/p>\n<p>Ok, I read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0345803485\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0345803485&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50 Shades<\/a> \u2013 so what? I mean we\u2019re all adults here. The funny thing is, he included a business card in the package with the manuscript, upon which was his photo. He looked like a friendly fella. He also looked like he was pushing 70. I giggled because I didn\u2019t expect this man who looked like he could be my Grandpa to be writing erotic fiction. A dirty old man indeed, but hey &#8211; good for him!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then I started typing\u2026 and let\u2019s just say that the kink was in full effect.<\/strong> But that didn\u2019t bother me. What bothered me was the fact that the book was poorly written. I mean, it was terrible! It had inconsistencies, and things that just weren\u2019t right. Names didn\u2019t match up, and for someone who is totally Type A, well, this was a major problem. (Keep in mind I was getting paid only to type &#8211; no editing)<\/p>\n<p>However, once I began, the OCD in me wanted to correct things. But how do you call Gramps and say, \u201cNo way could she take off her underwear because earlier you said she wasn\u2019t wearing any!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After asking if he would be willing to pay extra for me to take the liberty of doing a little editing, he said, very emphatically, \u201cNo. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t let my wife type these for me, because she goes around and changes stuff.\u201d Smart woman.<\/p>\n<p>But I still gotta give it to the old guy. Bad writing or not, his mind was still young, that\u2019s for sure!<\/p>\n<h2>The Downside of Being a VA<\/h2>\n<p>The drawback of virtual assistant work is that it can sometimes be hard to find something that is both enjoyable and pays well. In my experience, you might have to sacrifice one for the other, taking some jobs because you like them (social media type work is some of my favorite) even though you may not make as much, and other times taking jobs that pay pretty decent but are a total snooze-fest (transcribing or some research jobs may require lots of extra coffee for me to get the job done).<\/p>\n<p>My highest paying job was building a series of one-page WordPress sites for a guy who sold domain names. He paid me $25 per site, and because each new site was based on the exact same template with only a few changes to the content, I got to the point where I could install WordPress and build each new page in about 15-20 minutes. That ended up being <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$100 an hour<\/strong><\/span>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>My least paying job was finding potential sales leads and contact info<\/strong> for a fashion-based company who offers paid advertising on Instagram to their hundreds of thousands of followers. I only made $<span style=\"color: #008000;\">8\/hr<\/span> but I did it for about 2 months for two reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was fun to browse the websites of boutiques, jewelry designers and fashionistas to see if they would be a good fit for my client\u2019s services. Being on a sailboat does not afford me the luxury of space to support my love for fashion (my closet is only 24 inches wide), so it was like window shopping for me!<\/li>\n<li>It helped me build my own database of thousands of boutiques and jewelry stockists, whom I soon plan to market my own line of <a href=\"http:\/\/maggieandmilly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nautical inspired jewelry<\/a> to. <em>[Editor&#8217;s Note: Mel&#8217;s bracelets are awesome!! Totally check them out when you get a sec.]<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Where Can You Find Work as a Virtual Assistant?<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38191\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-school-computer.jpg\" alt=\"old school computer\" width=\"500\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-school-computer.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-school-computer-300x193.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>There are quite a few places you can find virtual assistant jobs.<\/strong> In my experience, I\u2019ve had the most luck in the <em>Gigs<\/em> section of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.craigslist.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Craigslist<\/a>. If you go onto any city\u2019s Craigslist page, you\u2019ll find the Gigs section underneath the Jobs section.<\/p>\n<p>The downside to using Craigslist to find virtual assistant work is that you have to weed through a ton of MLM type gigs and other spammy stuff. But I usually peruse the Computers and Writing sub-sections once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and once late in the evening. The good jobs go quickly sometimes, so it\u2019s good to check throughout the day for new listings.<\/p>\n<p>One of my secret weapons is a website called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adhuntr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AdHuntr.com<\/a>. It allows you to search all Craigslist cities at once which can often lead to a gig you might not have found otherwise, unless you manually go to each city\u2019s Craigslist page to look for side hustles (in which case, you probably have too much time on your hands). Be sure if you search for something on here, to use the filters and sort ads by \u2018most recent\u2019, or you might find yourself applying for a gig from a year ago that was never deleted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are also several other places you can find work as a virtual assistant:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Fiverr<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr.com<\/a>): This site is just AWESOME. Not only is it totally fun to browse to see how amazingly creative some people can be (wanna <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/suuzy88\/make-a-video-of-my-hamster-who-writes-your-message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see someone\u2019s hampster create a custom message from cabbage?<\/a>), but if you have a special talent, interest or gimmick, you can promote yourself on here and let people come to you!<\/p>\n<p>I have not used it to get work, but I have hired several people through Fiverr to help with things that I didn\u2019t really want to do myself. Each gig is $5 but you can put \u201cadd-ons\u201d to generate more income for yourself. Take some time to browse other gigs in your area of interest to get ideas and see what people are charging for what. While you may not get rich, it can be a fun way to market small tasks that you enjoy doing.<\/p>\n<p><b>Elance<\/b> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elance.com<\/a>): This site has some great, quality side hustle gigs. While there is a lot of competition, it\u2019s free to register, so it might be worth it to give it a glance. The way it works is you find a job that you\u2019re interested in and you submit a proposal (a bid) and the client chooses the preferred candidate based on the bid and your skill set.<\/p>\n<p>The good thing is that you can see how many other proposals have been made on a particular job, but unless you have the paid premium plan, you can\u2019t see the actual bid amounts. Still, there are good virtual assistant jobs on there, and some of them have a long duration if you\u2019re looking for an ongoing project. You can browse some of the available jobs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/freelance-jobs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Hire My Mom <\/b>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hiremymom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HireMyMom.com<\/a>): I just learned about this site this week from a couple of fellow sailors who has found work through there. She said she was able to find a lot more legitimate work than on Craigslist, but the downside is that you have to pay for a membership ($29.95\/quarter, or $99\/year), and they only let you preview a few of the most recent jobs posted before becoming a member. However, I\u2019m offering it up as an option because it came recommended by people that I trust. The website does say that while they are geared towards helping moms, they do not restrict anyone from joining.<\/p>\n<p><b>ProBlogger<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/problogger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ProBlogger.com<\/a>): While this isn\u2019t a site that is specifically geared for virtual assistants, if you are a really good writer, you can find a plethora of good writing gigs on here. Like with Elance, there is a lot of competition, but it\u2019s also free to join and who knows &#8211; you may stumble upon a really interesting writing job, like writing for a celebrity entertainment site!<\/p>\n<p><b>Zirtual<\/b>: (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zirtual.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zirtual.com<\/a>): I have not used this site yet, but it\u2019s on my list this week to apply as a virtual assistant. What I like is that they have a pretty strict hiring process, which means if you do pass their tests, your competition isn\u2019t as high as if, say, you were on Elance or something. They also only hire US-based college graduates, so it also eliminates the overseas competition that often scores the jobs due to their competitive pricing.<\/p>\n<h2>In Summary\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully this will give you a little more insight into what being a virtual assistant entails. If you like the idea of having diversity in your side hustles, you\u2019re multi-talented and have good writing, speaking or administrative skills, you enjoy research, and perhaps even the occasional dirty novel &#8211; you might make a perfect virtual assistant!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38192\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dinghy-dock.jpg\" alt=\"dinghy dock\" width=\"500\" height=\"185\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dinghy-dock.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dinghy-dock-300x111.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<b><i>Melody<\/i><\/b><i> is a 30-something year old who blogs at <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/savingtosail.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Saving To Sail<\/i><\/a><i>, a tale of budgets, boats and dreams.
