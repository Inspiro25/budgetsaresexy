I&#8217;m not too sure why I&#8217;m still receiving it via printed mail when I thought you could only get it online nowadays (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/myaccount\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ssa.gov\/myaccount<\/a>) but in either case my inner nerd was doing back flips. It&#8217;s not every day you&#8217;re reminded of all your income here on Earth! Or, perhaps more accurately, all of your income that you&#8217;ve since SPENT!<\/p>\n<p>(BTW, I highlight &#8220;taxable&#8221; here as it&#8217;s not really how much you&#8217;ve earned your entire life (which would be *gross* income), but how much you&#8217;ve paid taxes on. Which could vary drastically depending on your sources of income\/set up\/etc. Still, it&#8217;s pretty damn interesting to know.)<\/p>\n<p>The last time I shared my total earnings was back in October of 2010, and by that point I had earned a tidy sum of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/10\/social-security-statement-life-time-earnings\/\" target=\"_blank\">$489,400<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s What My Total Earnings Look Like Now:<\/h2>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/social-security-earnings.jpg\" alt=\"social security earnings\" width=\"452\" height=\"401\" \/><\/center><strong>$829,783!<\/strong> Almost a million bones! That&#8217;s good right? Maybe? Maybe not?<\/p>\n<p>I added in a column there to the right to put things in better perspective&#8230; A million dollars <em>sounds<\/em> good, but does it change when you know it covers almost 20 years? Or that incomes may not be totally stable? Or that you&#8217;ve been living in an expensive part of the country where salaries are higher?<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll remember from Friday&#8217;s post that the important part is <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/what-would-happen-if-everyone-could-see-your-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">what&#8217;s <em>saved<\/em> vs. what&#8217;s <em>earned<\/em><\/a>. So that&#8217;s the real telling point to fully appreciate the achievement or not (though of course you could still give yourself a pat on the back for managing to get someone to pay you so much over the years regardless ;)). It may be sexy to earn a hot million or two, or even 10, but if your bank account&#8217;s showing $15 in it something else is certainly going on&#8230; like, you&#8217;re having a helluva time pretending to be a rock star!<\/p>\n<h2>Introducing the &#8220;Lifetime Wealth Ratio&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Since the Social Security Administration would have no idea how much you&#8217;re saving in comparison to this income, we&#8217;re left to come up with our own means of figuring how good we&#8217;re doing or not. So today I introduce to you the newly coined term &#8211; and future buzzword &#8211; the &#8220;Lifetime Wealth Ratio\u2122&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which is calculated like this:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Net Worth <strong>\u00f7<\/strong> Total Income Earned<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We&#8217;ll use my pal Jacob from iHeartBudgets.net as our first example. You may recall a post he shared on this site back in January where he divulged <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/01\/total-money-earned-spent-in-lifetime\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>his<\/em> total lifetime earnings<\/a> over the years too. He went all the way back into childhood which isn&#8217;t included in these S.S. Statements (you know, like gift money, lawn mowing hustles, inheritances, etc), but to this best calculations he figured out he had received a staggering $601,600 by the time he hit 27. Nothing to sneeze at by any means. His total net worth at that time? $55,000.<\/p>\n<p>This would give Jacob a <strong>Lifetime Wealth Ratio\u2122 of approximately 9%<\/strong>. Is that good? Bad? I dunno. I&#8217;m just the guy who makes up terms on the fly ;) (And then fake trademarks them) But, I can tell you it&#8217;s a helluva lot better than 0%! And if you&#8217;re really forcing me to come up with some sort of ranking system here, and, well, I know you are, then twist my arm no longer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I would suggest rankings as so:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>0%-10% &#8211; Meh<\/li>\n<li>10%-25% &#8211; Now we&#8217;re cooking!<\/li>\n<li>25-50% &#8211; You&#8217;re on fire, baby! Give me your number!<\/li>\n<li>50-100% &#8211; Marry me.<\/li>\n<li>100%-1,000% &#8211; How do I get into your will?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(You probably couldn&#8217;t tell, but it took me all but 15 seconds to make that up)<\/p>\n<p>What you&#8217;re shooting for, of course, is to have as high a ratio as possible. This would show how good you are at saving\/investing\/blowing up your money\/etc. And if you&#8217;re asking yourself how it&#8217;s possible to get a return of more than 100% with this calculation, well, Google &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/03\/penny-compounding-interest\/\" target=\"_blank\">compounding<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>J. Money&#8217;s L.W.R.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>(Look at that! It already has its own acronym!)<\/p>\n<p>To put this ratio to an even better test, let&#8217;s see where I personally stand myself&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>At the same age of 27 like my boy Jacob, I made a total of $232,495 according to this same S.S. department when added all up. Almost 2\/3rds of what Jacob had earned by that point &#8211; so far not good. Since this was right around the time I started tracking my net worth too, I can also tell you that it was exactly <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/2008-net-worth-goal-100000\/\" target=\"_blank\">$58,769.65<\/a> at that point. Almost exactly the same as Jacob &#8211; we&#8217;re twinsies!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Running the ratio, however, paints a different story.<\/strong> If you divide 58,769.65 by 232,495 you&#8217;re left with an LWR of 25%. More than double Jacob&#8217;s 10%, and barely into the zone where I ask for my own number! Ow ow!<\/p>\n<p>Now of course I jest in fun as Jacob&#8217;s a good friend of mine and has already acknowledged he was horrible with money years ago (if you&#8217;re a follower of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iheartbudgets.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">his blog<\/a> you&#8217;ll know that&#8217;s definitely no longer the case) but this should help put things in better perspective. And surely the ranking system could use a little fine tuning based on your own judgement.<\/p>\n<p>(Keep in mind everyone tallies <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/blogger-net-worths\/\" target=\"_blank\">their own net worths differently<\/a> too, and that there&#8217;s much more to it than just &#8220;saving money.&#8221; All the usual suspects to growing wealth will play a part here &#8211; investing returns, real estate, business ownerships, etc)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s run my numbers again, only this time with current totals.<\/strong> At the ripe age of 34 (another variable to consider) I&#8217;ve made $829,783 of taxable money as shown above, and have a net worth of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/net-worth-update-september-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\">$456,140.18<\/a> as of September (new net worth comes out this week).<\/p>\n<p>According to this trending new ratio everyone&#8217;s talking about, I&#8217;m now hovering at around <strong>55%<\/strong> &#8211; double the growth! And now apparently time to marry myself, haha&#8230; As you can see, I&#8217;ve been getting smarter with my money :) And *that* is something I can be proud about.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Here Are Other Interesting Facts S.S.

Which is almost exactly what I&#8217;d get if I started pulling money at 67!<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty crazy&#8230;. And probably why there&#8217;s so much fraud with this stuff, eh? If people could collect pretty much the same amount of money but 30-40 years earlier for gaming the system?<\/p>\n<p>It also looks like I&#8217;ve earned enough credits for my family to receive &#8220;survivor benefits&#8221; too should I pass away at any point.

My wallet would greatly welcome it in, but we all know the system&#8217;s flawed so we continue hustling away and stashing that money as if it were us against the world.

And if it pisses you off, well, time to do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, all that matters is that you&#8217;re on top of it and continuously working towards better financial lives. <em><strong>Now go grab your L.W.R.\u2122!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong> <\/span>Many astute readers have mentioned that it&#8217;s more accurate to calculate your ratio with &#8220;taxed medicare earnings&#8221; vs &#8220;taxed SS earnings&#8221; due to capping that goes on with SS earnings. My numbers are the same in both sections so it doesn&#8217;t make a difference, but if you&#8217;re a baller and make a lot more where you&#8217;d be capped, consider running w\/ the medicare earnings number instead.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>UPDATE #2:<\/strong><\/span> Our wealth ratio just got mentioned in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/11\/10\/your-money\/saving-ourselves-from-not-saving.html\" target=\"_blank\">NY Times article<\/a>!
