That&#8217;s July 15, 2020.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve dug up (and made up) these weird tax facts for a little game of <\/span><b>True or False.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But first, a quick story&#8230;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised as a city boy. So when I visited Montana for the first time in 2011, it was my first taste of the \u201ccountry.\u201d It was remote and beautiful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But something really surprised me about Montana &#8230; Every little town I visited had about 20 businesses in it, and of those 20 businesses, about five of them had signs hanging out the front that said \u201ctaxidermy.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d never heard that word before. Taxidermy \u2026 Sounds a lot like \u201ctax attorney,\u201d so I just assumed it was local slang for the tax office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought to myself, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhy do they have so many tax offices in Montana? People out here don\u2019t know how to file their own tax returns? What idiots!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it turns out, I am the idiot. Many years passed before I found out that taxidermy has nothing to do with taxes. My in-laws who live in Montana had a good laugh when they schooled me about what taxidermy is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">True story. And now whenever I see a stuffed animal, I think about taxes. I\u2019m a weirdo!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, onto the game &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all <\/span><b>True or False<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> questions\/statements. The answers are posted at the bottom. No peeking! Some of them are no brainers &#8212; I\u2019m sure all of you will pass with flying colors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Taxes: True or False?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States has the highest national income tax rate in the world. Second-highest is the Netherlands, and Finland is third-highest.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Kansas, untethered hot air balloon rides are exempt from sales tax because they are considered a legitimate form of air transportation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 7 U.S. states that levy no personal income tax. They are: Texas, Nevada, Florida, Washington, Alaska, South Dakota, and Wyoming.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re over the age of 100 and live in New Mexico, you don\u2019t have to pay state income tax. In fact, you don\u2019t even have to file with the state if you\u2019re that old.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s smart to have your employer withhold as much tax as possible during the year, so that when you file your return, you get a bigger refund check!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional strippers in Las Vegas are allowed to deduct the cost of breast implants or enhancements in their annual tax filings.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billionaire Mark Cuban once filed his tax return using paper forms instead of electronically. It took a small team of accountants 23 days to fill out and double-check all the paper forms. They eventually shipped four large filing boxes full of papers to the IRS. Cuban did this as a protest against paying such high taxes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you file your taxes early in the year, you have a higher chance of getting audited. If your one of the late tax filers, the IRS is so overwhelmed that it doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth to check everyone\u2019s return in detail, so you have less of a chance of getting audited.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every U.S. president starting from Richard Nixon (1969) onward has provided his tax returns to the public for review.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the UK, residents must pay a \u201ctelevision tax.\u201d This is an annual fee to watch TV, and it covers watching shows on your TV, laptops, and cellphones.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IRS is trying to be more progressive to keep up with various technology platforms. If it decides to audit someone in the millennial or Gen Z age bracket, it will begin by notifying the taxpayer person through his or her TikTok or Instagram account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The word \u201cTAX\u201d is an acronym for the original Latin phrase \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taeter Amor Xenium,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d which roughly translates to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201clove donation for the king.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a side hustle, you don\u2019t need to pay tax if you didn\u2019t earn more than $3,000 (or $6,000 for those married filing jointly) in income from that specific side hustle.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Texas, if you hire someone to paint holiday images on your windows at home, you do not owe tax on the painter\u2019s fee.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In New York, there is a \u201csliced bagel tax\u201d that costs you an additional 8 cents if your bagel is sliced or schmeared with cream cheese.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average tax refund check for 2018 was about $1,200. This is how the government came up with a \u201cfair amount\u201d to give people as a covid-19 stimulus payment in 2020. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you get audited or screw up on your tax return, your credit score will drop a few points. The people most at risk are ones with credit scores below 720.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chuck Norris didn\u2019t even file his taxes in 2019 \u2026\u00a0 but the IRS sent him a refund check anyway.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">******<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f447;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f447;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f447;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Answers<\/b><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FALSE!

I hope you got this one right!\u00a0 Overpaying through the year just to get a bigger return is like giving the government an interest-free loan! The most ideal tax planning is to have $0 owed or refunded at the end of the year. :)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TRUE! Well, kind of. A famous court case in 1994 was won by \u201cChesty Love,\u201d who enlarged her \u201cassets\u201d to a size 56FF, then even bigger to 56N! She claimed the surgeries were necessary to increase her professional income and therefore should be tax-deductible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FALSE.

And how many accountants does it take for their tax preparation!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FALSE. No matter when you file your return, your chances of being audited are the same. Accuracy is the most important thing when filing, not tax day timing!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FALSE. Donald Trump and Gerald Ford never provided their returns to the public.

Beware of scams! The Internal Revenue Service will <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text message or social media to request personal or financial information.

What a weird set of rules, right!?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TRUE. New York has different taxes for standard foods (a bagel) and a \u201cprepared meal\u201d (a sliced bagel). There\u2019s even a whole section in the NY tax code that explains what <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tax.ny.gov\/pubs_and_bulls\/tg_bulletins\/st\/sandwiches.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">classifies as a sandwich<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. &#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FALSE.
