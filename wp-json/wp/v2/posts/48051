That&#8217;s a third of the world&#8217;s population. They don&#8217;t have a score because there are no formal public records on them &#8212; no bank accounts, no credit histories and no social security numbers. And because they don&#8217;t have a score, they don&#8217;t have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their lives. They are not trusted.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What a great way to harness all this new technology, right? Using it for GOOD!<\/p>\n<h2>Good Risk vs Bad Risk Through Data Points<\/h2>\n<p>After watching that video, and then reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/lending-startups-look-at-borrowers-phone-usage-to-assess-creditworthiness-1448933308\" target=\"_blank\">a similar article<\/a> in the Wall Street Journal a little while back (where that graphic up top came from &#8211; crinkled up in my backpack waiting to be released one day!), I&#8217;ve compiled a handful of the more prominent findings here so you can see what they&#8217;ve uncovered.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind these are just a <em>few<\/em> of the literally THOUSANDS of data points they&#8217;re collecting &#8211; but they&#8217;re some of the best ones. See where you fall :)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Making more phone calls in the evenings than during the day &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\">good risk<\/span>.<\/strong> This indicates &#8220;price sensitivity&#8221; in that off-peak times are cheaper (keep in mind these are phone plans from international countries &#8211; not the U.S. where peak and off-peak seem to be going away).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sending more text messages than you&#8217;re receiving &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">bad risk<\/span>!<\/strong> Data shows those who get more texts than they give out tend to be more creditworthy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Being a gambler &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\">good risk<\/span>!?<\/strong> Apparently gamblers are more likely to repay their loans &#8211; go figure. (Do people gamble on their phones?)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Draining your battery faster &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">bad risk<\/span>.<\/strong> &#8216;Cuz you&#8217;re goofing off too much on it? Or not organized enough to keep it charged?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consistently communicating with a few close contacts &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\">good risk<\/span>.<\/strong> Gives you a 4% bump in worthiness :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Having a pretty regular travel pattern &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\">good risk<\/span>.<\/strong> Data shows a 6% increase in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time. And I&#8217;d imagine if one of those places is &#8220;work&#8221; it&#8217;s even higher ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Communicating with a variety of different people a day &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\">good risk<\/span>.<\/strong> People who interact with more than 58 different contacts tend to have stronger support networks &#8211; and thus be more likely to be good borrowers. Giving you a 9% boost in creditworthiness.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Not paying your cell phone bill &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">BAD BAD BAD<\/span>!!!!<\/strong> Haha&#8230; okay, so I made that one up ;) But for real &#8211; that&#8217;s gotta be in there somewhere, right? Or maybe everything&#8217;s pre-paid in those areas? (Actually, that&#8217;s probably right&#8230; if they have no credit history of course they don&#8217;t have bills, d&#8217;uh.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So maybe it&#8217;s hard to compare your own data points with those in other countries, but if someone ever <em>did<\/em> task me on researching such things here in the U.S., here&#8217;s a list I&#8217;d provide them totally free of charge.
