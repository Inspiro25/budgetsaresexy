Nor is it even an available option for some people. Intentionally slowing down your path to financial independence or stopping your retirement contributions requires three important things:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Time: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The younger you are, the more flexibility you have in your path to financial independence. Because Coast FI depends on compound interest, a longer time horizon is necessary.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Existing assets:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There has to be at least <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> amount of money or wealth already sitting in a retirement account that will grow over time. If you\u2019re gonna leave your campfire unattended, you better first stack some large logs on that sucker before walking away!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>You still gotta work!:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-talk-on-coast-fire-slackers-and-fomo\/\">Coast FIRE<\/a> lets you reap the benefits of financial freedom early, but it\u2019s important to remember that without actually hitting your full FI number, you can\u2019t stop work completely. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/things-i-learned-while-taking-a-sabbatical\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabbaticals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and breaks are OK, but \u201cwork\u201d is still a big part of the strategy.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone\u2019s blend of these three necessities is different. If you have more of one, you can afford to have less of the others. It\u2019s flexible. This is what makes Coast FIRE such a unique and personal life plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Having a 0% Savings Rate: How Does That Even Work?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s a little scary earning only as much as I spend each year. Living paycheck to paycheck is something I\u2019ve avoided my entire life!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what allows me to sleep at night is my confidence in compound interest. Sounds nerdy, and it definitely is! It\u2019s also a little risky, which I\u2019ll talk about, too. Simply put, the reason I don\u2019t have to keep contributing to my retirement accounts each year is because the growth of my existing assets does it for me.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at a Coast FI scenario using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/playingwithfire.co\/retirementcalculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this FIRE Calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the awesome dudes over at Playing With FIRE. &#x1f525;\u00a0 For this scenario, I\u2019ve used the following inputs:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age: 35<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual expense: $40k per year<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual Income: $40k per year\u00a0 (0% savings rate)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Number needed to hit FI: $1 million<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current net worth: $500k<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63379 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Coast_FIRE_1_png_Dg_-ShD5-e1602465330795.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on a 7% assumed growth rate, someone who is about halfway to their financial independence number can retire in 10 years without contributing anything new to their portfolio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people would call this model conservative, and others would say it\u2019s risky \u2026 let\u2019s take a look at what happens when things don\u2019t go quite according to plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Scenario: What If We Make Less Than We Spend? (Negative Savings Rate)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s now assume that we have trouble keeping steady employment and only earn $30,000 per year instead of $40,000. Unfortunately, this would mean pulling out $10,000 per year from our retirement savings to cover annual expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age: 35<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual expense: $40k per year<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual Income:\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$30k per year\u00a0 (-33% savings rate)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Number needed to hit FI: $1 million<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current net worth: $500k<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63380 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Coast_FIRE_2_png_ut4WvNim-e1602465318282.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"498\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looks like even if our savings rate goes into the negative every single year, it only adds two more years to the FIRE timeline. Even though we\u2019re withdrawing $10,000 from the portfolio each year, the compounding growth more than makes up for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retiring at 47 instead of 45 is not a huge deal, is it?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s now take a look at if\/when the stock market shits the bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Scenario: What If the Stock Market Crashes 30% Right Now?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say the stock market crashed 30% next month, which brings the portfolio value down to $350,000.

You can see why a long time horizon is necessary when pursuing Coast FI. If your situation changes or things start to go wrong, <\/span><b>time can correct things naturally<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as long as you have enough runway.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Work, Work, and More Work Is Part of Coast FI<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three years ago, I would have probably looked at the charts above and thought, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s no way I want to work for another 10 years, let alone 20!\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people feel the same when they first discover the FIRE movement. \u201cRetirement\u201d is the ultimate goal for those who don\u2019t want to depend on work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But my view toward work and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-things-i-didnt-expect-in-early-retirement\/\">early retirement<\/a> has changed over time (and is still changing). I envision work being a big part of my future, no matter how old or how much money I have. If I\u2019m going to be working anyway, I might as well discover or create positions that I really enjoy. This takes time to figure out, and possibly means starting from scratch in some industries. Coast FI gives me the flexibility to earn a low income for a while &#8212; maybe even many years &#8212; and still have a comfortable retirement nest egg later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fun thing to think about \u2026 In 20 years, I\u2019ll probably be working on a project or doing a job that isn\u2019t even invented yet. Just like ~20 years ago, blogging wasn\u2019t even really a career. The unknown used to scare me, but now it kinda excites me.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Opportunity Costs and Flexibility in Coast Financial Independence<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a bunch of opportunity costs that come with slowing down retirement savings and pursuing coast FIRE at a young age. I\u2019m experiencing some of these costs right now, and let me tell you &#8212; it doesn\u2019t feel great :(<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I\u2019m choosing to work part-time through some of my \u201chigher potential income\u201d work years in life. This isn\u2019t a huge deal, because I\u2019m still confident in the math that I don\u2019t need a massive income to achieve early retirement. But, it hurts thinking about lost opportunity, regardless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another opportunity cost is not being able to take full advantage of buying more stocks during market dips. Earlier this year when the stock market tanked, my friends were all socking away excess income into their 401(k)s, Roth IRAs and other investments. I didn&#8217;t get that opportunity because I had no excess earnings. We\u2019ll inevitably have crashes and dips in the future that I can\u2019t take advantage of, either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, Coast FI is flexible. If we wanted to get back onto a more traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/money-morals-decisions-fire\/\" >FIRE path<\/a>, that\u2019s always an option. I envision some big income years for me and my wife and some zero income years in our future. Time will tell how it all plays out!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Coast FI Takes Confidence!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the last comments I heard was <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019d love to quit my job and slow down, I just don\u2019t have the cajones to do it haha.\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After digging deeper, I found out this person is actually already past their FI number. They could stop working anytime, and have enough money to live the rest of their life. All the math and FIRE spreadsheets in the world couldn\u2019t convince this person to quit their job, <\/span><b>and that\u2019s totally OK!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has different levels of comfort and confidence. At the end of the day, we need to follow the FI journey that makes most sense for us individually. Whatever keeps you stress-free and sleeping well at night!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any fellow Coast FI peeps out there with 0% or negative savings rate?
