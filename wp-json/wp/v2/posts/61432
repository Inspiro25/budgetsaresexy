Please enjoy this guest article today from fellow reader, and blogger, BC from <a href=\"http:\/\/frugalwheels.com\/about-me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FrugalWheels.com<\/a>. I only hope my own sons will give me such a beautiful gift like this come Father&#8217;s Day 2035! ;) Congrats on the epiphany, BC!]<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p><strong>My gift to my old man whenever a special occasion comes along is almost always a book.<\/strong> I read a lot, and he does too, and every so often I come across a book that I check out from the library that I know he will be fascinated by. As a writer myself, I like that I am spending gift money on supporting authors.<\/p>\n<p>This year was no exception (other than the book arrived in the mail a day late \u2013 shame on me for not going to my usual local book store). But this year I gave him something better \u2013 the best gift I think a son can give his father.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I told him <em>he was right.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll explain. My dad, brother-in-law and nephew took a walk down to the pub on Father\u2019s Day. We\u2019d be having dinner with the rest of the family later, but this was a little side outing, just for the boys. My dad and I are very different people in a lot of ways, and we always struggled to connect. I\u2019m a professional writer and photographer; my dad was an assessment specialist for the state. My dad\u2019s primary concern was finding a job he could retire comfortably while supporting a family; I took the long weird road because I needed a job that matters and took advantage of my creativity and challenged me. We fought tooth and nail when I was young, my old man was pretty strict and harsh, and though as I grew older we buried all hatchets and get along now, we didn\u2019t really connect on much.<\/p>\n<p>Until I found FIRE. I started reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mr. Money Mustache<\/a> and later <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Budgets are Sexy<\/a> (Shout out, J$!), and realized that saving and investing could help me buy my freedom. I diligently read all I could and cut expenses. Though my pay as a writer started off low, it\u2019s gone up as my colleagues leave the business and my value has increased with my skill. The side gigs I get with photography make for a lucrative side hustle on top. As I developed my FIRE muscles, it started to really dawn on me. Oh $hit. My old man\u2019s been telling me this all along!<\/p>\n<p><strong>My dad is sort of an OG of FIRE.<\/strong> He figured out the mechanics of FIRE well before a movement came along. Though he chose to work until 55 to get full advantage of his pension, he could have left earlier if needed. He is definitely what FIRE folks would call <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/4-types-of-fire-retirement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>FatFIRE<\/em><\/a>. I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but let\u2019s just say he\u2019s pretty well set.<\/p>\n<p>My dad lights up now when I bring up finances, and my current ideas, progress, plans. He asks me a lot about these new-fangled things, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wealthfront<\/a> and cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s given us something to connect with, along with our love of reading history books and our love of bicycles.<\/p>\n<p>So as we talked money, I was cognizant of my nephew\u2019s presence. He\u2019d just graduated high school and I hoped he would pick up some of what we were talking about, thinking it more effective than talking to him directly. My dad talked about starting early. I mentioned that while I was happy with my progress, I wished I\u2019d started at my nephew\u2019s age. If I had, I might be FIRE&#8217;d today. I looked my dad straight in the eye and said, <em>&#8220;I should have listened to you \u2013 you were right about investing.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, but the look in his eyes told me everything. He was nearly speechless.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I really do owe a lot to the old man\u2019s frugality. We always lived below our means. It made it much easier to adopt a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/fire-lessons-from-the-jamaican-bobsled-team\/\" >FIRE<\/a> mindset. Coming from a frugal background, and having lived on tiny amounts of money and survived as a young adult, made living a FIRE lifestyle a breeze. It was just about being conscious of spending. It took thought, but it wasn\u2019t painful.<\/p>\n<p>Last year I got a pretty sizable raise, mostly because I would be doing two people\u2019s jobs. My parents had taken me out to lunch for my birthday, and upon learning this my dad had some advice. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re saving at least 15%.\u201d I laughed. <em>\u201cDad, I\u2019m saving 50%.\u201d<\/em> The look on his face was priceless.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But not quite the same as when I told him I wished I\u2019d listened to him earlier. I think for Father\u2019s Day, it\u2019s something that will mean more to him than some book I bought.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re curious, BTW, the book I bought is <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2IW9CIx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Surprise, Kill, Vanish<\/a> by Annie Jacobsen. It\u2019s basically about the entire CIA\u2019s history with more inside info from legendary CIA operatives than anything I have ever seen, and as a journalist myself I am jealous of her impressive sourcing. I heard her on the <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/5VoVIpIzj_c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joe Rogan podcast<\/a> and I had to check it out of the library.<\/p>\n<p>******<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>BC<\/strong> is the brains behind <a href=\"http:\/\/frugalwheels.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FrugalWheels.com<\/a>, a blog about biking and pursuing financial independence in a small (cold) town.
