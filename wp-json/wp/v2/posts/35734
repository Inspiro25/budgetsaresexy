So I got out as fast as I could to assess the damage and take pictures (my car: beat up and cracked bumper. Theirs: maybe a dent in the license plate?) and then quickly left a note under their wipers with my name and number so I could be all good Samaritan-like (as if I could get away with it anyways if I wanted to). Then I jumped back into the car and hightailed it right outta there &#8211; this time, going forward (!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Seriously &#8211; who hits a park car??<\/p>\n<p><strong>And now &#8211; two days later &#8211; I go through the day on pins and needles just waiting to still get that call&#8230;<\/strong> My mind is racing a mile a minute:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did they get my note??<\/li>\n<li>Are they going to tear me a new one?<\/li>\n<li>Did they notice any damage??? (I did barely, but it was still there)<\/li>\n<li>Are they going to blame me for the scratches on the sides of their car too? (They had white brush marks on them which clearly weren&#8217;t mine. A) because my car is red, and B) because it was physically impossible for me to have hit them on the side when all I did was go directly backwards)<\/li>\n<li>Are they gathering info and estimates and gonna call me with some alarmingly high bill??<\/li>\n<li>Or was my note so genuine and good Samaritan-like, that they just thought &#8220;Aww, no problem. Stuff happens!&#8221; and that will be that?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m all alone with these thoughts over here, and it&#8217;s driving me mad. The only solace I have is telling myself that it&#8217;s a good thing I never fixed up my car after <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/got-in-a-car-accident-yesterday\/\">the last accident<\/a>! Which is unfortunately then followed by &#8211; &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/car-considered-total-loss-by-insurance\/\">Why didn&#8217;t you just sell it when you could??<\/a>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>I mean, what&#8217;s the worst that can happen, though?<\/strong> So they get mad and curse me out &#8211; I can handle that. (And wouldn&#8217;t they have already done that anyways by now??).\u00a0 I pay my $200 deductible and my insurance premiums go up a little\u00a0 &#8211; that sucks, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world. There&#8217;s no way I can be on the hook for hundreds (or thousands?) when insurance is involved, right? Like they can&#8217;t force me to settle outside of insurance or anything if I don&#8217;t want to, right? That would be bonkers. Oh man, what if they were in the mob and I get caught up in some crazy scheme because the dent reveals hidden drugs or bodies or something equally as scary!! OH. MY. GOOOOOOOOD!!!<\/p>\n<p>Man I&#8217;m drama queen, haha&#8230; But seriously &#8211; the unknown is the worst. I once got a voice mail from an old friend who left the following message: &#8220;hey.. man&#8230;. not doing well&#8230; call me back..&#8221; All woozy like. I call back, get nothing. Call again &#8211; nothing. Again, and again and again over the span of 24 hours &#8211; nothing, nothing nothing. You know when people say &#8220;Oh don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m sure all will be fine&#8221;? Well, it&#8217;s times like these that make me doubt them now. My friend wasn&#8217;t okay &#8211; I found him later at the hospital.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>In this case I&#8217;m 99% sure I WILL be okay, of course, but it still sucks not knowing the other side to the story.<\/strong> Very much like when people heavy in debt refuse to look at the actual numbers and their stress and madness eats them up the whole time imagining the worst possible cases they&#8217;re getting themselves in. And they could very well be accurate, but it&#8217;s amazing how much BETTER it feels just bracing and looking the numbers square in the eye. Isn&#8217;t this the part where that saying comes in? &#8220;You have to first admit you have a problem&#8221; before you can start being healed? Or getting your finances on track, as is this case?<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, the point is, I want these people to call me ASAP. In fact, I&#8217;d rather them call me with bad news than have me wait weeks\/months\/years thinking everything is fine and forgotten and then BAM. Remember me?? You hit my car last year &#8211; pay up! Cuz really the only thing worse than not knowing right <em>now<\/em> is getting surprised <em>later<\/em> with cockamaimy news. It&#8217;s no fun I tell you, no fun&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>(And another reason to return money that doesn&#8217;t belong to you &#8211; for all you new commenters on my old post about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/accidental-bank-money-not-yours-to-keep\/\">banks accidentally giving you some<\/a>. You don&#8217;t want a surprise later once it&#8217;s all spent! And believe me, they WILL get their money back.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think I&#8217;ll stop there and go for a walk now before I hyperventilate&#8230;<\/strong> On the plus side, I found two more shiny coins yesterday on the streets (both nickels!!) and for a split second I floated back up to heaven ;) That&#8217;s a 25% bump <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/09\/finding-free-money-vs-earning-it\/\">in findings over the past 2 months<\/a> mind you &#8211; pretty lucky!<\/p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;ll play the Powerball tonight.
