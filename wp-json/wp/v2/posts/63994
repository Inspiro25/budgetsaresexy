Also, thanks to my awesome wife for letting me fly off to the other side of the country to party on Wall St. She is the best!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, here\u2019s how it all went down\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Getting Invited to Ring the NYSE Bell<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bell ringing ceremonies happen twice each trading day, when the market opens and closes. The NYSE <\/span><b>only invites listed companies<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ring the bell (and sometimes non profits), so it\u2019s a pretty big deal to be invited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also kind of a last minute thing\u2026 I\u2019m sure some of the larger ceremonies (like when a company goes IPO) are planned well in advance. But for us they only gave ~48 hours notice! It was last Wednesday when we got the invite call, so I packed my bags that night and flew to New York the next morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I mentioned before, <\/span><b>LifeGoal Investments<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was the company that invited me. They launched some ETF\u2019s in September on the NYSE, and their flagship product is very unique, called the <\/span><b>Home Down Payment Investment ETF [Ticker: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/HOM\/\"><b>HOM<\/b><\/a><b>].<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Since this ETF is the first of its kind <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(you can learn <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifegoalinvestments.com\/hom\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what\u2019s inside it here<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the exchange wanted to host a celebration for LifeGoal and have a bell ringing ceremony.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a bit random how I got invited\u2026 When I picture events like this, I imagine invites going out to select bigwigs, important clients, and other fancy suits. Truth be told, I was really nervous because I don\u2019t really fit in with those crowds. I barely own formal clothes! <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Don\u2019t tell anyone &#x1f92b; but I had to dust closet mold off of an old suit I stole from my brother 10 years ago \u2014 it\u2019s the only respectable thing in my closet that I could wear there! Gross, I know.)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, the celebration with LifeGoal turned out to be very different than what I expected\u2026 The founders mostly invited their <\/span><b>close friends and family<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, because that\u2019s who they wanted to celebrate with. Here\u2019s another pic below, you\u2019ll see founders\/brothers Taylor and Brett are standing in the very front and their proud Mum is right in the middle! Most of the others were old childhood friends from the small town they grew up in. A very fun and wholesome group! I\u2019m proud to call them friends &#x1f60a;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64332\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Life-Goal-CB-Photo-211203-PRESS-CC-10-scaled-e1639112881386.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, Brett brought his wife and baby\u2026 who has the bluest eyes I\u2019ve ever seen!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64330\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Life-Goal-CB-Photo-211203-PRESS-CC-15-scaled-e1639112899221.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think NYSE allows you to invite as many people as you want to the ceremony, but only ~15 or so can fit up on the balcony when the bell rings. The rest hang down on the trading floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Checking in, the lobby, the ceremony\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NYSE is located on Wall Street in the lower part of Manhattan. Outside the building there\u2019s a large roped off area with a red carpet leading to the main entrance. The party starts about 1 hour before the bell rings, so we got there about 3pm EST.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might recognize a couple faces of our friends in the PF community\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64331 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IMG_4110-scaled-e1639112890935.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the far left is Joel from the <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.howtomoney.com\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Money<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> podcast.

These badges are modeled after those worn by traders to display their NYSE member numbers. They\u2019re made out of metal which makes it a cool little souvenir we all get to keep :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64333 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IMG_4112-scaled-e1639112871990.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone had funny nicknames assigned. Mine was just \u201cThe Blogger\u201d, which was nice because people then understood why I was asking all the dumb questions &#x1f602;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I took photos of the lobby area! Just imagine a sleek and modern museum, with long hallways displaying historic archives and art. The NYSE opened in 1792 (and moved into its current building in 1903) so there\u2019s a ton of artifacts and fun history to learn about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the lobby, everyone was ushered into a large convention room to have some snacks and drinks. There were massive video displays on all the walls, each displaying the LifeGoal Investments logo with welcome and congratulations messages. A few representatives from NYSE were there to give speeches, present awards to Brett and Taylor Sohns, and tell us more history about the bell ceremonies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At about 3.50pm, everyone was then taken up to the trading floor\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Trading Floor, Bell Ringing and Fun Facts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trading floor looks exactly like what you\u2019d think it does \u2013 just like in the movies. Flashing lights, computer monitors everywhere, and people bustling about. Except there was no yelling like I hoped to see. Maybe because it was a Friday afternoon and everyone was winding down after a long day \u2013 sadly, the market went down about -1% that day &#x1f62d;. Here\u2019s a pano pic of the trading floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64334 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/IMG_4151-e1639112856554.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"261\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know\u2026 Prior to a bell, the NYSE actually used a Chinese gong to sound the opening and closing of the markets!? It was in 1903 when they switched to bells. There are actually 4 loud bells, covering each area of the trading floor. They all ring synchronously, controlled by a master switch\/bell on the balcony podium.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s more cool <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nyse.com\/bell\/history\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">history on the NYSE Bell<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 2-3 minutes before 4pm, a NYSE representative took us upstairs to the bell balcony. He gave us some last-minute instructions of which buttons to press, when to hammer the gavel, and the bell timing. My job was to just clap continuously for 60 seconds, and then cheer loudly when the market closed. Here\u2019s a 1 min <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EvT1VaRlh38\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64327 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EvT1VaRlh38\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EvT1VaRlh38<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After ringing the bell, people can hang and take photos on the balcony for a bit. But before leaving, right behind the balcony there\u2019s a hallway of stairs with white walls. Everyone stops here and has a chance to sign their name on the wall with a sharpie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64329\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Life-Goal-CB-Photo-211203-PRESS-CC-17-scaled-e1639112908168.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a quick look through the names but didn\u2019t recognize any famous ones. Nevertheless, it\u2019s fun to sign my name next to others who were celebrating IPOs or big company milestones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Trip Costs and Travel<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I am the luckiest guy in the world. Believe it or not, this entire trip cost me about $108.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flights were booked with AMEX reward points from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/travel-hacking-101\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">travel hacking with credit cards<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I ate for free at the airport Centurion lounges in DFW and LGA on both travel days. (I have access to the lounges as part of my Amex Platinum card.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first hotel night was an annual IHG rewards night which was going to expire at the end of the year anyway. The other hotel night was comped by the LifeGoal team, and so was the dinner and lunch on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $108 I did spend was for Uber trips, catching the subway, and a few random beers and pizza slices while we were out. Gotta have pizza while in NY!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, it was a crazy 72 hours I\u2019ll never forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you again and CONGRATULATIONS to the LifeGoal Investments team. Never in a million years would I imagine I\u2019d be a part of such a rare event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If any of y\u2019all get an opportunity to ring the bell one day, take it! Even if it costs money and it\u2019s last minute, it\u2019s worth it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy Friday and have a great weekend!<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy Friday, y\u2019all!!!
