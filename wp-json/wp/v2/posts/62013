My relationship with a steady income started at the age of 16 when I began waitressing. Everything I made went right out of the door on clothing, entertainment, and alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>You see I grew up in a two-parent, Christian, middle\/upper-class household where all of my material needs were supplied. Any money I earned was just for play.<\/p>\n<p>I did not learn the value of savings, but I did recognize that money correlated to freedom. However, my desire for freedom was short-sighted as I only wanted to get out of the house (and my skin) in the moment.<\/p>\n<h2>When Emotional Stability is Lacking, so is Money Sense<\/h2>\n<p>My relationship with my Dad was not healthy growing up. He was doing the best he could and I now understand that, but he was a stressed-out salesman with a short fuse. He wanted to (and did) provide for his family, but his career became an obsession. Furthermore, my Dad grew up in a critical environment and these things have a funny way of being passed down. He didn&#8217;t have the patience for kids. I learned to get attention by getting into trouble.<\/p>\n<p>My Mom was loving, kind, and nurturing. Regardless I was scarred by some hauntingly, temper-filled, memorable encounters with my Dad. As a result, I grew up believing some very incorrect things about myself.<\/p>\n<p>I found solace in alcohol in my teen years. When I took that first drink, I became everything I thought I wasn&#8217;t &#8211; funny, pretty, and smart. I found the courage to be the fun-loving extroverted gal that I am. However, that courage was smoke and mirrors.<\/p>\n<p>When a person is exerting all of their energy to cope with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.recoveringwomenwealth.com\/2018\/10\/18\/brain-health-part-2-stressed-brains\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chronic stress<\/a> and extremely low self-worth, money, at best, is an escape mechanism, and, at worst, used for mere survival.<\/p>\n<h2>The Start of Debt as a Lifestyle<\/h2>\n<p>Interestingly enough, my parents have always been wise stewards with their money. They saved for retirement and their children&#8217;s college education, pay cash for cars, and have no debt. Due to my rebellion against them, I learned none of this growing up.<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 18 I bought my first new car with financing and you can see that dip on the graph. I ended up <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/selling-our-car-online-are-people-even-buying-cars-right-now\/\">selling that car<\/a> at the age of 21, moving to Colorado, and getting a small sum of money. For the first time, I was slightly above the line. This hippie used that money to fund a backpacking trip to Europe. #NoRegrets on that.<\/p>\n<p>However, with an unreconciled past and little money sense, I quickly got back into debt and kept drinking\/drugging. Getting sober wasn&#8217;t even on my radar back then.<\/p>\n<p>Due to my ability to be high functioning, I went undetected as having a problem for many years. I wanted to appear normal so I maintained an outward appearance that prettily covered up the pain and suffering I was experiencing.<\/p>\n<h2>Bigger Debt<\/h2>\n<p>I got married at the age of 25. We bought a house, financed two cars, and used credit cards inappropriately. You can see the graph going way below the line in my mid-twenties. My marriage ended at the age of 27 and I was left with a mountain of debt. I filed for bankruptcy but was able to keep the house. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t really learn any money lessons at this stage.<\/p>\n<p>My drinking\/drugging waxed and waned and though I wasn&#8217;t focusing on getting sober, I even managed to have some healthy years. I kept paying the minimum payments on my debt and vowed to never go back into bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>In my 30&#8217;s I made my way to graduate school to become a high school mathematics teacher. While my parents paid for my undergraduate education, I funded graduate school 100% with student loans.<\/p>\n<h2>The Beginning of the End<\/h2>\n<p>I excelled in graduate school but in the process, a man from my past walked back into my life and I unfortunately got back into drugs. While I graduated with a 4.0 and a promising career in education, I walked away from it to pursue a life that allowed me to use these drugs. It still pains me to write that last sentence.<\/p>\n<p>I became the wine sommelier at a country club where I had worked for many years. In case you are wondering, that\u2019s not really the best job for an alcoholic\/drug addict. ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Sure, I kept up the facade but I was basically getting paid to drink. Additionally, I was addicted to <a href=\"https:\/\/moneywithapurpose.com\/overcoming-addiction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crystal meth<\/a> so, with the combo of uppers and downers, I walked that lethal tight rope until I eventually spiraled down.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.recoveringwomenwealth.com\/testimony-about-me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bottom<\/a> occurred at the age of 36. It&#8217;s no surprise that I was also in the biggest amount of debt of my life. I was bankrupt emotionally, physically, spiritually, and financially.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It can be a beautiful thing when a person comes to the end of their rope and there is nothing left to grasp at. After some disturbing visions and the stark reality that I was going insane, I finally surrendered, admitted defeat, and asked for help.<\/p>\n<p>I left the destructive relationship, quit drugs, returned to faith, and committed to a life of sobriety.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Sober &amp; Digging to Get Back to Broke<\/h2>\n<p>The early years of getting sober were really about reconciling with my past. Reconciliation includes looking at my part in things, making amends, forgiving others, receiving forgiveness, and healing relationships.<\/p>\n<p>However, in remembrance of my vow to not file bankruptcy again, I made some financial changes. I was able to reduce my expenses, stop adding to the debt, and stay afloat financially.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About four years into my sobriety I wanted to gain complete financial peace. I had peace in every other area of my life, but not yet with my money.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A woman from my church helped me to get on a budget. Then I started listening to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.daveramsey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dave Ramsey.<\/a> He would tell me, over the airways, that I didn&#8217;t have to have to keep my debt around forever. I could actually get intense and pay it off, and for some reason, I believed him.<\/p>\n<p>In the process, I did lose my house to foreclosure. The neighborhood where I lived was not bouncing back after the crash of the housing market. It was no longer a safe place for a single woman to live. I stuck it out until some major things broke, at which time I moved into a ministry home. All the while I worked with a realtor to short sale my house. In the end, the bank declined my short sale. Feeling defeated and facing foreclosure, I hired an attorney and it ended fairly well.<\/p>\n<p>Once I bounced back from that, I humbled myself and asked my folks if I could move in with them. They were gracious and said yes. At the age of 43, I moved back in with my parents for further reconciliation of our relationship and to focus on paying off the rest of my debt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All in all, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.recoveringwomenwealth.com\/debt-freedom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I paid off $46,763<\/a> in about 3 &amp; 1\/2 years total on a $40k salary. Near the end of my debt pay off my salary jumped and it&#8217;s still jumpin&#8217; today!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I shared my testimony on the Dave Ramsey Show on June 4, 2018 which <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1mglnojy9RA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you can see here<\/a> ;-)<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1mglnojy9RA?start=1123\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>From Addiction to Investing<\/h2>\n<p>When I was in debt pay-off mode as I was getting sober, some things shifted in my relationship with money. Firstly, I knew I never again wanted to pay for things of the past. Secondly, I realized I value relationships over spending money. This attitude has carried over into my investing life. If I value something, I\u2019ll spend money on it, but I\u2019ve found that spending time with the people I love doesn\u2019t have to center around spending money.<\/p>\n<p>As I was approaching that bright light of broke, I started listening to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.choosefi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChooseFI<\/a> podcast per a recommendation from a colleague. I read J.L. Collins&#8217;, <a href=\"https:\/\/jlcollinsnh.com\/2016\/06\/18\/the-simple-path-to-wealth-is-now-published\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Simple Path to Wealth<\/a>, and realized I could do this investing thing.<\/p>\n<p>I started out 2018, maxing out all of the tax-advantaged accounts I could get my hands on and haven&#8217;t stopped yet. Today, I get to walk alongside women in recovery helping them with the same things I&#8217;ve gained freedom from. I&#8217;m spreading financial literacy to some of the women who need it most.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Current Breakdown of My Finances:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Employer-Sponsored Simple IRA: $33,054.63<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.recoveringwomenwealth.com\/2018\/09\/17\/the-magic-of-health-savings-accounts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Health Savings Account<\/a>: $5,233.65<\/li>\n<li>Roth IRA: $6,089.26<\/li>\n<li>Traditional IRA: $6,935.92<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.recoveringwomenwealth.com\/2019\/09\/23\/post-tax-investing-with-m1-finance-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M1 Finance<\/a>: $385.57 (just getting ramped up on post-tax investing)<\/li>\n<li>Between checking &amp; savings: $18,642.51<\/li>\n<li>Total net worth: $<strong>70,341.54<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Closing Thoughts About the Impacts of Getting Sober<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that it all goes together. Since getting sober I\u2019ve wanted complete healing and transformation, but I&#8217;m learning it&#8217;s a lifelong process. Some wounds go deep.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m grateful for that time with my parents. I was able to finish paying off my debt and get a fresh launching pad. More importantly, I faced and slayed some childhood demons. As a result, my family bond is stronger. People can change if they are willing and able to be honest with themselves and others.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve learned that valleys are where the real growth occurs. It&#8217;s the hard stuff that has chiseled me into the woman I am today, and I getting sober has made me proud.<\/p>\n<p>******<br \/>\n<em><strong>Deanna blogs at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.recoveringwomenwealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RecoveringWomenWealth.com<\/a> and writes specifically to women.
