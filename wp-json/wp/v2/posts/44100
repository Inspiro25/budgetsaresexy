All while producing two beautiful boys and putting up with the antics of yours truly. She&#8217;s a gem, alright! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And hey! We&#8217;ll get to use her <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/04\/coffee-money-hustling-music\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$200+ graduation gown<\/a> for two whole hours before having to return it back to the shop &#8211; what a privilege! NOT. (Remember when &#8220;NOT&#8221; was popular btw?? I so miss that&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>Anywho, a new chapter opens up when you graduate from school, so I thought I&#8217;d share some parting wisdom to any of those undergrads reading this right now, or those soon not far off. And you should listen to me since I&#8217;m old and wise and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/welcome-my-fellow-pfers_12\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rockin&#8217; a mohawk<\/a> still at 35 ;) That alone should give me some street cred, yes? Maybe? I should have left it in the 80&#8217;s? Damn you&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Things to keep in mind as you graduate college:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the best time to take risks and follow dreams!!<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s also the best time to start investing &#8211; even just $10\/mo<\/li>\n<li>As well as the best time to CHALLENGE THE NORM<\/li>\n<li>And to lock in a simple lifestyle before society tries creeping it up<\/li>\n<li>And, most importantly, the best time to hustle your ass off so you don&#8217;t need to hustle until you&#8217;re old and gray or even 35 like me. Set the plan into motion NOW and get to live The Dream similarly to how one <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2011\/04\/06\/meet-mr-money-mustache\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mr. Money Mustache<\/a> did when he figured out the system. It&#8217;s much easier to adapt now then when you&#8217;re set in your ways, and there&#8217;s no rule that you have to work 40+ years like everyone else if you don&#8217;t want to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So pretty much this is the best time to just kill it while you have all the time in the world without much responsibility.<\/strong> Sure you&#8217;ll have pressure from those around you, but remember this &#8211; this is YOUR life and the goal is to live it on your own terms. Take some risks and see where it goes!<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I only hit 2-3 of those tip above after graduating. Mainly the taking risks and following my dreams route as I packed my bags and moved up to NYC to be a rock star partier and best graphic designer \/ art director ever! Only to get a reality check and have to make due with minimum wage and drinking on a budget ;) But still &#8211; I did it! I moved my ass up there and even <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/wanna-know-the-cheapest-way-to-travel-the-world\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">traveled the world<\/a> while working for the airlines. Something I can&#8217;t even consider now with a family and responsibilities in tow. So believe me &#8211; you want to have fun and go after your goals in full thrust now while you have the freedom. You&#8217;ll settle into your own later once you&#8217;ve figured it all out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The only thing I wish I would have paid attention to more <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/04\/what-id-tell-myself-about-money-back-in-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was my money and investing<\/a>. <\/strong>And particularly my work ethic. I did enough to get by, but I never really put myself in overdrive to really get the ball moving. I guess we all figure it out at some time (hopefully!), but it would have been nice <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/03\/penny-compounding-interest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting that $$ compounding<\/a> a few extra years earlier to really jack it up. Time is SO on your side when you&#8217;re young! You have to take advantage!!<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, congrats to all the graduates out there, and even more to the ones reading this blog right now :) It already shows you&#8217;ve got money on your mind, and this will forever help you out. You only need to learn it once and you&#8217;re set!<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s how this week went in my finances&#8230;<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\">Digit<\/a> saved me an extra <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$48.31<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/acorns-app-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acorns<\/a> invested me an extra <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$8.07<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ebates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ebates<\/a> sent my wife a check for <strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">$50.35<\/span><\/strong>!
