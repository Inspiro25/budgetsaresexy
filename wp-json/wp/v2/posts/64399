It\u2019s human nature to try to actively solve problems when we foresee shit hitting the fan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, history tells us that <\/span><b>the more human intervention your portfolio has, the more money you lose.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even if your adjustments are made with brilliant research and good intentions, they have a higher chance of negatively impacting your overall performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Other Thoughts About Stock Market Crashes\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In no particular order, here are some other notes and stories on this subject:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It\u2019s a good time to \u201cplay dead\u201d:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fidelity did a 10-year study of all its client accounts from 2003 to 2013. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you know which investors had the BEST account performance?<\/span><\/i> <b>Dead people!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Or people who had \u201cforgotten\u201d about old accounts.)

I\u2019m not talking about consuming panic news and social media. I\u2019m talking about studying the good ol\u2019 fashion fundamentals of building wealth. Read some of the top personal finance books that have stood the test of time. Or, check out some notable new books:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now I\u2019m reading <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/34agdh1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trillions by Robin Wigglesworth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

This book is written by 30 of my fellow FIRE bloggers and influencers. Different topics, different perspectives, and I even wrote one of the chapters!

But the truth is that everyone is in the same boat as you \u2013 myself included! One of the reasons I publish my net worth each month is to show you that I practice what I preach. In a market crash, I will lose considerable value in my assets (I\u2019ve lost more than $50k in the last 3 weeks alone). It might get worse, but I won\u2019t be selling any investments. You are NOT alone in a crash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>This has happened before, and it will happen again:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The stock market has experienced dozens of crashes and corrections over the decades, and it&#8217;s bounced back from every one of them. Since I\u2019m only 37 years old, I will probably experience 5-10 more MAJOR crashes in my lifetime. Maybe even more. But, I will also experience an equal amount of MAJOR bull runs and heroic comebacks. As long as I stay invested, the growth will always be bigger than the crashes. I just need to ride everything out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You can\u2019t outsmart a crash:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sometimes people think they can use market crashes to their advantage. But, this rarely works out because <\/span><b>nobody knows where the \u201cbottom\u201d of a crash actually is.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In fact, even if you DID know when the exact market bottom was during every major crash over the past 40 years, you would still come out with less money investing at the bottom vs. investing consistently regardless of highs and lows. Read this easy-to-digest comparison from my buddy Jeremy at Personal Finance Club: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceclub.com\/how-to-perfectly-time-the-market\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to time the market perfectly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You won\u2019t lose any real money, **unless you sell**:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even if stock prices plummet, you haven&#8217;t technically lost anything as long as you continue to hold your investments. You still own the same number of shares in the same companies, so keep holding them until value rises again (it will).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The \u201cbright side\u201d of sequence of returns risk:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A multi-year market crash is one of the biggest risks to people who have just retired. BUT, a multi-year crash can actually be<\/span><b> the best thing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for people just starting their investment journey! <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2017\/05\/17\/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-14-sequence-of-return-risk\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Big ERN puts it<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSequence of return risk is a symmetric risk: you can benefit from it or it can seriously harm your investment returns. It impacts both retirees and savers and the risk is exactly a zero-sum game.\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cPlease sir, can I have some more?\u201d <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To add to the point above, a market crash means you can buy stocks at a discount. Downturns are actually a good thing for anyone who is consistently saving and investing (which is the majority of the population!). When you see stocks slipping, you should think like Oliver Twist\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPlease sir, can I have some more?\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Learning from past mistakes:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Talk to anyone who lived through the 2020 Covid crash, the 2008 Financial crisis, or the 2001 Dotcom crash\u2026 You\u2019ll hear 2 main regrets from any investor during those times. Those regrets are 1) I wish I didn\u2019t panic-sell when the market was crashing. And 2) I wish I bought MORE stock during the crash. Learn from other people\u2019s mistakes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It\u2019s a great time to side hustle!:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Speaking of buying more, market crashes are a great time to earn excess money \u2014&gt; and put that money into investments. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OOGU94eL07E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side hustles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also distract you and keep you busy so you don\u2019t freak out about what the market is doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Guided Meditation Video, by JL Collins: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years back, legendary JL Collins made the following 10-minute video for anyone freaking out about the stock market dropping.
