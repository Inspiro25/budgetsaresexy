As someone who loves answering questions myself, I thought I&#8217;d snatch &#8217;em up and share them with you too. It&#8217;s always good to stop and make sure we&#8217;re on the right path, right?<\/p>\n<p>So, here is an interview with myself and my money ;) not to be confused with an interview <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/interview-me-on-me_12\/\" target=\"_blank\">I did on myself<\/a> at the very beginning of this blog 5 years ago when I thought I was pretty clever&#8230; I hope you&#8217;ll answer these questions next.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Is My Money Being Spent on the Things That Truly Matter to Me?<\/strong> Yes, mostly. Not things that are all that sexy (electricity, shelter, insurance, etc), but definitely on *needs*. With some little splurges here and there too like Starbucks or eating out to keep me sane. (Oh, and also on some investing\/saving too, but not as much as I&#8217;d like these days&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>What Was The Last Item I Regretted Purchasing?<\/strong> Hmm&#8230; the last item I REALLY regretted buying &#8211; which I couldn&#8217;t return (an important distinction) &#8211; was our house. I&#8217;ve made some dumb purchases here and there in between these 6 years, but that was the only one to this day that&#8217;s really holding back our finances. While things have certainly gotten better (ie. we&#8217;re not *as* underwater <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/02\/its-official-our-house-is-upside-down\/\" target=\"_blank\">as we used to be<\/a>), and my blog and career came out of it all (woo!), it&#8217;s the only thing that really pisses me off in my past. But I&#8217;ve slowly been accepting it and moving on &#8211; even though I know it sounds like I&#8217;m still bitter here, haha&#8230;<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>What\u2019s Holding Me Back From Taking Action?<\/strong> Adam talks about &#8220;fear of financial freedom&#8221; in his answer, so I guess that&#8217;s what&#8217;s meant by &#8220;taking action&#8221; here. And for that the only thing standing in my way really is having *more* time to work on stuff. Along with being better about what <em>exactly<\/em> I&#8217;m spending my time on. Hustling 60 hours\/week on something important\/bigger for the future is better than hustling 60 hours on maintenance &#8211; which I can get caught up into since it&#8217;s so much easier. So I personally need to be working on *smarter* use of my time over here.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>How Would My Budget Look Without Debt Payments?<\/strong> Oh man, if I can figure out a way to kill those 2 mortgages of ours we&#8217;d be H-E-A-V-E-N. That would be $2,200 every dang month to be invested or saved somewhere (our payments are really $1,900&#8217;ish, but we pay a few hundred more ea. month to speed up the process), I can&#8217;t even imagine&#8230; And really, you can&#8217;t separate that debt out with consumer debt since at the end of the day it&#8217;s still all DEBT!!! Which is decidedly NOT sexy.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Am I Listening to the Right People?<\/strong> I hope so :) I listen to all of you in the comments, as well as other great personal finance bloggers! I get a lot more out of that than reading &#8220;real&#8221; websites or books. It&#8217;s all about the <em>personal<\/em> experience for me.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>How Can I Improve My Financial Literacy?<\/strong> Continue reading and learning! Best thing I&#8217;ve done since starting this blog&#8230; I was horrible at it before (I&#8217;d literally read a book once every 8 years &#8211; no joke), and now I&#8217;m constantly reading article after article. Still not so good on the book front, but hey &#8211; baby steps ;)<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>What\u2019s My True Hourly Wage?<\/strong> Probably $15\/hour, haha&#8230; I dunno, maybe higher, but lately it seems pretty low &#8216;cuz I&#8217;m working more than I used to but making less ;) Luckily I love being a blogger though.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>What Can I Do to Increase My Income?<\/strong> Find more\/better side hustles. And take more risks to do so instead of keeping in the comfy territory no matter how nice that feels!<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>If I Died Today, Would My Family Be OK?<\/strong> Yes. Well, at least financially :) <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/time-to-get-a-life-insurance-movement\/\" target=\"_blank\">My life insurance of $350k<\/a> would kick in giving my family enough to pay for funeral stuff and pay down our mortgages if they want\/etc. And on top of that we&#8217;d still have our $450kish in net worth too which def. helps&#8230; Now our income would go 100% away (unless my wife figures out how to keep my blog around for a cple year!!\u00a0 Haha&#8230; which is on my list to teach her ;)), but the money would last for quite a while until it ran out. This is a very important question to ask yourself though. The last thing you want to do is leave your family in financial ruin as well as emotionally a mess! Get some life insurance ASAP if you have a family and don&#8217;t have any (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/time-to-get-a-life-insurance-movement\/\" target=\"_blank\">we both have term life insurance<\/a> which we found to be the best route)<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Am I Setting a Good Example For My Children?<\/strong> I really hope so! Having a blog on money helps for future reference, haha, but hopefully I can instill smart financial cents in our little guy (soon to be plural) through real-life action too. I can&#8217;t WAIT for him to be able to understand and talk about money! But first, we need him to TALK in general, haha&#8230;<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Where Do I Want to Be One Year From Now Financially?<\/strong> EXCELLENT question. Shorter goals are much easier to think about, and achieve, than longer ones generally. So, for us, I&#8217;d like to be over the $500k <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">Net Worth<\/a> mark 12 months from now, as well as a 10% bump in business income AND a 2nd salary finally from the wifey ;) As it&#8217;s been a solid 4+ years since we&#8217;ve had one while she was getting her doctorate&#8230; I forget what it&#8217;s like to be a dual income household!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Some really good questions up there to ask yourself. Especially #3, #9, and #11. You&#8217;ve got to have goals and know what&#8217;s holding you back, and you&#8217;ve also gotta protect your family in the unlikeliness of us passing on. Having literally attended a funeral over the weekend (and with everyone else dying lately, God bless you Paul Walker and Mandela!), none of us have immunity. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/12\/it-can-happen-to-any-of-us\/\" target=\"_blank\">Neither from financial disaster either<\/a>, as I shared yesterday.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How would YOU answer these questions? Any get you to pause and re-consider stuff?<\/strong><\/em> Answer them as soon as you&#8217;re done reading this, even if just to yourself. Should only take a few minutes until the next shiny object on the internet catches your attention ;) Or, your boss.<\/p>\n<p>Have a great day over there, everyone.
