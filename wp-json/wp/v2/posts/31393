Haha&#8230; If so, consider me your alarm clock buzzing around your ears and the only way you can turn me off is to come up with a new one to tackle this month ;)<\/p>\n<p><em>What&#8217;s changed in the past 4 weeks that you&#8217;d rather work on instead?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Personally, I haven&#8217;t gone a DAY without thinking of mine &#8211; mainly because it&#8217;s a change that NEEDS to happen more than just a want.<\/strong> Every week that goes by I see more and more stuff that needs to be simplified in my life, and slowly but surely I work on it piece by piece. (If you missed my post earlier on what I&#8217;m resolving to do in 2013, it&#8217;s to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/01\/new-years-resolution-2013-keep-it-simple\/\">focus more and keep things simple<\/a> &#8211; something I constantly need to work on&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>In fact, this post today came about from a huge surge of energy I got yesterday while opening up my 1,001 accounts! (Because I&#8217;m anonymous here, I pretty much have double EVERYTHING. Gmails, twitters, facebooks, you name it). So outside of me nudging y&#8217;all to remember to keep on track with this year&#8217;s goals, it&#8217;s also a selfish way for me to pat myself on the back for all that I&#8217;ve been accomplishing lately too, haha&#8230; Is that bad? ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s everything I&#8217;ve simplified so far:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I unsubscribed myself from all future Woot.com and other &#8220;Daily deal&#8221; emails<\/strong> &#8211; something that I&#8217;ll probably miss a little, just cuz it&#8217;s exciting to see what the deals are each day!, but in reality doesn&#8217;t add much value outside of that&#8230; Especially since I rarely buy anything from them anyways &#8211; at least anything I *need*.<\/li>\n<li><strong>I cancelled my personal Facebook page!<\/strong> ACK! Something I would have never EVER ever believed I&#8217;d have done 4-5 years ago. But times are a changing and just knowing my stuff as out there not being touched at all just started bothering me&#8230; Perhaps I&#8217;m getting more conservative as the years go by? (Also, did you know you can download all your photos from your account at any time? OR that you can then re-activate your account anytime too, just by logging in again later? I found that to make my decision much less scary when I finally hit that button in the end :))<\/li>\n<li><strong>I cancelled all magazine subscriptions I no longer read anymore<\/strong>. Which so far has come to 5 out of my total 11 I signed up to last year in a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/02\/addicted-to-magazine-subscriptions\/\">fit of obsession<\/a> ;) GQ, Fortune, and Veranda being amongst them. (I of course can never git rid of any of my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/recommend\/\">money mags<\/a>!)<\/li>\n<li><strong> I now answer all robo\/spam phone calls and specifically ask them to take me off their crappy lists.<\/strong> Instead of ignoring them over and over and over again, day in and day out which gets super irritating. One time pains for future gains!<\/li>\n<li><strong>I also answer all calls from my friends &amp; family now right away.<\/strong> Rather than waiting for a more convenient time to call them back in batches, which not only stresses me out since then I need more pockets of time to get them all done, but also leads me to forget more and\/or upset my peeps. As evidence of them now all responding with &#8220;Wow, you answered your phone!&#8221; ;) This also cuts down on the chances of hour long phone calls of catching up from over the months and years gone by&#8230; Or is that just something <em>I<\/em> dread?<\/li>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;ve put to bed any ideas of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/trade-website-for-real-estate\/\">owning more real estate<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/07\/how-to-open-thrift-store-with-tips\/\">consignment shops<\/a>.<\/strong> Which all leads to more &#8220;stuff&#8221; both physically AND mentally &#8211; even though financially they may or may not be better. I figure I never have a shortage of business ideas though, and there are a ton of different ways to invest your money as well. Possibly IN those new business ideas :)<\/li>\n<li type=\"_moz\"><strong>I&#8217;m offloading more and more of my clothes and random stuff around the house.<\/strong> Straight to The Salvation Army! It def. gets harder as you dwindle down over time, but I find I&#8217;m getting a tad better knowing that eventually I&#8217;ll only be left with the stuff I really truly love, which is pretty cool.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s everything I&#8217;ve worked on so far here, but it&#8217;s definitely not the last of it. I&#8217;m actively trying to do at least *ONE* small thing a day to get closer and closer to my goals&#8230; which really doesn&#8217;t have an end in sight, considering I left it wide open and vague to begin with! Haha&#8230; But on the other hand you can apply the concepts of &#8220;simplicity&#8221; and &#8220;focusness&#8221; to all aspects of your life &#8211; both financial and otherwise. And since I&#8217;m doing well with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/01\/new-years-resolution-2013-keep-it-simple\/\">the money parts<\/a> so far, it leaves me a lot of time to concentrate on the other &#8211; less exciting &#8211; areas of life ;)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Your turn to divulge! What have you (or haven&#8217;t you) been working on this year?<\/strong><\/em> Are you over your resolutions already, or are you nice and motivated still? If you haven&#8217;t thought about them in a while, do yourself a favor and replace &#8217;em with one new SIMPLER one today. Think of something you can really sink your teeth into and start working on right away! Something that excites you.<\/p>\n<p>This J. Money alarm clock is now turning off, so no more hitting snooze! ;)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong> I have now since cancelled my personal LinkedIn account and my personal Twitter account too&#8230; I&#8217;m getting lighter and lighter as the days go by, baby!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>[Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/haquintero\/\">Hugo Quintero<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember those??
