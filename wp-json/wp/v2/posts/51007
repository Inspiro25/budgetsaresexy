Here&#8217;s a little ditty on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pickypinchers.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mrs. Picky Pincher<\/a>&#8216;s love\/hate relationship with extreme couponing &#8211; something I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all thought about and\/or tried at some point ourselves! Let us know where you stand in the comments at the end :)]<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***********<\/p>\n<p><strong>I am not an extreme person. <\/strong>If given the choice between couch-lounging and base jumping, I will always pick my couch and sweatpants. Always.<\/p>\n<p>Predictability is a good trait to have, especially since I\u2019m dumping $225,000 of debt to the curb. And that includes credit cards, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pickypinchers.com\/student-loan-payoff-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\">student loans<\/a>, and even my mortgage. It\u2019s a lot to pay off and I\u2019ll try just about anything to eliminate it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In my quest to vanquish debt, I became a Savings Extremist.<\/strong> A year ago you would have caught me lounging on my couch as usual, manically clipping coupons and reading sale papers.<\/p>\n<p>Somewhere along my journey I became a crazy extreme couponer.\u00a0 For the six months I couponed, every Sunday was like Christmas morning when the newspapers (plural) arrived with the next batch of coupons. I had accordion folders filled to the brim, bursting with meticulously-labeled <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redplum.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Plums<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smartsource.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Source<\/a> coupons.<\/p>\n<p>I was\u00a0<em>this close<\/em>\u00a0to digging through the trash looking for coupons.<\/p>\n<h2>I was a little obsessive, but there were many upsides to extreme couponing.<\/h2>\n<p><strong>It was fun<\/strong>: There was nothing like the thrill of scoring $60-worth of swag at CVS for a paltry $10! I salivated over my three-foot-long receipts with a $5 total. Math has never been my strong suit, but I really enjoyed planning my couponing hauls. I stuck it to The Man by swiping products off shelves for rock bottom prices. I did my fair share of happy dances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There were good deals<\/strong>: I once scored a giant jug of Dr. Bronner\u2019s soap for $10 &#8211; which normally retailed at $20. I also bought $4 bottles of shampoo for a mere $1 apiece, and cold medicine for $1 per pack. I won\u2019t lie: you can find great deals with couponing!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I was always stocked up<\/strong>: Toothpaste? Check. Shampoo? Check. Hair gel? What brand do you want? I have 13. Extreme couponing is most effective when you stack coupons and buy multiple products at a time. Which meant I always had a treasure trove of household products and snacks at my disposal. It\u2019s been over a year since I quit couponing and I <em>still<\/em> haven\u2019t finished our stock of shampoo! It&#8217;s a great way to stock up on lots of items at once, and on the cheap.<\/p>\n<p>Although extreme couponing was a blast in many ways, I decided it ultimately wasn\u2019t for me. After saving over $300 by couponing, I called it quits.<\/p>\n<h2>Here\u2019s why I stopped extreme couponing.<\/h2>\n<p>It was a time-sucker.<\/p>\n<p>I spent an average of 15 hours a week couponing, and this was below the average (hardcore couponers spend upwards of 30 hours a week couponing!).<\/p>\n<p>I spent hours scouring sales papers, company websites, and handfuls of coupon books to match deals. I carefully planned my weekly trips to CVS and Walgreens with precision math. I knew exactly how much money I needed to spend for each trip, taxes included. I memorized the rewards points balance on both mine and Mr. Picky Pincher\u2019s store rewards cards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It took for-freakin\u2019-ever.<\/strong> Extreme couponing required an insane amount of planning that didn\u2019t fit into my schedule. I already worked a full-time job and barely had the time to plan the shopping trips, let alone complete the act of the actual shopping.<\/p>\n<p>I grew weary of extreme couponing after realizing it was my main hobby. I had video games to play and cats to pet, after all. I didn\u2019t want to spend half of my waking free time at a drug store!<\/p>\n<h2>Bye-bye money<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve always been a big fan of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pickypinchers.com\/what-we-pay-good-money-for\/\" target=\"_blank\">spending more money on quality things<\/a>. Whether that means buying sheets with a higher thread count, dropping more cheddar for good shoes, or buying in bulk. Couponing seemed like a natural way to use today\u2019s money to pay for tomorrow\u2019s bills &#8211; I dug it.<\/p>\n<p>As it turns out, extreme couponing still costs money, even if you do it with care. I justified my addiction with the old adage, \u201cYou gotta spend money to make money!\u201d and felt that, even though a CVS run cost $15, I was saving money in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Picky Pincher mercifully pulled my head out of the clouds. I was spending at least $15 a week between my couponing runs to Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart which added up to an extra $60 a month that we <em>didn\u2019t plan on spending<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I was spending more money on things we didn\u2019t really need\u2014which meant we put less money towards our debts.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At first that didn\u2019t sound so bad. \u201cSo what?\u201d I thought, \u201cThose costs will even themselves out in our budget.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. Our expenses increased. The sixteen bottles of $1 nail polish weren\u2019t saving us money\u2014they were costing us money.<\/p>\n<p>I lost my sense of practicality with extreme couponing. I bought hair gel, brushes, and crates of toothpaste that I didn\u2019t need at all. I would buy items just because they were on sale. I was overspending every week and it added up quickly.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding cheaper alternatives<\/h2>\n<p>Even after realizing how resource-intensive couponing was, I still couldn\u2019t kick my obsession.<\/p>\n<p>I stocked up on makeup remover wipes, fancy lotions, packages of pizza-flavored chips, and bronzer &#8211; which is ridiculous when you\u2019re vampire-white like me.<\/p>\n<p>I cluttered our extra cabinets with this extraneous stuff, confident I\u2019d use it all eventually.<\/p>\n<p>But after watching the bills stack up, I wondered if there was a cheaper way to enjoy the same items? After snooping around, I found several cheap and easy alternatives for things I already bought.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are just a few items I make now to save money:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of buying Neutrogena makeup wipes, I started using coconut oil to remove my waterproof mascara. Works like a charm!<\/li>\n<li>We fry our own chips instead of buying 3 for $1 Pringles at Walgreens. I\u2019ve also started opting for healthier whole food snacks, like almonds.<\/li>\n<li>I bought a safety razor handle and a pack of safety razors. It cost the same as a new pack of razor cartridges with a coupon. The upside is the safety razors cost pennies compared to disposable cartridges and I get a better shave.<\/li>\n<li>I love sugar scrub, so I started making it myself out of coconut oil, sugar, spices, and essential oils.<\/li>\n<li>I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pickypinchers.com\/how-to-make-diy-dry-shampoo\/\" target=\"_blank\">homemade dry shampoo<\/a> instead of store bought. I add essential oils to corn starch and run a small amount through any greasy parts of my head.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The result with these are <em>actual<\/em>\u00a0savings.<\/strong> By opting for a DIY approach, I got the same (or even better) result as store bought products. Couponing encouraged consumption of products that I found out I could make cheaply at home.<\/p>\n<p>I know people hear \u201cDIY\u201d and think \u201cOh man, it\u2019s so much faster just to buy it at the store,\u201d but this didn\u2019t happen in our case. After factoring in the time it took to hunt for coupons, match deals, and do the actual shopping, DIY always came out ahead.<\/p>\n<p>This was the nail in the coffin. I canceled my multiple newspaper subscriptions, recycled my coupon books, and gave up extreme couponing.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Bottom Line<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I still <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pickypinchers.com\/how-to-coupon-the-right-way\/\" target=\"_blank\">love to use coupons<\/a>, I just use them more judiciously now. By focusing on non-consumption and producing a few household items myself, I\u2019m able to save more money than I ever saved with extreme couponing. I still think it&#8217;s great if you don&#8217;t get carried away, but in the end it just didn&#8217;t work out for me. This experience has made me realize that there isn\u2019t a right way to save money, though. It\u2019s all about doing what\u2019s right for you!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How about you?
