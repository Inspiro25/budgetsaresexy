He cost about $1,500 in parts to make and is the cornerstone of my homebrew operation. I\u2019ve been brewing my own beer, cider, and hard seltzer for about 7 years now, and while I still like sampling local craft beer and buying the odd case from the store, most of what I drink these days is brewed by yours truly. :)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People often ask me, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIs brewing your own beer cheap? Like cheaper than buying at the store?\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In some aspects, yes! In other ways, definitely not. The answer really depends on your brewing methods, quality of ingredients, and the amount your household drinks!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today I\u2019m going to run through some beer math with y&#8217;all, and we\u2019ll compare the cost of homebrewing vs. buying craft beer at the store or at a bar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and for those curious\u2026 Currently at my house on tap we\u2019ve got a Session IPA, Bavarian Hefeweizen, a pomegranate hard seltzer, and a non-alcoholic cucumber\/lime sparkly water. Something for everyone!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Much Does It Cost to Brew Your Own Beer?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s first simplify by removing <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gas<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electricity<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the equation, as well as the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effort<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it takes to home brew. (I\u2019ll address that later below)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Brewing Equipment: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginners will want to start out with a basic brewing kit, which costs about $200. Something like this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2M2qVwN\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">starter homebrewing kit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Northern Brewer is perfect, and includes all the equipment needed. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Yes, there are some cheaper kits available out there, but trust me &#8211; if you truly want to brew *good* beer over many years, you need good quality tools! It\u2019s worth a bit extra $ upfront.)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Recipe Kit:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Then we need a beer recipe and ingredients. A recipe kit ranges from about $35 all the way up to $80 for really fancy recipes. In my experience, the quality of your beer depends more on the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brewing method<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rather than the fanciness of the ingredients. For this cost exercise I\u2019m gonna use $45 as the average good craft beer recipe cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Beer Quantity:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Each batch makes about 5 gallons of beer, which equals about 50 beers of 12oz each. Technically it\u2019s 53 beers, but I like rounding down to 50 because some liquid is lost due to siphoning, spilling, and taste testing! <\/span><b>&#x1f609;<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Total Home Brew Cost Per Beer<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First batch: $245, yielding 50 beers = $4.90 per beer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second batch: $45 for recipe only = $0.90 per beer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>All beers going forward = ~90 cents per beer.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, this is an <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average cost<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are certainly ways you can reduce this, both the start-up cost and ongoing beer recipe costs. For equipment, try Craigslist! Many people sell or give away their old equipment because they don\u2019t use it, or they\u2019ve upgraded to bigger and better brewing techniques. When I built my kegerator, I gave away my bottling bucket, bottle filler and caps cause I didn\u2019t need them anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For recipe kits, I buy all mine online from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.austinhomebrew.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin Homebrew<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They have ongoing specials and seasonal promotions year round. For Halloween last year I got a Pumpkin Ale kit for about $32, and each summer I brew cheap hefeweizens for about $36 per kit. If you\u2019re a master homebrewer, you can also buy single ingredients in bulk, like malted barley, hops, yeast, malt extract etc. and store it at your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63674 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/beer_recipe_suppllies_JPG_g8nK2z87-scaled-e1610905667257.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several recipe kits &#8211; I buy in bulk!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Homebrew vs. Store Bought vs. Brew Pubs Cost<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer at the store also has a huge range in price. You can grab 30 cans of Bud Light for like $15 these days (but, can we really call that beer? &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;). And some of my favorite high end beers like Delirium Tremens costs $20 for a 4-pack!\u00a0 BTW\u2026 When did the 4-pack become the new 6-pack!?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, if we\u2019re going with the average, I\u2019d say most <\/span><b>beer at the store is about $10 per 6-pack, or $1.67 per beer.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you frequent bars and brew pubs, the cost of a beer ranges from $4 at happy hours, all the way up to $10 per pint at fancy breweries. Live sporting events are the worst&#8230; The most expensive beer I\u2019ve ever bought was $18.75 for a 24oz Golden Road Wolf Pup at Dodgers Stadium a few years back. Ouch!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For regular drinkers, let\u2019s assume we\u2019re buying <\/span><b>restaurant and pub beers at an average of $6 per beer.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\u2019s look at the comparisons\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63670 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Homebrew_beer_cost_comparison_jpeg_UxZVTeIQ-e1610905706303.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"175\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>So, Is Brewing Beer at Home Worth It (Financially)?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purely looking at the finances, yes, the cost per beer is the cheapest for home brew. But, to cover the equipment and start-up costs, you\u2019ve gotta pass the <\/span><b>breakeven point of ~260 beers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re like me (I drink about 1-2 beers per day on average), your initial homebrew kit costs will be covered in less than 6 months! Or, if you and your friends pool money together you can hit this breakeven quite quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just for giggles, in the comparison above I calculated 1 beer per day x 7 years I\u2019ve been homebrewing. Looks like after 2,557 beers brewed and consumed I\u2019ve saved over $1,700 compared to store bought! That\u2019s enough to cover the cost of Jeffrey!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in reality, building and housing a bar at your home is very expensive. I\u2019ve upgraded equipment many times, experimented a lot, wasted entire batches due to spoiling, and given away thousands of pours to neighbors, friends and family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brewing for me is a hobby, not a money saver. I like the math and science behind it all. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63672 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/inside_the_keggerator_jpg_YUldu5g--e1610905687647.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A peek inside Jeffrey. The clear hoses are beer lines and blue hoses are for Co2 :)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Much Time Does It Take to Brew Your Own Beer?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the biggest surprise to a new home brewer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d estimate <\/span><b>1 batch takes about 8-9 man hours <\/b><b><i>minimum<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, spread across a 5 week waiting period. Most of the time is spent on the first brew day, like maybe 4-5 hours brewing the wort and starting fermentation. The rest of the time is spent transferring (1 hour), bottling (1 hour), and cleaning\/sanitizing everything along the way (2-3 hours).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were to add your <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personal time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into the equation, homebrewing is definitely not worth the cost. 8 hours at <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only $5 per hour<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adds an extra $40 cost to each batch of beer. That brings the cost to <\/span><b>$1.70 per beer and is just as expensive as the store bought beers.\u00a0 <\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My guess is most of you value your spare time more than $5 per hour!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some ways to cut down time, like brewing 2 batches at once (as long as you have the equipment to handle this) or by having a few friends help out on brew day. But, you gotta be careful about sacrificing *quality*. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2-big-investing-mistakes-that-actually-made-me-smarter\/\">Mistakes are made<\/a> when you take shortcuts!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>No matter how cheap home brewing beer is compared with buying at the store, TIME is the main reason people don\u2019t even try it.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Kegging, Kegerators &amp; Buying Kegs at the Local Brewery<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few reasons I upgraded to kegging:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s pretty badass to have a kegerator in your backyard.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No more cleaning and recycling bottles! Bottling is the crappiest part of the home brewing process, and kegs save me a few hours per batch.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better temperature control, carbonation control, and shelf life for the beer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can make other fizzy drinks, or buy kegs direct from breweries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did I mention it\u2019s badass?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes I get lazy and will buy kegs of craft beer from Bevmo. But, what I\u2019ve found is that buying a keg of beer is pretty much just as expensive as buying it in cans or bottles. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 5 Gallon keg of Firestone Walker 805 costs about $75. Divided by 50 beers works out to $1.50 per beer. That\u2019s about the same as what I can buy this same beer for at the store in a 12 pack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh and as far as energy costs &#8212; the kegerator mini fridge sucks about $50-60 in electricity each year. It\u2019s not a huge cost but definitely adds up over the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63673 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Bottling_process_JPG_UtgDw5UD-scaled-e1610905678536.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pic from back in my bottling days<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Cost to Make Hard Cider, Seltzer Water and \u201cJoelClaw\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the kegerator, it\u2019s pretty easy to whip up other types of drinks. Here are some costs&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Seltzer water takes about 10 minutes to make. It\u2019s free. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s just tap water and CO2 pressure. We can flavor with fruits, oils, or even pour juice in the kegs. Because I have 4 tap handles, it\u2019s handy to always have one non-alcoholic beverage for kids and people who don\u2019t drink alcohol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Hard Cider <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takes almost the same time as beer to brew, and <\/span><b>costs $15-20 per 5 gallon batch (about $0.40 per cider).<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cider is just fermented juice, then you add sugar and champagne yeast. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Hard Seltzer <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is becoming really popular at my house! I\u2019m experimenting with my own WhiteClaw replica recipe at the moment (my friends call it JoelClaw). I buy corn sugar, yeast, nutrients and flavors all in bulk to drive the cost down. <\/span><b>It\u2019s about $15 per batch &#8211; so about $0.30 per drink.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Not bad considering WhiteClaw and other hard seltzers cost just as much as beer these days!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some other questions I hear a lot\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is Brewing Your Own Beer Hard?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not really. If you can follow a recipe, you can brew your own beer. There are instructions included in every kit, and YouTube has millions of videos to help. It\u2019s confusing at first learning new words like wort chiller, carboy, and krausen &#8212; but that\u2019s what Google search is for!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physically, you\u2019ll need to be able to lift a bucket with 5 gallons of liquid (~40lbs), and for safety you should be old enough to work a stove.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is Brewing Beer Legal? And How Much Can You Brew?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, it\u2019s legal to make homemade beer for personal consumption. But<\/span><b> you can\u2019t sell any alcoholic beverages without a license.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a limit to how much you can brew at home. It\u2019s 100 Gallons per person per year, or 200 gallons per household per year. I know that seems like a lot, but I am proud to say that I actually hit this limit in 2013! Me and a buddy brewed more than 40 x 5 gallon batches that year &#8212; and we gave away most of the beer. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funny story actually\u2026 One of my neighbors offered us $10,000 as start-up capital to launch our own microbrewery. We turned it down, and this is one of my life\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/top-5-regrets-of-the-dying-and-adjusting-life-accordingly\/\">biggest regrets<\/a>. More on that another time!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is Homebrewing Dangerous?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brewing beer is like manning an open flamed grill. It\u2019s dangerous if you are careless, forgetful, or have little kids running around. Other than that, it\u2019s a harmless hobby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whelp, we\u2019ve drifted way off the original topic, but I\u2019m happy to answer any other questions if you\u2019re interested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Bottom line: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brewing your own beer is cheaper than buying at the store.
