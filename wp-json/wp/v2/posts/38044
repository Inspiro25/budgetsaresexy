You&#8217;re our lucky winner today!

Which got crazier and crazier of the years too :) We haven&#8217;t done one in quite some time, so this email I got was even more accepted with open arms.<\/p>\n<h2>The Initiative<\/h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, DoSomething.org has partnered with H&amp;R Block Dollars and Sense program &#8220;to create a mobile experience challenging young people to choose between situations penny pinchers often find themselves in to save money.&#8221; Which &#8220;will be followed by action steps to get teens to start being smart about their financial future, and tips for how to start saving for their future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a teen reading this right now, <em><strong>text START to 38383<\/strong><\/em> and start playing\/learning right away :) And if you&#8217;re an adult reading this, do the same but not &#8217;till you&#8217;re done with this article ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some of the reasons this is important btw:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>68 percent of high school and college students say they have never had a meaningful conversation with their parents about personal finance.<\/li>\n<li>More than 3 in 4 students feel that they don\u2019t know enough about personal finances.<\/li>\n<li>According to DoSomething.org\u2019s National Survey: The top concern for people who volunteer is paying for college. For all young people, it&#8217;s &#8220;having enough money.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Young people want to know about money but don\u2019t really know where to turn.\u00a0 They\u2019re tired of surveys and calculators that instill more fear and insecurity about an issue that they\u2019re already anxious about.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fair enough&#8230; We as a society can use as much help as we can get to better help our youth &#8211; no doubt about it. And especially where finances are involved. (I was just having lunch with a 50+ y\/o friend, and we were talking about how easy it is for pretty much anyone to take out debt compared to &#8220;back in the day&#8221; before the rampant use of credit cards and loans\/etc. Back when mortgage rates were over 17%! Yikes!)<\/p>\n<h2>The Would You Rather Game<\/h2>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve done my part getting the word out, I thought we&#8217;d partake in the fun and play along ourselves :) I texted &#8220;Start&#8221; to 38383, and here was the first question I was prompted to answer:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Q1: What would you rather do to save $$? A) Share your spring break hotel room w\/ ur entire extended family OR B) not go on spring break.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>A!<\/strong> Haha&#8230; all day, every day! Save money AND get to have fun :) Though, I reckon it would be pretty harsh coming back late at night half\/full drunk and never hearing the end of it from your family. And\/or waking up the next morning in the condition you&#8217;d be in&#8230; But they&#8217;d know what you were doing on Spring Break anyways, so it&#8217;s not *that* bad. Plus it&#8217;s not like you wouldn&#8217;t be sharing it anyways to save money, you&#8217;re just swapping out friends for family. How bad can it get? ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>I then continued to play along:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Q2: To make $$, would you rather A) Be Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s personal ass&#8217;t for a month, OR B) Wash the Dallas Cowboys laundry for a month?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>A!!!!<\/strong> ZOMG!!! Laundry aside, what self-respecting Redskins fan would EVER come close to doing something nice for the Cowboys?? That&#8217;s fan club suicide right there! ;) Plus, you know you&#8217;d be out wining and dining w\/ Miss Lohan too outside of cleaning up any messes&#8230; You at least have a shot of having fun vs being stuck in a smelly ol&#8217; basement cleaning jerseys all day long, ick&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t even do that for my Redskins! (Okay, actually I would, but that wasn&#8217;t the question ;))<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Q3: Would you rather save $$ by A) not having a washing machine for a month OR B) not having a dishwasher for a month?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>B, hands down.<\/strong> Ain&#8217;t nobody got time to hand wash baby clothes 3x a week! I can live with some dirty dishes and\/or using the same few day in and day out&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38046\" alt=\"aint nobody got time fo dat\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/aint-nobody-got-time-fo-dat.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/aint-nobody-got-time-fo-dat.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/aint-nobody-got-time-fo-dat-300x203.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Q4: Would you rather A) walk a mile barefoot to school every day OR B) have your mom drop you off with a big kiss every morning?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Haha&#8230; B.<\/strong> I&#8217;ve got no shame in showing some mama love ;) Unless there were Fitbits back in the day when I was in school&#8230; In that case I&#8217;d walk and rack up all them steps every day! (BTW, would this be the same as walking to &#8220;work&#8221; for us old guys and getting dropped off\/kissed by our wives? ;))<\/p>\n<p>After the initial 4 questions, you can then continue on to play more by sharing the game with a friend (clever, clever marketers!), or go straight to the money tips by texting in &#8220;TIPS.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>I texted in TIPS:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Going on spring break? Create a travel budget so you come back from vacation with happiness and a tan, rather than regret.<\/li>\n<li>Establish a savings habit and stick to it. Once you get paid, pay off your bills first before buying anything else.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid buying on impulse. Wait at least a week before making pricey purchases to ensure you really want the item.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nice and solid advice, okay&#8230; I feel like it would be better to put hard numbers\/percentages in there (like, maybe 10% or 20% for #2?) but regardless it&#8217;s quality information. Let&#8217;s just hope it sinks in!<\/p>\n<h2>Your Turn Now :)<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an adult and still reading this, harken back to the good ol&#8217; days and answer these 4 &#8220;would your rathers&#8221; above yourself :) Or just text in and play and get a bunch of other questions too &#8211; I think maybe they&#8217;re randomized?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then come back here and share your answers below!<\/strong> I&#8217;m really curious about your answer to the Dallas Cowboys one ;) Feel free to drop your own advice to our wee lads reading as well. Anyone who&#8217;s trying to manage their money under 21 are smart as hell in my book.
