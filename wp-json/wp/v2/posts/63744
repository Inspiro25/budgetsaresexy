But I\u2019d like to track the numbers on this particular project publicly so you can observe how it grows from the beginning. I promise to write more about the ins and outs of private syndications another time, but for now I just wanted to explain why there\u2019s a big chunk of money missing from our brokerage account, and how the new line item \u201cR\/E partnership\u201d for $50k popped up below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>March 1, 2021, Net Worth: $564,730<\/b><b> (+$14,171)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the asset summary for everything we\u2019re tracking.
