Top o\u2019 the morning to ya! (Not sure why I just wrote that &#8211; I definitely don\u2019t speak this way in real life.)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s guest post is from Gary at <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.financialfives.com\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Fives<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sharing about his side hustle of renting out moving boxes! What I love about Gary\u2019s story is that he\u2019s truly proud of the value he\u2019s providing to the world. Starting any business is difficult, but it\u2019s 100X easier if you have a passion for the industry you\u2019re in! (Not to mention, if you love what you do, you can continue your fun work even after reaching &#x1f525;&#x1f525;&#x1f525;]<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How I Started a Side Hustle That Connected My Passion to My Skills<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve probably had enough about \u201chustle culture\u201d and videos or podcasts about \u201cmaximum productivity\u201d and waking up at 4 am to meditate. Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not the point of this post! I myself have garnered an aversion to those who advocate acting like a machine and accounting for every waking minute on your calendar.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t know about you, but I like to enjoy life and live in the present, and if that takes me longer to reach FI, I\u2019m 100% fine with that. Tomorrow is never guaranteed, so if we don\u2019t take the time to bask in the sun or bike through a trail, what\u2019s the point of all of that hustle?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that being said, I think having a side hustle, as humble or lucrative as it might be, is a strategic way to reach FI. As you\u2019ve surely heard, you can only cut your expenses so much, but your earning potential is virtually unlimited. Since I was a little late to the party being a millennial who graduated college the same year Instagram was born, <\/span><b>my side hustle came out of a need to feel like I am doing something to fix one of the biggest problems in my view: trash.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I read that the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/onearth\/united-states-most-wasteful-country-world\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United States is the #1 trash-producing country in the world!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#x1f92e; That\u2019s something I\u2019m certainly not proud to be #1 in.\u00a0 I wish I had the mind of an engineer to create compostable snack wrappers or start the company that came up with the coveted Hydroflask. Luckily though, I did have a knack for sales and negotiation, so that worked in my favor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My Side Hustle: Renting Moving Boxes<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My side hustle is a moving box rental company called<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.calboxrental.com\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Box Rental<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which was born after seeing the heaps of cardboard boxes piled next to dumpsters next to apartments and dorms by UCLA, where I went to college. I found that there were other companies that offered this concept in Canada, so I figured since there was nothing like that in my hometown of Sacramento, CA, that I would start one!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How a Moving Box Rental Company Works<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My business works like this: A customer contacts us looking for boxes to move or<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.financialfives.com\/post\/5-ways-being-organized-will-save-you-money\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to organize<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we help them create a rental package, we deliver the boxes and other equipment to their doorstep, they keep them for up to 4 weeks, then we pick them back up! No waste, no building up boxes or packing tape, no damaged items from overstacking or soggy cardboard after a rain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what the boxes look like:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-64029 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/moving-box-e1623399235296.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"449\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-64028 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/box-w-dolly.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These boxes are incredibly durable. We&#8217;ve had maybe 10 boxes break or become damaged out of our entire inventory over the last 8 years, and that&#8217;s usually due to mishandling. They are made from commercial grade recycled plastic, and the biggest issue if they&#8217;re used too heavily is the hinges or top flaps can become damaged. I&#8217;d say they have a life of 8-10 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as rental rates, we don&#8217;t rent per box, rather per &#8220;bundles&#8221; catering to how big the client\u2019s job is. The most popular package we rent is our House Bundle, which is 50 boxes, a few rolling dollies, a wardrobe box, etc and that rents for $189 per week. We also charge $100 for round trip delivery within 25 miles of our storage facility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the boxes aren\u2019t in use, we store them in a storage unit at a self-storage facility. We&#8217;re still pretty small, and my business partner owns a moving company, so it made sense to save money to store them there rather than rent a warehouse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since sustainability and zero waste is a huge passion of mine, and this kind of business requires little startup capital (It cost me less than $2,500 to get up and running) I figured I\u2019d give it a go, and we\u2019ve been going strong for 8 years!<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Get more inspiration:<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80+ real-life side hustle stories<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Budgets Are Sexy readers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Start-Up Challenges for a Side Hustle<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hardest part of a business is just getting started. I would say the biggest challenges we had to overcome when we started was convincing people that this model was the new way to move. The idea of renting reusable boxes rather than buying cardboard ones was new to virtually everyone in town, even though it was flourishing in other cities. Even if people see our reviews or are contacted by us, we used to be easily dismissed. Now, the sustainability movement is really helping us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hardest part of <\/span><b>growing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the business is customer acquisition, but also managing and cleaning inventory. When you are not a high-volume business, you can&#8217;t pay someone by the hour to clean boxes or deliver them. Also, when a customer orders 100 boxes, they don&#8217;t always check to make sure all the inventory is there, so it becomes a &#8220;he said she said&#8221; situation if things aren\u2019t accounted for properly. Other times, we might miss a box that is stacked to be cleaned and sanitized, and if a customer gets a dirty box they are not too happy!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I wish we did differently was having a better marketing plan in place so word of mouth spreads quicker. I always thought that the best brands don&#8217;t advertise, their quality speaks for itself and their customers are their biggest fans. We have 5-star reviews across the board, so our customers do love us, but I think <\/span><b>limiting our marketing budget is also limiting our revenue.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s just a side hustle to me though, I don&#8217;t think I have the capacity for running it full time!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Starting a Passive vs. Active Side Hustle<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason I went with starting a business from scratch was partially for bucket list reasons, but also for control. When you start your own business, you control the price, who your target market is, how to market your product\/service, and so on. I knew that if I put substantial effort upfront, it could turn into more of a passive income stream for me, rather than exchanging my time for money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is key; you want to decide if your side hustle should be trading your time directly for income, or if you want to put a little more effort upfront so that it\u2019s more of a passive income stream, allowing you to focus on other projects (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08KXQGV75\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as writing a book!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). It\u2019s not a bad thing if you don&#8217;t want to go the passive income route, in fact, it\u2019s very noble! If you have a passion or knack for writing, designing websites, or interviewing people, there is plenty of money to be made by doing that. Some people, including myself, also get satisfaction out of doing something productive in our off hours to earn an income, which we can then use to reward ourselves or motivate ourselves that we can in fact reach FI.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/california-box-rental-rocklin\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Box Rental<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I figured if I put in effort upfront to create preferred vendor incentives with realtors, mortgage brokers, moving companies, and property management firms, that I would have to put in less effort later on. We are primarily a referral focused business, we don&#8217;t really advertise at all. While I\u2019m sure we could earn more if we advertise more, my goal is to invest in an amazing customer experience so they act like our biggest promoters. So far it\u2019s working, and we have a 5-star rating on both Google and Yelp!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This business model has also allowed me to live across the country and not be tied to our physical service area. I handle all customer inquiries, invoices, and marketing, and I have a business partner who is local that coordinates deliveries and cleaning of the inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My business is not 100% passive, but it requires very little work outside of marketing to draw up a rental agreement and send it to the customer. Any time our boxes are in the customer\u2019s possession, we are earning money. Whether they rent for 1 week or 4 weeks adds no more work on my end, yet we charge them more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Future of Moving Boxes, and Life After FI..<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My goal with California Box Rental is to continue to grow it because we are the only show in town for now, and the sustainability movement is catching on quickly. Hopefully, in a few years, we\u2019ll either triple in size or be acquired, so that there is a lot more capital to focus more on commercial and multifamily residential markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after achieving FI, I\u2019m still planning to stay busy and work on things that interest me. I would like to become more involved in local policies and also philanthropy\/advocacy around my passions of conservation, sustainability, and multimodal transit. Another goal of mine down the road is to create a coworking\/entrepreneurial food hall in my hometown to foster innovation and also have a cool place to hang out!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice to you if you want to start a side hustle business is (1) find something you\u2019re passionate about and that you\u2019d do for free (2) find a way to monetize it and (3) don\u2019t get in over yourself or risk your all of your hard-earned money in something that may not work out. Start small, do your research, watch and listen to others who have come before you, and have fun! If it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s a lesson to do better in the future, not a failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary Grewal is a remote financial planner, entrepreneur, current nomader, and author of<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3vg9lap\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial Fives: The Top 325 Ways to Save, Earn, and Thrive to Retire Before 65<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
