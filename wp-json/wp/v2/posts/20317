Take a gander, and then leave your thoughts\/advice below?\u00a0 Thanks!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a real pickle, and my Google skills do not have me any closer to solving it. :)<\/p>\n<p>I made a really awful decision. At 21 I walked into the Ford dealership and signed $18k of my life away for a Ford Fusion. I paid far too much for it, the Carfax has a ding on it, and I can&#8217;t afford it. It took me quite a while to realize it though! (Also, my grandparents co-signed for it.) I can make a million excuses, but what I have the most of is REGRET.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know&#8211; kick myself in the rear and never make that mistake again. But that doesn&#8217;t help this 2 ton anchor weighing me down!<\/p>\n<p>Right now (23) I pay $346 per month on said vehicle, and I pay $200 in insurance every month (damn you Michigan and your high auto insurance rates!). J, let&#8217;s be real here &#8212; I&#8217;m still in college and I make about $25k\/year. I can&#8217;t afford this in any way\/shape\/form.<\/p>\n<p>What is worse is I can&#8217;t find a way out and I&#8217;m starting to feel mighty desperate. I don&#8217;t even have much credit, and my debt to income ratio is so high I can&#8217;t get approved for a card or loan independently. I by no means have the resources to come up with even a few thousand dollars cash&#8211; right now I&#8217;m very much paycheck to paycheck and my savings account is at $10. There isn&#8217;t anyone who can lend me any money. I also was unemployed for six months last year and have an eviction on my credit report.<\/p>\n<p>Is there any way out there to get a little breathing room? I&#8217;ve thought about trading my Fusion in for a car worth 5k or so&#8211; but from what I can tell, most dealers won&#8217;t allow you to trade in a car for less than the one you want to buy.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to desperately hard to be financially responsible! But between the high car payments and the rest of life, I can barely keep up much less get ahead. This car payment is the amount of RENT in my area, and I&#8217;m crashing with my grandparents 35 miles away from work and driving in every day because I simply can&#8217;t afford to even rent a room.<\/p>\n<p>I apologize for the sob story, but if you get a moment to think on this and have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>OUCH.\u00a0 The first thing that came to my mind was to advise her on getting ANOTHER job.<\/strong> I don&#8217;t care what it is, but *anything* will help to reduce this massive amount of debt and stress (or even yet, get a *better* job).\u00a0 It&#8217;s obviously not optimal as a student who already has some sort of a gig going on, but luckily we&#8217;re given 24 hours in a day to max out as much as we need to, come hell or high water.\u00a0 And since she didn&#8217;t mention it specifically one way or the other, maybe there&#8217;s room here to get some more income going? (Check out some of our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">side hustles<\/a> for good ideas)<\/p>\n<p>The other option she touched on was possibly trading in her car, but I think she&#8217;s right in that you usually can&#8217;t do so for a much lower valued vehicle.\u00a0 Though you could always sell it and take the loss, then try and get another one right after?\u00a0 At a much smaller cost?\u00a0 It wouldn&#8217;t be easy of course, but it&#8217;s definitely doable.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Those are the best 2 options I see &#8211; what about you?\u00a0 Have you ever been in this predicament before?<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 What would YOU do if you were here? (I know it&#8217;s hard without having all the facts and\/or knowing anything about the reader whatsoever, haha, but do your best ;)).\u00a0 At the very least she&#8217;ll have more to think on, and hopefully get pumped up enough to get out there and make it happen!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks guys, you&#8217;re awesome :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>(Awesome license plate captured by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/gammaman\/\">Gamma Man<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a tough one, indeed.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s the email I got from a fellow reader of BudgetsAreSexy.
