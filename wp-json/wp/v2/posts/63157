Nobody is buying used cars right now. You should\u2019ve sold it six months ago before COVID happened.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is what one of my friends said to me recently. &#x1f614; And at the time I kind of agreed. With most people working from home and limiting their travels, I thought we\u2019d have a really difficult time getting rid of our second car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, it turned out easier than we thought! Just last Saturday we sold my wife\u2019s 2013 KIA Soul. Woohoo!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We got a great price &#8211; $7,700 (well, we feel great about it) after only 4 days advertising it online. It was a win\/win deal for both us and the nice couple who bought it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend was right about one thing though \u2026 We should have sold it six months ago. Actually, we should have sold it <\/span><b>two years ago<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the very moment we realized we could get by fine with 1 motor vehicle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The cost of an unused car \u2026<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ran the numbers recently and it\u2019s quite shocking to see what this little Kia was costing us just sitting there without any use:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CA Vehicle registration fees: $154\/y<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-much-do-you-pay-for-car-insurance\/\">Car Insurance: $475\/y<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual parking permit: $34\/y<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depreciation: $1248 this year**<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Total:\u00a0 $1,911 for the year \u2026 or\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>$159 per month!<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind, this is <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">without even driving it<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Driving costs for gas\/maintenance would have added up to even more! Cars are the worst.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m a bit embarrassed to be sharing all this. I sit and type personal finance articles all day, and have been knowingly leaking $159 a month out of my wallet! There\u2019s no excuse. I guess the reason we kept the car for so long was because it was fully paid for (a sunken cost fallacy), and also a combination of laziness and falsely perceived convenience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s even worse, there\u2019s a big missed opportunity cost. For every $1 of negative equity sitting in a depreciating car, that\u2019s $1 of equity that\u2019s <\/span><b>not<\/b> <b>helping build wealth for our future!\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh well.

But also very depressing to learn how fast your car depreciates. It\u2019s much worse for expensive cars :(<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Selling a car online<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve only sold a few cars online in my life. Each time I learn something new and get a little bit better about the process. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first step was to do a bunch of online research to find out the best approximate car value. Since our KIA had low mileage for its year (only 43k miles &#8211; not bad for a 2013 model), I knew we had a better chance of selling than similar cars this age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I looked at Kelley Blue Book value first, and they estimated the car\u2019s fair market value range for private sale: <\/span><b>$6,673 &#8211; $8,190.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, I cross checked these numbers with Facebook Marketplace, Autotrader, and Craigslist. 2013 Kia Souls were advertised anywhere between $3000 for a crappy junk car all the way up to $9000 for dealership prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, my wife and I decided we would list it for $8,500 and see what happens. We could always drop the asking price later if needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>BTW did you know Kelley Blue Book does instant CASH Offers now?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found this pretty interesting &#8230; KBB now teams up with local dealerships to offer cash for used cars. Unlike a trade-in, you don\u2019t need to buy another vehicle at the dealership to get this cash price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After filling out a detailed form on the site, we were emailed an instant cash offer cash of $5,662. I could take this to a participating car dealership and get rid of it immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63161 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/KBB-Instant-Offer.jpeg\" alt=\"Kelly Blue Book Instant offer\" width=\"518\" height=\"211\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/KBB-Instant-Offer.jpeg 744w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/KBB-Instant-Offer-300x122.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was actually pretty tempting. The thought of taking it into a car dealer and that afternoon walking out with cash was really exciting. But, knowing we could probably make a few thousand extra for just a tiny bit more effort, we decided to do the hard work and sell it to a private buyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Photos, photos, photos!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before pulling out the camera, I went and got the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-how-to-clean-wash-cars\/\">car fully washed<\/a>, waxed, and smelling like new. This cost me $69.95 at the local car wash &#8211; seems their prices have dropped a lot due to nobody driving much these days!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, I drove over to a nearby parking lot and snapped photos with my iPhone. From everything I read online about selling cars, it all comes down to the photos! <\/span><b>If you show quality photos, you attract quality buyers. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Remember to cover your license plate in any photos!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63162 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Kia-Craigslist-Ad.jpeg\" alt=\"Craigslist car ad\" width=\"500\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Kia-Craigslist-Ad.jpeg 625w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Kia-Craigslist-Ad-300x274.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One other strong recommendation I heard was to <\/span><b>take a photo of the keys, original manuals, vehicle history report, title and all repair paperwork.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (check out the pic below) This might seem like a useless photo to take, but showing an interested car buyer that you keep records neat and tidy goes a long way! It also makes you stand out against the other ads out there!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63163 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/keys.jpeg\" alt=\"car manual, repair reciepts\" width=\"500\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/keys.jpeg 608w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/keys-300x253.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know Craigslist charges you $5 to post Autos for sale now? When did that start!? I guess it\u2019s in an effort to minimize the amount of fraudulent ads and users\u2026 But, it didn\u2019t stop me getting a lot of scammer responses. About 5 minutes after I posted online, I started getting emails from people with lowball offers or asking for the VIN number without explanation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then finally, after 2 days we were contacted by interested buyers who wanted to check out the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>COVID, Cleanliness, &amp; Craigslist<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the thing I was most nervous about was letting strangers touch and drive the car. My wife and I agreed to meet the potential buyer, but if we got weird feelings at any point we would just politely excuse ourselves. We brought disinfectant wipes and a bunch of hand sanitizer to the meet-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After greeting them and having a 5-10 minute chat (social-distanced of course), they sounded legitimately interested. They took the car for a quick test drive, and offered us $7,700 cash as soon as they returned. My wife and I were happy with this, so we accepted right away. Done deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I wanted to rub the 77 hundred dollar bills all over my face, I refrained. We washed our hands and disinfected everything when we got home. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why are people buying cars right now?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This whole process was shockingly easy. I had just assumed nobody would be buying cars right now. But there ARE people out there looking for used cars &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The couple we sold the KIA to moved to LA from New York a few years back. They\u2019ve lived without a car for the past few years &#8211; they work close to home and have been able to Uber almost everywhere they need to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now with COVID, they don\u2019t feel comfortable using Uber or public transportation. Since they are both working from home and cramped in a small apartment, they wanted a small used car simply for weekend use. They want to drive up the Pacific Coast Highway and visit the northern remote beaches. Camping, hiking, and just being outdoors and enjoying Southern California.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guy who bought it admitted he knows he\u2019s going to lose money owning a car. But I guess it\u2019s better than losing your mind stuck at your house all year?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>TLDR;\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wifey and I sold our spare car on craigslist for $7,700.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should have done this years ago, we are idiots.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was costing us $159 to keep in the garage &#8211; cars are a money pit!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KBB has instant offers now (they seem low), and craigslist isn\u2019t free anymore, they charge $5 to list a motor vehicle now :(<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re selling a car online, include a nice photo of the keys\/manuals\/paperwork.
