How generous of you. &#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f; Just kidding\u2026 I guess my question is: A lot has changed over the past nine months in personal finance \u2192 What new trends are you seeing in the PF blogging world and what does the future look like for the FIRE movement?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J$: HAH! I was actually thinking about that the other day! What a crazy time to be writing about money, especially when so many people are suffering all over the place :( So I definitely admire the crap out of y\u2019all as I&#8217;d be so self-conscious now! But of course the show must go on and people will ALWAYS need good solid advice no matter what\u2019s brewing, so I am glad to see people are still writing and sharing their ideas all over the place like yourself. It\u2019s been especially interesting reading about meme stocks and bitcoin and Lord knows what else is sitting on the horizon! Haha\u2026 So at least I didn\u2019t leave you with a total mess. ;)\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for changes in the PF community, it\u2019s honestly a lot of the same stuff that was happening 8 years ago when I started curating &#8211; and even decades before that as well! Money doesn\u2019t change much, though you do see more EXTREMES being passed around the media more &#8211; specifically with FIRE &#8211; and blogging monetization has gotten pretty bad where I can\u2019t even READ some blogs anymore without ads being smacked in my face left and right! But overall I\u2019d say it\u2019s a net gain with both advice and all the financial movements that\u2019s since popped up.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s also a ton of sites and communities now focused on minority money and LGBTQ+ money and female empowerment money and a host of others that weren\u2019t around nearly as much 12 years ago when I first came onto the scene. All of which adds so much more value and connectivity in our space which is awesome to see! So the PF world is expanding more and more, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll only continue doing so. :)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>JOEL: Will we be seeing you at FinCon in Austin this year?
