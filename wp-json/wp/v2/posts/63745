That\u2019s a lot of moolah!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of you might be thinking, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? That\u2019s awesome! I wish I had that much in savings!\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the problem is, her money isn\u2019t actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invested<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in anything. It has wicked earning potential, but needs to be moved somewhere so it can take advantage of compound interest. The longer cash sits in her checking account, the more growth she is missing out on!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Invest a Lump Sum of Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend is learning about the stock market slowly and knows she needs to make a big investment decision soon\u2026 She is considering one of these two options:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Invest the entire $200k lump sum immediately into the stock market. OR&#8230;<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Invest the money slowly over time (dollar cost averaging)<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually, there\u2019s a third option, which is to <\/span><b>do nothing and keep holding cash.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But, she\u2019s ruled this option out already (and I\u2019ll address why a little later on).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, let\u2019s compare dollar cost averaging vs lump sum investing, contend the pros and cons, and figure out the best option <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mathematically <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for her moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Lump Sum Investing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lump sum investment is a complete, once-off transaction to move all available capital into an investment. In my friend&#8217;s case, it would be purchasing $200,000 worth of index funds, all at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Benefit:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The beauty of a lump sum investment is putting ALL your money to work for you <\/span><b>as soon as possible<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In general, the earlier you invest everything, the more you make in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Risk:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But, moving large sums of money is extremely scary! My friend keeps hearing that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cthe stock market is at an all-time high.\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Her fear is that the day after she invests, there will be a big market crash and she will lose a butt-ton of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, my friend has grown <\/span><b>emotionally attached to her cash.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It took her decades to save up this amount, and every time she logs into her bank account she feels pride, security, and comfort. She believes all those good feelings will go away if the money goes away.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Dollar Cost Averaging?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dollar cost averaging (dca) is an investment strategy where you divide up your capital into equal amounts and invest it on a regular basis. In my friend&#8217;s case, it would look something like: investing $10,000 per month into index funds for 20 months in a row. $10k x 20 = $200k.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Benefit:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Dca investing is an awesome strategy for volatile markets. Sometimes stock prices will be up, and sometimes they will be down, but my friend can rest easy knowing that she will be <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buying at the average price<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the 20-month period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Risk:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Emotionally, this can be like peeling off a Band-Aid very slowly. If stock prices decline over the coming months, she\u2019ll feel like her $10k regular investments are being thrown into a black hole. And if the market rises, she\u2019ll be continually wishing she had invested more money earlier on, at lower prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, even after 10 full months of investing, my friend would still have $100,000 sitting in her checking account. Her \u2018problem\u2019 isn\u2019t really solved fast enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is It Better to Dollar Cost Average or Lump Sum Invest?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone got a crystal ball we can borrow to tell us how the stock market will behave in the near future!!? <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, we can\u2019t predict the future. But we can look back through past stock market data and see how each strategy would have turned out in years prior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m gonna use this online <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceclub.com\/lump-sum-vs-dollar-cost-average-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dollar cost averaging vs lump sum calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to compare both investment strategies. It will run all the math for us based on historical data over the past 150 years, and tell us which strategy works out better most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 3 inputs needed, and here\u2019s what I\u2019m using for my friend\u2019s case:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much money is being invested:<\/span><b> ($200,000)<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many months if we did a dollar cost averaging strategy: <\/span><b>(20 months)<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total amount of years the money will stay invested: <\/span><b>(20 years invested <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this is how long my friend says she has until retirement<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the results:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63782 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Lump_sum_vs_dollar_cost_average_results_200k_jpeg_FUM5bM9S-e1615078719269.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"240\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of all the scenarios computed, using 150 years worth of stock market highs and lows, it shows that <\/span><b>lump sum investing has been the better option 72.2% of the time.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not just that, the lump sum strategy has a higher average performance, and higher best performance for the ending portfolio value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, playing around with the calculator, I modified the inputs for the total amount of years invested. Instead of 20 years, I tried lowering to 15, 10, 5, and 2 years\u2026 No matter how short or long the investment timeframe, <\/span><b>the lump sum investing strategy always has won more than 70% of the time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on this, the investment advice I\u2019d give my friend is:<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You\u2019ve got a higher likelihood of success dropping your $200k into index funds in one swift transaction.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Your Paycheck: Keep Dollar Cost Averaging!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick note&#8230; Although the lump sum strategy wins for my friend\u2019s scenario, this is only because she has a massive sum of money saved up! Lump sum investing is only for people with lump sums.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For most regular people, dollar cost averaging is the best strategy with your regular paycheck. If you\u2019re already a dca investor, keep doing what you\u2019re already doing. (If you\u2019re invested in a workplace retirement savings plan like a 401(k), you\u2019re already doing dca &#8212; you contribute to the plan every month, and the money gets invested for you every month!)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Should You Wait to Invest Until the Market Crashes?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve determined that my friend should be a lump sum investor, so now the next question is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should she do this?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning I mentioned a strategy of <\/span><b>doing nothing, keep holding cash, and waiting a bit longer <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">until a big opportunity presents itself. But, there are a few issues with waiting for a market crash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, there\u2019s been extensive research about trying to \u201ctime the market.\u201d It\u2019s almost impossible to predict market timing, especially for a novice investor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, my friend has already been doing this \u201cwaiting\u201d strategy for years. Which is proof that it\u2019s not working! Last year in March when the market crashed she was presented with a HUGE opportunity to buy the dip. She wasn\u2019t comfortable investing then, so what\u2019s to say she\u2019ll <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually take action<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> next time the market crashes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this said, probably the best option for my friend is to <\/span><b>invest as soon as possible<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Right meow. &#x1f640;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Other Things to Consider When You Have a Lump Sum of Cash<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m guessing my friend\u2019s not the only one out there with a large checking account balance. Sometimes money comes unexpectedly, like receiving an inheritance, big bonus check, or maybe even a large tax return check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before putting all your money in the stock market, here\u2019s a few other things to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Got any debt to pay down?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Using cash to pay off loans is always a safe move. Your chances of getting a return on your money is 100%.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Double-check your emergency funds:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019ve been using round numbers in my friend\u2019s scenario, but in reality she should leave enough cash left over for her personal emergency fund.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Upcoming big purchases, like real estate?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you already have a plan *in the near term* for spending a lump sum, it\u2019s totally fine that it sits in cash for a while! For my buddy, she\u2019s not buying a house anytime soon.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Check your risk tolerance!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While I think it\u2019s smart to venture outside of your comfort zone <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">once in a while<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I don\u2019t recommend making big investing moves that cause extreme stress!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Try a blended lump sum &amp; dca strategy:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My friend might feel better investing $100k as a lump sum and then the other $100k monthly over a couple years. She can then have a little of both strategy benefits.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Chat to a financial advisor:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Never hurts to have a professional look at your overall portfolio, asset allocation, investment goals and introduce less risky assets to combat market volatility.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Have You Helped a Friend Invest?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figuring out a strategy is only solving 50% of the problem. The other 50% is <\/span><b>actually implementing it.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will my friend pull the trigger and make a $200,000 trade next week? <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t know.
