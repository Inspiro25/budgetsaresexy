Money, I just want to add to the list of non-four year degree jobs! I&#8217;m a <strong>Designer in the oil &amp; gas industry<\/strong>. I make <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$125K<\/strong><\/span> and climbing (not including overtime). I&#8217;m in the Civil\/Structural discipline but there are several more disciplines like piping, electrical, mechanical, instrumentation&#8230; all of which pull in this range of cash if they&#8217;re any good. I have a 2 year associates degree from a technical college, but many people get in this business by learning AutoCad from friends or family that have an &#8220;in&#8221; with the biz. The downside to this trade is how highly affected we are by the economy roller coaster. I was laid off early on in my career but came back strong and I&#8217;m surviving this craziness right now. Put in the effort, excel at your job and save money for the risk is the general idea to make it in this career path. It also requires visits to chemical plants, oil refineries, paper plants etc, but primarily sitting at a computer 3D modeling and creating drawings. It&#8217;s quite fun once you learn how to manage the stress and deadlines!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>High profile\/celebrity jobs:<\/h2>\n<p>(Keep in mind &#8211; these are all YEARLY earnings!)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vice President of The United States @ <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$235,083<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Jennifer Aniston (Actor) @ <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$28,000,000 <\/strong>(est)<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Luke Bryan (Musician) @ <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$42,500,000 <\/strong>(est)<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Howard Stern (Radio Host): <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$93,000,000<\/strong> (est)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like attention and certainly wouldn&#8217;t ever want to be famous-famous, but I think it would be pretty cool to know how to play the guitar (and sing!), so if I had to pick one of these I&#8217;d def. go the musician route.
