Check it out below, along with my response, and then tell us what you think in the comments below. Let&#8217;s help out our fellow BudgetsAreSexy reader!<\/p>\n<p>His email:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>So, not sure if there is an answer to this but you are the finance blogger I most relate to so I figured I&#8217;d give it a shot. \u00a0Let me first try to paraphrase everything so you get an idea of my financial state.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I live in a super affordable area and make decent money between a full time job and a side business.<br \/>\n&#8211; With my business income varying and me wanting to budget, I just take out a set amount every month. If I make more I use it for future expenses.<br \/>\n&#8211; My wife is a struggling teacher trying to find a job in a shitty market. Until then she is subbing which isn&#8217;t great money.<br \/>\n&#8211; Only debt we have is a mortgage, 2 vehicles (under $300 ea) &amp; student loans.<br \/>\n&#8211; My wife&#8217;s student loans are barely cheaper than the mortgage (gotta love the cost of a masters) which is killing us.<br \/>\n&#8211; When my wife is working we have a few hundred left at the end of every month which goes into savings<br \/>\n&#8211; We have 2 months of living expenses in an emergency fund, another month in some stocks.<br \/>\n&#8211; The job I currently have I started last fall and am not putting any money into a 401k as I&#8217;m trying to beef up the emergency fund. I have about 20k from my previous employer (I&#8217;m 30 so even though I know it&#8217;s not ideal I&#8217;ll play catchup once the wife lands that job).<br \/>\n&#8211; We are expecting our first kid in January (hoping for December for tax write offs though ;) )<br \/>\n&#8211; I have expensive hobbies including racing cars. An event which I like to do is around $500-600 for 2 days plus consumable parts, tons of gas, and possible travel.<\/p>\n<p>Now. Years ago I was stupid and racked up an insane amount of debt while building my car. I had a come-to-senses moment and paid off a ton of credit cards quickly, built a decent emergency fund, and was on track financially. Then I met me wife and between life crap, a wedding, a wife that isn&#8217;t as budget savvy, and no summer income, my emergency fund dwindled which put me in panic mode as in we can&#8217;t spend money. \u00a0This is keeping me up at night fearing I&#8217;ll rack up that 15k in CC debt again and have to start all over.<\/p>\n<p>The no &#8220;real&#8221; job thing makes my wife feel guilty that she&#8217;s not pulling her weight (she works her ass off and is good at what she does, there just aren&#8217;t the opportunities for an actual job) which causes arguments. She doesn&#8217;t like talking about budgets as a result. I know it&#8217;s a communication issue here and we&#8217;re awesome at it normally, it&#8217;s just a really touchy subject for her. Add that that the fact I&#8217;m pissy because I work my ass off at my job and business and can&#8217;t seem to find the money or time to do the car stuff I want to (missing a big event next week for the first time in years). I feel guilty when I do spend money on stuff even if it&#8217;s for the business in a way (such as buying parts for my car to show-case which does help sell parts (oh, my side business is a performance parts retailer). To off that guilt I spend the spare business money on personal stuff, for example&#8230;parts for my bicycle (another expensive hobby).<\/p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m sorta coming to a head with everything. I&#8217;m financially responsible but maybe too financially responsible? Should I saw screw it and do what I want and let my wife do the same and if we get too out of control then reign it in? \u00a0With a kid coming it&#8217;s not helping my OMGWENEEDAMILLIONINTHEBANKTOBEOK mentality&#8230; especially with a wife who, while subbing, barely makes enough daily to cover childcare and no maternity leave with her job. So yeah, I guess money just scares the shit out of me at this point and may be causing more problems trying to control it than just saying screw it (to a point) and doing what we want.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that makes sense and I didn&#8217;t ramble too much. A perk of my job is super relaxed hours which means it was time for me to go home 15 minutes ago so I sorta rushed through this. If you do happen to make sense of all this mess I appreciate your help in advance.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Here was my response:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Haha, no problem my man &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to admit it was a pretty interesting read :) I don&#8217;t know if I have any real answers for you since I don&#8217;t know you two very well (or at all?) but you did paint a pretty good picture about your money and situation. And actually you remind me a lot of my wife who needs a TON of money in savings to feel secure. We went from $80k in cash last year (she was in dream land) <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/net-worth-update-down-40k-10-percent-loss\/\">to now $28k<\/a> and she&#8217;s freaking out again. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/crap-week-rental-property-income\/\">As am I<\/a>. So I think there&#8217;s power in knowing what makes people feel safe vs others. Especially in a relationship like marriage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I guess my first question to you is &#8211; what WOULD make you feel safer?<\/strong> I mean, I know it&#8217;s more money and your wife getting a job, but is there a certain number you have in mind that&#8217;s realistic? Like, say, $20,000 banked? It doesn&#8217;t really help your current situation directly, but I know I always feel a lot better when I know the end goal with a plan. My wife too.<\/p>\n<p>Before we were at like $50k in savings and she was constantly worrying and so we chatted and found out her <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/new-monster-cash-account-emergency-fund\/\">ideal money in savings number was $66k<\/a> cuz it was 12 months worth of living (different now, but that was the situation back then). So we worked on getting that and then once we hit it I could do whatever I wanted with all the extra money if we had any cuz I knew she was safe and secure. So I&#8217;d come up with that number first, and really there isn&#8217;t a right answer since it&#8217;s totally relaying on your personality and feelings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>After that, I&#8217;d probably figure out a way to give you both some &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/marriage-money-husband-spends-differently\/\">do as you please<\/a>&#8221; budget money<\/strong> so it helps eases the stress each of you have when it comes to that stuff. Like if you had $200 to spend however you wanted every month, and she had $200 (or $100 or $300 or whatever) that each of you could do whatever the hell you wanted with.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s kinda a &#8216;screw it&#8217; plan like you&#8217;re asking in that you can blow all that money, but it&#8217;s also only a certain amount so you can never go overboard, know what I&#8217;m saying? And even if your wife had, say, $500 or like double what you give yourself, even if it pissed you off a little at least you&#8217;d *know* exactly the situation and more importantly BOTH of you are eye-to-eye on it. Which of course requires a conversation in order to get to there ;) But I&#8217;d imagine one that started with &#8220;let&#8217;s budget money for each of us to do whatever the hell we want with&#8221; would go a lot smoother than the others have, haha&#8230; You just both have to agree on SOMETHING, and then see how it goes for a few months &#8211; the numbers themselves don&#8217;t matter as much as that first part.<\/p>\n<p>At least that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do in your situation. Easier for me to say, of course, but I genuinely think it would solve a lot of your stresses at the same time. And hopefully carry you through to when your wife gets a solid job again and things are looking rosier.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Either way, though, I wouldn&#8217;t sacrifice all your good work you&#8217;ve done with your finances right now just to blow off some steam or forget about it for a while.<\/strong> Eventually it&#8217;ll only stress you out even more, and then you&#8217;d have double the problems to work on :( If you were leaning that way, just up the amounts of money you both can spend in your &#8220;do whatever&#8221; budgets so at least there&#8217;s a cap on there.<\/p>\n<p>Oh &#8211; quick question about your 401k at work before I forget: Do they match anything or no? If no, then keep on doing what you&#8217;re doing. If YES, then I&#8217;d strongly think about at least putting in whatever they match cuz it&#8217;s all <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/07\/my-4-favorite-pieces-of-financial\/\">FREE MONEY for you<\/a>. And even though it&#8217;s not directly in your savings account, it still might make you feel better in terms of money saved ya know? $200 in your 401k vs $100 in your savings could make a difference as the numbers keep climbing every pay check and you&#8217;re doing the same work.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if any of this helps or not, but I hope it does&#8230; <strong>I think you gotta give yourself a pat on the back for being aware of everything going on around you<\/strong> and &#8220;taking one for the team&#8221; there. If it makes things better, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/back-to-living-off-one-salary-again-womp-womp\/\">I&#8217;m currently the only provider of income right now too<\/a> &#8211; also with a baby in full-time day care (congrats on yours coming soon btw!!) &#8211; and I&#8217;m feeling <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/crap-week-rental-property-income\/\">some pressure<\/a> as well. Especially since just dropping $20k+ on renovations and my businesses not doing as well this Summer. The one thing I&#8217;ve learned though is that stuff is rarely perfect. As long as we&#8217;re workin&#8217; it 80% well, things will be fine in the end :) So keep at it!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you, the readers, say?
