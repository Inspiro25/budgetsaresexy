That sounds horrible!!&#8221; I blurted back. &#8220;All that hard work and then bam &#8211; time to start unloading it!&#8221; My dad nervously laughed back, and ever since I stopped jabbing him as much :)<\/p>\n<p>Logically, of course, I know the point of all this saving and investing we&#8217;re doing is to be able to use it later for a better future, but something about that convo was so real and raw that I never really stopped to think-think about it until right there in the moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How DO you get okay with spending money after decades of saving and skimping by? How do you break a habit that&#8217;s 20, 30 or in my father&#8217;s case &#8211; almost 50 years old in the making?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It sounds like the opposite of everything we&#8217;ve been trained to do, right?<\/p>\n<p>I still haven&#8217;t come to terms with it if I&#8217;m being honest, but two years later I&#8217;m proud to report that my father has finally overcome it and officially had his last day of work just last week :) At 60-something years old he has stopped hustling for that almighty dollar, and is now on a mission to soak up what he hopes is an even almightier life of leisure.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t had another heart-to-money-to-heart talk with him yet, but I can safely say that he seems to have gotten over it when I asked why the reception was so bad on our last call, and the answer was &#8220;because we&#8217;re on the boat.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It was 2pm on a Thursday afternoon :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And good for them. 80+ years of combined working and raising three mighty fine (if you ask me) grown up children, why shouldn&#8217;t they be living up the good life now? Money be damned!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although, I must say, in the past two years leading up to this point I&#8217;ve learned a LOT more about my parents&#8217; finances, making me realize just how conservative they actually are. It&#8217;s no wonder why their financial advisor asked why they weren&#8217;t retired years ago &#8211; check out these income streams!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A full military pension after 20+ years served<\/li>\n<li>A civilian pension after another handful of years served (what is a pension anyways??)<\/li>\n<li>Another full pension from my mom&#8217;s last working career<\/li>\n<li>A rental home that brings in income<\/li>\n<li>A handful of additional retirement accounts<\/li>\n<li>And lastly, another brokerage account on top of it all! Which I may or may not have &#8220;accidentally&#8221; seen one day years ago and almost spit out my diet caffeine-free substitute coke (really guys, you can afford the &#8220;good&#8221; stuff now!!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>I basically learned that my parents were the <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/millionaire-next-door-book-review-thomas-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">millionaires next door<\/a>, and really had nothing at all to worry about.<\/strong> But what do I know &#8211; I don&#8217;t even know what a pension is ;)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny looking back over the years though, because I could have<em> sworn<\/em> my parents were poor at times. I mean, what mother doesn&#8217;t let her kids rock the new Air Jordans every single year? (Or, *any* year for that matter?? They should have bought stock in Payless!!). And why couldn&#8217;t we have the SUPER Nintendo instead of the lame <em>regular<\/em> Nintendo mom? Jeez, gosh&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Following &#8220;I love you&#8221; and &#8220;goodnight,&#8221; the next popular phrases in our house were &#8220;we can&#8217;t afford that,&#8221; and &#8220;Money doesn&#8217;t grow on trees.&#8221; And then of course, &#8220;be thankful for what you have &#8211; there are kids in Africa with nothing!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>It didn&#8217;t stop us from wanting more, unfortunately, but as a reformed money lover I can now certainly applaud the attempts.<\/strong> And I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll pay for it dearly when my own kids start tormenting me in a few short years!<\/p>\n<p>But my parents DID love me and make sure we were always provided for no matter what, and for that I am eternally grateful. I&#8217;m not sure what would have happened if we knew just how well they were doing towards those later years, but I&#8217;m glad we were forced to make our own idiotic paths despite them trying to keep us on track. Have I ever told you the story of how I was so proud of contributing to my 401(k) for an entire year, only to realize I actually hadn&#8217;t and my balance was still at $0.00??<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we just gotta figure stuff out on our own :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So well done, parents! You have reached the pinnacle of financial success, and now it&#8217;s all good times and leisure for you.<\/strong> I may not have appreciated any of your tips growing up, but I sure see the light now and I thank you for being two of the best role models a mohawked kid can have.<\/p>\n<p>I love you guys from the bottom of my heart, and I&#8217;m so excited for your new journey together!!
