Yep. As I type this, and yet again avoid dealing with it, I currently have no health insurance whatsoever. And I don&#8217;t have anyone to blame but myself ;)<\/p>\n<p>I KNOW that it&#8217;s important, and I KNOW that I&#8217;m playing with fire here, but for whatever reason it keeps getting pushed down my priority list (says the guy who just blogged about how important it is to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/08\/3-things-money-cant-buy-sniff\/\">maintain good health<\/a>! Sigh&#8230;) And the 2.3 minutes I&#8217;ve spent on it so far hasn&#8217;t been very motivating either.\u00a0<strong> Costs aside, it seems you need a PHD just to figure out what the hell you NEED to begin with.<\/strong>\u00a0 Which gives me even more respect to all you in Human Resources, my goodness. Y&#8217;all are smarties!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not here to confess all my dirty secrets with you today, nope.\u00a0 I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;d be here for a lot longer if that were the case. Instead, I&#8217;m getting this all out in the open to make sure I hold myself accountable for now on.\u00a0 I know damn well some of you are jumping out of your seat, ready to knock some good sense into me already, so consider this me asking for it!\u00a0 But maybe focusing less on the\u00a0 hate, and more on the tip&#8217;age :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who do you all use for insurance?\u00a0 Did you get it on your own, or are you going through your employer?\u00a0 Do any of you own small businesses where you created your OWN group insurance?<\/strong>\u00a0 I was talking to a friend the other day, and he mentioned that he just created a *group* plan through his own LLC and that worked out nicely for him.\u00a0 In fact, I called my accountant last week (ooh, I *did* do more research on it all! Haha&#8230; already forgot about that, wow that&#8217;s bad.), and she mentioned that being self-employed I can now potentially write it off too!\u00a0 How sweet would that be?<\/p>\n<p>She mentioned something to the affect that to qualify, I couldn&#8217;t get it anywhere else like through my wife&#8217;s employer or something like that. But luckily\/unluckily she gets insurance through her University (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/03\/mrs-budgetsaresexy-got-accepted-to-grad\/\">She&#8217;s still a grad student<\/a>).\u00a0 Up until now I&#8217;d been on that same plan since getting <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\">laid off<\/a> in December, but now for whatever reason they&#8217;re swapping companies and their new insurance plans are all kinds of jacked up.\u00a0 Which is why I&#8217;m just now getting into this stuff, 9 months into J. Money 2.0 ;)\u00a0 At least I&#8217;ll get to learn something new which is kinda cool&#8230; just wish it was on stocks or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/09\/dont-go-shopping-while-drunk\/\">beer<\/a> or something like that, haha&#8230; maybe Beer stocks?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Okay, enough of my rambling.\u00a0 Hook a brotha up and give him some good pointers!<\/strong> Here are the questions again that come to the top of my head:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Which insurance company do you have?<\/li>\n<li>Do you like them? (aka would you recommend them to me?)<\/li>\n<li>Do you get it through your own employer?\u00a0 Or are you self-employed?<\/li>\n<li>How much do you think it will cost a 31 y\/o relatively healthy young man signing up on his own plan? ;)\u00a0 The person who gets the closest answer to this will win a special prize, haha&#8230; ooh I like that! Yes &#8211; tell me how much you think it&#8217;ll end up costing me, per month, and whoever gets the closest will win something cool!
