Which had been the plan for that allotted cash all year long (and especially when I found out we&#8217;d be <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/zomg-getting-money-back-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">getting $11,000 back from taxes<\/a>!). So that was <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$16,034<\/strong><\/span> from our cash savings off the bat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Next, we maxed out my Roth IRA which took another <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$5,500<\/span> from the pot.<\/strong> I had been going back and forth on this for a while, but ultimately just pulled the trigger figuring it&#8217;s better to make the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2-big-investing-mistakes-that-actually-made-me-smarter\/\">&#8220;mistake&#8221; of investing<\/a> a chunk now and dealing with it later, than having it disappear on Lord knows what over time and regretting it. Plus, I didn&#8217;t want to break my record of maxing it out over the past 5 or 6 years now :) We&#8217;re sitting on over $50,000 from all these yearly maxings now! <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/my-a-ha-moment-accumulation\/\">It adds up<\/a>! (The other $20k+ in that overall number you see up there, btw, is my wife&#8217;s Roth. I max hers out as well on and off when times are good)<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, which you can&#8217;t really tell from that snapshot up there, we finally got rid of all those <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-401k-ira-test\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crazy Traditional IRA accounts<\/a> and merged them into just ONE with <a href=\"http:\/\/Vanguard.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanguard<\/a> :) And as soon as the dust settles, I&#8217;ll then be moving that account into our SEP too for further minimalism! I had no idea you could do such a thing, but I love it!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ll also be cashing out of all stocks, funds, and everything else currently being held in my accounts real soon too.<\/strong> I just did a &#8220;transfer&#8221; to get everything <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/say-hello-to-vanguards-newest-member\/\">moved over to Vanguard<\/a> &#8211; Step 1 &#8211; which was also something I didn&#8217;t know you could do so easily (I thought you had to cash out first, then move, then invest it all over again?), and then Step 2 is re-investing into the new game plan. So look for that article soon here too, once we get that squared away this month.<\/p>\n<p>Other than that (&#8220;other than&#8221; &#8211; hah!), everything else hummed along normally as with other months, and most of our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\">net worth<\/a> increase came directly from the markets performing okay. We&#8217;re still losing money every month <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/net-worth-update-march-2014\/\">as we&#8217;ve come to terms with<\/a>, but I&#8217;m feeling really optimistic these days and have some other business changes in the works that I&#8217;ll be sharing with you guys pretty soon as well. I&#8217;m basically shedding even more stuff to free up time and re-focus on what&#8217;s important. I&#8217;m pretty excited about it!<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">For now though, here&#8217;s how Aprils&#8217; numbers broke down:<\/h2>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CASH SAVINGS<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$17,906.52)<\/span><\/strong>: As mentioned above, we took out over $22,000 to max out both my SEP and my ROTH Ira for the 2013 tax year. This should be the only major cash dipping we do all year long (fingers crossed anyways!).<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">529 College Savings<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$62.84)<\/span><\/strong>: Nothing to report here really, other than we&#8217;ll be adding some extra $$ here towards <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/introducing-j-nickel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baby Nickel<\/a>&#8216;s future eduction when the timing&#8217;s right. I read from a <a href=\"http:\/\/financially-blonde.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial planner friend<\/a> that a lot of her clients just pour in all their kids&#8217; college $$ into the same account, and then disperse\/tweak it later once\/if it&#8217;s time to start pulling from it. Which I had never thought about before as I always assumed you just had to keep creating new ones for each child? Another win for minimalism :)<\/p>\n<p><em><em>[<strong>Update:<\/strong> Fellow blogger <a href=\"http:\/\/momanddadmoney.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matt<\/a> brought up a good point to think about with this 529 merging idea: You may lose the opportunity to deduct more off your state taxes if you&#8217;re trying to max out contributions into your own state&#8217;s 529 plan (if that&#8217;s where you want to invest, of course). For example, in Virginia you can get $4,000 worth of tax deductions if you contribute that amount into their 529 plan (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.virginia529.com\/new-savers\/benefits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">details here<\/a>), which is fine if that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re planning on doing in the tax year, or less. If, however, say you&#8217;re looking to invest $8,000 into it ($4,000 for kid #1 and $4,000 for kid #2), then it makes more sense to open up that 2nd account so you can get BOTH $4,000 deductions okay. If you threw that $8,000 into the &#8220;mixed&#8221; account as mentioned above, you&#8217;d only benefit from $4,000 worth of deductions and lose out with the other $4k. So, something to think about&#8230;. And big thanks to Matt for pointing it out!]<\/em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IRA: SEP<\/span> <span style=\"color: #008000;\">(+$15,747.76)<\/span><\/strong>: Mmm mmm this looks good! Over $80,000 now in this puppy, all from yearly maxings over the years of self-employment&#8230; Which now crosses <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/12\/thoughts-learned-self-employment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over the 3 year mark<\/a> &#8211; pretty crazy.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IRA: ROTH(s)<\/span><span style=\"color: #008000;\"> (+$5,802.89)<\/span><\/strong>: Double nom nom nom!!

I can never max out any of my accounts regularly through the year since my business income fluctuates so freakin&#8217; much (as does my life now, apparently). So I leave it all &#8217;till the end of the year once all the facts are here, and then decide from there.

We&#8217;re no where near the holy grail of hitting a million, but we&#8217;re inching closer with each year!<\/p>\n<p>And you guys can too.
