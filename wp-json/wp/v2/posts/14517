Either way you need to visualize your goal, dream about it, make it real.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Imagine yourself living the goal\u2014what you\u2019ll do and how you\u2019ll feel.<\/strong>\u00a0 Make your goal a complete vision.\u00a0 Figure out how much that life costs, then make a plan to get that amount of money.\u00a0 While you\u2019re piling up the money, you need to focus on all the aspects of your life that are part of the goal.\u00a0 If your goal is to be a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/04\/my-millionaire-to-do-list\/\">millionaire rock star<\/a> in your 30\u2019s, you better be taking guitar lessons, or having the million dollars won\u2019t get you to your goal.\u00a0 Once you\u2019ve fully explored your dream goal, and understand everything it takes to achieve it, you\u2019ll be excited about doing what it takes and the financial steps will be a lot easier.<\/p>\n<p>My husband and I started out with the \u201cbazillionaire\u201d goal.\u00a0 We got out of debt and saved a good bit, but our heart wasn\u2019t in it.\u00a0 One day, I realized what I really wanted was <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/financial-minimalism\/\">freedom<\/a>.\u00a0 I simply didn\u2019t want to work for a paycheck.\u00a0 I decided I didn\u2019t need to be a bazillionaire to be free; I just needed to stop working.\u00a0 So I lowered my total savings target, so I could be free sooner.\u00a0 Then I calculated what kind of hovel I could afford on my freedom income, and decided to raise the dollar target and extend the time frame. \u00a0Over the years the numbers have evolved as I researched the cost of living in my dream city, decided how big a house I wanted, and fleshed out how I\u2019d like to spend my time.\u00a0 (Being a full-time volunteer takes a lot less income than being a professional shopper.)\u00a0 We took family vacations in our dream city so we\u2019d know what it would be like to live there and what kinds of activities we\u2019d want to include.\u00a0 The more we explored our dream of freedom, the more excited we were about saving money.\u00a0 My husband and I have been enthusiastically saving a third of our income for many years, because we finally got passionate about our goal.<\/p>\n<h2>Follow your values, not &#8220;the rules&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>The other thing I learned is that your financial choices need to follow your values, more than they need to follow \u201cthe rules.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s lots of great advice out there, but blindly following every tip for piling up money might not be the way you want to go.\u00a0 Consider this plan for piling up a bazillion dollars, based on actual financial advice:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get a college degree in whatever field has the most jobs that pay the most money, forget following your bliss.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/kelli-space-college-story\/\">No loans for college<\/a>\u2014work full time and see if you can get your degree in less than four years.\u00a0 Too much free time and socializing lowers your grades and increases the likelihood you\u2019ll drop out.<\/li>\n<li>Work for whatever company pays the most, even if you hate the work and everything the corporate machine stands for.<\/li>\n<li>Spend only what is necessary for survival, buy used or rent everything but food, and invest the rest.<\/li>\n<li>No debt, period.<\/li>\n<li>DO NOT indulge in dating, personal relationships or any social interaction that isn\u2019t free or reduced price.<\/li>\n<li>If you must date, insist everyone pay their own way and do things for which you have a coupon.<\/li>\n<li>Screw philanthropic donations. Since you don\u2019t own a house, charity isn\u2019t tax-deductible\u2014better to donate to your bazillionaire fund.<\/li>\n<li>If you have the free time to volunteer, ask for overtime at work instead.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid marriage at all costs, it\u2019s tax-disadvantaged and there\u2019s a risk you\u2019ll be stuck with your spouse\u2019s previous debts, shopaholic issues, and poor credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Above all else, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/06\/to-dink-or-not-to-dink\/\">don\u2019t have children<\/a>.\u00a0 They\u2019re an endless money pit and will expect you to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-pay-for-college-without-loans\/\">pay for college<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you follow these rules, you\u2019ll be a bazillionaire while you\u2019re still young.\u00a0 Plenty of time after that to buy the trophy spouse and settle down.\u00a0 To be on the safe side, get an airtight pre-nup.<\/p>\n<p>OK, I\u2019m being snarky.\u00a0 My point is there\u2019s a lot of good financial wisdom out there, but if it doesn\u2019t track with your values, it isn\u2019t right for you. \u00a0Being a slave to the \u201crules\u201d of finance is just as bad as being a slave to overspending and debt.<\/p>\n<h2>The values that took away from my freedom plan<\/h2>\n<p>My values include doing work that makes a difference, marriage and family, occasionally spoiling my kids, and taking awesome family vacations.\u00a0 These all took money away from the freedom plan.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>My husband elected to stay home to raise our two boys, a major hit to our income and savings.<\/li>\n<li>While we were piling up money for our goal, we also blew lots of money in big and little ways.<\/li>\n<li>We probably paid too much for housing, because we chose to live in neighborhoods with the best schools<\/li>\n<li>We don\u2019t buy expensive cars and we <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/03\/the-attack-of-the-used-car-disease\/\">drive them till they\u2019re dead<\/a>, but we always buy new.<\/li>\n<li>While I\u2019m happy to buy a t-shirt on sale at Target, I\u2019m just as happy to pay regular price at a high-end store.<\/li>\n<li>We don\u2019t budget. \u00a0We figured out how much we want to save for our goal, we have that automatically removed from our paycheck, we pay our bills, then the rest is ours to blow.<\/li>\n<li>We generally pay off our credit cards every month, but give ourselves a few months to pay off the big vacations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We could have retired several years ago if we\u2019d been more diligent or more willing to economize, but I love my job, and was happy to keep working<strong>.<\/strong>\u00a0 We probably look capricious, undisciplined, wasteful and dumb to the casual financial observer, because <em>we don&#8217;t follow rules&#8211;we follow our values<\/em>.\u00a0 So sue me, I\u2019m still leaving the workforce at a young age.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s important to live your dream life now, rather than waiting till you\u2019ve got bazillions to start living the dream.<\/strong>\u00a0 It\u2019s equally important to remember that planning and saving money are just tools to achieve dreams; they\u2019re not the dream itself.\u00a0 I\u2019m convinced if we don&#8217;t keep that straight, we become the tools. :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Barbara &#8220;Babs&#8221; Wagner<\/strong> is a former poster child for financial misadventure, who learned most of what she knows the hard way.\u00a0 She has a degree in business and has studied personal finance, most of which she now ignores.\u00a0 Her mission is to poke fun at conventional wisdom, keep money subservient to her values, and inspire others to learn from her mistakes.
