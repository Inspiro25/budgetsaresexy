Whole process was managed remotely.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our first investment together as a couple (we were engaged at the time, but not married yet, so mingling money and sharing debt was still a strange new feeling)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First time getting an investment loan.

I was smart enough to keep an awesome daily log of activities, but dumb enough to lose them immediately. :(<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Advice to new investors: Start an investment diary. Take notes on everything you learn. Record your wins, losses, and lessons learned. (and keep a backup of it &#x1f643;)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was given this same advice as a young investor. And while I\u2019ve done a half decent job of taking notes, I wish I had done better! Detailed notes from the past are handy in so many ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why New Investors Need to Start an Investment Diary<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some reasons I encourage investors, particularly *new* investors, to document everything they learn:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Writing stuff down helps you retain information better:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> No secret here, most of us learned this in school&#8230; Whether handwriting or typing, you remember more when you take notes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>It helps create a \u201crepeatable process\u201d:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My original goal of writing everything down for the rental purchase was so that I could create a personal \u201cplaybook\u201d for buying my 2nd, 3rd, and more properties. Constant note taking along my journey builds a solid book of knowledge for future investments and hopefully profit.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>It limits repeating past mistakes:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some of the best lessons learned are from trial &amp; error. Making silly mistakes or hitting unforeseen challenges. My past notes help remind me to avoid the same problems. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Eg. Note to self: Stop day trading. It only ends in tears. Keep buying that mutual fund!)<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Theory vs. practice:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There\u2019s a million books on investment strategy and How To Guides&#8230; But putting that information into practice brings a whole lot of experience and emotions you can never plan for. Documenting the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feelings<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along your journey is a really important part of investing when looking back &#8230; and that&#8217;s solid investment advice no matter if you&#8217;re investing in the stock market or real estate or for retirement vs. another long term goal. It applies to everything!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>New epiphanies:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 When I read my past notes and learning materials, I see brand new ideas and thoughts I couldn&#8217;t see at the time. It\u2019s weird to think that your future self can learn from your current self.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Others can benefit from your knowledge:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The main reason people follow this blog is because <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J Money documented his net worth growth in real-time<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Following his journey was so useful because a lot of it came from a beginner\u2019s perspective. Your notes could help other individual investors save time, money, and build their stock portfolio!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Knowledge &gt; Money:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Would you rather have Warren Buffett\u2019s wealth or Warren Buffett\u2019s knowledge? OK, bad example, don\u2019t answer that &#8212; you would take the $$$&#8230; but you get the point&#8230; The knowledge of how to fish is sometimes more important than the fish itself. Treasure the knowledge you gained from any investment decision, not just the money made!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b><i>Take notes about what? Where should I write this stuff?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to Create an Investment Journal<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a couple examples and things you might want to try as you make a record of your investment process &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Things you learn from books and podcasts:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Let\u2019s say you regularly listen to the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.choosefi.com\/episodes\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose FI podcast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230; Start up a spreadsheet with 3 columns: (date | episode | biggest takeaway).

Any time you are feeling uninspired, overwhelmed, or want to recall a specific memory, just go back to your spreadsheet.\u00a0 You can do the same with technical investing podcasts and personal <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/happy-thanksgiving-heres-some-good-reads-from-around-the-interwebs\/\">finance books<\/a> you read.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Notes when tracking your net worth:\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example is<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J$\u2019s net worth reports<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

You\u2019ll be thanking yourself later in life when you\u2019re reading your investment diary from years past.
