Money&#8217;s 30+ jobs<\/a>!), and have slowly worked my way up to a passable salary at a job I enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>As someone who once blew through $100,000 in 2 short years, I have always been curious as to how much money I have wasted in my lifetime. It&#8217;s a tough pill to swallow looking back at my spending blur and not even know where $35,000 of it went, but what if I took my<em> entire lifetime<\/em> to see how much money has passed through my hands?? Scary.<\/p>\n<h2>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>I was a kid from the 80&#8217;s, which meant my parents listened to a lot of MC Hammer and Paula Abdul. What does that have to do with money? Well, MC Hammer blew through <a href=\"http:\/\/business.time.com\/2012\/02\/16\/top-9-celebrity-bankruptcies\/slide\/m-c-hammer\/\" target=\"_blank\">a lot more money<\/a> than I did. Also, I can&#8217;t ever get that one Paula Abdul song out of my head (&#8220;straight up, now tell me\u2026.&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>Anyways\u2026so I was born in the 80&#8217;s, and like any good grandparent did back then, they gifted me some savings bonds. Like $100 or something. So, that was basically it for the first 5 years of my life. Unless you count stuffed animals and binkies as money. In that case, I was rich!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spending:<\/span> None. Unless you count cashing my cuteness checks ;)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5 Years Old &#8211; $100<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Once I was old enough to realize the value of money, I started getting some (again, from the grandparents) in my birthday cards. I would get $5 every birthday from at least 3 grandparents, so that&#8217;s $15 per year until about age 10. I also started receiving an allowance of about $1 a week. So another $325 passed through my hands in those 5 years.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spending:<\/span> Most of my spending included baseball cards, candy and arcade games. But I always had a little saved for a rainy day.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>10 Years Old &#8211; $425<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>At age 10, I was starting to pull my weight around the house (not that kind of weight). I worked my butt off, and deserved some compensation for my labor. I mean, seriously, have YOU ever mopped a kitchen floor with just vinegar? TORTURE!<\/p>\n<p>For my efforts, the parentals would drop $5 here, $10 there. I would guess I earned a few hundred over the course of the next 5 years. Add on top of that the average of about $50 per birthday, and I was probably at a good $500. I also started working in the summers doing odd jobs. I earned about $1,000 cold hard (under-the-table) cash! DON&#8217;T TELL THE IRS!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spending:<\/span> Through middle school and high school, my money went towards food (tasty school French fries) and movies. Because what else is there for a teen to spend money on?!<\/p>\n<h3><b>15 Years Old &#8211; $1,925<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>At 15, I was still doing some odd jobs, but was much too busy with marching band to care (Yes, I was the coolest kid in my school). I earned maybe another $500. But I hit the gold mine at age 16 when I landed my first job at a retail grocery store. CHA CHING! Earning a cool $6.50 an hour, I was really raking in the dough. At age 18, I got my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iheartbudgets.net\/2012\/06\/how-i-blew-through-100000-before-i-turned-21\/\" target=\"_blank\">$100,000 to blow through<\/a>, AND got a job at RadioShack.<\/p>\n<p>By the time I hit 20, I was almost broke again (crazy!). Now I can get into more exact figures, because the kind folks at the Social Security Administration keep track of my income for me!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spending<\/span>: You can just read through my post on blowing $100k to find where my priorities were. Ugh! So much potential wasted\u2026<\/p>\n<h3><b>20 Years Old &#8211; $132,500<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Wow, that was quite a jump. At age 20, I decided to quit work and go to school full-time. I got my audio degree (what is that, anyway?), and picked up a job installing VERY HIGH END home theaters from a company called Definitive Audio. Mostly, I got stuck in the crawl spaces to run wires for 8 hours a day, so I started job searching pretty quickly.<\/p>\n<p>I then worked my way into my current company. I worked there for a year, and then split to go get married and move out of state while my wife finished school. I moved back after she graduated, and we were DINKS (double income, no kids)! I also got promoted. W00t W00t! By the time I was 25, I had received the rest of my inheritance as well.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spending:<\/span> Getting married at age 22 and reading a Dave Ramsey book were the catalysts to getting my money in order pretty quickly. We paid off a ton of debt (over $24k worth), started rocking a sweet budget and saved money while living on only $14 an hour! We then bought a house and had a kid, which absorbed the remainder of our money.<\/p>\n<p>I then got a few more promotions and worked my way into my current position. Oh, and I became a tax professional part-time and started a blog that brought in some cash.<\/p>\n<p>So here it is\u2026 DRUMROLL PLEASE\u2026<\/p>\n<h3><strong>27 Years Old &#8211; $601,600<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>O.M.G.<\/p>\n<p>I have let WELL over half a million dollars pass through my hands, and my net worth is less than 15% of that number (~$55,000)&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Wow. Well, I&#8217;m going to go cry myself to sleep and then drown my sorrows in bacon.<\/p>\n<h2>What My Life Could Have Been Like<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say I took the advice of J. Money and did things like MAX out my 401k and have a sexy budget all along? What if I went crazy and invest 50% of my income throughout my last 11 years of money-making? What would the numbers look like to handle your money well from the beginning?<\/p>\n<p>If I invested 50% ($2,273 a month) for 11 years at 8% my net worth would be = <b>$494,832.50<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>The Lesson:<\/h2>\n<p>That is almost 10x my current net worth. I would probably have a paid-for house, TONS of tax sheltered investments, and would be well on my way to financial independence. I could have cut my working career IN HALF or less if I had my head on straight about how to handle money.<\/p>\n<p>This is serious. If you don&#8217;t handle your money with care, count every dollar that passes through your hands with a budget, and invest early and often, you may end up realizing you have WASTED half a million dollars as well.<\/p>\n<p><em><b>How much money has passed through YOUR hands in your lifetime?<\/b><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It may be a hard number to look at, but the numbers never lie. And it&#8217;s much sexier to know than to live in ignorance ;) Drop your number in the comments if you feel comfortable. This isn&#8217;t a competition, but a great way to get a 20\/20 look at your past to give you much better vision for your future.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<i><strong>Jacob<\/strong> writes some ridiculousness over at <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iheartbudgets.net\/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>iHeartBudgets.net<\/i><\/a><i>.
