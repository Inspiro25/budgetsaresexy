How much should I charge? Where can I find clients? But I&#8217;m already so busy&#8230;how can I manage my time?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It turns out that out everyone who wants to earn more money has a very similar set of barriers holding them back. Kind of like people who want to lose weight &#8212; it&#8217;s usually the same set of 5-10 mental and physical barriers holding them back. Interestingly, everyone thinks they&#8217;re unique&#8230;but of course, we almost ALL have similar questions and barriers.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s another important question that few people ever ask: <strong>What SHOULDN\u2019T I be spending my time on?<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #006699;\">When I tell people they SHOULD spend money on lattes, they get confused<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When I talk about the basics of personal finance, people are shocked to hear that I advocate spending extravagantly on the things you love. Whaaa&#8230;?? SPENDING? But I thought personal finance was all about making budgets, cutting back, locking up all your extra money for 40 years, making your own detergent, and checking your bank account 5 times a day???<\/p>\n<p>Some people get so hung up on the idea of spending extravagantly that they never hear the second part of my philosophy &#8212; cutting costs ruthlessly on the things you don&#8217;t care about.<\/p>\n<p>You want to buy that $500 pair of boots? Ok, if you really want them, go ahead. But the flip side of extravagant spending is cutting back on the things you just don&#8217;t care about and won&#8217;t miss (take a closer look and you&#8217;ll see there are actually a LOT of things in your life that fit this) &#8212; some people don&#8217;t care about cable, but forget that they&#8217;re spending on it every month, others could be saving $50\/ month on their cellphone bill but never bother to check if they&#8217;re on the right plan.<\/p>\n<p>So now let&#8217;s talk about how this relates to earning more money.<\/p>\n<p>Just like personal finance, earning more is within everyone&#8217;s reach. But there&#8217;s a slight difference:<\/p>\n<p><strong>With earning more, time is your currency. Where will you spend it extravagantly, and where will you cut costs ruthlessly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #006699;\">Stop wasting time on worthless activities<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Time is your most precious currency when it comes to earning more real money. Spending it on the wrong thing will slow you to a standstill.<\/p>\n<p>Why, then, do all the standard &#8216;How to start a business&#8217; tips tell us to do everything under the sun?<\/p>\n<p>Just as big brands are out there trying to market their products &#8212; giving you more and more options of where to spend your money &#8212; most of the standard &#8216;How to start a business&#8217; tips are simply marketing ideas so you&#8217;ll keep reading&#8230; and reading&#8230; and reading&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Reading tips can be fun, but earning more money is even better.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this list of &#8220;essential&#8221; tasks that you MUST do before starting your business, taken from one popular book on freelancing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up Twitter and FB page!<\/li>\n<li>Start a blog and website<\/li>\n<li>Get business cards and logos designed<\/li>\n<li>Register your DBA (Doing Business As) name<\/li>\n<li>Prepare a press kit<\/li>\n<li>Draft contracts and other legal forms for use with clients<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>THESE ARE ALL WORTHLESS WHEN YOU&#8217;RE FIRST EARNING MONEY<\/strong>. In fact, in my <a href=\"http:\/\/earn1k.com\/?utm_source=budgetsaresexy.vercel.app&amp;utm_medium=guest-posts&amp;utm_campaign=Earn1K%2BGeneral\">Earn1k<\/a> course, I ONLY focus on helping my students get their first 3 paying clients. Anything else is not important right now. Once you have consistent cashflow of $500\/month extra, $1,000\/month, or even $5,000\/month, you can afford to focus on other aspects of your business.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #006699;\">Why you should ruthlessly ignore typical advice about starting a business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll hear people recommending these same old tired, pointless tasks (like setting up a Twitter page to earn money) because (1) that&#8217;s what they know, and (2) it&#8217;s easy to describe. It&#8217;s much more difficult to explain the important of deep customer research or pricing. But some novice weirdo can say, &#8220;You REALLY need to set up a Twitter account&#8221; and wipe his hands because he thinks he&#8217;s helped you. (I have over 13,000+ followers on Twitter and carefully measure where I generate revenue from. I can tell you from quantitative analysis that Twitter is one of the LAST things you should set up, if your goal is to earn more money.)<\/p>\n<p>Here are some reasons why you should ignore this kind of advice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. They&#8217;re endless time sinks<\/strong>. None of the above to-dos are technically wrong, and some of them might even seem like no-brainers. But little things that can be constantly tweaked (&#8220;Oooh, maybe my logo should be a little more like THIS!&#8221;) add up rapidly until minutes become hours and hours become days. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still at $0 profit. But, you perfected that logo!<\/p>\n<p>Until you&#8217;ve started earning money consistently, you don&#8217;t have a business. Nobody cares about your logo, Twitter\/FB page, or anything else. Those are simply goals to get you to earning money&#8230;so why not skip over them and go directly to earning money?<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. They drain your energy<\/strong>. In a perfect world, everybody would do all of the above and still have plenty of time and motivation left over for actual work. In reality, we&#8217;re cognitive misers and have limited willpower, so people get lazy and feel like doing nothing a LOT OF THE TIME. You know what I&#8217;m talking about. Your motivation is finite, and that&#8217;s normal. But, know that if you don&#8217;t spend your limited motivation on the most important tasks &#8212; the tasks that are directly connected to getting clients and getting paid &#8212; then the real work will never get done.<\/p>\n<p>Be ruthlessly protective of your time and energy. Scrutinize every task and consider, &#8220;Is this EARNING essential or am I just doing it to put off  what&#8217;s important?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. You might not even need them<\/strong>. Remember, you&#8217;re earning money on the side &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com\/blog\/you-dont-have-to-start-google-to-earn-money-on-the-side\/\">not starting the next Google<\/a>. Resist the urge to think you need certain things in order to look like a &#8220;real&#8221; business.<\/p>\n<p>Real businesses make money. Case in point: I paid one of my freelancers over $12,000 last month, and he has no business cards, no blog and virtually no web presence whatsoever. And he works <em>exclusively<\/em> with online businesses!<\/p>\n<p>Barring a few truly important exceptions (e.g. basic legal and tax issues which are can easily be outsourced to experts and should NOT take up most of your focus), it&#8217;s time to start ignoring what most people say you need to do to start a business. No clients, no business.<\/p>\n<p>How do you get those clients? Focus on what&#8217;s truly important: Crafting an irresistible offer, figuring out who&#8217;s willing to buy, and closing your first three clients. <strong>Everything else is just details.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>*     *     * * *<br \/>\n<em>Ramit Sethi is the author of the best-selling personal finance book I Will Teach You To Be Rich.
