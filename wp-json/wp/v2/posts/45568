All this on the nights and weekends with a newborn baby in the house. What was my investment to get started in my new occupation? About $300. I\u2019ve since invested a lot more into my business, but fortunately, my original startup costs were pretty minimal.<\/p>\n<p>The industry that I dove into was voice over. I got paid $450 for the first job I ever did. I was instantly profitable. The job was to provide the narration for a two-minute video for a company in Denmark (I recorded it from the closet of my apartment in Kansas City). I made $10,000 over the course of three months on the third job I ever got. I quickly learned that is extremely rare to book a national radio campaign with a worldwide brand as a new voice actor, but hey, that\u2019s my story.<\/p>\n<p>In the rest of this article I\u2019ll tell you what voice acting is and a little about how the industry works. I\u2019ll also outline exactly how I got started, and provide some steps you can take if you\u2019re interested in becoming a voice actor.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is voice acting?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You know those voices you hear on the radio, TV, and online trying to sell you things? Those are done by professional voice actors. Professional voice overs are also used for narrating audiobooks, product\/explainer videos, training videos, video games, animation, live announcing, jingles and more. The voice telling you what stop is coming up next on the bus or subway is from a voice actor. Announcements at the airport and audio tours in museums. I\u2019ve done pre-recorded announcements for award shows. YouTube ads, Pandora commercials, toys\u2026 It\u2019s not just TV and radio. Video game voice actors are becoming very popular. The list goes on and on. When you hear a voice but don\u2019t see the person talking, that\u2019s voiceover. (Fun fact: It&#8217;s called seiyuu in Japan and it&#8217;s a huge industry over there!)<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Voice Over Work Entails<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I spend my days at home in my vocal booth, reading scripts, editing audio, and delivering recordings to clients. But I didn\u2019t start out that way. My first \u201cbooth\u201d was a spare bedroom in my old apartment with sheets hung on the walls. Then I \u201cupgraded\u201d to the closet that we treated with foam and acoustic blankets. I\u2019ve also recorded from my car, hotel rooms, friends houses, and once in an airport. That didn\u2019t work too well.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there is the business side as well that includes invoicing, marketing, networking, branding, and getting coaching and vocal training. As a voice actor, you\u2019ll spend your time split between doing the administrative things you need to do to keep your business running and reading scripts for commercials, narration, animation, or whatever types of jobs you book.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of times, the voice acting jobs that you book aren\u2019t really things that you\u2019re passionate about or interested in. But sometimes you get to work on projects that are right up your alley. Like in this Grammarly ad that got a lot of playtime on YouTube. A friend of mine called me and said he got really confused when he heard it. He often reaches out to me for help editing papers, and he thought one of our conversations was somehow being played back through his computer!<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/zADj0k0waFY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/center><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Pros of Voice Acting<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45575 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-derek-rv-trip.jpg\" alt=\"carrie derek rv trip\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-derek-rv-trip.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-derek-rv-trip-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>You can do it from anywhere!<\/b> Well, anywhere with an internet connection that is quiet enough. In 2015 my family went on a cross-country road trip and I recorded many spots from the bathroom\u2026 I mean \u201dstudio\u201d of our travel trailer. I would hang acoustic blankets up anytime I needed to record in there. I\u2019ve recorded from a parking garage, and I discovered one of the best, quietest places to record from when traveling: cemeteries. Yes, I look super suspicious pulling up in my car and then going into the backseat with a blanket over my head and a microphone. But you do what you have to do ;) My in-laws are awesome and set up a closet that I use as a studio when we come for visits.<\/li>\n<li><b>You don\u2019t need a degree<\/b>. But professional training is everything. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get my career off the ground like I did without training and coaching. While training is a must, what I mean is you don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to choose to pursue voice over.<\/li>\n<li><b>You can make your own hours for the most part.<\/b> There are always deadlines for voice work, but there\u2019s a ton of flexibility overall.<\/li>\n<li><b>It\u2019s a cool job!<\/b> It\u2019s fun, and people will always be intrigued when you tell them it\u2019s what you do.<\/li>\n<li><b>It is very lucrative.<\/b> Or it can be anyway. There are a lot of voice actors out there working part-time, pursuing voiceover as just a hobby, or who are struggling to get their careers off the ground. But on the other end of the spectrum, a lot of national TV commercials have 5-figure paydays. And it\u2019s been really fun to get to grow with a lot of voice actors who are now making a big 6 figure salary! Of course getting to those numbers takes years of dedicated voice work, training, a good plan, and the endurance to stick with it.<\/li>\n<li><b>Low barrier to entry. <\/b>You don\u2019t need a bunch of expensive equipment to get started. You do, however, need some <i>good quality<\/i> equipment, but you don\u2019t have to spend a fortune on it. (I\u2019ve offer resources to help you select equipment, get proper training, and start auditioning here in my free <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy--carrieolsenvo.thrivecart.com\/book-more-e-learning\/5e42fe8f58a5d\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">getting started in voice over<\/a> guide.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/carrie-voice-over\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61620\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/getting-started-voiceover-work.png\" alt=\"getting started voiceover work book\" width=\"481\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/getting-started-voiceover-work.png 1920w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/getting-started-voiceover-work-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/getting-started-voiceover-work-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/getting-started-voiceover-work-1024x768.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Cons of Voice Acting<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Work is never guaranteed.<\/b> It\u2019s a competitive industry, and sometimes (if you\u2019re auditioning) you\u2019ve got to beat out hundreds of other voice actors to get a job. There\u2019s not much of a safety net aside from your ability to market yourself and consistently book work. Agents and casting sites can help in this area but it\u2019s ultimately up to you.<\/li>\n<li><b>Training can be expensive and time consuming<\/b>. It takes time to get your skills up to a competitive level. The professional voice actor industry is competitive and full of people who have been doing it for decades. As a beginner you can\u2019t really expect to compete with people who have more skills, knowledge, and connections than you do. But even those people started as a beginner years ago. It\u2019s okay to be a beginner and start from where you are today. While getting enough equipment and know-how to start auditioning doesn\u2019t cost much, a good coach does \u2014 and should. But in my experience, it is well worth the investment to land more voice acting jobs. If the cost of training is prohibitive, there are many online groups you can join for free that are extremely helpful, but aren\u2019t a substitute for 1-on-1 coaching. (More info on these types of groups in the guide I mentioned above.)<\/li>\n<li><b>It can be isolating.<\/b> If you\u2019re an introvert like me, this could also go in the pros category. But you can expect to spend the majority of your time alone in your recording space. I sometimes joke that my job is to stay locked in a soundproof box in my house shoes talking to myself all day long. (Nightmare for some, dream job for others.)<\/li>\n<li><b>Certain types of work are easier to get if you live in LA or New York.<\/b> Although this hasn\u2019t stopped me from making six figures from home in Kansas City. I have flown out to LA a few times for auditions, but I do the vast majority of my work from home. About every other month I do a directed session at a local studio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>How Much Money Can You Make Voice Acting?<\/strong><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>This varies from job to job and depends on whether you are a union member or not. You can check out <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy--carrieolsenvo.thrivecart.com\/get-traction-in-voiceover\/5d409ce3f94c6\/\">current union rates here<\/a>. What I\u2019ve discovered is that outside of union rates, it\u2019s subjective when it comes to pay. Many audition sites will allow you to bid your own price for a job. On these sites, a job may get one bid at $20 and another bid from a different voice actor for $1,000. It\u2019s a matter of what you feel you\u2019re worth and how much clients are willing to pay for truly professional work.<\/p>\n<p>One of my most memorable paydays was $3,000 for 45 minutes of work. I was getting paid $500\/spot (whether the spot was 60 seconds or 15) for a cinema ad campaign and did six spots in under an hour. It was my first time seeing that kind of cash come in from voice acting, and I remember feeling like there had to be some kind of mistake when the check came in. I was ecstatic!<\/p>\n<p>The rate for voiceover work varies depending on what type of job it is (the pay for narrating audiobooks is very different than the pay for voicing commercials), how long the work will air, and where it will air. So you\u2019ll see rates ranging from a couple hundred dollars well into the thousands.<\/p>\n<p>When I was first starting out, I took jobs that I wouldn\u2019t today. But I learned my lesson on accepting less-than-optimal rates. I am a huge advocate for charging what you\u2019re worth and not underselling yourself&#8211;even for new voice actors.<\/p>\n<p><em>(EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Money magazine just came out with a list of the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/4023097\/freelance-economy-facts-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highest paying jobs you can do at home<\/a>, and interestingly enough voice over work clocked in at 2nd place! With an average hourly rate of $72\/hr. So obviously those actors aren&#8217;t doing it right like Carrie is ;))<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How I Got Started Voice Acting<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Before we dig in here\u2026 If you ask any voice actor how they got started you\u2019ll likely get a TOTALLY different answer from each person. There\u2019s not one, straight and narrow path like, \u201cI went to voiceover school, completed my residency, bought a mic and now I\u2019m a voice actor!\u201d I\u2019ll tell my story but just remember that your path will be different. I also highlight other <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy--carrieolsenvo.thrivecart.com\/voiceover-success-intensive\/5d39e2bcd78c6\/\">voice actors\u2019 getting started stories<\/a> on my website so you can see the unique journeys different people have had.<\/p>\n<p>Okay, here\u2019s my story&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>It all started with podcasting. My husband and I have hosted and\/or produced thousands of podcast episodes starting way back in the ancient days (2010). We used to work for a podcasting network and we\u2019ve had our own personal shows off and on since 2010 too. We\u2019re always on the lookout for a good new show to binge. At the time I discovered voice acting, I had a 45 minute commute to work, so I got lots of listening done.<\/p>\n<p>One day, I randomly picked a new podcast I had never listened to, the Go For It Show with Tyson Webb (sadly, it\u2019s not around anymore). I turned on the latest episode and set off for work. About half way through the episode, a light bulb went off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The show I happened to be listening to was an interview with a voice actor named <a href=\"https:\/\/alysonsteel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alyson Steel<\/a>.<\/strong> I was only half paying attention until I heard her answer the question, \u201cWhat does a typical work day look like for you?\u201d I had a baby that year and had just gone back to work. I was dying to be able to spend more time with my daughter and husband.<\/p>\n<p>This is what Aly\u2019s typical work day looked like: She got up, did yoga, got her kids off to school, checked her email for scripts, spent some time in her voiceover booth recording spots for radio, TV, internet, telephone systems, etc., got on Facebook for a while, did a little more recording, then called it a day. Um\u2026 AWESOME!<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the episode, she mentioned that she offers private voice acting coaching for $150 for an initial hour consultation (her coaching model is different now and I still highly recommend her). My husband, Derek, is a budgeting fanatic, so I figured he wouldn\u2019t be too excited about me asking to spend $150 to learn more about a job that neither of us had even heard of before that day. Fortunately, he told me to go for it. (He would later tell me that he could tell how excited I was and that he could \u201csense\u201d something.)<\/p>\n<p>I booked the session with Aly, a 20-year voice acting veteran, and she spent an hour telling me all about the business. I took notes like a crazy person. I still have them. That night, I recorded a very rough sample reel on the equipment Derek and I use for podcasting and sent it to Aly. She was beyond encouraging, so I hired her to coach me as I worked to get my new business going.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Ball Started To Roll&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I become a voiceover sponge, reading, watching, and listening to every voiceover resource I could find. Meanwhile, I started auditioning for work on an online casting site. They had a special where I could sign up for my first month for $10. When a client or casting director on the site likes your audition, they can shortlist you. I started getting shortlisted almost immediately. And one morning as I was leaving for work, I whispered to Derek who was still in bed, \u201cI got my first job. $450!\u201d I was thrilled and he was shocked!<\/p>\n<p>I had booked my first paying job about seven weeks after learning voice over was even a thing and I was totally obsessed. I started living, breathing, and eating all things voiceover. Well, not eating&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/carrieolsenvo.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45577\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-voice-over.jpg\" alt=\"carrie olsen voice over\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-voice-over.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-voice-over-300x205.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>(We\u2019ve come a long way since this pic! This was in an isolation booth at a at a co-working space I used to use that just happened to have a full blown recording studio. The door was five inches thick and weighed a freakin\u2019 ton! The mic in this pic was the same we used for podcasting and originally cost $100 in 2010. I\u2019ve since upgraded my set up which you can learn more about in my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy--carrieolsenvo.thrivecart.com\/voiceover-success-intensive\/5d372854d139e\/\">getting started guide.<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><b>I\u2019ve been having a blast.<\/b> Like in any business, there are ups and downs, but I have now been booking work on my own and through my agents and manager, while continually seeking out the best training in the industry. I get to network with the amazing contacts I\u2019ve made over the years, am nationally represented by one of the best agencies in the business, have voiced highly played television and radio commercials, and built up a hefty clientele of repeat business for my voiceover services. In 2019 I joined the Actors Union which I still can\u2019t believe!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of companies now, including Taco Bell, Kmart, REI, Grammarly, Pandora, 7-11, Walt Disney World, AT&amp;T and am loving doing promos for the Netflix Series Spirit Riding Free.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Here Are The Steps I Took in Detail<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>(I\u2019m laying out the path I took, even though I realize your path will look way different. If you\u2019re less interested in how I did it and would rather just hear about how you can do it, skip down a section.)<\/p>\n<p><b>First, I made the decision to make a real go of it.<\/b> Since I\u2019ve been voice acting, I\u2019ve had hundreds of people ask me how to get into the industry. I think the first step is that you have to want it. Badly. And you have to want it enough to put in the effort it requires. Of the many who have picked my brain on becoming a voice actor, only a small percentage actually followed through with the steps I suggested. Voice over work sounds like a ton of fun \u2014 and it is \u2014 but it is also a <b>business.<\/b> Voiceover jobs don\u2019t fall into your lap just because you\u2019re sort of interested in trying it out. This leads me to the second thing I did, and probably the most important.<\/p>\n<p><b>Then, I hired a voice over coach.<\/b> There are so many people on the web claiming to be voice over coaches, and you have to be careful that the one you work with isn\u2019t just trying to build up your confidence, make you a half-ass demo, take your money, and then send you on your way to poor results, no income, and frustration. Sadly, this does happen. You only get one chance to make a first impression with potential clients and agents, and your coach should be someone who helps you develop your skills and make a demo that is going to give them a good first impression. Look for someone who knows the industry, is connected to agents so they know what a good demo sounds like, and doesn\u2019t just crank out demos for anyone who will pay their fee. You want someone who gives you personalized attention and will be there for the long haul.<\/p>\n<p><b>Thirdly, I devoured everything I could get my hands and ears on about the voice acting industry. <\/b>Blogs, books, podcasts, everything. I\u2019m really glad I did this because I ended up booking my first national radio spot in a matter of weeks, and all of the research I did, combined with my sessions with my coach, helped me to feel like I knew what I was doing when I walked into the recording studio for the first time. I lay out some great resources that I devoured in those first weeks and months in a free guide that\u2019s available on my website (more info below). A word of caution on this: If someone is promising you something that sounds too good to be true, make sure to vet the person before giving them any money.<\/p>\n<p><b>Next, I auditioned.<\/b> Auditioning was my only method of getting work for my first full year as a voice talent. I was still working full time, so I would <i>try<\/i> to do ten auditions when I got home from work, and as many as I could on the weekends. This didn\u2019t always happen, but it was my goal.<\/p>\n<p><b>Lastly, I marketed myself. <\/b>After my first year, I wanted to have more control over my business, so I developed a targeted system and marketed my services to potential clients I really wanted to work with, mostly for e-learning work. By doing this I was able to build up a steady stream of repeat clients, many of whom I still work with today.<\/p>\n<p>You may have noticed that \u201cbuy a microphone\u201d or \u201clearn how to use audio editing software\u201d is nowhere on this list. Fortunately, I just happened to have had a hobby (podcasting) that gave me a head start in those areas.<\/p>\n<p>It was not a smooth road to making a full-time income with voiceover work, particularly in the first year. It was risky to leave my job when I did, and although things ended up working out, there were some shaky moments. My income was dependent on whether or not I would book that next job. Getting regular, repeat clients helped to ease the burden I felt to constantly be booking new work.<\/p>\n<p>And I never stopped seeking counsel. Along every step of the way, I consulted with my amazing voice over coach, who was (and still is) over the moon about my success. She has talked me down from the ledge, encouraged me, shared her wisdom, believed in me, and helped me to believe in myself. In a word, she is invaluable. I\u2019ve also been involved in voice over mastermind groups that have helped me grow my business through motivation, connections, and voice and business skills.<\/p>\n<p>By now you\u2019ve recognized a common theme throughout my story: <b>coaching and training.<\/b> Voice acting is one of those industries that seems easy to get started in because \u201cit\u2019s <i>just<\/i> talking.\u201d And while I do know a few people who have made amazing careers for themselves with no or limited coaching, you\u2019re much more likely to grow your business&#8211;and experience less frustration&#8211;if you invest in developing your performance.<\/p>\n<p>After all, many of the most acclaimed athletes, speakers, and entrepreneurs regularly meet with their coaches for ongoing development, so I figure I\u2019m in good company.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-61621 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-voiceover-studio-current.jpg\" alt=\"carrie's updated voiceover studio\" width=\"531\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-voiceover-studio-current.jpg 935w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-voiceover-studio-current-300x196.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/carrie-voiceover-studio-current-768x503.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(Pic above is of my current vocal booth at home.

If someone ever tells you it\u2019s going to be easy to start a 6-figure business, they\u2019re pulling your leg. Starting a voiceover business may not be easy, but with the right plan and expectations, it\u2019s totally doable. And totally worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few steps I recommend you take if you\u2019re interested in pursuing a career in voice over. These are the Cliff\u2019s notes.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Get a voice over coach.<\/b> I recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/alysonsteel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alyson Steel<\/a>. She\u2019s awesome. It may sound ridiculous to hire someone to teach you how to talk. You\u2019ve been doing that for years! But I promise there is a lot more to voiceover than just talking. A good coach can help catapult your career to the next level much faster than you could on your own. They can also save you from a lot of confusion and disappointment if you\u2019re auditioning a lot and just can\u2019t figure out why you\u2019re not booking any jobs.<\/li>\n<li><b>Listen to your coach.<\/b> No really, your coach will be able to tell you what your next steps should be. At some point, you\u2019ll need to make a demo and start auditioning and\/or marketing your services. Your coach will let you know when you\u2019re ready and will make suggestions for getting started.

But remember, you\u2019re much more likely to get the most out of your investment if you hire a reputable professional who is familiar with the industry to guide you.<\/li>\n<li><b>Listen to commercials.<\/b> Or audiobooks, or e-learning programs, or whatever it is you want to voice. I used to hate listening to radio commercials in the car. Now, I\u2019ll actually change the station when music comes on so that I can study the commercials!<\/li>\n<li><b>Market yourself.<\/b> Once you feel your skills are competitive, get a website up and running, get a demo made, and start reaching out to your ideal clients and agents. But don\u2019t do this too early. If you\u2019re going to invest in a demo, make sure it represents you at your best. So don\u2019t do it first thing. If you make your demo first, then start getting training afterwards, your demo will be outdated almost immediately. (Meaning: You will be better than your demo so your demo will actually be holding you back from getting jobs!) Make sure you\u2019re competitive before paying money to get a demo made.<\/li>\n<li><b>Keep practicing.<\/b> I absolutely love doing voice over. It\u2019s fun, and I get to be creative and even goofy sometimes. (Sometimes I scare the crap out of my husband when a job requires screaming. I always forget to warn him ahead of time!) There are people all over the world working hard to perfect their skills, and if I want to stay competitive with them, I have to practice to keep up my chops. I know they are practicing and getting coaching, and that motivates me to keep up (or slightly ahead). ;)<\/li>\n<li><b>Grab my (free) how to get started in voice over guide.<\/b> I give away some of my best secrets on how I grew my voice over career, as well as some super valuable resources in the guide.

In fact, there are definitely opportunities where having an accent or being bilingual comes in handy with voiceover work. And for all the other situations, there are coaches who specialize in accents, so they could help you with that area as well. One of the first questions my voiceover coach asked me was, \u201cDo you speak another language?\u201d.\u00a0 Slang and local terms are very desirable skills.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Voice coaches that specialize in accents: &#8211;&gt;<\/strong> Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/edgestudio.com\/education\">Edge Studio<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theaccentcoach.com\/\">The Accent Coach<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>How do you care for your voice?<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;I drink tons of water, or at least I should :) I avoid sugary foods before sessions, I avoid yelling, and I try not to get sick :)&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Best advice to attract new voice acting jobs?<\/h2>\n<p>I would say that your ability to act\/talk convincingly to your target audience is more important than the quality of your voice. If you\u2019re promoting a skin care product, and you can \u201cbecome\u201d the best friend sitting across the table telling your friend about this great new moisturizer you discovered \u2014 and do it so convincingly that it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re acting \u2014 that will get you further than just sounding nice. You can do self study to get better at this, and you can also attend classes, workshops, or hire a coach. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Can I do voice acting as a full time career?<\/h2>\n<p>Yes! This doesn&#8217;t just have to be a side hustle. Many people make a great career out of VO. Typically you&#8217;ll need a lot of experience to land full time jobs and earn a steady voice actor salary. But, you also might find that you can make more money contracting and being a freelancer for your talent than getting paid a salary.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the typical voice actor salary?<\/h2>\n<p>The average voice actor annual salary is ~$76,300 (or $36.70 hourly wage) according to Zip Recruiter as of October 2020)\u00a0 But keep in mind, this is the <em>average<\/em>. Some professional voice actors get paid massive amounts.<\/p>\n<h2>Can you make passive income from voice acting?<\/h2>\n<p>Although you sometimes can earn residuals for voice over work, this is mostly trading your time for money. But, if you love what you do, you don&#8217;t work a day in your life, right?<\/p>\n<h2>Who is the highest paid voice actor? (Just for fun)<\/h2>\n<p>Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone. These dudes created South Park, and do the voice acting for many of the main characters!<\/p>\n<h2>What if my voice sounds &#8220;too young&#8221;?<\/h2>\n<p>Remember, there is no such thing as the right kind of voice. Lots of adults get paid big money to voice act for parts that are supposed to be kids voices. Most of the cartoon voices that sound like kids on TV and in video games are really adults! Typically, adults are easier to work with than kids, so you can use a young sounding voice to your advantage!
