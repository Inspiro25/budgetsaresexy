In theory I think it all makes sense, but I tend to just cut back in all the areas I&#8217;m able to cut back in (some months it&#8217;s good, and others not!), and then at the same time stash as much savings as I can each month as well.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it breaks down into similar %&#8217;s over time, I&#8217;ve never really run the numbers, but so far it&#8217;s been working out well, at least since I&#8217;ve wrapped my head around all this stuff a decade ago :) Ask the old me though and I couldn&#8217;t tell you *what* I was spending on, no less the pie percentage!<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, here&#8217;s where our current finances would break down if it was pie&#8217;d up like that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Living expenses: 60%<\/li>\n<li>Discretionary: 20%<\/li>\n<li>Savings\/Investments: 20%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So not too far off, actually! Although there&#8217;s a number of items in there I had to guess on as wasn&#8217;t sure what category they&#8217;d fall into&#8230; (says the guy who blogs about finance for a living!!)<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">&#8220;You can afford a home that\u2019s two to four times your annual gross income.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Well this one should be an easy one to compare to since we <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/homeowners-again-but-struggling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">literally just bought a house<\/a>!! :) Doing the math on this bad boy pushes us out into the $320,000 &#8211; $640,000 range, where I&#8217;m glad to see we&#8217;ve landed wayyy on the lower end of the scale here &#8211; woo!!<\/p>\n<p>Although if you recall, we did get approved all the way up to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/should-we-go-for-a-15-year-or-30-year-mortgage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$800,000<\/a> from one source, so it seems pretty accurate at least on the lender&#8217;s side. And not to be confused with what you can *actually afford* btw, since the banks are happy to loan out as much as they can get away with because it means more $$$ for them!! So don&#8217;t fall for that trick like many of us have over the years!<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">&#8220;You need life insurance equal to eight to 10 times your annual pretax income.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>No idea where this figure comes from, but if we stayed in line with it we&#8217;d need to have about $640,000-$800,000 each, of which we&#8217;d massively fail at since we only have <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/time-to-get-a-life-insurance-movement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$350,000<\/a> of life insurance each ;) Though it was initially set up to mainly cover our *mortgages* in the event one of us passed pre-kids, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea to reassess here again&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Although isn&#8217;t the point of financial freedom to be *fully* sufficient without needing outside help unless you wanted it? We&#8217;re far from that point at the moment, but it would be yet another perk if you can start clearing away some insurances since you&#8217;d be able to fund a lot more during your demise ;) And not talking about *health* insurance btw &#8211; ain&#8217;t no way I&#8217;m giving up <em>that<\/em> with our jacked up system here!<\/p>\n<p>Curious though &#8211; how many early retirees out there are still carrying life insurance? Why or why not?<\/p>\n<p>(In other fun news\u00a0 &#8211; I <a href=\"https:\/\/davidperell.substack.com\/p\/monday-musings-52719\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently read<\/a> that they call it &#8220;life&#8221; insurance vs &#8220;death&#8221; insurance because it&#8217;s more appealing to see and better odds of people signing up for it, haha&#8230; Which is probably true, unless you happen to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-im-obsessed-with-cemeteries\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enjoy thinking about death<\/a> like some we know! ;))<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">&#8220;Save one-third of the cost of college.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never thought of the *ratio* when it comes to saving for college (just always gone with the &#8220;save as much as you&#8217;re able to&#8221; route, and we&#8217;ll figure it out later when it gets closer! Haha&#8230;), but probably better to have a more developed game plan in place ;)<\/p>\n<p>Per that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/article\/saving\/T023-C000-S002-financial-rules-of-thumb-to-consider-breaking.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same article<\/a> by Kiplinger:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Under this rule of thumb, you pay for a third of the cost of college from savings, pay a third from current income and financial aid, and borrow a third using a combination of parent and student loans.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Anyone care to share their perspective or strategy with this who&#8217;s in the thick of it all?! Obviously it would be great to have ALL of it taken care of by the time they leave your comfy nest, but we all know it&#8217;s hard enough to stay on top of our <em>other<\/em> massive goals in this Game of Life, so I think if you&#8217;re at least saving *something* towards it you&#8217;re allowed to be semi-proud of yourself&#8230; At least that&#8217;s the rationalization I&#8217;m telling myself ;)<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">&#8220;You\u2019ll need 70% to 80% of your preretirement income to live on when you retire.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Oh boy!!
