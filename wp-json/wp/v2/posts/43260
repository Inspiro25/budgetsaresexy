I had learned to quit &#8220;bored shopping&#8221; after first trying this, and now 7 years later I was curious to see if I could still pull it off and what I&#8217;d learn. Well, we&#8217;re almost exactly half-way through this revived challenge again (that was fast!!!) and so far I&#8217;ve barely even noticed I&#8217;m doing it &#8211; hah. That&#8217;s great and bad at the same time :) Great that it seems I naturally curb myself from unnecessary spending already, but sucky that I&#8217;m not really learning anything new! Though I did slip up those <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/02\/biggest-monthly-expense-game\/\" target=\"_blank\">couple of times<\/a> which made me feel kinda naughty, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>How are you guys doing with it so far btw?
