I heard that Bill Gates is buying up a bunch of rural land and is the biggest farmland owner in the world. Maybe we should be investing in raw land too for long term.

If you buy a piece of raw land today, how much can you sell it for in 10, 20 or 30 years? &#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2640;&#xfe0f; Beats me! Natural appreciation on land value is hard to forecast, especially in rural areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Rental income\/positive cashflow:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019m assuming \u201craw land\u201d means there are no structures or utilities.

(It can be difficult to get a loan for vacant land.) Even if you did take a loan out to buy a block of undeveloped land, without a renter for it, you\u2019re responsible for making the loan payments yourself, so no money is made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Tax benefits\/depreciation:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are various tax advantages to owning an investment property, but most of them are tied directly to maintaining, improving, or depreciating \u201cstructures.\u201d <\/span><b>Land can\u2019t be depreciated<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I guess you could pay someone to go out and do some landscaping and claim it as a maintenance deduction.
