Which I&#8217;ll admit I was pretty partial to when starting out this search ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ll see if this choice proves fruitful,<\/strong> but I&#8217;m hoping to be able to emulate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.howtosavemoney.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">this guy<\/a>&#8216;s words as the future unfolds!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My life completely changed when I got an SUV.

If I didn&#8217;t, Frankencaddy would have never entered my life (do you know how much gas that thing sucked up?), nor would this blog have ever seen the light of day either.<\/p>\n<p>And that would make you look pretty silly right now staring into a blank screen ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So true to other places I spend my money, I ended up putting it towards the car that brings me the most joy vs that which just &#8220;gets the job done.&#8221; Even if it makes me a bad $$$ blogger&#8230;<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of all the cars I&#8217;ve owned over my lifetime actually.

Before my kids get to it at least? ;)<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown of why we chose it:<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It felt damn good to be in!<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s super safe and reliable (Toyota makes them)<\/li>\n<li>My wife LOVED it, which she never does (a car is just a car, right?)<\/li>\n<li>They hold their re-sale value like a champ<\/li>\n<li>They&#8217;re highly rated across the industry<\/li>\n<li>It has relatively low mileage for an &#8217;08 (77,000)<\/li>\n<li>Has only been owned by 1 person<\/li>\n<li>Has the extra space we were looking for, but not so much where it feels like we&#8217;re driving a beast<\/li>\n<li>Has some nice upgrades (heated seats, 6 CD changer, AWD, sunroof)<\/li>\n<li>And most importantly, was shockingly priced within our budget ($15,000-$20,000)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Before taxes, titling and the extended warranty we picked up (*gasp*), it came out to <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$17,998<\/span>. With everything it was <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$21,079.10<\/span>. <\/strong>We ended up putting $2,000 cash down for it, and then financed the remaining $19,079.10 @ 3.45% giving us monthly payments of around $340. Which we plan on paying off wayyyy before the 5 year mark, and possibly within two.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely weird to have debt again, and especially car debt since it&#8217;s been a solid 8 years without it!, but it&#8217;s nothing we haven&#8217;t conquered before and will just motivate us to get rid of it that much faster&#8230; Though I am nervous about running our next <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">net worth report<\/a> :) That Brexit is already rilin&#8217; it up! (How bad do you wish you had a pile of cash to throw at the markets right now?? Everything&#8217;s on sale!!)<\/p>\n<p>We of course didn&#8217;t set out to pick up a luxury car, but after peeking at the Lexus in between test drives we realized that the right year\/mileage combo was actually comparable in price to its non-luxury counterparts. Which were all going for $15,000-$23,000 with 40,000-50,000 miles on them. (We were only interested in used cars)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So it ended up becoming a decision of a newer more practical car with less miles, or a slightly older &#8211; more luxurious &#8211; one with extra miles.<\/strong> And you now know which one we picked ;)<\/p>\n<p>There are some cons to it though, of course:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The gas mileage of the RX350 isn&#8217;t the greatest at 17 \/ 22 (we got the all wheel drive)<\/li>\n<li>Our insurance went up by $30\/mo, though as to be expected when upgrading from a 20 year old no coverage car to an SUV, haha&#8230; Interestingly enough it cost almost the same to insure our Corolla!<\/li>\n<li>The model we picked didn&#8217;t have all the super upgrades as these cars typically do (no navigation, bluetooth, DVD, back-up camera), though it does have leather which I&#8217;m hoping is easier to clean with kids making messes vs cloth?<\/li>\n<li>Because the mileage is higher we didn&#8217;t feel as comfortable without picking up an extended warranty, especially it being a luxury car. That ran us an extra $1,800 which we probably wouldn&#8217;t have gotten with a standard SUV (it&#8217;ll protect all major parts up to 125,000 or 4 years whichever comes first, with a $300 deductible).<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a little TOO shiny for my taste, but gonna have to get used to messes with the kids in &#8217;em!<\/li>\n<li>And lastly, the stereo isn&#8217;t as nice as you&#8217;d think it would be in a car like this&#8230; Though in comparison to having *no* radio like in my last car (it died 6 months ago), I can hardly complain ;) I will say that it was quite nice just listening to your own thoughts while rollin&#8217; around town though! You should try it if you&#8217;re looking for a new experiment!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So some pros, and some cons&#8230;<\/strong> You can find a full professional review of the RX here if interested: <a href=\"https:\/\/cars.usnews.com\/cars-trucks\/lexus\/rx-350\/2008\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/cars.usnews.com\/cars-trucks\/lexus\/rx-350\/2008<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Oh! We also ended up going through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carmax.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Carmax<\/a> which I&#8217;d never tried before!\u00a0 I typically like going through private parties since you can get them cheaper, but with time not being on our side (and not initially knowing what we wanted to get yet) we decided to give Carmax a visit and were pleasantly surprised.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few notes on them, with one major factor to watch out for!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their customer service was incredible<\/li>\n<li>It was AWESOME being able to walk around and not be pressured by salesmen 24\/7! (They all get paid the same whether you pick up a Kia or a Benz)<\/li>\n<li>Their inventory was pretty expansive, especially since you can xfer over cars (for free) from neighboring lots (which is what we ended up doing once we settled on the model we wanted)<\/li>\n<li>Everything is super easy and streamlined!<\/li>\n<li>All cars have to pass a 125+ point quality inspection<\/li>\n<li>They come with free vehicle history and safety recall reports, a 5-day money-back guarantee,<em> and<\/em> a 30-day limited warranty<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s absolutely NO HAGGLING, which could be good or bad depending (see below)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The downside? The cars come with a premium.<\/strong> Worth it to those who don&#8217;t want the added stress in their lives, but you&#8217;ll typically pay on the higher end of the spectrum for them. The trick is watching out for those that are severely overpriced! The first RX we liked was a mind boggling $5,000 over, whereas some of the minivans were $2,000-$3,000 more than you&#8217;d expect. On average though, it seemed the mark up was anywhere from $0-$2,000 on them. So you can def. pay for those perks.<\/p>\n<p>The point: just make sure to do your research before driving one off the lot! We used <a href=\"http:\/\/kbb.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kbb.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/Edmunds.com\" target=\"_blank\">Edmunds.com<\/a>, and then <a href=\"http:\/\/TrueCar.com\" target=\"_blank\">TrueCar.com<\/a> to look them up, and we searched all the nearest lots until we found one that was reasonable. It seemed Carmax followed True Car more than the others too fwiw (I&#8217;d never heard of them before until I noticed USAA partners with them).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, it&#8217;s only been a few days but so far we&#8217;re really enjoying it! And hopefully it&#8217;ll treat us well over the years as we plan on keeping it for the long haul&#8230;<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s that! Two major items down now (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/wont-be-homeless-next-month\/\" target=\"_blank\">home<\/a> and car), with two more left before <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/from-single-income-kids-to-dual-income-kids\/\" target=\"_blank\">the big move<\/a> (childcare and packing). If I didn&#8217;t know we were about to inherit a $50,000 salary next month, I&#8217;d be freaking out a little with all these extra costs, ugh&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how people do it??<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Hope stuff with your life\/wallets are going well!
