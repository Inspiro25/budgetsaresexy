Going to a bachelor party this weekend in Charleston, South Carolina! <\/strong>Nothing like a few days away w\/ the boys to celebrate some awesome falling in love and manly relationships :) I haven&#8217;t been back there either since being a kid on family vacations, and something tells me this will be quite different than those, haha&#8230; but probably not in the same way you&#8217;re thinking right now ;)<\/p>\n<p>First off, I don&#8217;t do strip clubs. Which I know I&#8217;m gonna get $hit for, but the idea of paying tons of money to get teased all night long is just no fun at all to me &#8211; why not go get the *real* thing for free? (*ahem* If I were single, of course). Plus, the fact that it&#8217;s Easter this weekend means I REALLY need to be on my best behavior as it&#8217;s probably not the best time for participating in any of these things anyways. Though on the positive side, I haven&#8217;t eaten junk food in over 6 weeks!\u00a0 Which means my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/02\/lent-season-give-something-up-sweets\/\">Lenten goals<\/a> have been met so far &#8211; woohoo!<\/p>\n<p><strong>But just cuz I won&#8217;t be throwing dollar bills out and making it rain, doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t be splurging money elsewhere.<\/strong> Here&#8217;s a list of the top four things I&#8217;ll be paying for this weekend that seems to keep going UP as we get older and continue these friendly traditions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Alcohol.<\/strong> While I def. can&#8217;t party it up like the true rock star I used to be, I most certainly will be engaging in some fine beer drinking&#8230; And probably the good stuff too considering we&#8217;re all past our Beast days, haha&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Food.<\/strong> Now that we&#8217;re all in our early 30s, this area has also been upgraded on these bro trips of ours :) Half the gang no longer eats at Micky Dees or Taco Hell, so now we tend to do more nicer sit-downs since it&#8217;s morphed into more of a &#8220;bonding time&#8221; than a &#8220;scarfing down&#8221; thing. Which is a lot easier to swallow now that we all have more savings under our belts and can act like adults. &#8211; but I can tell you it was a group divider back in the day when decisions like these were made ;) You can&#8217;t dip out on strip clubs AND dinners, so you&#8217;d have to choose your wallet&#8217;s poison.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hotels.<\/strong> This is probably the one area where we still act like college kids again, haha&#8230; we have no shame in filling up the room with a half-dozen guys or so to save money (and we&#8217;ve gotten more sneakier about it too ;).) Which is great cuz all the other areas have been sucking more of our money out as time goes on! The only thing that sucks with this, of course, is that not only do we all need to share 1 bathroom (and I always get labled the &#8220;girl&#8221; cuz of my mohawk), but then most of us also need to sleep on the floor in this case too&#8230; not a fun thing. Though in recent past it&#8217;s been a unsaid rule that the ones who make it home the latest, have to suck it up and crash on the ground.\u00a0 And usually those are the most drunkest too, and they could care less by that point ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Airfare.<\/strong> This is really the only category that hasn&#8217;t changed much over time, except that I now have more flexibility on when I can leave (which sometimes equates to more money saved) now that I work for myself.\u00a0 But in the grand scheme of things it seems airfare keeps getting more expensive so it&#8217;s not really helping out *as much* as it could.\u00a0 But really it&#8217;s out of your control anyways, unless you want to tack on more days to drive there and back too (when it&#8217;s possible).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>So I&#8217;ll def. be spending a lot more money this weekend than I normally would, but in the end it&#8217;s ALWAYS 100% worth it because it&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/04\/life-experiences-far-outweigh-cost-of\/\">life experiences<\/a> that we&#8217;re using our money for here.<\/strong> Even without the debauchery and crazy antics, you never want to be the one left out and hearing all the stories for years and years to come ;) I&#8217;ve done that once &#8211; 5 years ago &#8211; and to THIS DAY I still wish I would have gone on that adventure!<\/p>\n<p>But you can bet your sweet ass I haven&#8217;t missed a boys weekend since &#8211; which has taken us all over the world from <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/05\/5-things-ill-be-blowing-my-money-on\/\">New Orleans<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/06\/im-baaaaaaaaaaack\/\">Prague<\/a>. Something that money really can&#8217;t buy when it comes to spending time with your friends and family. It&#8217;s the only department I truly have an open budget for because I would MUCH rather go on all these trips and have to cut back somewhere else than the opposite&#8230; even if it made me miss a savings goal at some point (*gasp!*)<\/p>\n<p>What do you guys think about traveling and\/or bachelor parties? Anyone have any crazy stories they&#8217;d like to share with us? ;) <strong>Or how about the difference between your travels now vs. 10 years ago when your lives (and wallets) were much different?<\/strong> How have your priorities changed over time?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m off to start packing up and getting ready for this crazy, but hopefully non-trouble making, weekend, but I&#8217;ll be hopping on and off here to check in when I have no beer in my hand ;) Or better yet, maybe when I DO?! <em><strong>Have a fun and blessed weekend everyone, we&#8217;ll talk soon&#8230;<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Another perk of this bachelor party?\u00a0 Charleston is on the wife and I&#8217;s list to check out for possible moves on day &#8211; so I&#8217;ll be doing some recon work on the side too during our down times&#8230; I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s a WONDERFUL place to live!<\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mighty\/\">wickdani<\/a> &#8211; which I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be mimicking in just a few short hours&#8230;)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OH yeahhhh!
