Specifically, the plan was to sell some physical rental properties and move that cash into more passive investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the mission is now half complete! We\u2019ve sold 2 rental properties so far and have 2 left to go. Woohoo! &#x1f389;&#x1f973;&#x1f38a;&#x1f37e;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sale #1 proceeds &#8211;&gt; about $35k<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sale #2 proceeds &#8211;&gt; about $50k<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These properties were joint partnerships with other investors, so the $$ proceeds represent me and my wife\u2019s cut of the deal.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been getting a bunch of questions about the sales and learning stuff along the way, so figured I\u2019d share some of these in an update post. Here you go!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Recap: Why we\u2019re selling rentals&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, here\u2019s why we want to sell (or you can check out the original post here for full info: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-im-transitioning-away-from-rental-properties\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why we\u2019re transitioning away from rental properties<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Main reasons are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I don\u2019t find it fun anymore.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I know, I sound like a complain-y spoilt brat. But my new goal in life is to slowly shed the activities I don\u2019t enjoy \u2192 to make more room for the stuff I DO enjoy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>My asset allocation is out of whack.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We\u2019re trying to downsize the real estate portion of our portfolio and increase our exposure to stocks.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>It\u2019s not \u201cpassive\u201d enough. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, this is probably my fault\u2026 I bought run-down shit box rentals that need constant maintenance. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some real estate is passive<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but the physical properties I\u2019m selling are not.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Some of my properties are sub-performers.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think we can make a better return on our money elsewhere in the long run.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Owning 20+ doors is emotionally draining.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You\u2019d think that the more properties you own, the thicker your skin grows\u2026 I\u2019m somehow doing the opposite. My skin is getting thinner, probably because I am a wimp.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I don\u2019t like holding so much cash reserves.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/lowering-my-emergency-fund-to-0-00\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thoughts on holding cash<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are changing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>We can always buy more (or other types of) real estate later.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We are not anti real estate! We just want to downsize our *physical* RE assets. We can still invest in other types of RE later, for example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-syndication-example\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">syndication deals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, now let\u2019s get to some questions I\u2019m receiving, and some of the stuff I\u2019ve learnt through the sale process\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Where I\u2019m investing the sale proceeds &#8212;&gt; VTI<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, we\u2019ve just been dumping all the money into stock market index funds. In March we bought $35k of VTI, then again in June we bought another $50k of VTI after the second property sale. Our plan is to continue this with the next 2 properties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I must admit it\u2019s kind of scary putting money in the stock market while it\u2019s at an \u201call time high\u201d and so volatile! But, I\u2019m practicing what I preach: You can\u2019t time the market! And investing at all time highs usually has a better outcome than waiting for a big dip to buy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in the stock market solves a few problems for us\u2026 First, it helps shift our asset allocation out of real estate and into more equities. Next, it fits in with our long term goal to have more passive investments. The money that we invest we never have to touch or really even think about, ever again!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Selling during a \u201chot real estate market\u201d\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been hearing this a lot lately&#8230; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNow is a great time to sell real estate! People are making ridiculous offers to buy property, way over asking price!\u201d.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While yes this is probably true &#8212; it\u2019s a sellers market right now &#8212; it\u2019s important to understand the difference between <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">residential home sales<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the buyer wants to live in the place, driven by needs and emotion) vs. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">income rental properties<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the buyer is an investor, motivated by ROI calculations).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the properties I\u2019m selling are fourplexes (4 units all under 1 roof), the buyers interested in my props are mostly other real estate investors. They value the property based on the rental income it can generate from the 4 units (or 3 units if they want to move into 1 of them). While inexperienced or impatient investors might be willing to overpay a little for rental properties, most well-studied real estate investors won\u2019t pay ridiculous prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the best way I can boost my property sale values is to raise the rents for all the tenants within the units. This is much easier said than done! My property manager was able to do a little bit of this over the years, but not as much as what we hoped or initially projected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, I just wanted to explain why we\u2019re not making as much profit as people <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">think we\u2019re making<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Not all real estate is equal! This current \u201chot market\u201d gave us more interested potential buyers and a slightly shorter sales cycle, but not necessarily a huge increase in sale prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Selling the properties as a \u201cbundle\u201d&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple of people asked why we didn\u2019t just package all 4 properties into a bundle and sell them as a group. This would\u2019ve been the quickest way to get rid of them all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there were a couple challenges with bundle selling\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, we didn\u2019t know how many properties (or which ones) we even wanted to sell first. When there are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/investing-with-family\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple investors involved<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making decisions takes a long time because every person has a different opinion. So at the beginning of the year, we really only agreed on selling 1 property to start with. Then the plan evolved from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, we realized that bundling our properties for sale isn\u2019t really in our best interest <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financially<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The type of people who buy packages of investment properties are more experienced investors (we prefer beginners that don\u2019t negotiate as hard) and also they are looking for a bundle discount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we\u2019re not in a rush to sell, there\u2019s no reason to give buyers a bundle price discount when we can sell the properties one by one for the best price we can get individually.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Boring Tax Stuff&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some questions I got about taxes and how that might look this year for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cHave you thought about doing a 1031 Tax Exchange to defer capital gains?\u201d<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212;&#8211;&gt;\u00a0 No, not really. Our goal is to get away from physical properties, not get into new ones. I have heard of some groups that allow 1031 exchanges into syndications, but since I\u2019m transferring from joint ownership, I\u2019m not sure how this would work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, given our probable tax bracket this year, my wife and I might be able to avoid <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> capital gains altogether. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(My partners might be in a different situation, but my wife and I will have pretty low income this year, so locking in small cap gains is OK with us).<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to set some money aside for depreciation recapture\u201d<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212;&#8211;&gt; Absolutely! My partners and I have a reserve account with money set aside for estimated taxes. Since our gains weren\u2019t too big and we only owned the places for 3-4 years, we don\u2019t have a too hefty bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(For those of you who don\u2019t know what depreciation recapture is\u2026 When you sell a property that has provided you depreciation benefits or tax offsets in the past, the IRS will recapture that benefit by charging you for gains made when you sell. The only way to avoid\/defer depreciation recapture tax is to a) do a 1031 exchange or b) sell the property at a lower value than you bought it minus depreciation &#8211; neither of which make sense to us.)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cWho pays the taxes for joint partnerships?\u201d <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8212;&#8211;&gt; For the properties that are in LLC\u2019s, the LLC entity itself files it\u2019s own tax return and \u201cpasses through\u201d the tax liability to the members of the LLC through a K1 statement. All the LLC members file this K1 statement with their personal return. This splits the tax responsibilities fairly between the LLC members in proportion to their ownership percentage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For properties that are in joint personal names, each person just claims their split percentage of the property on their personal return.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example (in either scenario) If you own 50% of a property, you report 50% of the income, claim 50% of the deductions, get 50% of the tax benefits, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Setbacks, mistakes, and dirty dealings&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One setback we had on the first sale was a small water heater leak we noticed 1 week before closing. A repair man was at our property fixing an unrelated issue when he noticed a little bit of water in the drip-pan of a water heater. Being a good repair man, he reported this issue to my property manager and said we might want to get it checked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since there was no <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> problem (yet), we could have just proceeded with the sale and turned the keys over to the new owner and made him fix the issue when he took ownership. But, that would be unethical (and probably illegal) because as a seller we are bound to disclose any known issue with the property to the buyer prior to taking ownership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we fully diagnosed and fixed the issue, which cost us ~$1000 out of pocket for a new water heater. It sucks to buy brand new appliances for another investor, but I couldn\u2019t in good conscience hand over known potential faults. I never want to compromise my values for money &#8211; it\u2019s not worth it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of unethical dealings, we had a strange transaction with a realtor that I didn\u2019t feel was 100% above board. Long story short, we were in negotiations with a potential buyer that fell through\u2026 and somewhere within our negotiations we exposed our \u201crock bottom\u201d price that we would sell for. After the deal fell apart, we immediately received a different offer from that buyer\u2019s own broker! (not their specific agent, another realtor in their office). It was for the exact same ending negotiation price we were settled on with their client just days earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason I felt this was unethical is because I don\u2019t think agents are allowed to share confidential negotiation details with other agents and use it for personal offers. It really put a bad taste in my mouth. After I raised a red flag, the broker denied doing anything unethical, and that offer fell apart shortly afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, this event (and a few other small things in the selling process) reminded me that real estate has many grey areas, and there\u2019s a lot of room for greedy individuals to take advantage during the buying\/selling process. It\u2019s sad that this happens, but all I can do at the end of the day is to continue doing business the most ethical and responsible way I know how.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, one last shitty thing that happened (and this was my mistake) was that I promised one of the buyers some repairs as part of our contract negotiations&#8230; And I grossly underestimated the repairs costs. This ended up costing my partnership about $2700 extra, which I feel horrible about. Thankfully, we still made some great profits on the deal and all was forgiven in the end. My main lesson here is to never promise paying for repairs based on someone\u2019s word &#8211; always get written quotes and second opinions for <\/span><b>everything<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before agreeing to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Windfalls and bullets dodged\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One cool thing that happened during the first sale process was an unexpected insurance claim. The buyer asked us to get a new roof as part of the sale contract, and we agreed, building that into part of our planned costs (It was about $6000).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But just before we got the roof replaced, someone suggested I file an insurance claim because there was a hail storm recently that might have done some damage to the roof. If there was evidence of any hail damage, we might be able to get insurance to pay some of the replacement cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We didn\u2019t know if the claim would get approved, but there was no harm filing one anyway since the property was being sold. It took less than 1 week to file the claim and get an adjuster out there, and lo and behold they found some damage that was covered under our policy. So all in all we only paid about $3k for the roof replacement instead of $6k. A nice unexpected profit!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One other dodged bullet was some tenant issues that happened *after* the sale of a property\u2026\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My property manager caught wind of some tenant problems (missing rent, bad behavior, etc) a few weeks after the sale of a property. Since the new owner inherited our existing tenants (willingly!), this was now their problem to deal with. If we had never sold the place we\u2019d be dealing with that mess now, which sounds like a real headache.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>All in all, our long term plan is working out&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, we\u2019ve gotten rid of 2 properties, and I can\u2019t tell you the weight that\u2019s been lifted off of my shoulders. My partners and property manager feel the same!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since moving the sale proceeds to index funds, we\u2019ve had zero headaches, and even some great gains so far!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next step is to sell 2 more buildings we\u2019ve mostly agreed to list. I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated as we go along!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Got any questions I didn\u2019t address?
