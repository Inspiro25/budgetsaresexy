Here&#8217;s the rest of it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I read an article recently that I really appreciated and thought you might like it too. \u00a0It is actually focused on housekeeping issues, but it starts out with a story about people&#8217;s perceptions about personal finance, and then the steps she suggests for getting better at managing everyday home maintenance are really applicable to PF too.<\/p>\n<p>It was a good wake up call for me: 1) I shouldn&#8217;t look down on people who aren&#8217;t great at managing their $ just because (I think) I am, 2) maybe it&#8217;s not such a moral failing to not be good at keeping my floors clean! \u00a0Maybe a non-saver will never have as much in their 401k as they should, and maybe I will never have a spotless kitchen, but we can all make improvements! \u00a0:-)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>I thought this was great because whether we want to believe it or not, we DO judge others based on how we think they are with money.<\/strong>\u00a0 I try really REALLY hard not to, but it&#8217;s tough to stop the first impressions from hitting your brain when they&#8217;re completely out of your control ;) So instead I try and wipe them out after I think of them and try concentrating on something more productive. Like, as our reader mentions above, something that they probably ARE good at instead.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take my friend, Tom, for example. He doesn&#8217;t <em>ever<\/em> invest into his 401(k) plan but the crazy part is that he teaches people they should invest in their 401(ks) AS A JOB!! Like, that&#8217;s what he does 40 hours a week!!\u00a0 I cringe every time I think of that, haha&#8230; But the guy is AMAZING with other parts of his life instead. Like, with being almost obsessive about time management and working out. Never have I met someone who works so well on a schedule and can get so many things done, and on time.<\/p>\n<p>Another example &#8211; my friend Angel (not his real name, but I&#8217;ve always liked it for a guy :)). Angel has never saved a penny of his earnings in the 8+ years since I&#8217;ve known him. There&#8217;s always a new BMW he wants, or a club he has to attend, or the latest electronic gizmo that&#8217;s about to change his life. Despite my constant hints that he needs to start saving at *some* point here, it goes through one ear and out the next. Because according to him &#8220;life&#8217;s short so you should enjoy it before you die.&#8221; True indeed, but WHAT IF YOU LIVE UNTIL 100??? ;) I&#8217;ve tried being better at this and just letting him do his thing without being a nagging friend, but it&#8217;s often times hard. The guy is incredible at cooking and always being there for you as a friend though. I&#8217;ve never met someone so willing to go out of their way to help another person in my life. Great with relationships, sucky with money!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So it&#8217;s definitely true what our reader mentions above &#8211; we&#8217;re all good at *something* and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean with money.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This also got me thinking of other *judgements* I come into generally during life too. Reactions to things like fancy cars, houses, jobs, etc. In fact, here &#8211; I&#8217;ll list some of them out along with my initial feelings, then add the justifications I usually think shortly after to give people the benefit of the doubt ;)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fancy cars<\/strong> -&#8220;SEXY! I want that!!!&#8230; If only I had the balls to pony up the cash like <em>that<\/em> dude did.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fancy home &#8211;<\/strong> &#8220;Yuck. Just the *idea* of having to manage that thing would stress me out&#8230; I hope that person has a BIG family!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fancy clothes<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;Love it! Not going to lie. I can appreciate a well-dressed woman, or even man for that matter&#8230; They must need to do that for their job.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fancy jewelry<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;The blinger the better! But I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between a fake diamond and a cubic zirconia, so it doesn&#8217;t impress me much (and this from a guy who paid hundreds of dollars for the earring currently in his ear!)&#8230; They probably got it as a gift.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fancy job<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;Good for them!&#8230; It takes a lot of hard work and focus to pull off becoming a high-paying lawyer, doctor, real estate mogul, etc, so I respect a gig like that&#8230;&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fancy electronics<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;Meh. Waste of money&#8230; Hopefully they play with &#8217;em all the time and thoroughly enjoy them!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fancy food<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;Double meh&#8230; they&#8217;re probably out celebrating a special event.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on and so forth. I bet we come across half these items every single day actually. And again, they&#8217;re all judgements &#8211; just mainly on *things* this time over *people*, though of course it always comes back to them in the end too\u00a0 (thus my rationalization after feeling each of those ways ;)). I doubt I&#8217;m ever right 90% of the time, but a financial guy&#8217;s gotta hope for the best, right? And regardless, none of it really matters in the end anyways since it doesn&#8217;t affect US personally.(Though it IS good that we know ourselves well!)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, I&#8217;m rambling&#8230; <strong>The takeaway today &#8211; especially after celebrating the day of &#8220;thanks&#8221; giving! &#8211; is to keep an eye on those judgements and try to redirect your focus on the positive when possible.<\/strong> Especially those that directly concern you and your family\/lifestyle\/money. That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s important in our lives &#8211; all the rest is just noise.<\/p>\n<p>Now have a happy rest of your holiday weekend, and tell your family Uncle J$ says hi! :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mcmonahan\/\">maura_monahan<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>That was the title of an email I got recently from a reader who thought I&#8217;d enjoy this post over on Houzz.com on how to&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-often-do-you-judge-people-based-money\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[5],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-36671","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-life"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How often do you judge people based on their money? | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-often-do-you-judge-people-based-money\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How often do you judge people based on their money? | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"That was the title of an email I got recently from a reader who thought I&#8217;d enjoy this post over on Houzz.com on how to...
