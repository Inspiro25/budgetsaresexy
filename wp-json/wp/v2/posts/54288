Money alter-ego&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><b>#1) WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST DO, MAN???<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I sold Rockstar Finance to a friend of mine in an attempt to trade my hustle card in for more of a <i>living<\/i> card.<\/p>\n<p><b>#2) When did this all go down??<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We signed everything last week, but we\u2019re making it all public this morning which has been many months in the making. Pretty much since that fateful day of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-triad-of-hustling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hike<\/a>&#8221; when I realized I had my priorities all kinds of backwards and knew I had to make some big moves if I truly wanted some big results.<\/p>\n<p>I had considered handing it off a number of other times throughout it&#8217;s 4 year existence too, but I loved it too much and each time I just couldn&#8217;t pull the trigger as it never felt right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3) What other times are you talking about?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2015 I was handling every aspect of the site and almost sold the whole thing for $5,000 because I was close to burning out. Fortunately my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/caitflanders.com\/start-here\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cait Flanders <\/a>stepped in and convinced me to keep going, and with her on my side that is exactly what we did :)<\/p>\n<p>Then in 2016 I got the &#8220;deal of a lifetime&#8221; where I originally accepted <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/million-dollar-blog-deal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a million dollars<\/a> for all my projects and a 2 year commitment to blog for someone else, which as you know I ended up dipping out of at the last minute and decided to go ALL IN with my own projects instead.<\/p>\n<p>And this is what we did for all of 2017! We launched every single project I had wanted to do over the years, and we added it all to Rockstar Finance so it would have a much farther reach to people (and not attached to &#8220;me&#8221; specifically). This is when we launched our personal finance and blogging <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.rockstarfinance.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forums<\/a>, our\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Directory<\/a> that now tracks 1,400 other finance blogs as well as the most popular <a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\/personal-finance-podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcasts<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\/personal-finance-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apps<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\/personal-finance-books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">books<\/a>, and then of course we rocked <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/community-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our Community Fund<\/a> which ended up giving out over $14,000 of assistance to those who needed it in our community.<\/p>\n<p>We were on fire!!! Until I almost had a break down &#8211; again ;)<\/p>\n<p><b>#4) And this time you truly feel it&#8217;s &#8220;right&#8221;?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I do, yes&#8230;as close as 100% as you can get, at least.<\/p>\n<p><b>#5) What would make it even *more* right?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If I knew no one would hate me for making this move!! :) Or I got like triple the money for it, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><b>#6) Speaking of money, how much exactly did you get for it?<br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In the (very) low 6 figures.<\/p>\n<p><b>#7) I said <em>Exact<\/em>, don&#8217;t you play that card!<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Hey &#8211; you know how these contract things go! But I bet if you pay attention enough to the numbers in our next <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">net worth<\/a> report you can get a pretty good idea :) Though don\u2019t forget about the taxes or paying out some of my team members too which was important to me&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><b>#8) How much tax will you have to pay from it?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>About 25%.<\/p>\n<p><b>#9) And the % you gave to your team members?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>20%&#8230; wait a minute!! I see what you\u2019re doing there!<\/p>\n<p><b>*Takes a bow* <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>#10) <\/b><b>Alright, now why was THIS TIME the right time to sell again?<br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a handful of reasons, that when combined just made the most sense:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m having a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/when-you-find-out-youre-having-another-baby\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3rd baby<\/a> in a few months and really want to try being a stay-at-home dad<\/li>\n<li>But to do that I had to figure out how best to cut 50% of my time and responsibilities out, meaning one of my <em>internet<\/em> babies had to go :( And I just couldn&#8217;t give up the one site that started it all for me &#8211; Budgets Are Sexy! My first love! (And I also didn&#8217;t like the idea of just hiring on a new leader or team for Rockstar, because in my experience if you don&#8217;t have ownership of something you don&#8217;t give it all you&#8217;ve got)<\/li>\n<li>I also felt I took Rockstar Finance as far as I could with my energy and talents, and it was about to go into &#8220;maintenance&#8221; mode which would have done it a big disservice for people. Especially due to all its potential that we never got to tap. So handing it off to a new leader to continue its legacy just made the most sense to me.<\/li>\n<li>Lastly, and this is going to sound silly, but I REALLY want to enjoy the site and all the resources we put together as a &#8220;regular&#8221; reader without having to do any work for it! Haha&#8230; I built it exactly for us personal finance enthusiasts, but I&#8217;ve never been able to stop and enjoy it as I&#8217;ve always been in the thick of it during its entire lifetime&#8230; I&#8217;m so excited to get the daily digest tomorrow and <em>not<\/em> know what&#8217;s in it! :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>#11) I&#8217;m glad you mentioned this &#8220;new leadership&#8221;&#8230; Who exactly bought it from you and is taking over the site now?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>My good friend, and blogger veteran,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John from ESIMoney.com<\/a>. Someone who&#8217;s not only been with this community longer than I have going on 12+ years now (!), but also someone I know is &#8220;in it for the right reasons&#8221; and not going to add it to the infamous Site Selling Wall of Shame, haha&#8230; Which let&#8217;s face it, most sites go when new owners take over!<\/p>\n<p><b>#12) And how do you know this &#8220;John&#8221; character won&#8217;t be adding it to this Wall of Shame?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Because I know him and trust him, and I know on a list of his priorities, money is at the bottom of it as an early retiree with plenty of millions in the bank already :) Which is usually why sites go down in flames with new ownership &#8211; they just plaster it all with ads!!<\/p>\n<p>And due to this new found &#8220;retirement&#8221;, it also means he has plenty of time to dedicate to it and is already working on a number of new features I was never able to pull off myself. It&#8217;s pretty much going to be a turbocharged version of how it is today, and at worst it&#8217;ll be the <em>same<\/em> as it is today if nothing pans out, which is a pretty good worst case scenario.<\/p>\n<p>So between all that, and the fact he wants to pass this site down to his kids one day to continue its legacy, it&#8217;s the best a creator can really ask for :)<\/p>\n<p>He actually has a post live right now too if you want to hear his side of the story &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be a fun project to work on together! <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/bought-rockstar-finance\/\">Why I Bought Rockstar Finance<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>#13) Wait wait wait, what&#8217;s this &#8220;together&#8221; part here? I thought you just sold it and are moving on?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Nope. I sold it, yes, but I&#8217;m still helping out with everything, just more in an &#8220;advisory&#8221; type role than a day-to-day one. Which pretty much means I get to do all the fun parts like brainstorming and scheming and connecting the dots, only I don&#8217;t have to do any of the work in actually making it happen :) I&#8217;m actually quite impressed with myself in pulling this off! Haha\u2026 And as a minimalist, it&#8217;s actually a pretty freeing feeling because &#8220;stuff&#8221; applies to internet and brain assets too!!<\/p>\n<p>But ask me in 6 months how it&#8217;s all going and we&#8217;ll know more then ;)<\/p>\n<p><b>#14) How do you think it&#8217;ll be in 6 months?<br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m *hoping* that I&#8217;ll be much more relaxed and creative and our blog here will be flourishing even more at Budgets Are Sexy &#8211; since this is literally the first time in 8 years it&#8217;ll be the only project I&#8217;m working on! &#8211; and that I&#8217;m also hitting inbox zero every single day and have a baby who sleeps 12 hours straight a night, but only time will tell ;)<\/p>\n<p>I can tell you out of every move I&#8217;ve ever made with work-stuff though, this one sets me up closer to the &#8220;ideal lifestyle&#8221; than any others&#8230; I&#8217;m literally getting paid to do half the work!! And I still get to be a big part of a community I helped create!<\/p>\n<p><b>#15) Okay, we&#8217;ll come back in 6 months and see how it&#8217;s really going :)\u00a0 Getting back to the projects of Rockstar Finance again real quick, what about that Community Event you guys just launched where you gave 20+ bloggers $100 in cash to go out and do something helpful with it? Is that still going on or has something changed with it now?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Nothing&#8217;s changed! We&#8217;ve <a href=\"https:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/community-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set up a page<\/a> that highlights all the results from our Community Fund over the past 12 months, and we&#8217;ll be adding all these new blog posts that people will be sharing to the tippy top of it all. And we&#8217;re hoping it moves us from $14,000 of Good to almost $20,000 of Good! A great way to go out with a bang this year!<\/p>\n<p>(I will note, however, that we <i>are <\/i>phasing out the Community Fund for the 2018 year as far as being attached to Rockstar Finance (I&#8217;ll probably keep doing The Good behind the scenes and\/or move some of the project here to this blog), but as a big philanthropy guy, John is already coming up with his own replacement project which I have no doubt will be doing some great stuff\u2026 Back at one of his original sites, he used to give out \u00bd of his earned profit every month so I know his heart is just as big as ours, if not bigger.

What did that process look like?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Once I knew it was time for me to leave, I hit up about 6 or 7 people in the community that I thought could be a good fit for it, and then I just had a butt ton of interviews and questions and spent the better part of 4 months really marinating on everything until John\u2019s name eventually crept to the top. It was probably one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve ever had to do since being on the online world, but again &#8211; big dreams require big moves!<\/p>\n<p><b>SQ #5. And where did your now famous <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-triad-of-hustling\/\"><b>Triad of Hustling<\/b><\/a><b> come into play with all of this?<br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It was instrumental! Not in finding a new leader, but in getting me to the point where I realized what I had to do&#8230; Here&#8217;s the quick version of the Triad being applied towards Rockstar since I know you&#8217;re trying to make this a speed round ;)<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Did it take up a lot of <strong>time<\/strong>? Yup. 3-4 hours a day, if you count all the thinking too<\/li>\n<li>Did it make <strong>money<\/strong>? Enough to pay the team and a little left over, but not much. Though it was also not built originally to make money either &#8211; I had no idea it would grow to as large as it did!<\/li>\n<li>Was it <strong>fun<\/strong>? Yes. Most days at least :) But again, to pass the Triad it needs to hit 2 of the 3 areas&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Equalizer<\/strong>: Was it a HELL YEAH or a \u201cno\u201d? Well, the first few years it was close to a HELL YEAH, but over the past 6 months it turned into more of a Kinda Hell Yeah, which we all know it means some changes need to happen&#8230; And this is when the soul searching began.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You know, thinking about the Triad in terms of Rockstar I&#8217;m realizing that there&#8217;s one major factor that we haven&#8217;t even touched on: <em><strong>whether a project is successful or not.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Shutting down something that fails the Triad and is not successful anyways is one thing, but it&#8217;s a whole other when it IS successful yet still doesn&#8217;t make you happy in the end. Similar to the other years dilemma with me <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/good-vs-bad-reasons-to-quit-something\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">walking away from the podcast, M.O.N.E.Y. <\/a>&#8211; remember that one?<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s also something for everyone here to be aware of, especially the entrepreneurs &#8211; just because your project is successful, however that may be defined, it still doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should be continuing it if in your hearts of hearts you know it&#8217;s not bringing you joy. I&#8217;ve shut down over two dozen projects or ideas over my 10 years in this game, but the only two I struggled with were the two that were booming on the outside!
