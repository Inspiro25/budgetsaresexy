All you renters out there, listen up!<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (and Landlords, please pay attention too because negotiation goes both ways and renting should be a win\/win sitch!]<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*******<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Justin! Welcome to the blog and thanks for sharing your secrets! First off, I\u2019m curious why there are so many hidden tips given that renting is such a common thing. Why don\u2019t renters know this stuff already?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hey Joel!\u00a0 Happy to be here.\u00a0 I was baffled by this question early on as well.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the conversations we have about rent tend to focus more on complaints than solutions.\u00a0 But on top of that, as we approach adulthood there are typically no classes on financial education in general, let alone specific classes on controlling rent which is almost every young adult\u2019s number one expense.\u00a0 And to make matters even worse there weren\u2019t any books on the subject until I wrote Rental Secrets.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This leaves young adults learning by trial and error, which is among the worst ways to learn.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost as if the goal was to set them up to fail.\u00a0 Clearly, learning from the prior experiences of others would be a much better way to go.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, there\u2019s another reason as well.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been conditioned to have a consumer mentality.\u00a0 We walk into a store and see an item we want on a shelf.\u00a0 There\u2019s a price on the shelf.\u00a0 We pick up the item, walk to the cashier, pay the price, and leave.\u00a0 Never once did it occur to us to negotiate with the cashier or their manager.\u00a0 And the vast majority of people apply this same mentality to renting.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you also *own* rental properties\u2026 So why would a landlord share rental secrets? It\u2019s your job as a landlord to suck every cent out of your tenants as possible, right? &#x1f609;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, I own and operate rental properties and I also wrote Rental Secrets.\u00a0 This is not as contradictory as it may seem at first.\u00a0 There\u2019s an unhealthy conflict between renters and landlords.\u00a0 This conflict results in renters damaging property or allowing it to be damaged.\u00a0 It leads to landlords not caring about renters.\u00a0 It also leads to poor government policy decisions that ultimately serve renters or landlords.\u00a0 I believe renters feel this way because they believe they have no power in the landlord-renter relationship. Rental Secrets is an attempt to correct that misconception and highlight just how valuable the renter is in the landlord-renter relationship.\u00a0 Renters will never put hammer to nail to build their own homes.\u00a0 And landlords choose to invest in badly needed quality housing for their retirement, so renters are living in the landlord\u2019s retirement plan. When you look at it from this perspective, the importance of this relationship becomes much more clear.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your second question goes directly to the heart of the animosity between landlords and renters.\u00a0 It\u2019s a common misconception that it is a landlord\u2019s job to squeeze every last dime from their renters.\u00a0 And it doesn\u2019t help that some landlords do attempt to do this despite the fact that it isn\u2019t in their long-term interest.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, the landlord\u2019s job is the <\/span><\/i><b><i>proper stewardship and maintenance of the properties they are responsible for<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 There are several factors to doing this well, and yes collecting rent is part of that job.\u00a0 Rent pays for maintenance, upgrades, salaries, mortgages, and other expenses related to keeping the property functioning properly. Those landlords who don\u2019t maintain their properties are asking for trouble down the road as this is a fundamental betrayal of the trust their renters place in them.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, Robert Kiyosaki tells this great story about the first investment property his wife bought.\u00a0 She\u2019d just invested in the property the year prior, felt it was time to increase her rents, and typed up a letter to her tenants.\u00a0 Her goal was to increase the rent by a whopping $25.\u00a0 She sent the letters and the renters promptly moved out.\u00a0 The property stayed vacant for three months and the rent was approximately $400 at the time.\u00a0 So in an effort to gain $25 more per month she lost $1200 in rent.\u00a0 In addition to losing that rent, there were cleaning, repair, carpet cleaning, and painting expenses to prepare for new renters.\u00a0 And let\u2019s not forget the cost of locating those new renters. The point being that getting top dollar might be nice, but <\/span><\/i><b><i>continuity of cash flow is what\u2019s most important when it comes to proper real estate stewardship.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third, there\u2019s a conversation I had with one of my clients last year that relates to your question.\u00a0 He owns a property management company in the San Francisco Bay Area.\u00a0 I asked him about how the eviction moratorium had affected his clients.\u00a0 His response was very interesting.\u00a0 He said those landlords who had cared for their properties over time and had bothered to maintain great relationships with their renters by and large fared quite well.\u00a0 Those who cut corners and didn\u2019t bother to maintain renter relationships or their properties bore the brunt of the payment headaches.\u00a0 Moreover, those landlords would also be left to the tender mercy of whatever payment assistance the government offered because his company would not be helping them go after their renters legally.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, renters have economic hiccups occur all the time.\u00a0 Sometimes they lose their jobs.\u00a0 Sometimes their cars breakdown.\u00a0 There are always unexpected expenses that pop up.\u00a0 As a landlord, if your goal is to squeeze every last dime out of your residents, you are setting yourself up for higher vacancy rates and increased interruptions in your rental cash flow because there won&#8217;t be any financial cushion for these common economic challenges.\u00a0 So squeezing every last dime from your renters doesn\u2019t really help the landlord in their true job which is proper stewardship of their property.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Give us your top 3 bits of advice that all renters should know\u2026<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and most important bit of advice is that rent negotiation is possible.\u00a0 Landlords are people with problems but, if you know how to speak their language and know what the problems are, you can help solve them.\u00a0 And people who solve problems get paid.\u00a0 In this case, paid in the form of lower rent.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, summer is the most popular time for people to rent.\u00a0 Students are graduating from school and parents are getting situated before the next school year starts.\u00a0 Landlords know this happens every year, so their asking rents are higher in the summer.\u00a0 But, apartments still become vacant in late fall and winter.\u00a0 If you rent during that time of year, you could save up to 7% on your monthly rent.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third, apartment community amenities are only great if you actually use them. Every amenity in an apartment community has a corresponding surcharge added to the rent for each apartment in that community.\u00a0 The amount of that charge depends on the total cost of the amenity, the proximity of the apartment to the amenity, and the level of convenience that amenity adds. So only choose apartment communities that have amenities you will actually use, because you\u2019ll be paying for those amenities whether you use them or not.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Many landlords ask for a rent increase every single year. It\u2019s ridiculous sometimes! How can a tenant slow down these rent increases?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you left high school or college and entered the world of renting residential real estate, there were no classes providing any guidance on the language landlords use.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a key phrase that relates to your question. \u201cOur rents are competitive with the market\u201d.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It sounds really nice, right. They\u2019ve done all the work for you.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need to lift a finger.\u00a0 And you can\u2019t get a better deal.\u00a0 But, unfortunately it\u2019s a lie.\u00a0 What they do is compare themselves to properties nearby, within a mile or two.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a lie because they didn\u2019t do the research.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lie because their research has nothing to do with you or your situation.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know anything about you or what you need.\u00a0 They assume the properties close by are their competition.\u00a0 But, their competition is really any property that fits your needs whether it\u2019s close by or not.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can slow these rent increases down by showing them who their competition truly is.\u00a0 You may have chosen their apartment community because it\u2019s 30 minutes east of your job.\u00a0 But, there may be really great options 30 minutes west of your job.\u00a0 These other options aren\u2019t considered in their pricing analysis to determine your renewal offer.\u00a0 So the trick here is to use market data to counter their renewal offer because you have options.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Got any tips for people that aren\u2019t great at negotiation?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When renting an apartment it can feel like the landlord has all the power.\u00a0 As if they were the \u201cGreat and Powerful Oz\u201d.\u00a0 But, it\u2019s important to remember that landlords are people too, with challenges and problems.\u00a0 So the first tip is to remember the landlord is a person just like you.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People think they aren\u2019t good at negotiation because they don\u2019t know how.\u00a0 Negotiation is just a conversation between two parties who each have something the other wants. But the key is knowing what\u2019s important to the other party. That\u2019s where my book, Rental Secrets, comes in.\u00a0 It gives you a window into the landlord\u2019s head and allows you to negotiate with the landlord in their language.\u00a0 So, the second tip is knowing what\u2019s important to who you\u2019re negotiating with, in this case the landlord.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, just remember that if you are working, have a decent credit score, and know how to play well with others then you are exactly the kind of renter that landlords vigorously compete for every day. You are bringing something very valuable to the table and it\u2019s not just about the money.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Your books says something about \u201cFREE RENT\u201d. How is this even possible? &#x1f92f;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free rent may sound like a fairy tale, but it happens all the time across the country.\u00a0 And it might surprise you to learn that Rental Secrets describes not one, but two ways to get it.\u00a0 The most common way is that free rent is used as a marketing tactic.\u00a0 Landlords are in serious competition for you, the quality renter.\u00a0 The person who has a decent job, a good credit score, and knows how to play well with others.\u00a0 And nothing says \u201cPlease tour my apartment community\u201d like an offer of free rent. In this case, the free rent offer will last for a specific number of weeks.\u00a0 I\u2019ve actually seen some communities offer up to 6 weeks of free rent.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second way you can get free rent often never occurs to people because they think of the landlord as their enemy. But changing this perspective can reveal an amazingly powerful opportunity to get free rent.\u00a0 And that strategy is to work for the landlord. Yes, you can obtain free rent by working for your landlord.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And what makes this strategy so powerful is it typically has the same time requirements as a part-time job or side gig.\u00a0 Some US states require property owners to provide residents with an on-site employee. While specific laws will vary, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t use these laws to your advantage. And even without such laws, the landlord still benefits from having a representative live on site.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this role, you\u2019d be responsible for keeping the property clean, being the first point of contact for your neighbors, letting vendors in, and showing apartments when necessary.\u00a0 When you consider that rents are as high as $2600 per month or more, you can see how this can be an amazing side gig.\u00a0 But, it gets even better.\u00a0 This free rent is an after-tax benefit because if you were actually paying that rent, you\u2019d be using after tax dollars.\u00a0 In my book, Rental Secrets, I tell the story of one young man who took advantage of the strategy and he had absolutely no prior experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[**Note from Joel &#8212; there\u2019s also the method of <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coachcarson.com\/house-hacking-guide\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">house hacking<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! It\u2019s when you buy a small multi-family house (like a duplex or tri-plex), live in one of the units and rent the others out. In the right scenario, the other renters could potentially cover all your property expenses so you are living for free.**]<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>The market in my area is just SO HOT right now. How can I find more affordable options?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every apartment is different. Even those in the same apartment community have differences.\u00a0 Some of these apartments are less desirable than others just because of where they are on the property.\u00a0 The apartment might face a busy street.\u00a0 It might have a poor view.\u00a0 It might be on the third floor with no elevator.\u00a0 It might not come with enough parking.\u00a0 But whatever the reason apartments can and do sit vacant even in hot markets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This actually happened to me. \u00a0 It took two months to rent an apartment in one of the hottest rental markets in the country &#8211; Mountain View, CA.\u00a0 We had lots of people tour the apartment but no one ever rented.\u00a0 I asked my leasing agent what was going on.\u00a0 He said they\u2019d get to the master bedroom door, turn around and leave.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem was the view from the master bedroom\u2019s window which you could see from the bedroom door.\u00a0 Because of where the apartment was on the property, the view was obstructed by wire mesh in the window that was required by the local fire code.\u00a0 But, that obstruction was only part of the reason the apartment didn\u2019t rent.\u00a0 Since people stopped their tour at master bedroom door, they never saw the double closets or the fully remodeled master bathroom.\u00a0 And if they don\u2019t see it, as far as they\u2019re concerned, it doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 They likely completed the full\u00a0 tour at the other properties they visited.\u00a0 Since they\u2019d only completed a partial tour of my apartment it\u2019s at a distinct disadvantage.\u00a0 So yes even in \u201chot\u201d markets it is not unheard of for apartments to experience significant vacancy.\u00a0 And in those two month\u2019s that apartment community lost $6000 in rental revenue. And that vacancy pushed property managers to make deals.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Dude! Thank you SO MUCH for coming on the blog and sharing your tips!
