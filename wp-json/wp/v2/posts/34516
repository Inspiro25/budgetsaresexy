We&#8217;ve got renters!!!&#8221; one, but at the last minute it fell through and the family decided the place wasn&#8217;t for them. On the same day they were supposed to sign the lease and move in too (!!!).<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how common or not that is, but it&#8217;s obvious we&#8217;ve got a much longer journey ahead of us than we expected. I literally thought we&#8217;d have renters locked in and moved within a week or two, especially after all the awesome upgrades we&#8217;ve done to it and it showing so well (could you tell how naive we are? ;)). We&#8217;ve had two other interested parties apply for the place too, but unfortunately we had to nix those off the bat:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Applicants #1:<\/strong> 3 young men in their early 20&#8217;s, one of which had a pretty bad credit score, and the other a pretty long rap sheet. Including destruction of personal property, so&#8230;. That mixed with the fact our neighbors are 3 single young ladies who like to party, well, it just didn&#8217;t seem like the smartest move on our part (man I feel old saying that!). On the plus side, we did feel good getting the application within 48 hours of having it on the market which is cool. Until I ran into their realtor the next day whose first words out of her mouth was, &#8220;So YOU&#8217;RE the one who denied my client?&#8221; Awkward!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Applicants #2:<\/strong> An older lady who was a right match all around, with the only exception that she wanted to move in two months from now. Which obviously we couldn&#8217;t do since that would be a *major* loss of income coming in&#8230; We&#8217;re already losing one month to pay for the property management of the place, so we def. couldn&#8217;t lose out in another two.<\/p>\n<p>Typing all this out actually makes me feel a little better. People are DEF interested so that&#8217;s a good sign, right?? Maybe it is just a matter of time until we find the best match?? And better now that they&#8217;re falling through than later?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The whole thing just sucks to be honest with you.<\/strong> Each new day that goes by we get more and more anxious to hurry up and get someone in there. The only thing keeping me somewhat sane is remembering how some of y&#8217;all told us that it&#8217;s much more important to find the *right* renters over filling it quickly since the latter can do much more damage &#8211; both physically and financially. So I&#8217;m holding onto that right now and just praying that happens sooner than later. I&#8217;m also starting to wonder if we&#8217;re as cut out for this sorta thing as we initially thought? Not that we can do anything about it now.<\/p>\n<p>So we&#8217;ll see. It&#8217;s technically only been on the market for 3 weeks, but man it just feels like F-O-R-E-V-E-R. I have no idea what the average time is for this sorta stuff really. We found our rental here in Virginia the same day it went on the market, and then we signed the lease the next. I guess I was just secretly hoping we&#8217;d have similar luck?<\/p>\n<p><strong>In other news, my online businesses aren&#8217;t doing that hot either.<\/strong> I mentioned what a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/net-worth-update-down-40k-10-percent-loss\/\">perfect storm of finances<\/a> it&#8217;s been in our net worth update last week, and it only seems to be continuing into this month too. Some of our projects aren&#8217;t taking off as well as we had hoped, and most of my advertisers across the board seem to have taken a nice long nap as well. The trick now is to just figure out if it&#8217;s a lower than usual dip in the self-employment game, or if it&#8217;s a longer &#8211; more permanent &#8211; situation. In which case I&#8217;ll need to formulate a new plan STAT.<\/p>\n<p>Just lots and lots of unknowns here lately. And why they hit all at the same time is beyond me. I guess that&#8217;s the biggest problem I have right now with everything &#8211; not knowing what the future holds for once :( I&#8217;ve been on solid ground for so many years now that I&#8217;ve forgotten what it&#8217;s like to go through some $hittier ones. Time to eat some of that &#8220;humble pie&#8221; now, eh?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh well. That&#8217;s self-employment for ya.<\/strong> Gotta take the lows as you do the highs&#8230; If you can keep us in your thoughts and prayers, though, I&#8217;d really appreciate it. Feels weird being such a Debbie downer here when I&#8217;m so used to being up in the clouds! But hopefully I&#8217;m just freaking out for nothing. Guess only time will tell&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Hope your month&#8217;s starting out a lot better!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Sad face monkey by <a id=\"yui_3_7_3_3_1372698152855_339\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/emrank\/\">emrank<\/a> \/ Thoughts by J$)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What a crappy crappy week&#8230; From the highs of moving in to our new home, straight to the lows of less income and realizing how&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/crap-week-rental-property-income\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[178,8,36],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-34516","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-entrepreneurship","category-home-ownership","category-rant"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Oh How The Tables Have Turned... | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/crap-week-rental-property-income\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Oh How The Tables Have Turned... | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"What a crappy crappy week&#8230; From the highs of moving in to our new home, straight to the lows of less income and realizing how...
