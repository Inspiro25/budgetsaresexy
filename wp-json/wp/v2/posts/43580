I can&#8217;t tell you how happy my wallet is right now :) And this may even mean no daycare for however long it takes her to land a gig too, saving a cool $2,000\/mo! Which is about a $36,000 salary alone if you factor in taxes, *face palm*.<\/p>\n<h2>Other financial wins this week&#8230;<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Saved <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$21.86<\/strong><\/span> more through <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/01\/digit-review-save-money-fast-easy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digit<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Invested <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$11.28<\/strong><\/span> more through <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/acorns-app-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Acorns<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Made a <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$25.00<\/strong><\/span> donation to support a friend&#8217;s cause (I have a rule that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/12\/give-money-homeless-panhandlers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I have to donate to places my friends ask me to<\/a> since I suck at donating anything on my own accord :( This forces me to actually do it while also helping out a friend!)<\/li>\n<li>Got <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$153.00<\/strong><\/span> back in taxes! Which is good or bad depending on how you look at it ;) I&#8217;d say the big win here is really just FINISHING my taxes to begin with, haha&#8230; What a pain in the ass. And I don&#8217;t even do them myself &#8211; I use an accountant! Who I gladly pay to make sure it gets done right too so I <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/do-you-tackle-your-own-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">don&#8217;t have to fear going to jail<\/a>.

It literally took me over a month to do this, and thank goodness they finally mailed me something saying we&#8217;re straight now, ugh&#8230; I also had to prove my own income too, but that was even easier since all I had to do was run my yearly &#8220;Income &amp; Expense Summary&#8221; via <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/outright\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Outright.com<\/a> which I use for tracking all business $$$. A HUGE time saver right there, I&#8217;ll tell you what&#8230; If anyone&#8217;s looking for a good way to track their biz $ I highly recommend them! In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/outright.com\/testimonials\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I&#8217;m even on their testimonial page<\/a>! Haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Cool stuff that went down around the Blog:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/apple-2-computer-blog.jpg\" alt=\"budgets are sexy blog\" width=\"466\" height=\"332\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But first a PSA: Sometimes stuff breaks here (sorry!) but thankfully this week was not one of them. If you ever see something jacked up or that you wish I&#8217;d add here, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">please let me know<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1) We now have a mobile app!<\/strong> Okay, well this actually happened last month but I keep forgetting to tell you ;) And actually it&#8217;s not really an app-app so much as it is a redesigned site specifically fitted for phones\/tablets. The next time you&#8217;re on yours bring up budgetsaresexy.vercel.app and let me know what you think! It&#8217;ll even let you save a nifty icon I created to your home screen so I&#8217;m just one click away &#8211; woo!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2) I may or may not be in the works of starting a podcast :)<\/strong> I&#8217;ve told myself over the past year or two I&#8217;m not going to do it unless I can find the perfect co-host so I don&#8217;t bore myself (or you guys) to death, and out of the blue this guy\/girl? crossed my path and it just clicked. I don&#8217;t want to say too much until I know what the hell I&#8217;m doing (FYI &#8211; I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing!), but as soon as things are more squared away I&#8217;ll start sharing some of the details&#8230; Also, I need you to hold me accountable so I actually go through with this! I think it could be really fun\/educational for all of us!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3) One of my articles was blasted out to Republic Wireless subscribers!<\/strong> Giving me a total nerdgasm! Haha&#8230; Been a huge fan of theirs ever since switching over last year and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">saving $100+\/mo<\/a> which completely jump started our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Challenge Everything<\/a> series we&#8217;ve got going on. So thanks RW! And here&#8217;s the funny part about this article they picked up (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/pwk.republicwireless.com\/guest-post-j-moneys-7-money-lessons-from-7-years-of-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7 things I learned about money in 7 years blogging<\/a>&#8220;) &#8211; it almost didn&#8217;t get written! I was worried it would come out lame but decided to sit down and start typing it out anyways and it went on to become one of my more popular articles in recent history :) Sometimes you just gotta give things a shot!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4) Our food battle from last week?<\/strong> Over 300 comments between the two (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/how-do-you-spend-little-money-food-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here&#8217;s the instigator<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/dollar-meal-budgeting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here&#8217;s the backer upper<\/a>) sharing all kinds of awesome tips, banter, and a few heated debates. I had no idea people were as passionate about their food as they are politics ;) Seriously. You should go back and check some of them out if you haven&#8217;t already &#8211; jam packed with details and emotion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5) Lastly, don&#8217;t forget to enter our book giveaway!<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/04\/one-page-financial-plan-book-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The One-Page Financial Plan<\/a> by NY Times columnist Carl Richards (and overall doodler extraordinaire).<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Cool stuff other people are doing around the financial community:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43594\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/phroogal-road-trip.jpg\" alt=\"phroogal road trip\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/phroogal-road-trip.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/phroogal-road-trip-300x163.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>#1) Luke from ConsumerismCommentary.com<\/strong> and our financial blogger &#8220;Plutus Awards&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theplutusawards.com\/2015\/introducing-plutus-foundation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is building a foundation<\/a>. Which is bad ass because it&#8217;ll now mean our online financial community will have a centralized place to do good and give back. And since my older philanthropy project, <a href=\"http:\/\/lovedrop.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Love Drop<\/a>, has been closed for over a few years now, I&#8217;ll have a new place to latch onto and get better about said charity sucking ;) So thanks, Luke!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2) I also had a fun call with Jason from Phroogal.com<\/strong> who&#8217;s about to embark on an epic 30 day \/ 30 location cross country tour to spread the good financial word around town.

Check out his list of the 30 pit stops in the right column of that link and see if you can make any of them. They&#8217;ll be chatting $$$, featuring cool speakers\/founders, and in some areas offering free food and booze! ;) And if you work for a financial institution, maybe try to involve them too?<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3) Then there&#8217;s our hustler friend, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/11\/side-hustle-idea-selling-junk-mail\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lil&#8217; Vee<\/a> &#8211; remember her?<\/strong> Who rocked that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/01\/10k-christmas-hustle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$10,000 savings challenge<\/a> late last year and writes as hilariously as our new foodie friend <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/how-do-you-spend-little-money-food-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Braden<\/a> does?\u00a0 Well, turns out she&#8217;s launching her own financial blog here shortly which I&#8217;m thrilled about.

Now, I&#8217;ve never actually used a prepaid card before, but if I did I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;d be lured in by them as their marketing to the younger\u00a0millennial crowd is spot on. They make prepaid cards look cool!! Or are prepaid cards already cool? I literally have no idea, haha&#8230; But check these things out:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43595\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kaiku-prepaid-cards.jpg\" alt=\"kaiku prepaid cards\" width=\"550\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kaiku-prepaid-cards.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kaiku-prepaid-cards-300x85.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, since I&#8217;ve never used or researched one before, I emailed back a rep over there asking about fees and how they compare to others in their field.
