So way to go, man!! A refreshing thing to read in these trying times!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s his note below&#8230; For reference, he lives in Lisbon, Portugal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hey J.!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just wanted to check how are you doing during this pandemic outbreak.<\/p>\n<p>And also to let you know how I was doing because it&#8217;s been years now since I last sent any news. So, overall, I&#8217;m better than ever and you had a big impact on me. Till today I&#8217;m very thankful for your support and it pleases me to re-listen to the episodes <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/new-money-podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you recorded with Paula<\/a>. So much knowledge and so much humility.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As for me, in the last two years I&#8217;ve been great because:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I quit my university degree exactly a year ago and I&#8217;ve never been more relieved. That was one of the biggest things that contributed for my depression. I was not letting go of something that was harming me in the name of grit\/perseverance without realizing that continuing it was hurting me more than doing good. I found a parallel between that and you <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/good-vs-bad-reasons-to-quit-something\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deciding to quit the podcast<\/a>. That episode was so relatable!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; After quitting school, I spent most of the time working (on what I was already working in) and saving up money (I had about \u20ac20,500 saved by the end of 2019). I work in tourism (I rent two Airbnb rooms and I&#8217;m a tour guide) and property management (I manage 8 tenant contracts).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Even though this work was not related to what I studied (architecture), it was earning more money (\u20ac1,750\/month) than people working in my field of study (architecture = \u20ac900\/month).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I wanted to invest in Land Flipping due to it&#8217;s low-initial-capital required to invest (I was planning on \u20ac7,000) so I purchased the <a href=\"https:\/\/retipster.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">REtipster course<\/a> online by Seth Williams (\u20ac2,000). Have you ever heard about it? [Nope! But love the name! :)]<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Because I needed to physically be in the US to open a bank account for the Land Flipping business, I flew to the US and Canada for the first time in my life on Nov. 2019 and LOVED it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I felt super welcome by everyone and it all felt very familiar, maybe because I grew up with so many references from there (online and TV). It was very easy to start a friendly conversation with almost everyone!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I had been very slow applying the knowledge from the Land Flipping course due to excessive demand in my Lisbon-based work. So I haven&#8217;t made any deals yet. For now, due to the covid-19, I decided to pause that course.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; During the quarantine I am trying to learn Forex Trading. I see a lot of lessons also apply to stocks (technical analysis).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I started dating a new guy two years ago who is great and has even met my parents and relatives.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; My dad finally broke his 10-year silence regarding my homosexuality and has been very supportive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m more and more connected with my parents, siblings, cousins and some aunts and uncles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I suspect that many other relatives now know or think I&#8217;m gay and keep treating me equally, which is what I always wanted. One of my fears <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/seeking-financial-stability-as-a-gay-non-white-man-of-muslim-faith\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back in 2017<\/a> was that my family would treat me differently if they ever knew the truth. It&#8217;s still on a Don&#8217;t Ask Don&#8217;t Tell mode, but overall it might not be as bad as I feared, thankfully.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; I feel much more in control of my finances as I&#8217;ve been aggressively tracking my money and cutting unnecessary expenses (as you always recommended).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I bought my first investment property with my boyfriend this February (2020) and it&#8217;s already rented out. We bought it for \u20ac99,000 and our down-payment was \u20ac16,000 which meant the loan was \u20ac83,000 at a fixed yearly interest rate of 1.25%. At the end of 30 years we will have paid \u20ac31,215,14 of interest on the \u20ac83,000 loan. The closing costs + repairs during February were \u20ac4,000 so each of us had to put in a total of \u20ac10,000 (\u20ac16,000 + \u20ac4,000 \u00f7 2).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; In March (last month) we rented it for \u20ac750\/month, so in one year, after taxes, insurance, fees and mortgage, we&#8217;ll have an annual liquid profit of \u20ac1,200 for each of us, which is equivalent to 12% of the invested capital with the bonus of building an asset being paid by our tenant&#8217;s rent. I only present the numbers because you and Paula love actual numbers. With the covid-19, I suspect things might change and our rent might have to go lower. Time will tell.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The covid-19 has stalled a lot of my work, mainly in tourism, so my monthly income is down by 86% (to \u20ac250\/month &#8211; not counting the \u20ac100\/month from the real estate profit), but I have a financial cushion that will allow me to survive for at least 6 months (\u20ac8,500 saved up) while I learn more about Forex Trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Despite the many downsides of this pandemic, like my huge income loss, a possible BIG economic crisis, the many deaths, the vulnerability of my loved ones, the major changes of plans, the many health problems (<a href=\"https:\/\/affordanything.com\/i-tested-positive-for-coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">even Paula caught Covid-19 and suffered a lot with it<\/a>), I&#8217;m seeing many good things:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m enjoying my time at home doing all the things I&#8217;ve been delaying due to the &#8220;lack of time&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m grateful I have a roof, I have supermarkets still filled with food, I have internet connection to keep learning new things, I&#8217;m communicating with everyone and keep working on property management.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m grateful that the Portuguese government and police have been surprisingly responsible\/correct handling this delicate issue. Even rival political parties are united.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m grateful that the majority of people in my neighbourhood are being careful and humble. I offered to go grocery\/pharmacy shopping for the vulnerable-elderly people in my building (it&#8217;s more common to live in apartments than in single family homes here in European cities) and they were moved by the gesture.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m eating better because I&#8217;m cooking everything I eat.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m talking more with loved ones through Whatsapp because I decided to create an online family tree and add everything I can before the elders pass away. I&#8217;ve got 534 people so far!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m appreciating the silence in the city, the clear sound of the birds. I think I won&#8217;t be able to handle the car noises again once things return &#8220;back to normal&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m appreciating the lack of consumerism habits I used to have (I&#8217;m spending way less than I would in a week in little minor stuff like restaurants or clothes).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m appreciating my daily 1-hour non-stop walks through Lisbon with pure silence, no cars, and <a href=\"https:\/\/affordanything.com\/podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">listening to Paula<\/a>, with you occasionally coming on in the Bloopers!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I like the fact that this is an opportunity for the planet to see how it was environmentally needing a break from the heavy industrial usage.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; And I really hope this changes the paradigm of consumer habits in our planet (including for me).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I hope this balances off the overvalue given to certain jobs and undervalue given to others (footballers versus nurses\/psychotherapists\/scientific researchers), etc.<\/p>\n<p>(I know this list looks like a modified version of your &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/im-just-as-happy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I&#8217;m just as happy&#8230;<\/a>&#8221; post last month, which by the way I just commented there)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Overall I&#8217;m very happy and stable in this unstable time, ironically, unlike <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/seeking-financial-stability-as-a-gay-non-white-man-of-muslim-faith\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how lost and desperate<\/a> I felt when I first emailed you three years ago.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I cannot thank you enough for the dedication you had towards me during that time. You always replied, you always followed up, you recognized the challenge I had even if you weren&#8217;t in my shoes (you had empathy) and still encouraged me through your honest and humble words.<\/p>\n<p>So again, a big thank you for everything!<\/p>\n<p>A big hug (with distance) from Lisbon,<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; Iqbal<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaways I see here:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>He wasn&#8217;t afraid to give up on something that no longer holds true for him anymore! (Leaving school)<\/li>\n<li>He&#8217;s been experimenting like crazy with ways to make an income!<\/li>\n<li>The more open he&#8217;s been with people he loves, the more loving &#8211; or at least understanding &#8211; they&#8217;ve been in return. Probably the hardest part out of all of this.<\/li>\n<li>He&#8217;s been TRACKING HIS MONEY and gotten his expenses pretty damn low &#8211; being able to go 6 months off \u20ac8,500 of savings!<\/li>\n<li>He seems incredibly grateful these days!<\/li>\n<li>And possibly the greatest turn around of all &#8211; he seems light years more *optimistic* than he once was three years ago&#8230; And good reason for it too, with everything he&#8217;s accomplished!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So again man &#8211; way to STICK TO IT and bet on yourself, and I&#8217;m so very glad to hear things are better for you now, as I&#8217;m sure everyone else here is happy to hear as well :)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know it&#8217;s not easy &#8211; and not even <em>close<\/em> to being over &#8211; but you&#8217;ve seen the light now, baby!!!
