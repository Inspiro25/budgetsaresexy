Who\u2019s looking forward to an awesome weekend!? &#x1f64b;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;&#x1f64b;&#x200d;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today I\u2019m gonna share something a little embarrassing\u2026 It\u2019s the final report card from my graduating year at high school. Check this out:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63316 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/yr-12-report-card-1-e1600370127370.jpeg\" alt=\"A bad Math report card doesn't mean no early financial independence\" width=\"600\" height=\"454\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, Math was my worst subject. 29 out of 100&#8230; I\u2019ve never scored lower than 29% on anything in my entire life! This class was the rock bottom of my formal education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, before you label me a complete idiot, you should know a few things about Australian high school vs. American high school:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Australia has wicked high standards for curriculum. For example, this high school Math class \u201c1S PES\u201d included Applied Calculus &#8211; stuff most Americans usually don\u2019t get taught until later in college. No wonder I sucked at it, I was only 17!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ozstudies.com\/blog\/study-australia\/complete-guide-to-the-australian-grading-system\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grading system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is wacky down under. For example, I received the highest Art Design score in the whole school (and still only got 87%). In the US, many schools give the highest person 100%, then <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tophat.com\/glossary\/g\/grading-on-a-curve\/#:~:text=Grading%20on%20a%20curve%20refers,grade%20average%20for%20a%20given\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grade the entire class based on a curve<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the USA you must pass every class to graduate from high school. For AUS they go based on weighted averages. You can suck really bad in 1 subject and make it up by overachieving in others. This is how I passed high school.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, no matter which way you look at it, I was labelled \u201cbad at Math.\u201d All my teachers, my peers, and my grades told me that I would never be a numbers expert. I received merits in every other subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This report card is from 18 years ago. Today, I have a job writing about finances, of which some stuff has a heavy math focus. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can a guy who barely scraped through high school get a job writing about numbers? How can a guy like that become financially independent and be able retire early in life?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few things I\u2019ve realized about math and personal finance. I hope these insights encourage others who may have been (or currently are) a similar type of student as me.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. You don\u2019t have to be good at math to be good with money<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people think becoming a millionaire is complicated and you have to have advanced knowledge in investing, economics and complex math. This simply isn\u2019t true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kicking ass in personal finance is a simple and repeatable process, no matter your level of education. It\u2019s based on proven principles and habits\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work as hard and smart as you can<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earn as much money as you can<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spend less than you earn<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save and invest the difference<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repeat this for many years<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After high school I jumped straight into the workforce while my \u2018smart\u2019 friends went to college. I always felt bad about this, like they were getting smarter and smarter, and I had given up on education. I hate to admit it, but I let my high school report card define who I was for a long time. Big mistake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then somewhere around my late 20\u2019s, I looked around and realized I had more money than most other people my age. I realized that my growing wealth wasn\u2019t because of my academics, or lack thereof\u2026 It was due to my <\/span><b>subtle daily habits and following the basic money principles.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can be the smartest math genius in the world and still be flat broke later in life. And you can be a high school dropout and become financially independent in your 30s. Don\u2019t ever let bad math grades convince you that you\u2019re bad at money or will never be wealthy! If you\u2019re not convinced, just read <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/book-review-millionaire-next-door\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Millionaire Next Door<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and learn what most true wealthy people are like. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Formal education vs. self education<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">School while you\u2019re young is important. Your mind is a sponge, you have unlimited spare time, and education is packaged nicely into 1 hour classroom learning sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning as an adult is much harder. And inconvenient! It requires self motivation, discipline, and time to acquire knowledge. Many young kids think that when college is over, the learning stops. This isn\u2019t the case at all!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason I\u2019m better at math today and can comprehend finance stuff is because I slowly built up knowledge over time. Books, podcasts, blogs, independent courses and asking good questions all contributed to my education. And, I\u2019ve still got a loooong way to go!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I could go back in time and give advice to my high school self, it would be:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you\u2019re not great at something today, it doesn\u2019t mean you will never be good at it. Learning never stops.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you didn\u2019t learn something in school, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/6-ways-my-parents-taught-me-financial-independence\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from your parents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at home, that\u2019s OK. There are a ton of places you can pick up knowledge and learn as an adult.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In school, a report card tells you how well you&#8217;re doing. In personal finance, your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\">net worth <\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is your report card. It is the <\/span><b>single best tool<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that tells you if you&#8217;re on the right track, or need to study harder! Your school report card goes away in your 20\u2019s. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\">net worth report card never goes away<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>3. There\u2019s a calculator for that!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My grandpa once sat me down and said, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJoel, if you ever don\u2019t know how to do something in life, that\u2019s OK.
