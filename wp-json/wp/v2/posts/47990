Tell us how it went down, Mike&#8230;)<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***********<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Here&#8217;s How NOT to Get Paid Being a Sperm Donor&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It all started by applying with a company in New York City that specializes in fertility issues.<\/p>\n<p>If anyone is considering doing this as a side-hustle, I feel that they should know exactly all the demanding procedures involved in the qualification process. I thought I could walk into the company\u2019s office, sign a few papers, and start donating sperm to my heart\u2019s content.<\/p>\n<p>I was in for a rude awakening.<\/p>\n<p>The program has a strict anonymity policy for donors, and any expression on social media about being a sperm donor is prohibited. For example, you can\u2019t include any identifying information in your donor profile that can also be found online (e.g., pictures of yourself, descriptions of any physical attributes, posting your donor ID#, etc.). Also, you cannot confirm nor deny that you are a sperm donor with a company in New York City.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>With that being said, here is what becoming a sperm donor entails.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Basic requirements:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be at least 5\u20199\u201d tall.<\/li>\n<li>Have a bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited college or university.<\/li>\n<li>Be somewhere between ages 19-38 years old.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Step #1: The Application Process<\/h2>\n<p>Initially I had to provide the company with several sperm samples, as part of the application process. This meant commuting into the city, meeting with the donor receptionist, and *ahem*, you know, doing something into a little cup. I didn\u2019t receive any compensation for this; however, the company did give me little perks (e.g., a <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$20 Amazon gift card<\/strong><\/span>) for submitting samples.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to providing semen samples for analysis, I was also required to fill out an extensive family tree document that included information about my siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc., as well as my family\u2019s medical history. That document took about two days worth of research and digging into my family\u2019s history to complete.<\/p>\n<h2>Step #2: Becoming an Acceptable Applicant<\/h2>\n<p>I eventually was deemed an acceptable applicant, and a donor coordinator then provided me with an orientation to the program (i.e., a general welcome presentation). I was compensated <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$60<\/strong><\/span> for completing the donor profile and making an &#8220;initial donation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company checked out all my information, provided me with a donor ID#, and entered me into their system as a <i>conditionally qualified <\/i>sperm donor. That meant that I would soon be making money through my sperm donations. This was about three months after initially applying.<\/p>\n<h2>Step #3: Being Seen by a Licensed Physician<\/h2>\n<p>The next step was to be seen by a licensed physician, and I was compensated <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$50<\/strong><\/span> for getting a physical (turn your head and cough sort of thing). The company then asked me to provide <i>another<\/i> sperm sample, which acted as my first &#8220;retainable specimen&#8221; for the company.<\/p>\n<p>(Note: I had already provided 4 or 5 specimens for them up to this point)<\/p>\n<p>That day I also gave a blood sample to the company, and spent approximately 90 minutes filling out and reviewing a Medical Social Questionnaire. Though at least I was finally getting paid some real money for my efforts, as I was compensated <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$125<\/strong><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, to become a <i>fully qualified <\/i>\u00a0sperm donor it takes approximately two to three more months to complete the rest of the screening procedures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before I divulge this qualification process information, here\u2019s what being a <i>conditionally qualified<\/i> sperm donor entails:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Donate at least once per week, up to three times per week<\/li>\n<li>Abstain from ejaculation(s) for 24-48 hrs between each donation<\/li>\n<li>Make enough to fill two small vials to satisfy an &#8220;acceptable donation&#8221; (and get paid $125)<\/li>\n<li>Provide urine analysis once per month, which is used for STD testing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Step #4: The Psych Evaluation<\/h2>\n<p>Once I reached the <i>conditionally qualified <\/i>phase, things began to run more smoothly as I would be compensated the full amount for donations. Additionally, all applicants have to submit to a psychological evaluation with a psychologist affiliated with the company in New York City.\u00a0 This is another day spent trekking into the city on my own dime.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s pertinent to mention the travel costs associated with the application process too. \u00a0I spent approximately <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$180<\/strong><\/span> on train tickets and random meals getting to all these various appointments.<\/p>\n<p>The psych eval is just as extensive in itself. I was grilled for <strong><em>two hours<\/em><\/strong> about my behavior, attitudes, and life experiences, and was also asked to complete an additional <em><strong>300-item<\/strong><\/em> questionnaire! Then the doctor asked me <i>more <\/i>questions about my life based upon the answers I submitted to her survey. It turned out to be a disaster, and ultimately I &#8220;didn\u2019t pass&#8221; the psych eval.<\/p>\n<p>So, after six months of going through this entire application process, in the end I was sent home packing. I never reached the <i>fully qualified <\/i>stage, and ended up sinking a lot of effort and time into something that eventually became fruitless.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>In Summary&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you think this is a viable side-hustle, let me give you my numbers from the whole endeavor. And keep in mind, again, that getting to the phase where I was compensated the full $125 per sperm donation took about five-six months from the time I initially applied.<\/p>\n<p>In total I was paid <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$460<\/strong><\/span> from the company, spent <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$180<\/strong><\/span> on train tickets and food in the city, and then ended up shelling out another <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$407<\/strong><\/span> to remove a virus from my laptop that was probably the result of watching too much porn (which included a $251 repair fee, and two years of anit-virus software for protecting my network).<\/p>\n<p><strong>All together, that means I netted <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">-$127<\/span> after almost half a year of my life. Womp Womp.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, If someone is <i>really<\/i> serious about becoming a sperm donor, be aware of exactly how thorough the screening process is, and how much effort you have to put into schlepping into the city and filling out BS medical history forms! \u00a0You\u2019re gonna have to be in it for the long haul, and need to decide if it\u2019s really worth it for you because the road to being able to donate regularly is anything but smooth.\u00a0 #FML<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***********<\/p>\n<p>Daaang, sucks man!
