Another month, another <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\">net worth<\/a> report while being another month OLDER as well! Haha&#8230; <\/strong>I swear I still feel like the same 28 year old when <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I first started tracking these<\/a>, do you??? :)<\/p>\n<p>Three juicy things that went down this month:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The markets continued its crashing (which you already knew)<\/li>\n<li>I had to withdraw our ROTH IRA contributions as it turned out we weren&#8217;t allowed to contribute (!!!)<\/li>\n<li>I tried bitcoin and hated it!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We&#8217;ll skip item #1 up there since it&#8217;s nothing we haven&#8217;t covered here before (i.e. just avert your eyes and keep going with the plan!), but let&#8217;s talk a little about events #2 and #3:<\/p>\n<h2>#2. Roth IRA boo-boo<\/h2>\n<p>You know how I always wait until Tax Time each year to max out our IRAs after meeting with our accountant? Which I&#8217;ve faithfully done for the past decade and it&#8217;s been working like a charm? Well, for whatever reason I decided to go rogue this time around and max it out three months early, and of course its the ONE TIME I mess it all up, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Turns out we made too much money last year to be able to contribute *anything* to our Roths (due to the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-i-fired-myself-from-rockstar-finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rockstar sale<\/a>), and so the $5,500 we each put towards maxing it out had to be reversed unless we wanted to do a dance with the devil. A good problem to have, but still a problem no less, and is why you see such a large cash infusion up there in our net worth graph this month :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>It wasn&#8217;t because we were straight up hustling &#8211; it was because we straight up made a mistake!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I eventually got it all cleared up (had to file two &#8220;Correction of excess contribution&#8221; forms, which then gets it withdrawn + any profits it made), and now we just await to see how much we&#8217;re gonna get dinged for the honor of making this mistake ;) The good thing is that we caught it *before* the tax year ends which should help, but I&#8217;ll report back once I know more when I get the details&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>If you ever come across more money than you&#8217;re used to though, don&#8217;t be like me and excitedly start maxing stuff out! Make sure you&#8217;re playing inside the rules! :)<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Bitcoin Experimenting<\/h2>\n<p>This was another one that threw me for a loop this month&#8230; For years I just ignored and ignored and ignored the crypto craze and told everyone who asked me, &#8220;No! Stay away!&#8221; but when a good friend of mine started getting into it I couldn&#8217;t help but get sucked in&#8230; And before I knew it I had my entire <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/spavings-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spavings fund<\/a> ($2,300+) dumped in Bitcoin et al seeing what it was all about!<\/p>\n<p>Whelp, it was fun for a little bit, but my pea brain just couldn&#8217;t get into it *long term* like I had originally planned, and as fast as I had &#8220;invested&#8221; it I had gone in and cashed it all out, haha&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t stop staring at the screens every day wondering where it would bounce to next!! Even though I kept telling myself it&#8217;s a long play and to stop doing it!<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly I <em>did<\/em> end up coming away with an extra <strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">$332.61<\/span><\/strong> when it was said and done (and re-invested into that same spavings fund &#8211; which is why it&#8217;s up larger than normal this month), but it was by pure accident and literally the next week it all crashed harder than the stock markets&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad I gave it a shot though because I hadn&#8217;t tried any new experiments in a while, and it only reinforced my love for &#8220;regular&#8221; investments, haha&#8230; And I have to give mad respect to all y&#8217;all who are invested long term as well, because I really do think it&#8217;ll be around for a while &#8211; even if it looks different &#8211; and if you&#8217;re better than I at averting your eyes and focusing on its strengths, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be handsomely rewarded later (if you haven&#8217;t been already). My friend is very much still &#8220;in&#8221;, and I have a feeling he&#8217;ll be rubbing it in my nose years from now :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some other quick notes from my experience:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coinbase<\/a> to do all my buying\/selling &#8211; it was so easy!! Loved having it all in one &#8220;wallet,&#8221; and seems to be the popular choice for people (though you&#8217;re limited to what types of digital currency you can buy there). UPDATE: See Jake&#8217;s note in the comments section on why using places like this could be bad!<\/li>\n<li>I bought three types of cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Of which all but Ethereum made money, though I think they&#8217;ll be the clear winner when all the dust settles&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>I spent way too much time reading &#8211; and laughing &#8211; about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptokitties.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cryptokitties<\/a>!<\/li>\n<li>And there&#8217;s about 1,000 new articles on bitcoin and company every day so you&#8217;ll never get bored :) One of the more feistier ones came from Mr. Money Mustache, though it still didn&#8217;t stop me from experimenting on my own, haha&#8230; &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2018\/01\/02\/why-bitcoin-is-stupid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Bitcoin is Stupid<\/a>&#8220;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em><strong>Would love to hear how many of you are invested in it, and what your experience has been so far?<\/strong><\/em> Have you been involved for a while, or just recently started out? Any good articles\/resources you can share with our community here?<\/p>\n<p>So yeah, a wild month this round! And that&#8217;s on top of packing up all our stuff, moving to our new house, and then un-packing all our stuff while prepping for a new human in our lives :) But more on that in a bit.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Onto March&#8217;s Net Worth Breakdown&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><em>[As always, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these reports<\/a> are shared to keep things transparent and start great convos around money.

Because we were so close and had a two week overlapping of homes, we were able to do the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make daily car trips to move some of the fragile\/fluffy\/weird-shaped items from one house to the next<\/li>\n<li>Make bigger moves over two weekends using friends&#8217; trucks and trailers<\/li>\n<li>And then renting one 16 ft van for a few hours to move over all remaining furniture<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It took a lot of *time*, but much easier\/smoother doing it over the course of two weeks than all in one main day. And it barely disrupted my kids\/pregnant wife&#8217;s lives too :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) THE BABY IS COMING THIS MONTH!!!<\/strong> I don&#8217;t know when, but I know it&#8217;s coming and just praying towards the END of the month vs in the beginning\/middle, haha&#8230; I&#8217;m ready, but not <em>that<\/em> ready.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) I&#8217;m finally fine, and enjoying, my freedom from <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-years-of-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a billion and one<\/a> projects :)<\/strong> And I don&#8217;t even want to start a new one anytime soon &#8211; imagine that?? My trick of trying to do the *least* amount of work possible every day, while still doing work and being effective, is starting to pay off, and I only hope I don&#8217;t lose my hustle bone as the months tick by, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Lastly, if you ever come across a box of old coins in your attic or from family members, feel free to mail them over to me and I will value them and liquidate for you!<\/strong> I jokingly said I&#8217;d do that for a friend the other day as it&#8217;s something I really have done over the years, and not only did he take me up on it but it should be arriving to my house any day now!!!
