Asking for a Friend &#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypothetically, let\u2019s say you know a guy who owns a 2010 Prius. The car is mechanically reliable, fully paid off, and lightly used.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one day, this hypothetical guy gets a phone call from his wife\u2019s parents &#8230; They want to buy him and their daughter a new car, free and clear, as a gift. This gift car would be larger than the Prius, have more modern and awesome features, and would be perfect for future road trips that this hypothetical guy and his wife are planning to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This guy you know is loving the thought of having a newer whip, especially one he can fit all of his surfboards inside plus have plenty of room in the back for his <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-14000-dog-cooper\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hypothetical German Shepherd<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, this guy and his wife are mostly minimalists, and don\u2019t <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a new car. Upgraded versions of the consumer items they already own don\u2019t add a huge amount of value to their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help this hypothetical guy out. What would you advise him to do in this situation? Should they accept the new car as a gift, or politely decline the offer?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Accepting BIG gifts Is Hard, Especially Cars!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, you might be thinking that this friend of yours is a complete idiot! Why is this such a tough decision? Take the car, you moron!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it was me making the choice (and it\u2019s definitely not me or anything &#8230;) I would be hesitant because:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owning newer stuff increases my cost of living. A new car would add to my annual expenses, and it\u2019s why we <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/selling-our-car-online-are-people-even-buying-cars-right-now\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just got rid of our previous spare car<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our 2010 Prius works just fine and isn\u2019t due for an upgrade for at least 5 years, or probably longer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I have a lot of self pride. Accepting handouts and large gifts is uncomfortable because we feel we haven\u2019t earned it ourselves.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m a personal finance blogger, and many readers would never be in a position to be gifted a car. Accepting expensive gifts kind of makes me feel like a fraud, because I preach to others all day about saving and investing &#8212; and here I am getting stuff for free.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that being said, I also believe &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Part of Giving Is Receiving<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve given away decent sized gifts in my life, and it feels GREAT. I love acts of kindness, showing love, helping others, sharing wealth, and all that good stuff people do when they have an abundance of something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By refusing the car, <\/span><b>I\u2019m kind of belittling the process that I love so much<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So here are some supporting points for why we should accept the car:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the situation were flipped, I\u2019d probably do the same thing. Sharing my wealth is what I plan to do in the future &#8212; probably with my kids in the form of things they wouldn\u2019t buy themselves.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not accepting gifts robs the giver of a good feeling. Generosity should be encouraged, not discouraged.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we don\u2019t <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a bigger car, it certainly would come in handy. Road trips, more room if we foster kids soon, and also it solves a problem in the coming years when the Prius dies.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I left Hawaii in 2012, I gave away my car and motorbike to others (they were only worth a few thousand each). The car went to a work colleague who had 5 teenage daughters, and the motorbike went to a friend with no transportation. Is this the universe paying me back 9 years later? The more you give, the more you get.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Financially Speaking \u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s help this hypothetical friend work out how much his annual expenses would increase by taking on a newer car. Maybe that would help his decision-making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s assume the current 2010 Prius gets swapped out with a gift of a new (used) 2018 Ford Explorer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Registration costs:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I believe California has a flat registration fee\/taxes for standard vehicles so I\u2019m going to assume no change here. Annual <\/span><b>reg is currently $186.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Car Insurance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A quick GEICO quote shows me a 2018 Explorer would be $741 for a 6 month insurance policy. That\u2019s an <\/span><b>increase of $440<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to the current Prius policy of $301 for 6 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Gas Mileage:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The current Prius is averaging 46 miles per gallon and I\u2019m gonna assume that the new Explorer will get approximately half that. Therefore, <\/span><b>gas prices would double<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Looking back at my past annual gas expenses, we spend an average of $1,245 in gas each year (not including 2020, we didn\u2019t travel). All in all, the new car <\/span><b>would ADD $1,245 annually<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to our fuel expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Maintenance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the simplicity of this exercise, let\u2019s assume both cars have the same annual maintenance costs. The Prius just got new tires and has no mechanical issues. I\u2019m assuming the new car won\u2019t have any issues over the next 5 years either. <\/span><b>Annual maintenance: $368<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63682 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Car_Comparisons_of_Cost_png_dAT1-elL-e1611516009183.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"199\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All summed up, looks like accepting the new car would add $2,125 in expenses annually. Or broken down per month this would be $177 per month!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financially worth it? Well, just looking at annual cost isn\u2019t the complete story \u2026 Upgrading cars this year means not having to upgrade later. Paying the extra $2,000 per year now might save a once off $15,000 replacement cost for upgrading the Prius in 5 years. &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Other Random Thoughts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking outside the box, this might not have to be a binary decision. There could be options other than just \u201ccar or no car.\u201d A few things come to mind:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if we accept the new car on the condition that we get to gift our current car to someone else in need? Paying it forward is a beautiful thing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We could also accept the new car, then buy a large unexpected gift in return for the parents later. A vacation? A surprise party where we fly in relatives and pay for expenses?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is kind of rude to request &#8230; But we could ask the parents if this gift car could wait a few years. It would be much easier to accept if our current car were dead and needed to be replaced! I feel dirty just typing that thought.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of a car, what about something the entire family can all enjoy together? This would allow the giving to take place, and more people can receive a benefit. Could that be a win\/win?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Would You Accept a Car as a Gift?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this totally hypothetical made-up situation that is definitely not happening right now with me and my family. I\u2019ll be sure to pass on all your comments to my friend. &#x1f60a;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s also hope that his parents in-law aren\u2019t reading this post right now. Just in case, please be respectful in the comments &#8212; I\u2019m not really sure how they\u2019d take to their goodwill gesture being splashed around and discussed on the Internet.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hypothetically, let\u2019s say you know a guy who owns a 2010 Prius.
