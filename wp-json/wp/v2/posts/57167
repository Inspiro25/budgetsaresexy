I think I&#8217;d agree &#8211; finding true love isn&#8217;t always in your control, whereas most of your finances are. And the more in control of your finances you are, the better shot of attracting that *person* in your life too &#8211; BOOM! Budgeting = confidence = sexy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Almost 3-in-10 report talking about money (27%) before going out on their first date through a digital dating service.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LOVE THIS!! That&#8217;s a lot of people talking about money before meeting up in real life! I met my wife the old fashioned way before I got a chance to dabble in the online dating world (met her at a bar where she asked me where the bathroom was &#8211; hah! I told her it was on the dance floor ;)), so never experienced what that was like, though I hear it&#8217;s either super awesome or super scary. Any of you guys meet your spouse online? Did you guys talk $$$ before meeting in real life?<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;55% of couples combine their money, up 4% since last year.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re combiners here too for a couple reasons: 1) it&#8217;s much easier to track and watch over when it&#8217;s all streamlined, and 2) it feels like we&#8217;re more of a &#8220;team&#8221; doing it this way, which marriage is all about! Of course, it might be different if I had trust issues or been in toxic relationships in the past so I totally get why you&#8217;d want to separate it out, but so far it&#8217;s been working out well for us.<\/p>\n<p>Another idea is to combine, but keep *one* separate account opened where you can do as you please with no questions asked :) This lets you keep some of your autonomy and freedom more, while also letting you be a bit loose and not have to worry about it affecting your major goals\/dreams.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;70% of couples share decisions around large-scale purchases&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well I would hope so!

It would be interesting to see just how much &#8220;more&#8221;, if we could even fathom that! But I shouldn&#8217;t talk much, &#8216;cuz while we did spend around average for our wedding, it looks like I rank pretty high on the price paid for the engagement ring&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;The average engagement ring spend is $2,841, up from $2,016 last year.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I spent <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/biggest-life-purchases\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$7,800<\/a> &#x1f631;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;42% of divorcees report improved financial well being after divorce, split evenly among men and women (42% and 43%).&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well that seems encouraging!
