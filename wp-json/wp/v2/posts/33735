Meaning it&#8217;s not as simple any more of taking a check or getting it fixed :(<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the bad news out of all this. The GOOD news, of course, is that they&#8217;re going to compensate me for the whole thing once I make up my mind which of the two routes I want to take. And at the moment, I&#8217;m at a total loss (no pun intended).<\/p>\n<p>Here are my two options:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Take a check for $2,100 and be on my merry way.<\/strong> I can choose to use the money to pay for most of the damages (the total damage came out to $2,500 per their estimates), or I can pocket it and see how long I can get away with driving it a little busted up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Take a check for $3,500 and leave my car with them.<\/strong> Their fancy system thinks it&#8217;s worth about $3,500 by the time the car and taxes and everything comes into play (more than the $2k KBB shows for it), so they&#8217;re pretty much offering to buy it from me outright and be done with it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now. Half of you probably think my poor sweet car is a pile of junk, and thus would take the $3,500 and get the hell out of there, but to ME, she&#8217;s a beauty :) I take her out for a spin blaring some hip-hop and all kinds of players and pimps give me head nods while the ladies start throwing their panties my way, haha&#8230; Well maybe not the latter, but most definitely the former. It&#8217;s the perfect ride for a blogger who just wants to feel good in his car and get excited every time he turns that key. Even if it&#8217;s a little ghetto and\/or grandpa like (funny how both connotations can come with the same car too).<\/p>\n<p><strong>So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m currently left with right now until I let them know how I&#8217;d like to proceed.<\/strong> I want to get y&#8217;alls opinions here in a bit, but before I do let me just brain dump all the pros and cons I can think of for each scenario first to give you a better picture of where my mind is at. I wish it was just a simple cut and dry choice!<\/p>\n<h2>Option #1: Taking the money and running.<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I get to keep enjoying my car!<\/li>\n<li>I get over two thousand dollars to do with as I please!<\/li>\n<li>My car still drives\/looks fine albeit w\/ a few minor dings.<\/li>\n<li>On the other hand, my car will now be reported as a &#8220;total loss&#8221; on the record :(<\/li>\n<li>Meaning it&#8217;ll be much harder to sell or trade in down the road&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>And I&#8217;m not even sure it&#8217;ll pass a safety inspection when we have to get the next one done.<\/li>\n<li>Or that the $2,100 would even cover all the needed fixes in that case?<\/li>\n<li>Which also means the $2,100 isn&#8217;t to &#8220;do with what I please&#8221; anymore :(<\/li>\n<li>And lastly, who knows when my car will eventually die out anyways? It&#8217;s over 20 years old!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>\u00a0Option #2: Selling my car to them<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I get a check for $3,500!!! Way more than I would if I sold it (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/net-worth-update-april-2013\/\">by $1,500<\/a>, probably)<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t have to worry about any car inspections or selling it later.<\/li>\n<li>Or it breaking down when least expected&#8230; especially if Baby Money was with me.<\/li>\n<li>But then I have no car :( Which, may be fine once we&#8217;re settled into our new home since most things will be walkable, but it&#8217;s still scary to be car-less when you&#8217;ve owned one your entire life.<\/li>\n<li>I also don&#8217;t know how the hell I&#8217;m going to find a replaceable car that I like so much??<\/li>\n<li>And on the CHEAP for that matter? <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/07\/i-just-bought-caddy-and-i-slapped-it-on\/\">I paid $3,100 for this caddy almost exactly 5 years ago<\/a> (on credit card, if you recall;)) and have been living car payment-less ever since.<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also don&#8217;t even want to THINK about car shopping anytime soon while we&#8217;re moving&#8230; too many things to do all at the same time :( And it takes me forever to finally choose a car anyways.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Lots and lots to think about over here&#8230; Now on the plus side, our statute of limitations in Maryland gives us a few years to accept a claim so I def. have enough time to think on it, haha&#8230; Not that I&#8217;d ever want to wait that long of course. But at least I don&#8217;t have to decide over night. Or when the Progessive guy asked if I wanted to leave my car there right on the spot &#8211; I was like whaaaa?? How would I get home?? :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s funny. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/got-in-a-car-accident-yesterday\/\">You get in a car accident that isn&#8217;t your fault<\/a>, but none of the options to resolve the situation seem to make the most sense.<\/strong> I can&#8217;t even choose &#8220;just fix it back up to normal, please&#8221; &#8211; ya know? I either have to PAY money to get it back to snuff (and I&#8217;m sure the &#8220;total loss&#8221; is still on the record either way), or I give up the car completely and start all over again. Doesn&#8217;t seem real fair to be honest with you, even though I can understand the reasoning behind it by insurance companies (hard to justify putting more into a car than it&#8217;s worth &#8211; even though it&#8217;s not their car!!<\/p>\n<p>But such is life, I suppose. We gotta do our best to roll with the punches&#8230; Now to just figure out which option to choose though! Again, at a total loss here as to which is better than the other. I feel like Option #1 is best for the short term, but Option #2 is best for the long term. And I&#8217;m not quite ready to depart with my poor baby yet at least until after the move, so who knows&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Which option would YOU take? After reading all my thoughts on each?<\/strong><\/em> (Which you have to do for me so you can better understand my dilemma\u00a0 here. If you don&#8217;t you&#8217;re liable to choose based on your personal taste of cars! :)) Pretend this is YOUR car that you love and enjoy dearly, and then you&#8217;re hit with these choices. After getting hit in a crash too, mind you.<\/p>\n<p>HELP!
