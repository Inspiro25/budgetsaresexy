All included!<\/li>\n<li>So I said, &#8220;awesome &#8211; we&#8217;ll buy it!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>A few days later the delivery men came but one of the pieces was broken so they had to ship it back to get fixed (annoying, but things happen)<\/li>\n<li>Noticed the ottoman didn&#8217;t show up, however, so reached back out to our sales rep who stated he was sorry for the mix up but it was not added to the order<\/li>\n<li>I asked him if I could just swing by the store and grab it sometime, and he said it wasn&#8217;t included in the sales price so it&#8217;ll be an extra $300 if I want it.<\/li>\n<li>I told him I DO want it, but I&#8217;m confused and certainly don&#8217;t want to spend an extra $300 for something I was told would be included?!<\/li>\n<li>We debate a bit, and I finally ask him if he has any suggestions before I escalate it up the chain<\/li>\n<li>He says no, but he&#8217;s sorry again for the mess up<\/li>\n<li>I proceed to call customer service who refers me back to the store<\/li>\n<li>I call back the store and they don&#8217;t answer the phone<\/li>\n<li>I call back the customer service line (corporate, basically) and they once again refer me back to the store<\/li>\n<li>They forward me over while on the phone and a representative at the store says they can&#8217;t help me as all ottomans cost extra<\/li>\n<li>I tell them I&#8217;m aware of that now, however that was not what was told to me prior to the purchase so I&#8217;d like to speak to a manager<\/li>\n<li>The manager hops on the phone and asks if I looked at the itemized sales receipt before I signed on the line to fulfill the purchase, and I say yes<\/li>\n<li>He asked if I saw &#8220;ottoman&#8221; on there, and I say no<\/li>\n<li>He asks why I continued the purchase then, and I told him I just assumed it was all included &#8211; just like the pillows that were not itemized on the sheet however there are 2 of them sitting in my living room right now<\/li>\n<li>He doesn&#8217;t answer me but says I should have said something<\/li>\n<li>I agree &#8211; and tell him it was my fault for not double checking and trusting the sales rep<\/li>\n<li>He says he&#8217;s sorry but would be happy to ship me the ottoman as soon as I pay the $300<\/li>\n<li>I tell him that&#8217;s not going to happen and ask if he has any suggestions before I escalate it further<\/li>\n<li>He offers to give me a $50 gift card and advised me to take it<\/li>\n<li>I politely decline, though thank him for trying to work with me<\/li>\n<li>I call customer service again and ask to speak to a manager there<\/li>\n<li>They refer me back to the store as all stores are privately owned (?) and they can&#8217;t change any pricing or wave fees<\/li>\n<li>I ask if it&#8217;s possible to just return the whole thing then because we can&#8217;t come to a resolution<\/li>\n<li>They say &#8220;all sales are final&#8221; but to talk to &#8220;Bob&#8221; at the store<\/li>\n<li>I ask who &#8220;Bob&#8221; is and they say he&#8217;s &#8220;the top manager&#8221; at the specific store and is scheduled to be there today<\/li>\n<li>I call &#8220;Bob&#8221; and he is not there, but will return on Saturday<\/li>\n<li>Saturday comes and we finally connect&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Now if you&#8217;re still reading this, I&#8217;ll stop you there and ask you real quick what you would do at this point so far? ;)<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Would you continue to keep fighting it, knowing exactly what you heard and what you were led to believe? Or would you finally just give in and either do without the stupid ottoman or pony up the $300 to complete your set? (Or do you go balls to the wall and do what it takes to get that refund out of principle??!)<\/p>\n<p>I talked it over with my wife, but in the meantime tried one other avenue that has been known to work from time to time&#8230; And of course that avenue is taking it to social media ;)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I private message my concerns on Twitter (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AshleyHomeStore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@AshleyHomeStore<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I receive no response back<\/li>\n<li>I find their &#8220;customer care&#8221; handle (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ashleyhomehelp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@AshleyHomeHelp<\/a>) which states &#8220;a community manager is actively listening between the hours of 9-5pm EST&#8221; and send them a private message there too<\/li>\n<li>I receive no response back<\/li>\n<li>I send a *<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BudgetsAreSexy\/status\/1202603079197179906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public<\/a>* message tagging them in case that gets their attention which said: &#8220;Anyone ever have issues with @AshleyHomeStore ?! Ordered a brand new couch for the first time in my life and having a dickens of a time getting what I paid for&#8230; (after of course spending 2 hours bouncing between customer service centers &#x1f643; )&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>They respond! &#8220;We\u2019re sorry for the delay. Please send us a PM with your contact information, store location and confirmation, so we can see what the holdup is.

And after researching it more and learning of possible &#8220;restocking fees&#8221; and the fact places rarely return *shipping* costs either, we&#8217;d have to commit for the long haul.<\/p>\n<p>And then Saturday came!!!<\/p>\n<p>And do you know what happened?!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Bob&#8221; called me!! Before I could even call him! Here&#8217;s how it went down:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>He calls us and immediately apologizes for us having a bad experience so far (thank you!!)<\/li>\n<li>He tells us their sales rep&#8217;s side of things, but states it doesn&#8217;t even matter because at the end of the day we&#8217;re unhappy and it needs to be fixed (which was nice to hear, especially as the rep&#8217;s story has now changed for a third time)<\/li>\n<li>He says he&#8217;d love to resolve this right here on the phone and offers to give us the ottoman at &#8220;cost&#8221; if we still want it &#8211; which comes out to $150<\/li>\n<li>I tell him I think that&#8217;s a fair compromise and he adds it to our scheduled shipment of our broken-but-now-fixed other part of the couch<\/li>\n<li>I thank him for resolving it once and for all :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So a somewhat happy ending to the story, though definitely not going to be taking the chance again with them in the future, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>But what do you think? Would you have taken the deal or kept fighting? Was I in the wrong here or could you relate? Have you ever had any experiences w\/ Ashley before, good or bad?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I debated on whether to even share this publicly or not, but after the failed attempts on social (and giving them ample opportunity to talk with me!) I felt it was something worth mentioning in case it helps just one other person avoid this frustration down the line :(<\/p>\n<p>Super great couches and prices there, but not the best customer service in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Though to be fair, when I asked the community about them some of you did say you&#8217;ve had great experiences with Ashley, so perhaps I was just unlucky ;) Along with the few others who also had not so great experiences with them&#8230; (you can see the chain <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BudgetsAreSexy\/status\/1202603079197179906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> if you&#8217;d like)<\/p>\n<p><strong>At any rate, upward and onward!
