Get out and run for the hills!!&#8221; haha&#8230; and then I threw up a little in my mouth.  J\/K, but I would have had we been switched ;)<\/p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t guessed it already (or this is your first time on my blog), I&#8217;m <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/10\/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house\/\">not the biggest fan of home ownership<\/a> right now.  Or more accurately stated &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe owning a home is for *everyone*.  It&#8217;s for a lot of people, and probably a ton more than it&#8217;s not for, but I think too many people get caught up in the idea of it all and jump right in before really considering it (*ahem* story of my life 4 years ago).  I&#8217;m not saying my sister is doing that right now, but it does make me a little worried &#8211; esp considering she has the travel bug as much, if not worse, than I do. And that&#8217;s saying something!<\/p>\n<p><strong>6 months ago she was planning to travel around the world with her adorable little boy.<\/strong> She&#8217;d have a home base in Europe or South America somewhere (she couldn&#8217;t decide at the time), and would go off on little adventures here and there outside of work on the weekends (her plan was to get her employer to xfer her for 1-2 years). Again, not for everyone, but it goes to show the adventurous spirit my darling little sister has.  Which we all blame on our military father  ;)  3 years in one spot?  Hah!<\/p>\n<p>So as you can imagine, I was pretty shocked when all of a sudden she put in an offer to buy a home fairly close to my parents.  Which again went against her vision, haha&#8230; That being said, it could also mean that she may be growing up?  She knows she has her family as a support system near by (which is great for the wee one), and she DEF knows how affordable homes are these days &#8211; esp in the area she&#8217;s now gonna live at.  This decent sized house was literally a good $100-$150k MORE just 2 years ago!  How insane is that?  So the fact she can now afford something her and the nephew can grow up in and expand as a family, is pretty damn good.  Plus, as she told me the second I started throwing those red flags out,<em><strong> &#8220;she could always rent it out and travel around.&#8221;<\/strong><\/em> Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>I agree you can always rent houses out and\/or sell them whenever you choose to, but the odds that you physically go out of your way to do so, without a major life change hitting you, is somewhat small.<\/strong>  At least in my opinion.  Not impossible, just not as easy as I think people assume it is.  I&#8217;ve been saying I&#8217;m gonna rent out our townhouse for over a year now!  And have I gotten any closer?  Anope.  And if I were renting and wanted to move somewhere?  You think I&#8217;d have <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/10\/think-could-live-in-hotel-pros-cons-living\/\">been there<\/a> by now? Ayup!  Because every year you get to that point where you&#8217;re forced to make that decision &#8212; Do you renew your lease, or do you move out?  You gotta make a move, and there&#8217;s a sense of real urgency there.  And when you own your own house?  Forget about it.  Outside from crazy changes, it&#8217;s really 100% on YOU to get out there and do something about it.  Something I yammer on about all day long, but know very damn well it&#8217;s even hard for me to do at times.  Esp when it comes to our dang freakin&#8217; house. I miss my freedom!<\/p>\n<p>Wow, this post is starting to get long, haha&#8230;.(that&#8217;s what she said).  <strong>My point to everything here is this:  Home ownership is not for everyone. <\/strong> It&#8217;s for a lot of people, but not for every last one of us Americans &#8211; and I point out our country not cuz it&#8217;s different in other cultures, but just that here we literally sell it as the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; and it&#8217;s very important to take a step back and REALLY ask yourself if it&#8217;s YOUR dream.  Not society&#8217;s dream, or your parents&#8217; dream, or even your wallet&#8217;s dream. YOUR dream. <em>Just because something&#8217;s financially smart, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s right.<\/em> A house purchase is the biggest purchase you&#8217;ll ever make in your life &#8211; make sure you truly want it!<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day though, even if I don&#8217;t understand it completely, I&#8217;m gonna give my little sis the benefit of the doubt and support her as best I can.  I&#8217;ve now said my piece and it&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s gonna change her mind anyways! haha&#8230; we&#8217;re all gonna do what we wanna do, right? At least she was smart enough to have tons of money saved up. 2 years of living at home can do WONDERS for your financial situation ;)  I would gladly move back into my old room for a couple of years if I could!  Haha&#8230;  that&#8217;s all sorts of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/08\/living-minimalist-lifestyle-is-it\/\">minimalism<\/a>! (don&#8217;t tell my wife though)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, sister, if you happen to be reading this right now, I love you. I support you. And I wish you nothing but happiness!<\/strong> Honestly, truly. It may scare the bejesus outta me still, but more power to you if you can rock it out :) If you need anything at all let us know!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Emoticons by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/somegeekintn\/\">somegeekintn<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know I should be happy for her right now, but the first thought that came to my mind was &#8220;Nooooooooooooo!!!!
