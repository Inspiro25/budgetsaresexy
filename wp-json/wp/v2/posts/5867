They struggled to start the season, and of late have come to dominate their opponents.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been following them a little more closely ever since Lebron uttered the words \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 my talents to South Beach.\u201d\u00a0 I knew it would be an entertaining ride watching three superstars try to mesh their individual skills in the team oriented sport that is professional basketball.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now that it\u2019s the mid-point of the season, I\u2019ve had some time to reflect on their early struggles and recent success. <\/strong> Early on in the season they were still feeling themselves out and I saw that they were definitely still used to \u201cbeing the man\u201d on their own teams.\u00a0 Now it looks as if they\u2019ve figured out how to work together.<\/p>\n<p>As I was thinking, it occurred to me that we (those of us who struggle with our finances) could learn a lot from the Miami Heat this season.\u00a0 A wise man once said, &#8220;sports are a metaphor for life,&#8221; so as basketball goes, so does your finances (I think it might have been former Vice President Cheney who said, about the slow progress in Afghanistan, \u201c&#8221;It&#8217;s sometimes 3 yards and a cloud of dust. There&#8217;s no home run&#8230;ur, touchdown\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>In other words, a successful team should exhibit the same qualities that a financially successful person would, if we look close enough, that is.<\/p>\n<h2>So what can we learn from the struggling Miami Heat basketball team?<\/h2>\n<p>Plenty.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) You can\u2019t just freestyle with your budget and go \u201cone-on-one\u201d with your finances. <\/strong> What does that mean?\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/07\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\">written budget<\/a> or spending plan, telling every penny of your income what to do.\u00a0 You have got to have some discipline here too.\u00a0 The budget is your game plan month in and month out, so once you\u2019ve created something that works for you, stick to it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) No matter how good your individual talent is, you have to work as a team in order to win..<\/strong> If you are married, or share expenses with someone, you\u2019ve got to work together or even the best game plans won\u2019t work.\u00a0 Having secret spending habits, or keeping credit card purchases from your partner, will spell disaster sooner or later&#8230;and not just for your finances.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>3) You can\u2019t just go out and \u201cget your own to pad your stats\u201d and expect to win (or make your teammates happy). <\/strong> Once personal finance becomes all about \u201cyou,\u201d you\u2019ve lost sight of the big picture.\u00a0 Yes, you should <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/10\/easiest-way-to-be-financially-confident\/\">keep track of your progress<\/a> and make sure you spend within your means.\u00a0 But don\u2019t lose sight of the big picture.<\/p>\n<p>Sticking to a budget, living frugally, and saving money consistently makes the future more sustainable for everyone.\u00a0 Cultivating and honing your frugality will lessen your impact on the planet\u2019s resources.\u00a0 Saving consistently for your own future will lessen your impact on financial resources of future generations.\u00a0 Its not all about \u201cyour stats\u201d or \u201cgetting yours,\u201d its about living a more sustainable life and that benefits everyone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Making progress takes time, especially if you have new teammates.<\/strong> If you are just starting to track your spending, making a budget for the first time, or figuring out just how much damage you\u2019ve done by borrowing money, seeing progress takes time and you are likely to fall down in the beginning.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>In other words, you can\u2019t expect immediate results or to be \u201cgood\u201d at the game of personal finance right away.\u00a0 Especially if you are $50,000 in debt and only make $30,000 a year, have never tracked your spending, or can\u2019t resist the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/12\/thanks-latte-starbucks\/\">daily latte<\/a>.\u00a0 Don\u2019t give up.\u00a0 Keep plugging away at your debt until you\u2019ve conquered it.\u00a0 Work harder, two jobs if that&#8217;s what it takes, just keep at it.\u00a0 If budgeting is your problem, keep refining yours it until it works for you.\u00a0 The point is to keep going until you succeed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5) Finally, its never too late to get back on track.<\/strong> The Miami Heat may have struggled early in the season, but now that its mid-season they\u2019ve gotten it together and by the time the playoffs begin they will be among the favorites to win it all.<\/p>\n<p>If you are struggling with your finances right now and feel hopeless, just remember everyone has to start somewhere. Whether you are $500,000 in debt or just inherited $500,000, it\u2019s not where you start, it\u2019s where you finish.\u00a0 So if you are frustrated, hopeless, or just don\u2019t know where to begin&#8230;<br \/>\n<em><strong>just start<\/strong><\/em>.\u00a0 Too often we become paralyzed to start something because of the enormity of the task.\u00a0 Just by starting though, you can begin to find your direction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6) *Bonus lesson*: You\u2019ve got to play great defense.<\/strong> No matter how good your offense is (your ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">create an income<\/a>), you\u2019ve got to play good defense to win.\u00a0 Good defense means watching your expenses, eliminating unnecessary purchases (defined as superfluous purchases that don\u2019t give you any real personal value or fulfillment), and saving for your future while meeting your current responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>There was never any need to panic over the Heat\u2019s early struggles.\u00a0 They always had the tools to be a great team and succeed.<\/p>\n<p>I suspect too, that you have the tools to succeed financially and you can, and will, succeed if you use these 5 principles in your own life. Stay in the game and don\u2019t give up, and eventually you too will win financially.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em><strong>Guest post by <\/strong><strong>Stu at Pennywise2Pennyworth.com<\/strong> &#8212; a teacher who decided to blog about personal finance after trying to teach high schoolers how to become millionaires&#8230; and decided he&#8217;d better up his game to make personal finance more interesting. \u00a0He wants to help you to grow your financial worth through wise decisions and have fun while you do it. \u00a0Check him out at <\/em><em><\/em><em>pennywise2pennyworth.com<\/em><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/stuseeger\/\">StuSeeger<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Guest Post by Stu at Pennywise 2 Pennyworth) The Miami Heat have already had an up and down year.
