Just further proof we all have it in us to rock this stuff if we really care enough to make it happen! And it doesn&#8217;t matter where you&#8217;re starting out either, so long as you actually *start*.<\/p>\n<p>First up, this message from <em><strong>Twoee<\/strong><\/em> left on our article about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\">the power of doing just one thing<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>OK, so I am making a commitment to max out my IRA. My mother-in-law challenged me to try her way of saving. I didn&#8217;t even think I had funds to do this. I work part time and my husband had just been laid off.<\/p>\n<p>Well, I am proud to say I have been saving $200 a month since Jan of this year! I have paid off more than 50% of my credit card debt and all of my bills are current and on time. This is major motivation for someone who had nothing 7 yrs ago.<\/p>\n<p>Now I have found this blog to help me stay focused! I am going to get to 50% of my income then go full time and do 75% of my income. If it takes me until I am 50 (currently 32) at least I know it&#8217;s possible and I did it so I can teach my kids to do the same. I will end the poverty cycle in my family!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>YES! It <em>is<\/em> possible!<\/strong> Lots of people have managed <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/12\/proof-you-can-live-off-50-of-your-income\/\" target=\"_blank\">to save 50% or more<\/a> of their incomes &#8211; keep going! I smiled like crazy reading this the first time around too about breaking that poverty cycle, man&#8230; Amazing what can happen when you really commit to something important, right? Love to hear this stuff&#8230; Way to go, Twoeee!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another one by <em><strong>naughtygrog<\/strong><\/em> on last week&#8217;s article on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/04\/money-epiphany\/\" target=\"_blank\">having your money epiphany<\/a>&#8230; I have no idea what a &#8220;naughty grog&#8221; is, haha, but it sounds like a helluva great band name ;)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My financial epiphany is ongoing and only kicked off 3 months ago. But in that 3 months I\u2019ve managed to get things moving in a much better direction.<\/p>\n<p>We paid off a nearly $600.00 payday loan and have tracked every dime spent in the last 3 months. We are in the process of building a budget. This has been a process because we had no earthly idea what we were spending but we should have it locked down this upcoming month.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m super excited to say that in that 3 months we\u2019ve managed to SAVE just south of $400 bucks. This would have been completely unheard of 6 months ago.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>BOOM! Tracking your money &#8211; especially for the first time &#8211; does amazing things, no doubt&#8230;<\/strong> If you don&#8217;t know where the hell all your money is going, how can you figure out what to improve?<\/p>\n<p>This was one of the first things I did when having my own epiphany 8 years ago too&#8230; And I learned quick that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/have-money-left-over-each-month\/\" target=\"_blank\">I was leaking $200 every month<\/a> when in my head I thought I was SAVING $200\/mo. How you miss a difference of $400 is beyond me, but the only way I caught on was because I was tracking it all! And 3 months usually gives you enough time to start seeing the patterns.<\/p>\n<p>(As an aside, the beautiful part about getting your money down is that once you get good at it and learn how you work, you can let up on the details a bit and coast more. You won&#8217;t hear many financial bloggers or &#8220;experts&#8221; tell you this, but there&#8217;s something to be said about being good with your money 80-90% of the time than driving yourself crazy at the full 100%. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with tracking every penny forever either &#8211; just that most people tend to burn out over time.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then here&#8217;s a note I just received yesterday from a kid who&#8217;s figured out more than some adults ever will:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My brother!<\/p>\n<p>How&#8217;s it going J?<\/p>\n<p>My name&#8217;s Carl. I&#8217;m an 18 year old, motivated teenager in this big scary world! I&#8217;ve recently moved to the U.S. to chase my dreams, and I stumbled across your blog a few weeks ago while doing my usual nightly financial research. It is one of my favourite things to read now!!<\/p>\n<p>I have dreams of being financially secure, raising a family and doing some cool things with my life. And your blog has made me believe that it really is possible. I need to work hard and track my spendings. I have a dream of being a successful day trader and be able to make other investments such as real estate etc. People have told me that I have unrealistic dreams and need a reality check but I ain&#8217;t listening to a word. I&#8217;m gonna live the life I want to live and nobody&#8217;s gonna stop me.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m working as a sales associate really right now, earning poor money and not getting the hours that I desire to be able to actually save up some money and begin my journey. I&#8217;m not getting myself down though, I know it&#8217;s all part of the process and I&#8217;ll get where I want to be in good time.<\/p>\n<p>Keep up what you&#8217;re doing!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. Maybe one day if you&#8217;re lucky, I&#8217;ll lend you my Lamborghini for a weekend as a &#8220;thank you&#8221; for the motivation and financial advice you put out ;)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yessir, I&#8217;d gladly grab that lambo for a day and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2012\/06\/28\/king-for-just-one-day\/\" target=\"_blank\">live like a king<\/a> :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But seriously, how many lessons did you see hiding in there that most people take a lifetime to understand?

You never know what having an online platform will open up (I never dreamed I&#8217;d become a blogger for a career?), and since there&#8217;s no barrier to entry anymore and it&#8217;s super flexible, you hold a lot of the control.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mix that with an insane drive and some positivity and you&#8217;ve got a recipe for success!
