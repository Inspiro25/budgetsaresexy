Even before I graduated college, I focused on developing a side income by selling stuff on eBay.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/street-fighter-video-game.jpg\" alt=\"street fighter video game\" width=\"200\" height=\"290\" border=\"0\" \/><strong>It started with me selling my own junk on eBay. <\/strong>When I went to college and moved into my first \u201creal place\u201d, my parents brought over all my kid stuff and said, \u201chere you go\u201d. Well, I didn\u2019t want any of this stuff, but I didn\u2019t want to give it away. So, I took to eBay.<\/p>\n<p>After about a year I\u2019d exhausted all of my own junk to sell, so I started selling other people\u2019s stuff. It started with friends and family, and soon it moved to buying items at estate sales and selling them on eBay. This is when my side hustle income really started increasing, and I was enjoying being able to do this in my spare time.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Idea for Estate Sales<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The more I bought from <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-find-estate-sale-deals-from-a-beverly-hills-bargain-hunter\/\">estate sales<\/a>, however, the more I started feeling bad&#8230;\u00a0 I felt bad because I felt like I was taking advantage of a situation. I would regularly buy items at estate sales for $1, and then turn around and sell them for $100.<\/p>\n<p>But that gave me an idea \u2013<em> the idea to be different in the estate sale space<\/em>. What if I could create an estate sale company that not only helped the owner\/family maximize their profits, but I got to get \u201cfirst dibs\u201d on the good stuff and a cut of the profits? I did a bit of homework of local estate sale companies and realized that nobody was really offering this.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Founding San Diego Estate Sales<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>So, with that goal in mind, I founded <em>San Diego Estate Sales<\/em> and built a website to be legit. This was really my first foray into building websites, and I have to admit, the website sucked. I built it using a template that had my basic info \u2013 I didn\u2019t know anything about SEO, and I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing. I did design my own header though (admire the basics pictured at the top!)<\/p>\n<p>Without even knowing it, there were only about 5 full time estate sale companies in San Diego, and only one other company had the name \u201cSan Diego\u201d in their name. So my site ended up ranking very high in search, and I quickly started getting leads for customers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Running the Estate Sale Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As the leads started coming in, I had to actually figure out <em>how<\/em> I was going to do this. So, I started with my first client \u2013 and I\u2019ll always remember her because she was selling her mother\u2019s pottery and other miscellaneous items.<\/p>\n<p>I went to her house on a Saturday for a consultation. She had taken home a lot items, but left <a href=\"https:\/\/millennialmoney.com\/sell-used-furniture\/\">used furniture<\/a>, a few cabinets full of knick-knacks, most of the kitchen items, and her car.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/roseville-pottery.jpg\" alt=\"roseville pottery\" width=\"200\" height=\"218\" border=\"0\" \/>As I was digging around, I immediately recognized something from my eBay days \u2013 <strong><em>Roseville Pottery<\/em><\/strong> (pictured on the right). The lady didn\u2019t even know what it was, but I informed her that a lot of these items would fetch a nice amount if we sold them outside of an estate sale. She took my word for it, and I told her I would be in touch soon.<\/p>\n<p>After figuring out some estimates and the amount of stuff (plus my time), I suggested that we sell the pottery online, and then we host a 2-day estate sale on the following Saturday and Sunday for the other items. I told her we could advertise the car, and if it didn\u2019t sell, I could help her sell it or she could keep it.<\/p>\n<p>She agreed to it, and we were on for our first estate sale.<\/p>\n<h2>The Estate Sale Business Model<\/h2>\n<p>The basic business model of estate sales is commission based on what is sold. My commission structure was <strong><em>20% of online sales after fees<\/em><\/strong> (so the seller would typically net 60% or so). For physical estate sales, I charged <em><strong>50% commission<\/strong>, <\/em>and that included all of my fees<em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I also offered a variety of add-on services, like cleanup after the sale. Basically, anything that didn\u2019t sell, we would donate or toss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally depending on the items, other venues would be a better way to sell them.<\/strong> My business model was completely based on getting the highest price \u2013 it benefited the seller and me.\u00a0 As such, I\u2019ve also done consignment (especially for artwork) and auctions (for coins).\u00a0 Think <a href=\"http:\/\/coins.ha.com\/c\/index.zx\">Heritage<\/a> and Teletrade (coin collectors will know what this means).<\/p>\n<h3><strong>My First Estate Sale<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>So, for my first estate sale, it was just my wife (at that time she was just my girlfriend), her sister, and me. It was a very small house, and not much to sell, but it was a great starting point.<\/p>\n<p>I learned the key to a great estate sale was advertising \u2013 online, Craigslist, and the local paper. While advertising in the newspaper is expensive (upwards of $100), it is totally worth every penny. Also, you need to litter the neighborhood with signs. For our estate sales, we typically had 10+ signs at all major intersections and routes towards the house.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/estate-sale-invoice.png\" alt=\"estate sale invoice\" width=\"215\" height=\"181\" border=\"0\" \/><strong>Our setup was simple<\/strong> \u2013 table by the garage with my wife, who would take diligent notes on what sold and for how much. Her sister would be by the other door, and I would be in the house to answer questions and haggle.<\/p>\n<p>My wife would keep diligent records in Excel on her laptop, which we would turn into an invoice at the end for the seller. We would put as much detail as possible, but for a lot of stuff, it was just a generic title (i.e. tools).<\/p>\n<p><strong>When everything was said and done, we would tally everything up and provide the seller with a detailed receipt and a check for the amount.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In my experience, a typical sale that I hosted would break down as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gross Sales:<\/strong> $5,000 (with $500 to $1,000 coming from online)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fees:<\/strong> $200<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advertising Expenses:<\/strong> $250<\/li>\n<li><strong>Labor (Wife\u2019s Sister):<\/strong> $200 (I would give her $100 per day, about $10 per hour)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Seller Net:<\/strong> $2,400<\/li>\n<li><strong>My Net:<\/strong> $1,950<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My best year was about three years ago, and saw us net about $10,000 running 5 estate sales.<\/p>\n<h2>The Pros and Cons of Estate Sales<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/old-vending-machine.jpg\" alt=\"old vending machine\" width=\"200\" height=\"317\" border=\"0\" \/>Running estate sales was a lot of fun!\u00a0 As someone who loves going to them, I find that I\u2019m in my element buying and selling, haggling a little, and just talking to people. Plus, you never know what you\u2019re going to find \u2013 I\u2019ve encountered just about everything, from rare coins to nasty molded furniture. Given my background, I\u2019m also very frugal, so I like getting a good deal \u2013 both when buying and when selling.<\/p>\n<p>Given the market and lack of competition, I think that it\u2019s pretty easy for anyone to get started with estate sales \u2013 <em>if you have the time<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And that\u2019s the biggest con \u2013 time.<\/strong> Estate sales take time, from finding clients, to putting everything together, to giving up a weekend to do the event. I found that the max I could do was one per month, and even that was pushing it. Working full time and trying to balance this was tough. Plus, I never even got that many going. The most I ever did was five in a year, plus a variety of other selling online or elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>However, the income for the amount of work, I felt, was pretty decent. To earn the $1,950, I would say that we put in about 50 hours of work between my wife and I, including the day of the event. That\u2019s about $39 per hour, which isn\u2019t too bad. Plus, I considered anything I was able to sell online as a bonus, since the time commitment was less and the reward was a bit higher!<\/p>\n<h3><b>Side Hustles and Estate Sales Today<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>As I mentioned, the time constraint for doing an estate sale is the biggest drawback and roadblock to getting started, and for us, continuing to do them. I wasn\u2019t able to host a single estate sale last year, and so I finally decided to let my website lapse and fade away. I was getting leads and felt bad not being able to respond to potential clients.<\/p>\n<p>However, it just shows that the market is there. I\u2019m finding that more and more people are searching online for estate sale companies, and yet, many of the \u201colder\u201d estate sale companies haven\u2019t made the move online yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m out of the side hustle game just yet.<\/strong> In fact, I\u2019m totally about developing multiple income streams, and am working towards a new goal of beating the nine to five by becoming an entrepreneur. I\u2019ve just moved towards activities that require less time, and are more flexible around my schedule. With a baby on the way, you can\u2019t be giving up full weekends for estate sales, even if it is a lot of fun and makes a nice side income.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Are any of you fans of estate sales?
