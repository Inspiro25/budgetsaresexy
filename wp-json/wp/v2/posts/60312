Haha&#8230; It&#8217;s amazing how fast you can adapt to stuff when it comes up in life!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So keep on sending over positive vibes please!! I&#8217;m hopeful our house is out there!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And in the meantime, it&#8217;s been head down in the *financial* aspect over here which should be no surprise to anyone that it&#8217;s been the most fun part of the process ;)<\/p>\n<p>After getting pre-approved through two different places so far (USAA and a mortgage broker recommended by our realtor), it looks like we&#8217;re hovering in the <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$650k-$800k<\/strong><\/span> range of what we can &#8220;afford&#8221; based on their assessments, which of course has nothing to do with what we can REALLY afford, but at least looks good on paper ;)<\/p>\n<p>Our true budget is actually closer to<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong> $350k,<\/strong><\/span> and might even go down to $330k depending on which area we end up in, and I&#8217;m feeling pretty good about that since it means our mortgage will be in the mid $200&#8217;s after we plop down 20%.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which leads us to today&#8217;s question of whether it&#8217;s smart to go for a 15 year mortgage and save THOUSANDS on interest as well as a quicker pay off, or keep it nice and safe with a 30 year and much lower payments in case money&#8217;s tight some months\/years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve hinted in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/home-searching-advice-for-first-time-buyers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous articles<\/a> that I was set on the 15 year since we can fortunately afford it and it&#8217;ll only push me to paying off the mortgage faster, however surprisingly I&#8217;ve gotten a few comments from people I respect on how the 30 year is a much better option to go. Despite the savings!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of them I&#8217;ll single out, just because it comes from a financial journalist and author who you&#8217;d expect to say the opposite ;) Per, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kathykristof.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kathy Kristof<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I promise to stop popping off after this&#8230; BUT&#8230; Buy a house that you can afford with a <span class=\"il\">15<\/span>&#8211;<span class=\"il\">year<\/span> mortgage, but <span class=\"il\">get<\/span> the 30-<span class=\"il\">year<\/span> mortgage. Why? You can pay it off in <span class=\"il\">15<\/span> years, if you want. But, if something goes wrong &#8212; you lose a job; have a big financial crisis that needs to be addressed, etc. &#8212; the 30 <span class=\"il\">year<\/span> mortgage gives you the flexibility to drop down to the cheaper payment, without jeopardizing your house.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"il\">People<\/span> <span class=\"il\">get<\/span> <span class=\"il\">enamored<\/span> with the <span class=\"il\">idea<\/span> of <span class=\"il\">saving<\/span> <span class=\"il\">all<\/span> this <span class=\"il\">money<\/span> with the <span class=\"il\">15<\/span>&#8211;<span class=\"il\">year<\/span> <span class=\"il\">loan<\/span>. But the interest rate on this <span class=\"il\">loan<\/span> is only slightly cheaper than the interest rate on the 30-<span class=\"il\">year<\/span> <span class=\"il\">loan<\/span>. And for that slight differential, you buy yourself a TON of flexibility. Again, there&#8217;s no penalty for paying off a 30-<span class=\"il\">year<\/span> <span class=\"il\">loan<\/span> in <span class=\"il\">15<\/span> (or 10 for the matter), but you don&#8217;t have to&#8230;.<span class=\"im\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"il\">Enamored<\/span>\u00a0 &#8211; hah! That&#8217;s me! :) But I&#8217;ll agree on her points of flexibility here, as that&#8217;s exactly the loan we had ourselves the first time around and it was nice to be able to make extra payments whenever we wanted but weren&#8217;t forced to. Not that we knew what we were doing back then anyways, haha&#8230; We literally bought a house <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with no money down and financed 100% of it<\/a> (!!!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But I do wonder if now, with over 10 years of wealth building and *learning* under our belts, we <em>could<\/em> better withstand the volatility of life over the years? And if so, wouldn&#8217;t it be best to maximize the savings?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kathy&#8217;s right that the 15 year rates are only &#8220;slightly cheaper&#8221; than 30&#8217;s, but a fraction of a percentage point &#8211; or in our case when I first got quoted &#8211; almost .75% of a point! &#8211; can still make a helluva difference over the long term!<\/p>\n<p>Check out this quick comparison off google&#8217;s mortgage calculator I just did to put it in better perspective&#8230; I&#8217;m using $280,000 as the mortgage since we&#8217;re putting down 20%, and I left the default interest rate alone since it looks about right anyways w\/ our credit scores:<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">30 year mortgage @ 3.92%<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-60323 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/30-year-mortgage-calculator.jpg\" alt=\"30 year mortgage calculator\" width=\"582\" height=\"247\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/30-year-mortgage-calculator.jpg 960w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/30-year-mortgage-calculator-300x128.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/30-year-mortgage-calculator-768x326.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(A total of $476,597 &#8211; crazy!!!))<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">15 year mortgage @ 3.17%<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(0.75% less than the default rate)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-60322 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/15-year-mortgage-calculator.jpg\" alt=\"15 year mortgage calculator\" width=\"584\" height=\"248\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/15-year-mortgage-calculator.jpg 960w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/15-year-mortgage-calculator-300x128.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/15-year-mortgage-calculator-768x326.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>As you can see, that&#8217;s not exactly &#8220;slightly cheaper!&#8221;<\/strong> Haha&#8230; We&#8217;re talking a difference\u00a0of paying a total of $476,597 with a 30 year or a total of $352,189 with a 15! <strong>That&#8217;s <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$124,408 <\/span>less!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And sure, you can still pay more off every month and knock down that interest\/time substantially, but you&#8217;re still coming up short even with paying *the same amount* every single month like w\/ a 15:<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">30 year mortgage @ 3.92%<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(paying an extra $633\/mo)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-60324 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/extra-payments-mortgage.jpg\" alt=\"extra payments mortgage\" width=\"553\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/extra-payments-mortgage.jpg 834w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/extra-payments-mortgage-300x131.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/extra-payments-mortgage-768x334.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mortgagecalculator.org\/calculators\/what-if-i-pay-more-calculator.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgagecalculator.org<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Now this route gets you a LOT closer, saving you an additional $98,576.49 and almost 14 years off the original 30 year!, however you&#8217;re still about <strong>$26,000 short<\/strong> compared to sticking with the original 15.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, this assumes that you&#8217;re indeed contributing that $633\/every month too and not being tempted or forced to divert!
