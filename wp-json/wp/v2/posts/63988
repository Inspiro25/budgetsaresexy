Everyone has them, even early retirees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One might think that FIRE is the single biggest thing you can do to remove problems from your life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I am here to inform you, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that simply isn\u2019t the case<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cThe truth is pretty simple: All we do, all we ever do, is trade one set of problems for another.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0-Seth Godin<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t have put it any better.<br \/>\n<b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All we ever do is trade one set of problems for another. Plain and simple.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your problem is work, so you come up with a creative plan to retire early.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You work hard for years to achieve that goal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then you take the plunge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, guess what? You might have given yourself the freedom to do what you want, when you want&#8230;but you have only resolved <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your problems: work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t rid yourself of any <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/livingafi.com\/2021\/03\/17\/the-2021-early-retirement-update\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationship problems<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.routetoretire.com\/early-retirement-kids\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parenting responsibilities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/steveark.com\/2021\/09\/05\/a-look-from-the-other-side\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health issues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or even money stress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Your Problems Pre-Retirement Are Still Your Problems Post-Retirement<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I left my CEO gig to head off into my mini-retirement (eventually finding myself Accidentally Retired), it was mostly to leave the corporate bureaucracy behind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an entrepreneur, there was nothing I disliked more than not being able to hire\/fire and fully control my budget. But after selling our company to a billion-dollar public company, everything slowly but surely started to slip out of our control.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while I have left corporate bureaucracy far behind, which has resulted in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/enjoying-life\/happiness-data-visualization\/707\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happiness boost<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that hasn\u2019t taken away most of my other \u201cproblems.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I am still a parent &#8211; and parenting is stressful!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So while not a problem in the traditional sense, it is still a daily stress. I don\u2019t have as much time for myself as you would think. I\u2019ve got to be on my game for my kids in the morning, in the evenings, weekends, etc. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parenting is hard<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look, I am not trying to complain about parenting. I love my kids, I left my job to spend more time with my kids. I am actively choosing this lifestyle every day, but when you have FIREd with kids, you are really a stay-at-home parent. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/lifestyle\/15-reasons-why-being-stay-home-parent-harder-than-looks.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a stay-at-home parent is really hard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I still have family\/relationship problems. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have had the worst year of my life for family relationships. One relationship in particular has deteriorated so badly in the past year, that it will take years to fully mend it, if that is even possible. I wish I could say exactly why this happened, but it\u2019s too long, complicated, and confusing for this post.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I still stress about money<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Because my retirement was entirely unexpected and unplanned, I still have a lot of stress about money. Some of it has gone away since I fired my financial advisor and took up DIY investing, but not all!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having my money fully in my control and removing my blind spots in regards to investing has paid dividends (literally). Yet, I still stress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sequence of return risk is circling like a hawk. My hope is that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/financial\/websites-versus-real-estate\/1672\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buying a website instead of real estate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, will eventually help to smooth out some of my long-term cash flow concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I still stress about my parents and in-laws&#8217; health. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand that this is completely <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not in my control<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But there is still stress about my aging parents and my aging in-laws. Just yesterday, I had to call 911 and send the paramedics to my in-laws\u2019 house because my mother-in-law was having a health issue and called my wife instead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, it turned out to be a false alarm &#8212; a panic attack (likely). Still, time marches on and there is simply no easy way to unload this stressor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I still stress about being a good spouse.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nothing is more important to me than my wife\u2019s happiness. So I try to figure out how I can best support her. We have been together for a long time now (nearly 20 years), and even though our relationship is great overall, it is hard work! We have disagreements and minor problems that need to continue to be worked on. Plus we also need to make sure that we make space for each other, and space for our relationship.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>All of these problems were here pre-retirement. All of them remain.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Positives of FIRE Still Outweigh the Negatives<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I don\u2019t want to go on here making it seem like my life is in shambles and I regret FIRE.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do not regret it. Not. One. Bit.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But early retirement hasn&#8217;t exactly been a holy grail stress reliever.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has relieved some stress, but not all!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the benefits of FIRE outweigh the negatives any day of the week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, what we all crave is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freedom<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The freedom to do with our time what we want, whenever we want to do it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we have that freedom, our problems remain. But on the positive side, <\/span><b>now we have more time to work on them<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Can You Do to Offset Your Early Retirement Problems?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, I work at my happiness every day. I <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/resources\/happiness-tracker-spreadsheet\/502\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">track my happiness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like a runner tracks their miles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Happiness isn\u2019t something that can be improved overnight. You have to work at it, day after day.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I work at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking my happiness has helped me focus on making better daily choices that support my happiness, help me to start each day fresh, focus on being present in the moment more, and tweak my routines when they need tweaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond happiness, <\/span><b>I\u2019ve focused on my health<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I walk more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I golf more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hike more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I bike more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I work out more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve also found that<\/span><b> I enjoy being productive<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I enjoy writing. This is why I started AR. I need a purpose in my life. AR has given me that purpose, that enjoyment, and the challenge I need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I read.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I strive to be a continuous learner. And I feel like I have learned more in the last year and a half of FIRE than I have in my career as an entrepreneur and CEO (though that&#8217;s probably recency bias).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I journal.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019ve added morning pages into my routine. It gives me a chance to unload my problems to no one in particular, but unload them nonetheless. This is a huge stress reliever that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cannot understate<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I never journaled until retirement. And now it has become a big part of my daily routine that I cannot live without.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I do the things I need to do. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I am stressed about something for any period of time, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just do it<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I have the time, so there is no longer an excuse. I either need to do it, or delete it from my mind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>I am grateful. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gratitude is the ultimate problem solver. If I am having a particularly bad day, I open my journal and I list out everything (and I mean everything) that I am grateful for. From my kids, to my morning cup of coffee, to my favorite TV shows. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I write it all down<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That is one surefire way of making yourself feel better!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Life Is Simply Trading One Set of Problems for Another<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if my Accidental Retirement has taught you anything, it is that some problems will go, but others will remain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are a part of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are constantly trading one set of problems for another.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as I resolve my money stress, my family relationship issues, and this parenting hiccup or that, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new problems will crop up<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is OK. Because nothing is perfect.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You certainly cannot rid yourself of problems. Not at least if you want relationships, kids, money, or health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you want any of those good things, then the only thing we can do is accept that problems will come and problems will go, and that is part of life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just don\u2019t go expecting that your early retirement is going to be sunshine, rainbows and lollipops. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It certainly won\u2019t be that.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDid Pete cry?

They come, and they go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your happiness is not dependent on all of your problems going away, just the same as your happiness should never be dependent on people or things.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happiness is a daily pursuit, and ultimately it is a choice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I, for one, choose happiness.
