I&#8217;ve arranged my life so that I can do what I want.<br \/>\n<em>&#8211; Warren Buffett<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m a big fan of Warren Buffett, but not for the reason you may think.<\/strong> While Warren is an investing genius, there are plenty of others who have also figured out how to build vast wealth. The trait that\u00a0makes him really great is that he&#8217;s a genuinely good person with plans to give almost all of his billions away to charity. And he&#8217;s frugal too, living in the same home for most of his life.<\/p>\n<p>And I love listening to Warren&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1500days.com\/berkshire-meeting-warren-buffett-and-charlie-munger-speak\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">folksy wisdom in person every spring<\/a>. If you&#8217;re a shareholder of Warren&#8217;s company, Berkshire Hathaway, you<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>have the opportunity to\u00a0attend\u00a0the company&#8217;s annual meeting. The big party takes place in Omaha and is informally called\u00a0the &#8220;Woodstock of Capitalism.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a fun event where folks\u00a0from all over the world ask Warren anything they want during the question and answer session. My wife even asked Warren a question about real estate at the 2016 meeting. Here she is on the big screen:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53080\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/BerkshireMeeting.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/BerkshireMeeting.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/BerkshireMeeting-300x203.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>There is one question that will always stay\u00a0with me though.<\/strong> At the first meeting I attended, a 20-something year-old asked Warren what books he&#8217;d recommend for getting rich. Warren didn&#8217;t have\u00a0many recommendations, but he went on a tangent that was much more interesting. While ruminating on his age, Warren said\u00a0this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d give away every cent I have\u00a0to be your age again.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Healthy Is Better Than Wealthy<\/h2>\n<p>Warren is a wise man. As he approaches 90, he realizes his days on the\u00a0little blue-green sphere we all share are almost over. Money means less and less as we approach our expiration date.<\/p>\n<p>Health is the most important aspect of life.<\/p>\n<p>I hadn&#8217;t been taking good care of myself until recently. <a href=\"http:\/\/1500days.com\/free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Retiring early<\/a>\u00a0has allowed me to go for runs in the middle of the day or swing the kettle bell first thing in the morning. If you don&#8217;t have your health,\u00a0what else matters?<\/p>\n<h2>Relationships Are Better Than Riches<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone wants to give you advice when they hear that you&#8217;re expecting your first child. This certainly happened to me and I quickly grew tired of it. But when I was least expecting it, I received the best child-rearing advice ever.<\/p>\n<p>I was at work\u00a0when my manager called me into her office. She asked me to sit down and I thought that I was in trouble for playing pranks on my co-workers (not an uncommon occurrence). Instead, she told me that she had advice for me. I was skeptical, but her advice\u00a0blew me away:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>All your\u00a0children want is your time.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>She went on to say\u00a0that I didn&#8217;t need to buy them tons of toys or take them to Disney every year. Just give them your attention. Deep down, that&#8217;s what they really want and need.<\/p>\n<p>I walked out of her office in a daze. The advice was simple, but profound. And it made perfect sense. How many times have you seen children act out only\u00a0because they want the attention and love of their parents?\u00a0My manager&#8217;s words were completely true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>***Quick note<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re a parent reading this now on your phone, you have permission to read the rest of this article before setting your phone down and asking your children how their day was. :)<\/p>\n<h2>Hundreds of Thousands Don&#8217;t Bring You Happiness<\/h2>\n<p>I need about $40,000 per year to fund my life. Per the 4% Rule, that means that I need a nest egg of\u00a0$1,000,000. My portfolio sits at $1,400,000 and I have an additional $400,000 in home equity. For those unskilled in the ways of math, that comes out to $1,800,000.<\/p>\n<p>When\u00a0I left my job, I expected an instant boost\u00a0in my happiness.\u00a0And then it didn&#8217;t happen. I started thinking about it and had an epiphany:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The money didn&#8217;t make me happier either.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I was no happier as a millionaire than I was when I was just out of college with $60,000 in debt. Wealth\u00a0doesn&#8217;t create happiness. You must figure that out for yourself!<\/p>\n<h2>The Paradox of Money<\/h2>\n<p>None of what I&#8217;ve mentioned requires money. You don&#8217;t need money to be healthy. You certainly don&#8217;t need it to spend time with your family.<\/p>\n<p>Where does money fit into all of this then? To get money, we must trade our time. You can always earn more money, but you can&#8217;t change\u00a0your expiration date. The only thing you can do then is increase\u00a0the amount of time where work is optional.<\/p>\n<p>And this is the paradox of money:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>It&#8217;s simultaneously the most and least important part of life. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While you don&#8217;t need money to be happy or healthy, it buys time. And once you have time, you can structure your life optimally. The real goal is this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Save\u00a0enough money so that you don&#8217;t have to worry about money.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Money is not the end, only the start.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Advice For My Younger Self<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If I were to do it all over again, I\u00a0wouldn&#8217;t buy two new cars. I&#8217;d hack my living situation with roommates. I&#8217;d build wealth as fast as I could to minimize my working life and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1500days.com\/enough\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maximize my freedom years<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Time is a finite resource. If you&#8217;re younger than Warren, embrace his wise words and appreciate the years you have ahead of you. <em><strong>Put the pedal down and start living!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*****<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:<\/strong> I think about this trade off alllll the time and actually have a saying for it &#8211; &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/money-saying-rather-be-young\/\">I&#8217;d rather be young!<\/a>&#8221; That&#8217;s what I tell myself anytime I catch myself getting jealous of what someone older than me has that I desperately want :) It doesn&#8217;t help when they&#8217;re much younger than me, haha, but it does if they&#8217;re much older! No way I&#8217;d trade decades of my life for more money. Also makes you appreciate how long it takes to acquire such wealth as well &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t come fast.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[As part of our weekly column by Mr. 1500 of 1500Days.com &#8211;
