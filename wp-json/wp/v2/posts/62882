See you back on Monday for one last week of hanging out together! :)]<br \/>\n<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a common question in the personal finance community \u2026 <strong><i>\u201cHow can I get my partner on board with Financial Independence?\u201d<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tough to answer, because everyone\u2019s relationship is a little different. But, the more we all share our stories and ideas, the more we can help others develop stronger financial plans with their partners!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So today I\u2019m going to share some of my personal stories, and I want to hear yours, too!<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Getting my wife on board with FI<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, it\u2019s a bit unfair to say \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I brought her\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on board with FIRE. Because the truth is, my wife and I built our financial plan <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">together<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even though I was responsible for 95% of the technical details and spreadsheet stuff, it\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> plan, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> journey, and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn\u2019t realize this until years into our relationship \u2026 The biggest mental step I took in getting my wife on board was to de-board my own boat first. Like getting off my single kayak before jumping into a double kayak.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The beginning: Our first finance conversation &#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About nine years ago, my wife (then girlfriend) had just graduated from college. She ran home one day and announced, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI got a job! Woo hoo!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I was an idiot back then with tunnel vision (still am today sometimes), I ruined the mood immediately by hounding her with a series of money questions &#8230; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHow much are they paying you? What benefits do they offer? 401(k)? Think we can afford a house soon?\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, this was important stuff! We lived in Hawaii after all, and things ain\u2019t so cheap out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My poor girlfriend started hyperventilating. We were on completely different pages financially. This was her first full-time job out of college and she hadn\u2019t thought about all the \u201cgrown-up stuff\u201d that I had been dealing with for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>After a nice long fight and avoiding the topic for a few weeks, we finally sat down and talked about where we went wrong \u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned these lessons pretty quickly:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she\u2019s excited about something, I should get excited about it, too. Extinguishing her enthusiasm only teaches her to extinguish my enthusiasm in return. She will never be excited about money if I don\u2019t show excitement about the things that are important to her.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned that our financial journey would be a loooooong road. No sense in rushing things or pushing her into conversations she wasn\u2019t ready for. We had the rest of our lives together to figure it all out. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Awww, how sweet ;)<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to recognize that she could teach me things, too. She\u2019s incredibly savvy, and I needed to be more like her in more ways.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Stronger as a team<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we kept dating, I started to realize that my girlfriend kicked ass in areas that I was never good at. She was very thrifty, always good at negotiating, and passionate about sustainability. She taught me how to reduce-reuse-recycle and helped curb some of my dumb spending habits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more I appreciated and learned about her cool strengths, the more she took an interest in mine. We found that teamwork makes us so much stronger than working as individuals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would ask her, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHey, can you help me find a good deal on a surfboard?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d She would save me hundreds of dollars in bargaining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In return, she would ask me things like, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHey can you help me with my tax return?\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat is a Roth IRA? Should I set one up?&#8221;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admitting our weaknesses to each other bonded us tighter. I learned that coming from different financial backgrounds wasn\u2019t a bad thing. It was a good thing! Because we each had our own financial strengths.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Celebrating the 1st of every month! (Passive paychecks)<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My career was in sales, so I used to get paid monthly commission checks. Some small, some big. My wife and I would always go out and celebrate when a big paycheck came in. This is common &#8212; many people celebrate work paydays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for me, it always felt bittersweet. On the one hand, I always want to celebrate when money comes into my life! But on the other hand, the blood\/sweat\/tears behind each paycheck was slowly killing me. Whenever we celebrated a payday, I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad about the hundreds or thousands of non-refundable hours of my life I traded to earn that money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So about five years ago, we made a change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I bought a small rental property in Texas in 2015. When the first rent check came in, we yielded a few hundred dollars in profit. Not a huge amount, but the fact that we didn\u2019t have to work for it was awesome. The next month brought another rent check. And the next month, and the next, etc. Soon enough, my wife and I started to celebrate the 1st of every month.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Monthly celebrations brought several benefits<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife got more excited about passive income instead of earned income. She saw firsthand the power of income-producing assets. She wanted more of them!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It got us talking about money more regularly. Every month, we check in with each other, make sure we\u2019re still happy with our plans, and modify anything if needed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celebration became a regular part of our life. Whether we have a good month or bad month, money is always a positive topic and celebrated in our household. :)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>A big \u201cah-ha\u201d moment for my wife<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day my wife and I were talking about her work. She was a part-time substitute teacher back then, considering moving to a full-time position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn\u2019t want to push her to work more if she didn\u2019t want to, but at the same time, I was very excited about the extra potential income. Any extra income from her would go straight into our investments and make a huge difference for us later in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since my wife isn\u2019t really money-motivated, I needed a way to encourage her to work without saying it\u2019s for \u201cmoney.\u201d So I eventually blurted out a statement that was a defining moment in our relationship. I said, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor every week that you work now, you are shaving 2 weeks off of us having to work later in life.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something just clicked when I said that. Just the thought of her being able to buy us time together later in life was a big motivator for her. She doesn\u2019t care about the money &#8212; her motivation has always been about TIME.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Still figuring it all out!<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s been a fun journey, but it\u2019s far from over. My wife and I don\u2019t have kids yet, don\u2019t know when we will officially be \u201cFI,\u201d or even which city we want to live in when we\u2019re older. Our money discussions and decisions will continue until we die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the hard part is mostly over, and I\u2019m lucky to have such a patient and dedicated partner in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those out there struggling to talk with their partner about finances, keep searching for ways to break through and get on the same page. The more we all share our stories, the more we can help each other get to better places in our relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soooo &#8230; <strong>How did you get your partner on board with FIRE? Any defining moments, or was it easy from the get-go?<\/strong><\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Top pic by <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@cblack09?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cody Black<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[Happy Friday!
