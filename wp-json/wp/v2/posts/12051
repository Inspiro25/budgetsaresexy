Money\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Three and a half years after starting, our little blog has grown up!<\/strong> I can&#8217;t believe it. And really, I don&#8217;t know what to say other than a hearty THANK YOU. To each and every one of you who has stopped by at some point throughout our existence here. It means a lot. Without readers, this is just another diary :)<\/p>\n<p>And like money, it holds true here too: The first million is always the hardest. Haha&#8230; it took over 2 1\/2 years to hit 1 million, and almost EXACTLY <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/budgets-are-sexy-hits-1000000-page-views\/\">1 year<\/a> (off by 3 days!) to hit 2. That&#8217;s insane. And honestly, I&#8217;m not doing anything much different here, so it just goes to show that over time hard work really pays off. (The same can go for paying off credit card debt, or growing your savings accounts too &#8212; pushing hard, day by day, month by month, ultimately gets you to your goal!)<\/p>\n<p>One of my very first posts was an <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/interview-me-on-me_12\/\">interview I did with myself<\/a> &#8211; yes, myself! who else was gonna do it? haha&#8230; &#8211; so 3 and 1\/2 years later I&#8217;m doing it again for good time sake :)\u00a0 5 people probably saw the original one, but now I get a lot more eyeballs reading &#8211; yay!!!<\/p>\n<p>Here we go, a handful of questions that you may or may not be wondering:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Is it hard writing every single day, Monday &#8211; Friday?<\/h2>\n<p>Yes.\u00a0 Very. Especially for someone who hates writing!! Haha&#8230; it&#8217;s not that I run out of things to say, although sometimes that happens, but more that it takes foreverrrrrr to get out of my head and on paper succinctly!\u00a0 I always feel GREAT once I get my thoughts out so I can share it with the world, but it literally takes me 2 or 3, or even 4 hours sometimes. For one seemingly simple post! Haha&#8230; I always know what I *want* to say, but my brain just doesn&#8217;t work like a writer&#8217;s at all.\u00a0 I&#8217;m more visual, so it&#8217;s very hard at times to get my words across :)<\/p>\n<h2>2. Did you have any idea you&#8217;d be a blogger for so long?<\/h2>\n<p>Noooo way&#8230;. mainly for the reason I listed above (I hate writing!), but also because I have major A.D.H.D.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve never liked something for more than 6 months, so it&#8217;s just as shocking to me as it is to my friends when I tell them I&#8217;m actually making a career out of it now :)\u00a0 But I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.<\/p>\n<h2>3. What do you like so much about it?\u00a0 Do you ever get bored?<\/h2>\n<p>Nope!\u00a0 It&#8217;s totally nerdy, but it&#8217;s so damn fulfilling (and just plain FUN).\u00a0 As crazy as it sounds, I&#8217;ve met all my closest friends now from blogging or <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/budgetsaresexy\">Twitter<\/a>\/<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Budgets-Are-Sexy\/68302201559\">facebook<\/a> :)\u00a0 And that includes a lot of you reading this right now.\u00a0 I call y&#8217;all my online family cuz that&#8217;s really how it is &#8212; I have more in common with you guys than I do my &#8220;real life&#8221; friends who I don&#8217;t get to see as often as I&#8217;d like!\u00a0 And it&#8217;s totally opened up so many other opportunities as well.\u00a0 Yes I blog about money day in and day out, but you learn SO MUCH about the online industry, and many other things at the same time.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve grown more in the past 3\u00a0 years than I have in the past 10, and the idea that *anything* can happen one day just excites the pants off of me&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>4. Do you think you&#8217;ll ever blog about anything else?<\/h2>\n<p>Haha, yes :)\u00a0 You&#8217;ve probably noticed a few posts here and there that kinda hover on the border of personal finance, and that&#8217;s usually my other passions or thoughts trying to pop themselves out.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll always keep this site financially related, but I may start another blog (or podcast?)\u00a0 where I can just be myself 100% and say whatever the hell I want just to get it off my brain.\u00a0 Kinda like a show about nothing ;)\u00a0 In fact, my boy Nate and I talk about having a &#8220;Nate and J&#8221; show where we just stream ourselves talking about whatever, and callers chime in and we just shoot the $hit.\u00a0 It&#8217;ll probably only be interesting to us, but I think it would be fun.<\/p>\n<h2>5. What&#8217;s an average day for you now?<\/h2>\n<p>Boy, it changes every month but here&#8217;s the current pattern: I wake up at 8:30 (used to be 10:30), answer emails for a few hours, tweet a bit, write a blog post for 10 hours (haha&#8230;), go for a walk, answer more emails, work on a side project for an hour, work on <a href=\"http:\/\/lovedrop.us\">another side project<\/a> for two hours, tweet a lot, go on another walk, have more calls, waste an hour or two online doing who knows what, answer more emails, and then maybe take a break?\u00a0 I stop usually around 8-10pm and then work some more later if something important (or exciting) is going on.\u00a0 If not, I&#8217;ll hang w\/ the wife and then do it all over again in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>It probably sounds real bad &#8211; like I&#8217;m a workaholic or something &#8211; which is true, but I promise you it&#8217;s pleasurable.\u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t even call it work.\u00a0 More like a hobby that pays the bills :)\u00a0 Whenever someone asks me what I&#8217;d do with more free time, the answer is always &#8220;build something online!&#8221; So it&#8217;s safe to say I&#8217;m on the right track.<\/p>\n<h2>6. What does Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy think about all this?<\/h2>\n<p>Haha, it depends on when you ask her ;)\u00a0 She&#8217;s 100% supportive, and thinks it&#8217;s great I immerse myself into it so much, but she def. gets tired of hearing about it all the time.\u00a0 Or not hanging out with me as much as the pre-blog days.\u00a0 But I&#8217;m always striving to be better and adapt as we go along here.\u00a0 It&#8217;s true I&#8217;m pouring my heart and time into it like a madman now, but I think it&#8217;s paving the way for a MUCH better future ahead.\u00a0 You always have to put in the time up front so you can enjoy the rewards in the future, and she knows a lot of this stuff is just temporary.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll always be &#8220;in the game,&#8221; but I won&#8217;t always be strapped to the laptop like I am now. Or on the road <a href=\"http:\/\/lovedrop.us\">every month<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>7. How has your Net Worth changed since blogging?<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s gone up!!\u00a0 By a ton. Which I attribute a lot of it to this blog, and having everyone hold me accountable to it all.\u00a0 The very first time I EVER tracked it we were at <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/2008-net-worth-goal-100000\/\">$58,769.65<\/a>, and 41 months later we rose to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/net-worth-june\/\">$214,025.67<\/a>. An increase of over 300%! I still worked my a$$ off to get to where it is today, but talking about it out loud and sharing it with everyone has def. helped me focus on it more.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Is it true you like to watch The Bachelorette?<\/h2>\n<p>No comment!!! :)<\/p>\n<h2>9. Anything else you&#8217;d like to ad?<\/h2>\n<p><em>(Those are always my favorite questions)<\/em>\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 My readers are honestly the BEST readers a blogger could ask for &#8211; no joke.\u00a0 Everyone here is so generally positive and motivating that it makes my &#8220;job&#8221; incredibly satisfying!\u00a0 I know so many sites that just get crapped on left and right by the haters, and it really pisses me off.\u00a0 And makes me sad. It&#8217;s always okay to spark a little debate and get some juicy discussions going on, but you NEVER personally attack someone or be outright disrespectful.\u00a0 And I&#8217;m proud to say you guys never cross that horrible horrible line.\u00a0 And for that, I am eternally grateful :)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Got any questions yourself for me?<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 Shoot &#8217;em by!\u00a0 It&#8217;s always more gratifying answering REAL ones than made up ones from my head ;)\u00a0 Anything at all goes, too &#8211; whatever you&#8217;re thinking.<\/p>\n<p>And for anyone who still doesn&#8217;t have one, make sure to download your <a title=\"sexy saver certificate\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/04\/you-love-meyou-really-love-me\/\">Sexy Saver Certificate<\/a>!\u00a0\u00a0 It may have been 3 years ago when I made it, but it&#8217;s still just as sexy as ever.\u00a0 Happy Thursday!!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/krynsky\/\">krynsky<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Three and a half years after starting, our little blog has grown up!
