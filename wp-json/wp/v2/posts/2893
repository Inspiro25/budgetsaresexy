But the one thing celebrities don\u2019t seem too willing to talk about is their money \u2026 or lack thereof.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the glitz and glamour, some celebs are racking up enormous debt as they struggle to maintain their extravagant lifestyles. Noteworthy examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lindsay Lohan<\/strong> \u2013 Pre-slammer, the former child star was charged with $600,000 in credit card debt in April.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Teresa Giudice<\/strong> \u2013 This Real Housewife of New Jersey seemed pretty desperate in $9M of debt when she filed for bankruptcy in June.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mariah Carey<\/strong> \u2013 The diva owes her veterinarian $30k. Not such a sweet fantasy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mike Tyson<\/strong> \u2013 Iron Mike was a formidable opponent in the ring, but debt KO\u2019d him in 2003, when he filed bankruptcy at $27M in the hole.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Nicolas Cage<\/strong> \u2013 The star can\u2019t work sorcery on his bank account. His Bel Air Mansion went to auction in April after the IRS demanded more than $13M in back taxes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, as celebrities go into debt with over-the-top spending, Americans are following suit as they try to keep up with them. It turns out that we Americans begin to identify with the characters we see on TV, and we use those lifestyles as unrealistic reference points. Soon \u201cKeeping up with the Joneses\u201d becomes \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bravotv.com\/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey\">Keeping up with New Jersey Housewives.<\/a>\u201d In a study of Americans\u2019 spending habits, Juliet Schor, author of The Overspent American, concluded that each hour of weekly television viewing correlated to an increase in spending of $200 annually.<\/p>\n<p>Scott Crawford, founder and CEO of DebtGoal, says the boring, unglamorous fact we all must face is that financial health means spending less than we earn, whether our salaries are blue collar or red carpet. Here are some of Scott\u2019s tips for managing your debt before it reaches celebrity proportions.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Quit spending on your credit cards<\/h2>\n<p>It might seem obvious, but it\u2019s hard to make any progress on your debts if you continue to spend on your credit card. Putting away the plastic wouldn\u2019t have freed Lindsay of her debt to society, but at least she wouldn\u2019t owe her credit card company too. If you\u2019re using a credit card for the rewards, stop now! It\u2019s not worth what you pay in interest, and there are debit cards out there from companies that let you can earn up to $600 in cash back annually without going into debt.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Negotiate Your Rate<\/h2>\n<p>While you\u2019re paying those credit cards down, make sure you are doing it at the best interest rate possible. Most credit card companies are willing to negotiate to lower rates, but you need to make the call and ask. NegotiateMyRate.com provides a free script to help first-timers negotiate better rates.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Organize your debts and create a plan for paying them off<\/h2>\n<p>Most people in debt know they have a problem, but don\u2019t have a good idea how much debt they really have, what it costs them per month and whether they\u2019re making progress each month or not. The first step in getting out of debt is creating a pay down plan that works for you. Pay the minimums on every account but your highest-interest account and apply the remainder to this account. Doing the math and setting up a pay down system can be daunting, but online tools can help automate this process.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Tell others about your goal<\/h2>\n<p>Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson is managing her reported \u00a32M in debt with some help from a friend\u2014Queen Elizabeth II. Not all of us have these kinds of connections, but telling a friend gives them a chance to support you and creates positive peer pressure that can keep you on track. Studies show people who tell others about their goals are 10-20% more likely to hit their goals, so don\u2019t be shy.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Find additional cash by lowering major expenses<\/h2>\n<p>You may not spend lavishly on your dog like Mariah (or maybe you do), but re-evaluate the recurring expenses in your life like your cable bill, cell phone, health club, etc. Netflix has a ten dollar per month on-demand subscription, which costs less than what many cable companies charge. And Hulu.com can bring you most of your favorite shows for free. By moving to a cell phone family plan, arranging to have longer chats with friends during free evening and weekend time slots and just sending fewer texts per month you can significantly reduce your cell bill. Your health club may be willing to reduce your monthly fee if you ask, and if not, a little fresh air never hurt anyone. Consider moving to housing with a lower rent or trading down a car to a different one with lower payments. Such moves can free up hundreds of dollars per month that you can use to get out of debt.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Start saving to avoid future debt<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got your debt paid down it\u2019s time to start saving. Without an emergency fund and a clear plan to save for the things you really want, you\u2019ll just wind up in debt again. Many online savings accounts helps people save for specific financial goals too.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>[AWESOME photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/exfordy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">exfordy<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Guest article today) Celebrities are willing to dish on their diets, workout regimes, health issues, partying lifestyles, relationship woes and child-rearing preferences.
