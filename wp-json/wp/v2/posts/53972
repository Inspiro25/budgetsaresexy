The average American gross household income is $71,258<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Pretty decent&#8230; Our household income this year will be around $110,000 between my wife&#8217;s new job and my online projects, but obviously if there&#8217;s only one of you in your household it&#8217;s going to skew your results :)\u00a0 Verdict for us: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>above average<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>#2. The average American household with debt owes $132,529<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Dayuuummm&#8230; Although it *does* include mortgages and student loans, cars, etc, so it&#8217;s not ALL credit card debt. We&#8217;ve opted to go back to renting so we don&#8217;t have any mortgages, but we do have a car note with $12,142.79 left which makes our verdict here <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>below average<\/strong><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#3. The average American gave $5,491 to charity in 2015<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Pretty good!!! Probably because the higher earners skew it, but still &#8211; no shame in trying to keep up! And outside all the gobs of time I spend helping people with their $$$, we fail here with only giving about $1,000 in cash and donations last year&#8230; Though we did give out over <a href=\"https:\/\/communityfund.lovedrop.us\/total\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$14,000<\/a> so far with our <a href=\"https:\/\/communityfund.lovedrop.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Fund<\/a> I helped launch, and my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/20-dollar-money-trick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$20\/mo charity trick<\/a> is now auto. pumping out $100\/mo to 5 of my favorite organizations, so we are getting better! Verdict: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>below average<\/strong><\/span> (but not for long!)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#4. The average American has a FICO credit score of 700<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Much better than I&#8217;d expect? I&#8217;m not exactly sure what my *FICO* score is, but I do know from last week&#8217;s checking that we&#8217;re at 829 with Experian and 835 w\/ TransUnion and 833 w\/ Equifax. So I would assume we&#8217;d be in the 800&#8217;s as well with FICO. And <em>man<\/em> are there a lot of different scores out there? You can learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Credit_score_in_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most of them here<\/a>, but again as long as you&#8217;re at least monitoring <em>one<\/em> of them consistently you&#8217;ll be just fine.

The average American&#8217;s 401(k) balance is $96,288<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I no longer have a 401(k) since becoming self-employed, but I do have about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/new-net-worth-688k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$504,000<\/a> in my SEP IRA which is an equivalent (minus those glorious free matches!!!) so it&#8217;s safe to say we&#8217;re way <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>above average<\/strong><\/span> here too.

The average personal savings rate in the U.S. is 5.5%<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Ugh&#8230; Although apparently this is up from 1.9% in 2005, so yay? I&#8217;m never quite sure exactly how one goes about <em>calculating<\/em> their savings rate (do you use pre-tax money? After-tax? Does investing count? What about debt payments?) but here&#8217;s what I get depending on what I&#8217;m including &#8211; all based on pre-tax income:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actual &#8220;savings&#8221; rate: <strong>0%<\/strong> (all our extra money goes to maxing out retirement accounts and debt)<\/li>\n<li>Investing rate: <strong>26%<\/strong> (SEP IRA, ROTH IRA)<\/li>\n<li>Investing + debt pay off rate: <strong>34%<\/strong> (SEP IRA, ROTH IRA, Car loan)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Verdict:<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong> above average<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>#7. Only 18% of Americans actively contribute to an IRA<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Double ugh&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s considered &#8220;active&#8221; here (I usually contribute only once a year to max it out vs monthly deposits) but either way not good, America. Not good! J$ verdict:<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong> above average<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>#8. The average American&#8217;s tax refund in 2016 was $2,860.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I know people either LOVE getting refunds or think it&#8217;s asinine that you &#8220;give the government a loan,&#8221; but as far as I&#8217;m concerned a nice surprise is always better than an ugly one. And I find that when people get a *chunk* of money vs smaller more frequent ones, they tend to apply it more towards bigger goals anyways since it seems to make a much larger difference. So to me it&#8217;s all in HOW YOU USE THE MONEY vs when you get it.<\/p>\n<p>As for our typical returns, we usually break even since we pay taxes quarterly, however last year we got an unexpected return of $5,000 when we overpaid on part of some money that came in at the end of the year. Which of course went right back into investments! And again, a much better surprise getting $5,000 back than the opposite ;)<\/p>\n<p>Verdict: <strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">above<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> average<\/span><\/strong> (not sure how to color code this, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#9.

For 2016 that came out to <strong>17%<\/strong> for us (much lower than usual probably due to us <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/we-sold-our-house-no-more-mortgages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taking a loss when we sold our house<\/a> earlier in the year, as well as my wife maybe going back to work?), but for 2015 it was quite higher at a whopping <strong>43%<\/strong>!
