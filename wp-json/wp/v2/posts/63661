(And by \u201cscientific fact\u201d, I really mean that I just made this up in my head right now, but it seems legit &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;).\u00a0 Having more fun = getting more done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A money savings challenge is typically done *in addition to* your regular saving habits, to achieve a short term savings goal. Most of these yield you a few thousand bucks at the end for you to invest, spend, or give away if you\u2019re feeling generous!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s get started!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and for you high-income super-savers out there who are capable of saving a lil\u2019 faster than regular folks, try <\/span><\/i><b><i>doubling the savings numbers<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (or shortening the time frames) to make it more challenging.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Money Envelopes Saving Challenge (Save up to $5,050!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this challenge, you grab 100 x blank envelopes and label them each with numbers 1 \u2192 100. Scramble them up, then put them into a box. Each week, pick out 2 x envelopes at random, and whatever numbers you pick, you place that amount of money inside the envelopes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63699 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/money_envelopes_jpg_dPFwnwL4-e1612157988503.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some weeks you\u2019ll pick high numbers, sometimes low numbers, but <\/span><b>after 50 weeks of saving you\u2019ll have $5,050 in extra cash!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve seen a few versions of this saving challenge floating around the interwebs over the past year or so. Depending on how much you wanna save, you could modify the challenge accordingly\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 envelopes, open just 1 each week <\/span><b>= $5050 in 2 years!<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">52 envelopes, labelled 1 \u2192 52, open 1 each week = <\/span><b>$1,378 in a year!<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe back half\u201d: Only 50 x envelopes, but label them starting at #51 \u2192 100 to skip all the low numbers. <\/span><b>This\u2019ll get you $3,775 in a year :)<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know the year is already underway, and it seems weird to start a 52 week savings challenge in February\u2026 But, it\u2019s not too late to play catch up. Start by opening 5 or 6 weeks of envelopes all at once in the first month! Or, double up envelopes in a certain month when you expect a higher paycheck, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. A 52 Card Pickup Challenge (Save up to $1,352!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This money challenge involves a deck of cards. Similar to the envelopes challenge, you shuffle all the cards and pick out <\/span><b>2 cards<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at random each week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add up the numbers on the face of each card you pick, and this is the amount of dollars you need to save that week. (Jacks = $11, Queens = $12, and Kings = $13. And if you want to keep Jokers in the deck, you could assign them a ridiculous number, like $100 if you pick a Joker)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you pick a 7 and a King, you gotta put $20 in the piggy bank that week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the kicker\u2026 Instead of discarding the cards after you draw them, you put them back into the deck each week. This keeps it fun and interesting because you never know if you\u2019re picking high numbers or low numbers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lowest amount of money you\u2019ll save after 52 weeks is<\/span><b> $104. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(picking 2 x Aces each week) The highest is <\/span><b>$1,352 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(picking 2 x kings each week). But those are extreme odds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>On <\/b><b><i>average<\/i><\/b><b> the weekly savings will add up to ~$728 for this 52 week money challenge!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63698 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/money_deck_jpeg_WTT8QYr9-e1612157997604.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"271\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Bonus challenge: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick up one of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/benbf\/moneydeck\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these money decks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which each playing card has a small educational money fact on it. May as well slowly increase your personal finance knowledge while you\u2019re playing throughout the year!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Weekly Screen Time FINES (Save $500 &#8211; $3,000)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one is a great idea helping 2 different ways in your life&#8230; Reducing screen-time AND boosting your savings account!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, at the end of each week, you navigate to the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screen Time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> section of your smartphone, and pay yourself a \u201cfine\u201d for the number of hours you spent on your phone that week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a screen grab of mine for example. Kind of embarrassing&#8230; My total screen time last week was 28 hours! OUCH.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63697 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Screen_time_challenge_png_-NO-mktB-e1612158005518.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"449\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know\u2026 Scientific research shows that by year 2030 the average person will be on their phone for 19 hours per day!!!??\u00a0 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I made this statistic up too, but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it actually comes true given the amount of zombies I see glued to their phones out there <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f9d0;<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all seriousness, a weekly reminder of a bad habit (screen time), that is paired with a good habit (saving money) can help both ways. <\/span><b>Given my average screen time of 28 hours per week, I\u2019d have around ~$1,500 in extra money aka \u201cfines\u201d at the end of a 52 week challenge.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Let the Good Savings \u201cRoll\u201d (Save ~$1,277)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This saving challenge is kind of like the card pickups, but instead of cards, you roll dice! And instead of weekly, you roll <\/span><b>daily<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting with 1 dice, rolled once per day, you save the number it lands on each day for an entire year.\u00a0 Rolling all 1\u2019s for 365 days straight is the lowest you\u2019ll save ($365), but that is as practically impossible as rolling all 6\u2019s each day ($2,190). More realistically, you\u2019ll end up closer to <\/span><b>$1,277 on average in savings!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not enough for you? Try rolling 2 x dice. Or even 3? Or\u2026&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better yet, grab one of these <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0747PLQLX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polyhedral 100 Sided Dice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with numbers 1 through 100. Be careful though\u2026 Rolling this bad boy each day will get you saving an average of $18,000 after 365 rolls!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. \u201cThe Best Deal\u201d Savings Challenge (Compete against friends &amp; family!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This money challenge involves a group of friends to compete against. First, you set up a group text chain, WhatsApp group, Facebook group or whatever so all the members can talk to each other&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, everyone within the group shares at the end of each month their \u201cbest deal\u201d that they found throughout the past month. It could be that someone saved $300 by switching car insurance, one person might have double-dipped with coupons to get a killer discount on a big purchase, or perhaps someone found some free stuff on Craigslist and sold it for $200 profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone HAS to bring a deal story to the table. After hearing everyone\u2019s stories, the group collectively decides who wins \u201cthe best deal\u201d that month. Could be a highest dollar amount, funniest story, or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s why this group challenge is awesome:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>It promotes a culture of \u201cwinning\u201d: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharing your success stories and celebrating other people\u2019s successes is soooo important in life. It boosts morale, motivates people, and rewards good progress.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>You look for wins more regularly!:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Throughout the month, you\u2019ll notice yourself looking for more deals, because you want to bring an awesome story to the table when the group meets. As others share their stories, it\u2019ll open up more ways and areas for you saving money.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>It helps your friends (they need it)!:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some of my friends look down on frugal living, and would scoff at a regular \u201cmoney saving challenge.\u201d But a \u201cbest deal competition\u201d&#8230; they\u2019re in! Little do they know you are helping them reduce spending, and subtly preaching good personal finance habits &#x1f92b;.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>6. Weekday No Spend Challenge: (52 x $0 spend days!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a little different than the regular \u201cno spend challenge\u201d where people typically take 1 full month off of spending. Instead, this challenge is just picking 1 day of the week, and not spending any money on that particular day for an entire year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I like about no spend Wednesdays (or whatever week day you pick) is that<\/span><b> it slowly forms habits that actually last<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Making lunch instead of buying it, not grabbing that guilty pleasure energy drink on the way home, inviting friends \u2018round for a board game instead of meeting them at the bar, etc. It\u2019s one thing going cold turkey for a month on spending, but a weekday no-spend challenge is a small, repetitive goal that gets you more conscious of your behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another cool thing is it actually saves <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than the 1 month long no spend challenge. A month of no spending only saves 30 days of money. But a full day off each week is 52 x days of no spending. Almost double the impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the total amount of money saved, you could figure out your <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average daily spend<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> outside of essentials (add up your amusement, dining, discretionary spending categories in your budget, divide by 365), then set that money aside each day in a specific checking account. Or, pulling the money out in cash is always a great idea, because it removes the dollars when you are checking your digital bank account balances or net worth, making it feel like \u201cextra money\u201d at the end of the year!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. Receipt Savings Challenge:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever seen this funny tweet or meme?&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63695 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/PaigeKellerman_Twitter_jpeg_GLADvNCH-e1612158023935.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"338\" height=\"137\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PaigeKellerman\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@PaigeKellerman<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Twitter<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haha! It\u2019s funny because receipts don\u2019t lie. They reveal both bad spending habits as well as good ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my wife and I, I like to think we are <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the opposite<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this being broke statement&#8230; If you compile all of our receipts and stack them together, it would make a teeny tiny book about why <\/span><b>we&#8217;re rich. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because most of our receipts would reveal discounts, promos, and weekly ad deals! (it would also reveal that we prolly drink too much, but that\u2019s another story!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK here\u2019s the receipt challenge\u2026\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time you hit up the grocery store, pay attention to the \u201cdiscounts\u201d and reduced price items you\u2019re buying. Most stores total your savings at the bottom of your receipt when you check out. Here\u2019s one my wife brought home from shopping recently:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-63696 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Reciept_savings_jpg_hy84NnjY-e1612158013779.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each week, total up your savings and transfer that money to a separate savings account. In this example, I\u2019d throw $44 towards my savings goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could say that this money is already \u201csaved\u201d because it wasn\u2019t really charged to you in the first place&#8230; Yes, that\u2019s correct, and by manually moving the money to a separate account <\/span><b>you are actually paying yourself, instead of the retailer.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building up that money in a separate account means you won\u2019t accidentally spend it elsewhere. Not to mention, keeping track of your savings on a regular basis makes you more aware of discounts on future shopping trips.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>8. Save all $5 and $50 Bills Challenge!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A while ago I read a challenge about saving every $5 bill you come across within the year. Sounded awesome! But, then it hit me that I rarely use cash. When I do use cash, it\u2019s either spare change coins for the parking meter, or large $20 and $100 bills for cash <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-find-estate-sale-deals-from-a-beverly-hills-bargain-hunter\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deals at Estate Sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since $5 bills are rare for me, I\u2019m including $50\u2019s in this challenge as well. Sure, it\u2019ll hurt if I sell something on Craigslist for $500 and the person pays with 10 x $50 bills. But, that\u2019s the challenge! It\u2019s supposed to be hard!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wonder how much I can collect in a year of $5\u2019s and $50\u2019s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or can anyone think of a digital money saving game similar that replaces the physical cash aspect of dollar bills?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Saving Money Challenges &amp; Tips for Actually Finishing Them&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people start up a fun money saving challenge, then as time goes on they either forget weekly check-ins or lose motivation. So here are a few tips for success:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Set weekly reminders in advance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recurring phone alarm, a calendar reminder, pop up alerts, post-it notes, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/use-this-chart-to-save-1000-this-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">printed wall money saving chart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026 Whatever you can do to remind yourself weekly or monthly to stay on point will increase your chances of success.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Get an \u201caccountabilibuddy\u201d:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s awesome when friends want to participate in the challenge with you (or <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">against<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you &#x1f609;). If nobody wants to join, that\u2019s ok. Just making your challenges public and talking about them will hold you accountable.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Have a specific reward in mind:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Saving money just for money\u2019s sake can be a bit boring. It helps if you have an idea of where the money will be put or spent at the end. A holiday trip, extra money for Christmas presents, beefing up your emergency fund, etc. For you <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2-big-differences-between-successful-and-unsuccessful-investors\/\" >investors<\/a> out there, this extra cash could become \u201cplay money\u201d to buy a few individual stocks you want to own outside your regular index fund strategy. Just an idea to keep the fun going and compounding after the challenge is over. :)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Don\u2019t bite off more than you can realistically chew:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you set a goal that\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too high<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it can kill your motivation if you don\u2019t end up achieving it and leave a bad taste in your mouth.
