I asked him why he&#8217;d even <em>offer<\/em> his tenants the chance to renew if they sucked so much anyways?, and he said they tried doctoring the contract so he had to take &#8217;em to court! Ouch! The joys of rental properties, eh?<\/p>\n<p>But this post is about me, not him (sorry Lazy Man ;)) and I&#8217;m in the mood to celebrate! Opah! And this now closes out two large questions we&#8217;ve been mulling over the last two months as well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where are we going to live this year?<\/li>\n<li>What are we going to do with our default rental property? (Our old house we used to live in, but don&#8217;t want to sell yet cuz we&#8217;re too underwater)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>As you can see, #2 is now crossed off the list: our renters will remain for another year!<\/strong> And as for #1, well, we decided we liked it too much <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/were-officially-virginians\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here in Virginia<\/a> to leave anytime soon :) So we&#8217;ll be sticking around for at least another year ourselves too. Especially while baby #2 makes entrance, and the wife once and for all finishes that dang dissertation to complete her PHD. Meaning this time next year we&#8217;ll no longer be a single-income house! Double opah!<\/p>\n<p>The interesting part about this whole house renting business, though, is how similar both homes in question are. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They&#8217;re both 1,700 sq feet<\/li>\n<li>They&#8217;re both on the same rental time-frame (which I guess makes sense since we moved out of one and into another, eh?)<\/li>\n<li>And they&#8217;re both set at $1,700\/mo rent. Even though one&#8217;s far away from the city and one&#8217;s smack dab in the middle of one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So it always feels like we&#8217;re playing Even Steven here, which again we continued forward when it came to the renewal rates.<\/strong> I&#8217;m not sure if it was a smart *business* decision, but emotionally it felt pretty good so we ran with it (ya&#8217;ll know I choose emotions over facts\/money most of the time ;)).<\/p>\n<p>We got the notice first from the house *we* rent, saying they wouldn&#8217;t be instituting a monthly rate increase, so when it came time to tell our tenants our offer to them, we decided to stay put and not raise the rates either. I just couldn&#8217;t see ourselves raising it when we were offered a similar deal, ya know? And our biggest fear of course is that they walk and decide not to rent again, effectively costing us a whole entire month&#8217;s worth of rent (the amount our property manager pays to secure a new renter from start to finish) &#8211; if not more.<\/p>\n<p>So while the few hundred dollars extra this year would have been nice, it&#8217;s much nicer knowing we&#8217;ve got a good, solid, tenant staying put for yet another 12 months. Now had our landlord increased the rent instead? Who knows how it would have played out :) Even though the two shouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with each other at all&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Either way, we&#8217;ve now almost officially been landlords for a year!<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/found-renter-officially-landlords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">That was fast!<\/a> We got off to a rocky start, but thankfully we haven&#8217;t heard a peep of trouble for the past 5+ months now which is music to our ears&#8230; Here&#8217;s what the numbers looked like for 2013 (starting in July):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total expenses (repairs, management fees, etc): <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$3,290.95<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Total income (rent collected): <strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">$10,479.15<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Total amount we paid in mortgage + HOA: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$12,120.00<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Total loss for 2013: <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$4,931.80<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And that doesn&#8217;t include the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/new-home-renovation-costs-18000\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$20,000 we dropped<\/a> to get the place up to par either, ugh&#8230;. But at least we were able to write it off for the year which helped us <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/zomg-getting-money-back-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get back $11,000<\/a> like we did. And now all our major expenses are out of the way for the future too, which is good! (Knock on wood)<\/p>\n<p>Still, we&#8217;re definitely not raking in any profits :) We&#8217;ll just be losing <em>less<\/em> every month going forward, which one day will even out and THEN start giving us some extra profit. At least in theory&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Here are some things we&#8217;ve learned so far being a landlord:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No phone calls are good phone calls :)<\/li>\n<li>Managing a property can be emotionally draining<\/li>\n<li>But <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-and-when-to-hire-a-property-manager-for-your-real-estate-rental\/\">property managers<\/a> help with this, as long as you&#8217;re okay with the costs<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s pretty awesome when someone else pays your mortgage for you!!<\/li>\n<li>Rental properties are a long strategy play<\/li>\n<li>And they aren&#8217;t for everyone (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/10\/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">just like home ownership<\/a>)&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ll see what the future holds, but I&#8217;m not a converted man just yet &#8211; only a more patient one ;)<\/strong> I think it would be much different going into investment properties when you actually do so ON PURPOSE than by default, haha&#8230; We&#8217;d have never bought our house when we did (or for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/12\/sure-we-financed-our-house-100-but-ya\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how MUCH<\/a> we did, for that matter) had we known we&#8217;d later become landlords. Definitely something to consider for all those looking to scoop up their first homes soon&#8230; It&#8217;s all fun and exciting except for when it&#8217;s time to pony up large buckets of cash you&#8217;d rather hold on to! So consider this <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/stuff-new-home-owners-never-think-about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a scare tactic<\/a>! ;)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, you live and you learn and we&#8217;ll continue going along for the ride and seeing how things pan out&#8230; Maybe we&#8217;ll have a whole portfolio of properties the next time we talk about this and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/02\/how-plan-to-retire-early-30\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retire at 30<\/a> like FI Fighter?
