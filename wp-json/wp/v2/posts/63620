Although not traveling saved us a few bucks, we still had some hefty December spending &#8212; and a negative savings rate. &#x1f641; Here are the major things that hurt our wallet:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Tax bill paid for rental property: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically this $5k bill wasn\u2019t \u201cdue\u201d until the end of January, but I hate having outstanding bills just sitting around so we paid it early. This was paid with our property reserve account, and tax isn\u2019t due again until next January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Christmas presents, a tree, food, and booze:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We dropped another $600 or so this past month on presents (+ a tree!), in addition to our November gift spending. Our grocery bill was pretty killer this month ($627) which is quite high for a family of 2. But, some of these were fancy meats and stuff we don\u2019t typically buy, plus contributing to family meals for Christmas. My birthday was on Dec 30th and my wife made a special beef wellington with expensive filet mignon &#8211; delicious and worth every dollar!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Lower income for school holidays: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife isn\u2019t paid as a salaried employee, so we miss paychecks over school holidays. Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks total over 3 weeks of missing pay! This is one of the reasons we sit on a large emergency cash fund, to see us through dips in income like this. Summer break hurts the most, which we\u2019ll tackle somehow in a few months when the semester is coming to an end.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>December good stuff and wins!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Stimulus payments, $1200:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We got our stimulus payments on Dec 31st &#8211; a nice little way to end 2020. We qualify for these checks because we have less than $150k in combined income.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Teacher appreciation funds: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because my wife is such a kickass teacher, the families and students gifted her a total of $365 in vouchers and cash this Christmas! <\/span><b>Thank you to all you parents out there who gift money to schools and teachers.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I can\u2019t tell you how well this is received by teachers and how much it makes them feel appreciated. THANK YOU.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Trash turned to treasure:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Out on a morning run, I came across a compost tumbler that someone was throwing away. I snapped a pic, created a free ad on an app called OfferUp, and someone picked it up a few hours later for $40!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63647 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Compost_Tumbler_jpg_69q46Shk-scaled-e1610085665502.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My conscience got the best of me the very next day\u2026\u00a0 I noticed more free items and furniture out front of that same house and learned the people there were moving houses. I can\u2019t imagine how much it sucks moving homes during a pandemic, so I ended up giving the $40 to the family as a moving present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why I\u2019d be a horrible business owner &#8211; I have a problem giving my profits away. At least I have a fun story to tell, and maybe some good karma down the road somewhere. &#x1f609;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Detailed Asset Breakdown:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>CASH Accounts: $37,265 <\/b><b>(-$1,954)<\/b><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We skipped a paycheck from my wife\u2019s job this month, and also transferred some cash into our HSA account. This cash balance is trending downward, which is OK as it\u2019s still higher than what we really need for our emergency fund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Rental Property and Reserve Account: $233,228 <\/b><b>(-$4388)<\/b><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We paid our property tax bill which accounts for $5,185 of this expense. Our positive cashflow was $797, which is the difference between $1,975 in rental income minus $1178 in total expenses. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>IRA &#8211; Rollover: $137,226 <\/b><b>(+$5,903)<\/b><b>: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The increase in this account was solely from market growth and reinvested dividends. Someone asked me about why I don\u2019t do a backdoor conversion of this account over to our ROTH\u2026 and the answer is that we plan to in future years. More to come on this topic!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>IRA &#8211; Roths: $70,429<\/b><b> (+2,663)<\/b><b>: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m excited to contribute to these Roths again in January for 2021. The plan is to transfer funds from our joint brokerage over these accounts to begin tax-free growth as early as possible within the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joint Brokerage Account: $177,454<\/b><b> (+$4,015)<\/b><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I made some large buy\/sell trades within this account in late December. Due to our low income in 2020, we were in a good situation to do large capital gains harvesting. Although we\u2019ll pay a small amount of state income tax, we\u2019ll pay 0% in capital gains tax and reset our cost basis for a bunch of stocks. At some point I\u2019ll do a deeper dive into this account and explain what all that crap I just wrote actually means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>HSA: $2,850 <\/b><b>(+$994)<\/b><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The increase here came from an after-tax contribution of $887.50 (prorated contribution for 2020) and the rest was market growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>New 401(k) at work: $6,457 <\/b><b>(+$2,196)<\/b><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This 401k has been only open for 3 months, so I\u2019m proud that there\u2019s already $6k in there. I get zero company matches, so this is mostly personal savings and a tiny bit of market growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Breakdown of Liabilities<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Rental Property Mortgage: -$122,278 <\/b><b>(+$240)<\/b><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If my calculations are correct, this mortgage balance will be less than $120k at the end of 2021 if I just leave everything alone. I could speed things up by making extra payments myself\u2026 but why do this when the tenants are paying it down naturally each month?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Credit Card Balances: -$121 <\/b><b>(+$358)<\/b><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Other than this small credit card balance, my wife and I have no other consumer debt. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, 2020 was a very good *financial* year for my wife and I. Since we only started sharing these monthly <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-5-man-alive\/\">net worth reports<\/a> in October last year, I can\u2019t really give a complete and full 12-month comparison and overview.
