Moved it to a fund that has very small growth but very little chance of losing. However back then it was at ~15,200 for the DOW and now the dow is about 17,000 or about 12% increase.<\/p>\n<p>My problem now is I know that I shouldn&#8217;t have done that but how do you convince yourself it is a good idea to move it all back into the other funds even though it is up 12% from where it was when I did it in the first place?<\/p>\n<p>Have you done anything like this and how did you get over it? I hate hearing over and over how the DOW is at an all time high and that just seems stupid to move all my money back right then.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Here was my response to him:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Sorry to hear man, that sucks. But honestly you&#8217;re not alone &#8211; it&#8217;s what millions of others do too and why people say to just <em>ignore<\/em> the news and pundits (and emotions!) as no none can predict anything. You gotta invest for the long haul and sit still &#8211; in good times and bad &#8211; to fully take advantage of the earnings in the long run. It&#8217;ll go up and down hundreds of times throughout our lifetime but you gotta be in it to win it! :) Also, better to learn this lesson early on with less money than later with a lot, eh?<\/p>\n<p>Now is the Dow currently at all-time highs? I guess. But it doesn&#8217;t really matter if you&#8217;re investing for 20, 30, 40 years. So concentrate more on sound investments <em>now<\/em> and then avert your eyes later when emotions and panic hits the masses &#8211; though I know it&#8217;s easier said than done. Also, keep in mind that when stocks go down later &#8211; which they will &#8211; you&#8217;ll only be able to pick them up cheaper! It&#8217;s all about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing-what-to-do-with-a-pile-of-cash\/\">dollar cost averaging<\/a> if you&#8217;re able to take advantage of that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I could care less what the &#8220;experts&#8221; are saying or not saying because at the end of the day it doesn&#8217;t matter at all &#8211; no one knows the answer.<\/strong> If you believe the market will go up over time like I do, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consider index funds<\/a> which go up when the market goes up, and goes down when markets go down as it tracks the general stock market. Either way you definitely can&#8217;t go in and out based on emotion as that&#8217;s a total losing game as you now know :(<\/p>\n<p>Again though, you&#8217;re not alone. You pulled the trigger and it&#8217;s done, so now it&#8217;s time to get back to it and be better the next time around. The good thing here is that you don&#8217;t have to touch the $$ for decades and decades (I think you&#8217;re young like me, yeah? in your 20s\/30s?) so there&#8217;s plenty of time to watch it grow again &#8211; this is just a small bump in the road.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh, and yes &#8211; I have done something similar before, only it was trying to game the system by day trading vs based on the market being at an all-time high or whatever. <\/strong>I took out $500 (which was HUGE for me at the time &#8211; as I had no real savings or investments and probably had balances on my credit cards too!) and tried to buy stocks of\u00a0Sirius Satellite Radio when it first came out. I&#8217;d pick up as much as $500 would buy early in the morning, and then throughout the day try to sell at higher prices and then buy back in when it dropped a few pennies\/percentages, etc etc.<\/p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t work, and I ended up losing a good $300 of it until I called it quits forever ;) And it didn&#8217;t help that I worked at E*Trade at the time when everyone around me (aka the &#8220;experts&#8221;) were trying to make fast money and all acting like they knew what they were doing when they didn&#8217;t. We were all chasing the quick buck instead of playing the long game.<\/p>\n<h2>Other People &amp; Things I Ignore<\/h2>\n<p>After responding back to my friend there, I thought I&#8217;d make this into a blog post and share some other people and things I typically ignore too &#8211; just like those highfalutin stock &#8220;experts.&#8221; These things rarely add any value to my life and\/or usually depress me:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Political pundits<\/li>\n<li>Complainers<\/li>\n<li>People on Facebook always trying to make you jealous of their lives (you know who they are ;))<\/li>\n<li>The things people\/celebrities are doing<\/li>\n<li>The things people\/celebrities are buying<\/li>\n<li>General TV News<\/li>\n<li>General economy news<\/li>\n<li>Toxic people in general<\/li>\n<li>And radio commercials. The worst! Always hawking expensive cars and shady loans!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The only two things up there probably worth explaining more is my general disregard to most news and economy updates<\/strong> &#8211; especially as a financial blogger ;)<strong>\u00a0<\/strong> I&#8217;ll pay attention to it when I&#8217;m bored or specifically into a certain story, but the main reason I don&#8217;t go out of my way to follow along is because 95% of it is negative every time I turn it on. And rarely does it affect my life or goals directly.<\/p>\n<p>To me, it&#8217;s smarter to focus on the stuff <em>within<\/em> our control rather than get caught up with all the noise out there distracting us. Unless you&#8217;re actually planning to run for office or change the world &#8211; both noble goals separating you from those who bitch about stuff and then sit back and do nothing.<\/p>\n<p>That said, of course you still need to know what&#8217;s going on around you to be a better informed and well-rounded person. And fortunately being so glued to blogs and Twitter all day, I come into a bulk of everything I need to know when my friends and people I respect are discussing it. And usually civilly :)<\/p>\n<h2>Which leads me to the people and things I *don&#8217;t* ignore!<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>People I love<\/li>\n<li>People I respect<\/li>\n<li>Things that bring joy to my life<\/li>\n<li>Things that make my life easier<\/li>\n<li>Things that are important to me and my values<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Go back to that Ignore List up there and tell me if any of those things match with this list below? They don&#8217;t, right? I still get my fill of the news and advice that I need to live a decent life, but they come from my &#8220;inner circle&#8221; vs random\/famous people who make a living spewing forecasts that are usually wrong in the end. As my good friend Kathryn likes to say &#8211; you never see them come back on TV and talk about all the times they were wrong, do you? They just keep going and pretend it never happened&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here &#8211; watch this video she made, it&#8217;s hilarious (because it&#8217;s true!):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/FZAbLdzbnFk?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><strong>Anyways, all that to say it&#8217;s important to surround yourself with the things and people that coincide with your values. <\/strong>Also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make investment decisions for the long run and sit on your hands when emotions are high<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t day trade &#8211; even if your friend just made a million dollars (he&#8217;ll soon lose it)<\/li>\n<li>Do your best to focus on the things within your control<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I deviated a bit from my friend&#8217;s email there, but hopefully it was worth it ;) <em>What are other things we should ignore or pay attention to?
