For those of you who don\u2019t know, FinCon began in 2011 as the Financial Blogger Conference, but now it\u2019s a place for all types of digital content creators, money nerds and brands to get together and geek out on personal finance stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64232 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Joel-at-FinCon-e1633316138501.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was my second time going to FinCon. I met 1000 cool bloggers there, learned 1000 new things, and drank 1000 beers. Very fun stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than doing a review of the event and name-dropping all the bloggy-celebs who were there, I wanted to share some of the neat brands and companies that surprised me. I love FinTech and want to spread the word about anything that can help people make\/save money in smarter ways. Here are 3 cool FinTech companies and apps that I found interesting, and you might too&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**No, they didn\u2019t pay me to write about them or sponsor this post. Just sharing stuff I think is good!**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>LifeGoal Investments: ETFs for Various Life Goals<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64231 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Lifegoal-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Lifegoal-logo.png 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Lifegoal-logo-300x120.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the first day of the conference my friend said, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHave you checked out LifeGoal Investments yet? They are super interesting! They are a new company that created 5 different ETFs people can invest in.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my head I was thinking, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWho cares? The only ETF I am interested in is VTI. Why would I invest in anything else?\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then later I learned what these ETFs were created for and their purpose. The more I spoke with LifeGoal Investments, the more impressed I was with their mission! They are helping people store <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less in cash positions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, 2 of their ETFs really struck a chord with me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first ETF is called <\/span><b>LifeGoal Homeowner ETF (NYSE: HOM).<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This ETF was specifically created for people who are saving up for a home down payment. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen an ETF address this problem (and they actually have a patent pending for this type of ETF).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Here is the problem it solves: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest hurdles for a homebuyer is saving up to make cash down payment. The average size of a down payment in America is ~$47,000, and the average time it takes to save is 6.5 years!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge is, most people save their down payment <\/span><b>in cash<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They save cash in a regular checking account (earning $0 interest) or a savings account (earning a few pennies interest). Meanwhile, from the time they start saving until the time they are ready to purchase a home 6 years later, housing prices continue to rise and inflation eats away the buying power of their cash savings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution is to convince people to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invest<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their housing down payment while they save up. BUT\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What average person trusts the \u201cstock market\u201d and knows how to invest conservatively!? <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in 100% stocks can be \u201crisky\u201d for potential homeowners because if there\u2019s a crash, they could lose a chunk of the down payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, that\u2019s what the HOM ETF was built for. It\u2019s very conservative (~75% bonds, 25% stocks) and <\/span><b>the biggest stock holdings are directly tied to the housing market<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It holds stocks like Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, Zillow Group, etc. The idea is that as the housing market rises, a portion of the down payment savings also rises, helping people afford higher house prices when they\u2019re ready to buy. REALLY innovative stuff! <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifegoalinvestments.com\/hom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more about HOM here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other ETF that impressed me was <\/span><b>General Conservative ETF (NYSE: SAVN).<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is built to help people conservatively invest their savings or everyday emergency fund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of you guys know that already I <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/lowering-my-emergency-fund-to-0-00\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lowered my emergency fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> significantly, investing most of it in VTI. And many people shook their heads at me, thinking it was very risky! (It kind of is.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, I still believe holding emergency fund cash in a checking\/savings account hurts more than it helps in the long run. So this new ETF called SAVN is a different, very conservative way to invest emergency cash to make sure money is still working a little bit for you. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifegoalinvestments.com\/savn\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more about SAVN here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**This is probably a good time to remind you that I am not a financial advisor! Don\u2019t invest in stuff just \u2018cause I think it\u2019s cool. Gotta do your own research. :)**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Qube Money: A Budgeting App with \u201cEnvelopes\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64233 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/qube-money-logo-1536x631-1-e1633316148484.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"246\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budgeting with physical envelopes is pretty common. Many people love it. You take your paycheck, turn it into cash, divide all the dollars up into different envelopes and spend only what\u2019s inside each month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/qubemoney.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qube<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the <\/span><b>digital version of cash envelope budgeting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The basic plan (free) lets you create 10 envelopes &#8212; called qubes &#8212; and spend money via a debit card. The big difference is that by default, the debit card holds a $0 balance. By this, I mean that the card can only be used after you assign it some money from one of the envelopes. All spending is controlled by the app, BEFORE a purchase is actually made on the debit card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a quick video showing how it works: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KybvSZ99Asc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qube Money Video<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I love about this budgeting process is it encourages more intentional buying habits. It helps people stop and think before making purchases. The app is designed to not allow you to overspend in a category (just like you can\u2019t take out more money from a physical envelope than what\u2019s actually inside of it). You are not capable of overdrafting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was also pretty impressed with the company&#8217;s product roadmap. Their paid versions offer more features, and family\/children features are coming soon. This will allow you to give kids debit cards, and load them up with an exact amount of money, instantly, from the mobile app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this seems cool and you\u2019re looking to replace your physical cash envelope budgeting, check out Qube. Like I said, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/qubemoney.com\/pricing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">basic plan and sign-up is FREE!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**I also learned about a new app called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.withyotta.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yotta<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has a similar \u201cbucket\u201d system for saving for money goals. They reward users with a lottery-like game and awards for meeting savings goals, encouraging good savings habits. Kind of cool!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>RocketDollar: Self Directed IRAs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64234 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rocketdollar-logoo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"438\" height=\"115\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rocketdollar-logoo.png 438w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rocketdollar-logoo-300x79.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I liked learning about RocketDollar. They\u2019ve been out for a few years already so maybe I\u2019m late to the game here, but this was my first time really looking at their offering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RocketDollar makes it easy to invest in almost anything inside your IRA account. Instead of the common stocks\/bonds\/REITS, you can buy a physical rental property, invest in precious metals, cryptocurrencies, or even a private start-up business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative investments can sometimes be risky. But, with higher risk can come higher returns. Making higher profits inside a tax advantaged account can be a huge advantage over long holding periods as opposed to buying with after-tax funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a little expensive ($15 per month with a $360 set-up fee), but all of the legal work and account structure is set up for you quickly, along with an LLC to hold investments. They also provide easy online tools to manage your stuff. Looking back, I wish I had used my IRA to invest in some of my real estate syndication deals. Instead, I used after-tax cash so I have to pay taxes on all gains the moment they are realized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, before you get excited and gamble all your IRA funds away on crypto stuff\u2026 You\u2019d better do your own due diligence on what you\u2019re investing in. Just because you can do alternative investments with your IRA doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best option for you.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whelp, I\u2019ll share more stuff about FinCon over time and maybe talk about some of the interesting peeps I met there. (A lot of TikTok, YouTube and Instagram influencers\u2026 they made me feel so OLD!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hope y\u2019all have an awesome day ahead!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheers,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>October 14, 2021 update: After this post was published, Joel made a personal investment in LifeGoal Investments.
