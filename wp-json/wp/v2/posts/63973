And Money Is Time."},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve probably heard the saying <\/span><b>time is money<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As weird as it sounds, it was one of my favorite concepts growing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a teenager, my first jobs were hourly paid. The more hours I worked, the more money I made. If I didn\u2019t work any hours, I didn\u2019t get paid anything. Back then I took the phrase \u2018time is money\u2019 quite literally, and it motivated me to work harder and earn more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today however, I am learning that the flipside of this phrase can be equally motivating. <\/span><b>Money is time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! By this I mean that if you\u2019ve saved a lot of money, you can potentially buy hours of free time in your life. (Not <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> time &#8212; we all get the same 24 hours a day &#8212; I\u2019m talking about <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> time, as in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freedom<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to choose how you live.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>\u201cRemember That Time Is Money\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently Ben Franklin said this first, way back in 1748 when he published a short essay called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/founders.archives.gov\/documents\/Franklin\/01-03-02-0130\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advice to a Young Tradesman<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here\u2019s a snip from the paper\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><\/i><b><i>Remember that Time is Money.<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or sits idle one half of that day, tho\u2019 he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon that the only expense; he has really spent or rather thrown away five shillings besides.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll admit I had to re-read that passage about 6 times to decipher Franklin\u2019s old-school (and gender bias) writing style. But what I think he was trying to say is:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you earn $10 dollars for each day of work, but choose to take a day off, then that day just \u201ccost\u201d you $10. (Opportunity cost)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if you take the day off AND spend $5 buying something, in total, the day cost you $15. ($10 in opportunity cost + $5 in real cost)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, basically, we should all work 365 days out of every year, right? Every second we\u2019re not working, we are wasting money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, probably not. Although it\u2019s important to understand opportunity cost and make money while you can, it\u2019s also important to find balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Taking the Concept Too Far<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back when I was 20, I worked as an hourly paid employee at a cellphone store. I can\u2019t remember my exact wage, but it was probably like ~$16 per hour (this is Australian Dollars, so maybe like $12\/hr USD). I worked 5 days a week, so my take-home pay was about $130 each day before taxes. That\u2019s about $33k per year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I was a money-hungry little bugger, this wasn\u2019t good enough for me. And since I didn\u2019t yet understand the concept of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher value<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> labor, I decided to trade <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of my time for money at a second job, after hours. My mindset was simply, <\/span><b>more hours working = more money.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My after-hours job was at the Australian Post office, working 7pm to 12am sorting mail for $18 an hour. Daily, that was ~$90 before taxes, so $23k per year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, with both jobs that\u2019s $56k before taxes, working ~60 hours per week. Decent coin for a 20-year-old! At first I was loving it! Knowing that I was maximizing my time and not missing out on any opportunity to work felt great.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, as you can imagine, it eventually led to burnout. Prioritizing money too much and giving all my time away was unhealthy. I learned a huge lesson during that time in my life \u2192 <\/span><b>Although time is money, sometimes the money isn\u2019t worth trading the time for.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another cool thing I learned during that time\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>\u201cRemember That Credit Is Money\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This saying comes from Ben Franklin\u2019s exact same essay, right after the \u201ctime is money\u201d bit. He continues on to say:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><\/i><b><i>Remember that Credit is Money.<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the interest, or so much as I can make of it during that time. This amounts to a considerable sum&#8230; Remember that money is of a prolific generating nature. <\/span><\/i><b><i>Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and so on. Five shillings turn\u2019d, is six: Turn\u2019d again, \u2019tis seven and three pence; and so on \u2019til it becomes an hundred pound.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, I had to re-read this a few times to decipher it\u2026 But I\u2019m pretty sure that Franklin is talking about compound interest! His lessons here are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money can make more money, compounding over time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The earlier in life you make money, the more compounding can happen.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you miss work for your $10 of pay, it not only costs you $10\u2026 <\/span><b>It also costs you the potential compounding<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over and over again throughout life.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bottom line: Time is waaaay more money than most people think \u2026 because opportunity cost also has compounding value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was lucky to be exposed to investing at an early age. It took a good decade of saving and buying assets, but I was finally able to shift my mindset from trading time for money, to using my assets to generate money.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Money Can Buy Free Time<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I say you can \u201cbuy\u201d time, what I really mean is that money can be used to remove regular obligations in life (work, chores, inconveniences), freeing up your time so it can be spent in more fulfilling ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moneyisemotional.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Luken<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dropped a cool comment the other day on the blog. She said:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne thing I will add is something I do called \u201cBuying Back My Time.\u201d It\u2019s the rule I use to figure out if I should do something myself or pay someone else to do it. Essentially, I calculate how much time something takes me versus how much it costs me to pay someone else to do it. For example, my cleaning person takes 10 hours of work off my plate per month for the low, low cost of $160. (She only needs 6 hours to get it done because she\u2019s that good.) All I need to do is sell an online course or to book one 60-minute corporate money wellness webinar to pay for my house cleaner. <\/span><\/i><b><i>$160 to buy back 10 hours of my time is an amazing deal for me!\u201d<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outsourcing work gives you more free time. But in order to do that, you have to have money to pay for it. In Christine\u2019s case, she can pay for 10 hours of free time for $160. (And she also worked out that she can make $160 in 1 hour, or by selling a book.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achieving financial independence (especially at an early age) can give you HUGE amounts of free time in life. If you\u2019ve saved up enough money to cover your bills and conveniences for the rest of your life, you\u2019ve just \u201cbought\u201d free time for the rest of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Time Is an Asset. And Money Is an Asset.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, both time and money are assets. It\u2019s up to you on how you want to use them in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I promise this is the last Ben Franklin quote I\u2019ll use for a while! This is from the final paragraph in his essay\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn short, the Way to Wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, Industry and Frugality; i.e. <\/span><\/i><b><i>Waste neither Time nor Money, but make the best Use of both.<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He that gets all he can honestly, and saves all he gets (necessary expenses accepted) will certainly become Rich.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agree? Disagree?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wishing you all a lovely week ahead, spending your time and money in awesome ways!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love, Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019ve probably heard the saying time is money.
