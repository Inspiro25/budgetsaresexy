But since I&#8217;ve never actually heard anyone doing this before (and I know I&#8217;m not the only one who had this idea!), me thinks maybe it&#8217;s not exactly legal to do so&#8230; And I&#8217;m too lazy right now to Google it and find out, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh forget it \u2013 I just spent the 30 second researching and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/fact-check\/first-class-salesmanship\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apparently you <em>can<\/em> sell stamps if you want to<\/a>!

We have no control over the pricing policies of private entrepreneurs, companies or agencies who resell our products.<\/p>\n<p>Customers may avoid paying more than the stated value for First-Class Mail\u00ae postage by purchasing stamps at a local Post Office&#x2122; location, through Stamps By Mail\u00ae, phone, online, self-service kiosks and retail outlets that are involved with our consignment programs or from one of the many postal stores.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Excellent! So why aren&#8217;t more people doing this?? Too costly to market or find customers? Not enough margin? I know storage can&#8217;t be an issue considering how small and lightweight they are, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>TRUE STORY:<\/strong> I once <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/all-30-jobs-ive-ever-done\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">worked at a stamp factory<\/a> over a summer, and we weren&#8217;t allowed to wear any clothing with pockets or bring in any bags that weren&#8217;t completely see-through in order to thwart thievery. We even had to go through security check points every time we entered or left the building! I also remember one guy pointing to a load of pallets on my first day and saying that each one of them was worth around a million dollars each &#8211; so wild&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But I digress&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>And now because I went down this dang Google hole, you get to read the hundreds of facts I just uncovered while spending an additional 30 minutes on it (curse you!!).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>They are pretty good though :)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Post Office Department was founded in 1775, making it the second oldest federal department<\/li>\n<li>Benjamin Franklin was appointed its \u0015first Postmaster General, and up until 1971 the Postmaster General was a Cabinet member<\/li>\n<li>U.S. mail is protected by more than 200 federal laws enforced by the Postal Inspection Service, one of the nation&#8217;s oldest law enforcement agencies<\/li>\n<li>The Postal Service receives NO tax dollars for operating expenses, and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations<\/li>\n<li>The Postal Service has the nation\u2019s largest retail network &#8211; bigger than McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and Walmart combined (domestically)<\/li>\n<li>The USPS employs more than 7.5 million people, including more than 105,000 military veterans &#8211; making it one of the largest employers of veterans in the country<\/li>\n<li>There are 228,483 delivery routes, that go to over 157 million addresses in every state, city and town in the country<\/li>\n<li>The most popular street name is &#8220;Main&#8221; (13,000 of them!), followed by &#8220;Maple&#8221; (8,000)<\/li>\n<li>The longest rural delivery route is in Erie, KS, where the carrier travels 185.4 miles every day delivering to 174 boxes<\/li>\n<li>The shortest rural delivery route is in Athens, GA with 0.18 miles traveled daily and 280 deliveries<\/li>\n<li>The ZIP Code with the most possible street deliveries is Cathedral Station, NY (10025) with 45,742!<\/li>\n<li>ZIP stands for &#8220;Zone Improvement Plan&#8221; which was introduced in 1963, and are important parts of the nation\u2019s 911 emergency system.<\/li>\n<li>The first number of ZIP codes represents a general geographic area of the nation, such as &#8220;0&#8221; in the East moving to &#8220;9&#8221; in the West.
