Please welcome today, a good blogging bud of mine, <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ESI<\/a> from ESIMoney.com. He <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/i-retired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently retired at 52<\/a> and gained a whole new appreciation for what life has to offer. And spoiler alert: it doesn&#8217;t involve money or a high-powered career! Both of which he retired from once he realized enough was enough (his &#8220;enough,&#8221; btw? <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/the-first-million-is-the-hardest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$3 million<\/a> :)) Take it away, ESI!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<p><strong>When I retired last fall at 52, I thought I knew exactly what retirement would be like.<\/strong> Many of the expectations I had did come true, but there were several surprises as well.<\/p>\n<p>Today I&#8217;ll share my revelations in hopes those of you considering early retirement might be better prepared for it.<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Mondays Became the Best Day of the Week<\/h2>\n<p>Monday was my archenemy for decades.<\/p>\n<p>I worked as a marketing executive for 28 years, many of them in high-pressure jobs. The sinking feeling would start about 4 pm on Sunday &#8212; dreading the work week to come.<\/p>\n<p>Then Monday would hit and it&#8217;d be the low point of my week. Each day got better than the previous one until we hit Friday. It was all great from there. Until Sunday at 4 pm again.<\/p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/monday-best-day-retirement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monday is my favorite day of the week<\/a>. It signals the beginning of five days of peace and quiet. The gym is less busy, the stores are less busy, restaurants are less busy, everything is less busy &#8212; because people are at work. It&#8217;s quiet, and I like it.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. My Colleagues Can&#8217;t Accept I&#8217;m Retired<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/responses-to-my-retirement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whole host of reactions you get<\/a> when you retire early. Most of them are quite comical because people are literally stunned. This is especially the case when you&#8217;re a C-level executive (or higher), and you retire during your most lucrative decade of earning power.<\/p>\n<p>I expected people to be a bit shocked, but I didn&#8217;t foresee them constantly pushing new jobs at me like I needed to work or my life was over. Colleagues after colleagues send me new job openings all the time now. I have more recruiters than ever even connecting on LinkedIn and forwarding me job listings (some are pretty good actually!).<\/p>\n<p>Even people I just meet aren&#8217;t satisfied with my retirement.<\/p>\n<p>I had coffee the other day with a friend of a friend because the original friend said we should meet. The new guy spent the whole time brainstorming how he could help me find a job. Ugh. I feel like an unmarried, 30-year-old woman whose Jewish mother keeps pushing bachelors her way so she&#8217;ll get married even though she doesn&#8217;t want to be married.<\/p>\n<h2>#3. I&#8217;m Busier than Ever<\/h2>\n<p>When you work 50+ hours a week for most of a career and have a family along with personal interests, you&#8217;re very busy. Life is hectic. That&#8217;s just the way it is.<\/p>\n<p>I expected things would calm down dramatically when I retired, but I now seem to have more to do than ever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The difference is that I went from doing things I <em>HAD<\/em> to do, though, to doing things I <em>WANT<\/em> to do. Which makes all the difference in the world.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;m swamped.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been ramping up my blog writing (which is quite fun and gives me a creative and intellectual outlet). I started working out at a faster pace. I developed a plan to climb <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pikes_Peak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pikes Peak<\/a> this summer. I got involved in more aspects of planning my daughter&#8217;s college career. I started helping my son find his life calling. I dramatically upped my video game playing time (from virtually nothing to an hour or so a day at the present time (Horizon Zero Dawn FTW!!!)). I joined a non-profit board that helps the homeless. And I&#8217;m planning several trips with various members of my family.<\/p>\n<p>On and on it goes. Most of the things on my to-do list simply move to the next day&#8217;s undone.<\/p>\n<p>I was one of those people who used to think &#8220;What will I do all day in retirement?&#8221; I then moved to &#8220;I&#8217;ll find things to do&#8221;, so I made the leap. Now, I&#8217;m wondering, &#8220;How will I get it all done?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But I am doing what I want, which makes this a &#8220;fun busy&#8221;. So I don&#8217;t mind.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. I&#8217;m In The Best Physical Shape of My Life<\/h2>\n<p>I started working with a trainer about 18 months ago. Up until retirement, I had made tremendous progress. I added 20 pounds of muscle and dramatically improved my cardio conditioning (which has always been good.) As a result, I almost completely eliminated back issues that I had for over 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>I thought I&#8217;d continue on the same pace during retirement, but the freedom of time and lack of stress has really taken my workouts up a notch.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, since I&#8217;m at home more, I can control better what I eat &#8212; which has always been my weak spot as it&#8217;s so hard to eat well at the office (at least for me). They say being in good shape is 80% nutrition and 20% exercise. I so wish the percentages were reversed!<\/p>\n<p>When I was younger, I could work out and eat pretty much whatever I wanted. No longer. As I gained that extra muscle, I didn&#8217;t lose much fat, so my weight went up (even while my waist size shrunk).<\/p>\n<p>After retirement, I decided to get serious about eating well. I went high protein and low carb. Since the start of the year I have lost 16 pounds of mostly fat. In addition, I was given my third cardio test and my VO2 max was in the &#8220;excellent&#8221; range for my age. It was so good that it&#8217;s even in the &#8220;good&#8221; range for a 20-year-old.<\/p>\n<p>Who would have thought my best physical years would be after 50?<\/p>\n<h2>#5. I&#8217;ve Gotten Very Comfortable Wearing Casual Clothes<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to say I have always been an uptight dresser. Let&#8217;s just say I was always dressed for the occasion. I like to look nice and professional whether at work, church, or even out shopping. I&#8217;m not wearing $1,000 suits by any means, but I like to be dressed &#8220;nicely&#8221; wherever I go.<\/p>\n<p>Cue the workout pants. You know, the baggy, comfortable ones similar to what basketball players wear during warm-ups? They refresh my soul.<\/p>\n<p>It took me about three days to go from button-down Bob to casual Clyde.<\/p>\n<p>Do you know how comfortable workout pants are? Answer: VERY comfortable. These are for colder temperatures. Do you know how comfortable shorts are? Answer: VERY comfortable. These are for warmer temperatures.<\/p>\n<p>Both are accompanied by a t-shirt and\/or a Columbia thin pullover depending on the temperature.<\/p>\n<p>These are now my clothing wear of choice. I haven&#8217;t donned even a pair of Dockers more than twice in eight months (I did wear a pair to a funeral, however). I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where even putting on jeans feels like I&#8217;m &#8220;dressing up&#8221;. And they just aren&#8217;t as comfortable as I like.<\/p>\n<p>We even joke at my non-profit board meetings that I dress up for them by wearing my &#8220;nice&#8221; workout pants or shorts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But what do I care? I don&#8217;t have anyone to impress.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consider Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and the like. No dressing up there. They don&#8217;t (didn&#8217;t in Jobs&#8217; case) care what they are wearing, they just want to be comfortable. And while I don&#8217;t have billions like they do, I am financially independent and can wear whatever I want.<\/p>\n<p>Much different than my pre-retirement days&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>#6. My Family Relationships Are Much Better<\/h2>\n<p>I assumed that retirement would give me more time with family, but I didn&#8217;t know how meaningful and far-reaching this time would be.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a sampling of the impact so far:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>My wife and I take two 45-minute walks a day now (we live in Colorado, so even much of winter is walkable). It gives us lots of time to connect and talk. Great for our relationship.<\/li>\n<li>I developed a reading plan for my son to help him discover what career he wants. We discuss each book and his notes on it. He&#8217;s also my Tuesday movie buddy (half-priced tickets!) since we like the same kind of shows.<\/li>\n<li>My daughter and I go out regularly to eat (we both like Mexican), shop (she&#8217;s hooked on Bath and Body Works), or have coffee. We talk a lot about what she wants to do with her life, what to expect in college, etc. She&#8217;s totally prepared. We&#8217;ll be taking her senior trip to Seattle and Portland this summer and I&#8217;ll be dropping her off at college in the fall.<\/li>\n<li>I have been able to see my parents a few times since retirement &#8212; way more than the twice-annual visits we had before. In addition, my dad will be coming to see us in June.<\/li>\n<li>I was able to re-connect with my cousin on one trip to see my parents. I had the time (of course) that I never had before, so I asked if he was available. He was and we had a great breakfast. It was awesome!<\/li>\n<li>I was able to attend my Aunt&#8217;s funeral, and even be at the hospital right before she passed. Having a job would have not afforded me the time (or at least as much time) for either of these.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition to helping connect with family, being retired has allowed me to connect with <em>friends<\/em>. I attended my college reunion last fall and got to see my three best friends from that time. I would have NEVER spent a week doing that had I been working. And I hadn&#8217;t planned on it even once I retired, but the new, more relaxed, me thought &#8220;what the heck!&#8221; and I went. So glad I did. I&#8217;ll be headed back to college homecoming this year too!<\/p>\n<p>This is probably the most rewarding part of early retirement for me and completely unexpected. It&#8217;s been a great surprise.<\/p>\n<h2>#7. I&#8217;m Learning and Growing More than Ever<\/h2>\n<p>Retirement is the time to kick back, down-shift, and relax, right? The time to coast on all the work we&#8217;ve done up to this point, similar to the Falcons in the second half of the Super Bowl? (Oh wait, that didn&#8217;t work out so well)<\/p>\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s just say that coasting is not for me. I&#8217;m pushing forward more than I ever have and am loving it! I am learning and growing in ways I completely didn&#8217;t expect.<\/p>\n<p>Some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m reading more than ever.<\/strong> The library and I are on a first-name basis. I&#8217;m there several times a week. I&#8217;m reading on personal growth, fitness, blogging, and a whole host of non-fiction topics. I also have time to read fiction and am catching up on John Grisham&#8217;s stuff, as well as a Batman graphic novel here and there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m learning from YouTube.<\/strong> You can find videos on how to do anything these days. Now that I have time, I&#8217;m learning how to cook (especially grill), how to do simple repairs around the house (I&#8217;m not &#8220;handy&#8221; yet, but I&#8217;m getting there), how to travel hack (still a neophyte but learning), and on and on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m heading up Pikes Peak.<\/strong> I told you I&#8217;m planning on walking up Pikes Peak this summer. So I&#8217;m learning about the physical challenges (and training accordingly), the equipment, weather, etc. It&#8217;s a blast to learn new things as well as have some big, physical challenge to look forward to.<\/li>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m planning loads of travel.<\/strong> My wife used to handle most of the travel planning, but I&#8217;m now becoming the expert. This year we have trips planned to Seattle, Portland, back to Iowa (where I&#8217;m from), Dallas, and, the crowning touch, a month in St. Thomas early next year. There are various decisions to make, and of course I want to make the trips as great as possible, so I&#8217;m doing lots of reading about each place and searching for great deals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m consuming podcasts.<\/strong> As I train for Pikes Peak, I&#8217;m walking a lot. Some of that is alone, and when I walk alone I listen to podcasts. I&#8217;m learning about a whole host of topics, plus getting lots of input on financial issues that keep me sharp. I really look forward to this time each day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m playing chess.<\/strong> I now have time to do daily chess puzzles, play chess, read chess books, and even watch chess videos. I know some of you are close to falling asleep simply reading that last sentence, but chess thrills me. The strategy and complexity gets my juices flowing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m interested in a lot of things, and now I have the time to learn about them too. I thought I would have some time for this, but the amount and diversity of learning has really surprised me.<\/p>\n<h2>#8. I Can&#8217;t Go Back To Work Anymore<\/h2>\n<p>When I retired I thought I&#8217;d only take a year or two off, but would then likely go back to work at some point &#8212; even if just part-time. After all, I was a high-power executive and work was what I did!<\/p>\n<p>Now I can&#8217;t imagine <em>ever<\/em> going back.<\/p>\n<p>If I did, I&#8217;d hate Mondays again. I&#8217;d have to dress in something other than comfortable clothes. I&#8217;d miss the time with family and friends. I&#8217;d have to cut back on fitness and learning. I&#8217;d have to live by a schedule. That all sounds like a colossal pain in the rear now.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve since eased into my new normal, and I love it.<\/p>\n<h2>#9. The Stress is Gone<\/h2>\n<p>We all hear about stress and how it impacts our health, and so forth. But having lived with it for so long, it was normal to me. I didn&#8217;t realize just how much it was impacting me.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, every once in a while I would realize my temples were tight and my jaw was clinched while laying in bed. I&#8217;d try to relax my facial muscles and could for a bit, but even trying to fall asleep, the tension would come back. It was the stress of work.<\/p>\n<p>Once I retired, I could literally feel the stress melt away. It was that tangible. I was destressing after 28 years of constant pressure.<\/p>\n<p>It took several months to go completely away (it was that bad!), but I eventually got to a low point of stress I never thought I would reach. I started sleeping better. My head wasn&#8217;t tight all the time. Life was more relaxing overall.<\/p>\n<p>I was surprised at just how noticeable it was. Something that simply was there for most of my life, is now almost nonexistent.<\/p>\n<h2>#10. I&#8217;ve Turned Into a Morning Person<\/h2>\n<p>There are morning people, and there are night people. I have been a night person my whole life. My ideal world was to stay up until 3 am and get up around noon. Not bad, right?<\/p>\n<p>But I had to go against that grain during my career. Most companies expect you to roll in well before noon, so I was up early every day and I hated it.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d sleep to noon every day once I retired, but I did think I&#8217;d sack in until at least 9 or 10am.<\/p>\n<p>Nope. I&#8217;m now up and at &#8217;em by 6 am most days. Sometimes I&#8217;ll got to 7 am if I had a really hard workout the previous day or stayed up late the night before. But that&#8217;s rare. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I slept until 8 am. And I&#8217;m certainly up more days before 6 am than after 7 am.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The big difference now, though, is that life is so much more exciting.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m getting up to do things that <em>I<\/em> want to do. It&#8217;s a blast &#8212; almost like the night before Christmas. I&#8217;m excited about the next day and simply can&#8217;t sleep longer.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, the working out and lack of stress helps my sleep to be more restful, so I feel better with less sleep now than I did with more sleep while working. (But don&#8217;t worry that I&#8217;m robbing myself. I&#8217;m a regular 10 pm to 6 am sleeper, so I still get eight hours most nights)<\/p>\n<p>My kids think I&#8217;m crazy (&#8220;why do you get up so early?&#8221; they ask) but that&#8217;s what happens when you are excited about life.<\/p>\n<p>My wife has always been a morning person, but I&#8217;m now up an hour or so before her each day. It&#8217;s so quiet and peaceful at 6 am and the day is full of promise. It&#8217;s my favorite time of the day. 6 am on Monday is heaven.<\/p>\n<p>As a bonus, I heard somewhere that <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/can-getting-up-early-make-you-wealthy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting up early can make you wealthy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>[<strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:<\/strong> This is the reason I started waking up at 5am every day!
