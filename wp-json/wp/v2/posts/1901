Hope you get this on time,sorry I didn&#8217;t inform you about my trip to United Kingdom for a program. It has been a very sad and bad moment for me over here and the present condition that i found myself is very hard for me to explain, I&#8217;m sorry for this odd request and I&#8217;m writing this with tears in my eyes, I \u00a0was mugged at gun point last night at the park of the hotel where i checking all my cash, credit cards and cell were stolen off me. I am even owing the hotel a sum $2000, the hotel manager won&#8217;t let me leave until i settle the hotel bills now am freaked out. So i have limited access to emails for now and i can&#8217;t access phone for now, please i need you to lend me about $3500 or any amount you can afford so i can make arrangements and return back I am full of panic now, the police only asked me to write a statement about the incident and directed me to the embassy, i have spoken to the embassy here but they are not responding to the matter effectively, I will refund the money back to you as soon as i return, I am so confused right now and thank God i wasn&#8217;t injured because I complied immediately. I need this help so much and on time because i am in a terrible and tight situation here, please understand how important and urgent i needed your help. so please let me know on time so i can forward you my details on how to transfer the money And let this be personal even if you can&#8217;t help because i don&#8217;t want people to be worried about me.<\/p>\n<div>I await your response<\/div>\n<div>Thanks&#8221;<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>If the horrible grammar doesn&#8217;t give it away at first<\/strong> (we all have friends who write like they&#8217;re on crack &#8211; myself included sometimes), the fact that they&#8217;re EMAILING you for this info should be a huge warning sign.\u00a0 As well as the business-like response at the end, and the famous &#8220;don&#8217;t tell anyone I&#8217;m trying to trick you&#8221; type deal. We&#8217;re not 5 years old anymore.\u00a0 Remember, these zombies have full access to our friends&#8217; email accounts right now until they figure out what&#8217;s going on and can reset their password. So if you get one of these, CALL up your text your friend to let him\/her know they&#8217;ve been hacked &#8211; don&#8217;t email them back ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>A good rule of thumb to spot a scam right away is when someone&#8217;s asking for your personal and account information over email\/internet.<\/strong> Paypal, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa\">USAA<\/a>, and all the other banks out there that are legitimate business would never do this! Nor would I, so don&#8217;t ever give me money :) (Unless you&#8217;ve won one of my sexy giveaways &#8211; then you better give me your address or I&#8217;ll have to keep &#8217;em for myself!)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a slighty &#8220;better&#8221; email scam&#8230;def. got me confused at first since it was the first on I&#8217;d seen:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m writing this with tears in my eyes,We came down here to England for a short vacation and i was mugged at gun point last night,at the park of the hotel where we lodged all cash,creditcards and cell were stolen off me, thank God we have our life and passport.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been to the embassy and the Police here but they&#8217;re not helping issues at all,they asked us to wait for 3weeks but we can&#8217;t wait till then.
