I also found it hard to focus on goals and life all morning long and eventually opened up my laptop to start working before anxiety took over!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>A helluva exercise to take on though, and one which I highly recommend if you&#8217;re having trouble getting a good rhythm down yourself.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here are our original two postings on this if interested:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/working-benjamin-franklin-schedule\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trying To Be Benjamin Franklin For a Week<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/learned-working-like-benjamin-franklin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What I Learned Working Like Benjamin Franklin For a Week<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s been three years now almost exactly since I gave this experiment a shot, so I thought I&#8217;d share how I currently feel about it all, since I&#8217;m proudly still going strong in the *waking up early* department :)<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t wake up at exactly 5 am on the dot anymore (which I blame on my kids), but I routinely get up 1-2 hours earlier than the rest of my family every day*, usually around 5:30\/6:00 am.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;\">Here are all the reasons I still do it:<\/h2>\n<p><strong>#1. The stillness of the mornings is so peaceful! <\/strong>When was the last time you could just sit there by yourself in absolute quiet? Without interruptions? It&#8217;s hard as hell to wake up some mornings, but the second I sit down in my cozy corner of the house with my cozy warm coffee in my hands, I&#8217;m reminded right away of why I still do this :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. It&#8217;s nice to set your *own tone* for the day, instead of outside influences.<\/strong> I used to wake up to the sound of crying babies or cell phones going off, but when you wake up around 5 am ain&#8217;t no one is ready to pester you yet! It&#8217;s as nice as it is empowering to wake up on your own accord.<\/p>\n<p><strong> #3. Early wake ups slowwwwwws down time and helps you appreciate life more. <\/strong>It&#8217;s so easy to get caught up in the quickness and routines of the day, that if you don&#8217;t take the time to breathe and hit &#8220;pause&#8221; at any point you&#8217;ll speed through the days much faster than you want. Waking up early helps slow you down a bit and gives you some good time to reflect and remember why you&#8217;re on this green Earth of ours! And it&#8217;s not to be busy 24\/7!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. It\u2019s nice having 100% YOU time.<\/strong> One-two hours to do whatever the hell you want: hustle\/pray\/build\/write\/create\/read\/anything except for sleep :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. It feels <em>damn good<\/em> knocking out solid work first thing!<\/strong> I still do a version of the &#8220;<em>Powerful Goodness!<\/em>&#8221; recommended by B. Frank every morning (i.e. praying\/reflecting), but with multiple kids in tow I tend now to jump right into my work and get a good start for the day before the madness ensues. Makes for a great time to knock out any of the stuff that tends to get pushed to the side, as well as any lingering passion projects too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#6. I work\/think much more efficiently in the mornings.<\/strong> This was another nice surprise because I always thought of myself as a &#8220;night person.&#8221; Turns out I work and think much more clearer (and faster) though in the wee mornings than I do evenings?! And since you&#8217;re not really *gaining* any free hours by waking up earlier because it means having to go to bed earlier, it&#8217;s like swapping out crappier hours with more focused and energetic ones! Kinda cool.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#7. Early wake-ups helped me to shut down the laptop in the evenings. <\/strong>First, because I&#8217;m usually way to exhausted to even do it, haha, but secondly because I&#8217;m now able to get most of what I want done every day jumping right into it vs having to wait on other peoples&#8217; schedules. To hustlers this might sound like the opposite of a good thing as we&#8217;re so conditioned to work 24\/7, but for all those who are self-employed you\u2019ll know just how hard it is to delineate the lines between professional and personal time. Especially if you work online where people never sleep!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#8. I&#8217;m much less anxious these days!<\/strong> I didn&#8217;t realize how much I actually carried until starting this experiment, but looking back I was always a bit anxious going to bed knowing that I never got everything done I had wanted that day. Now though, no matter what&#8217;s going on, I always know I at least have an hour or two FIRST THING in the morning to deal with whatever&#8217;s on my brain! And even though it&#8217;s not any *extra* hours as mentioned above, just knowing I can get to it <em>right away<\/em> helps sooth me over as I lay down to sleep.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#9. I go to bed at a reasonable time now.<\/strong> This was probably harder at first than the actual wake-ups themselves, but after I got going I was so drained from the long days that I started actually *looking forward* to going to bed early, haha&#8230; No more 12am-2am bed times for this guy! I&#8217;m in bed like an old man by 10pm&#8217;ish every night! Party time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#10. Lastly (and most surprisingly?), waking up early has stopped me from snacking and drinking beers throughout the night! <\/strong> This was by far the most unexpected result of this newly formed long-term habit. Since I knew I had to take showers and brush my teeth earlier with the earlier bed time, I got in the habit of doing both of them the second we put our kids down to sleep at 8. And then since I&#8217;m all cleaned up and in my jammies by then, the temptation to grab a quick snack or drink quickly diminished! Because who wants to have to brush their teeth all over again?? Not me!<\/p>\n<p>My wife constantly makes fun of me for this, but my improving health (and physique) should hopefully woo her back eventually ;) And this is a trick you can use whether you want to wake up early or not! Just grab your toothbrush the second you start having cravings, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;\">The downsides of waking up early?<\/h2>\n<p>There are some downsides, of course, depending on your lifestyle:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to go to bed earlier than you&#8217;re used to, because if you don&#8217;t it&#8217;s like walking around with a hangover all day!<\/li>\n<li>You might miss out on late night activities, whether with friends or your wife (hubba hubba)<\/li>\n<li>You might not catch all your favorite late-night sports games<\/li>\n<li>You might find you<em> don&#8217;t<\/em> work as well in the mornings than evenings!<\/li>\n<li>You might find you have to wake up at 4 am instead, if everyone else wakes up at 5 am in your household (ouch)<\/li>\n<li>You might already have a perfect schedule and don&#8217;t need to go around messing with it!<\/li>\n<li>Or you might just find that you are decidedly not a morning person and will never wake up early if your life depended on it :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Different strokes for different folks, but it might just be the lifestyle change you need to improve your life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Try it out for a week and see how it goes! If it sucks, just stop, but if not &#8211; keep going! I surely never expected to still be at it three years later&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Next on the list: tackling Benny&#8217;s 2 hour lunch\/reading scheme! Maybe I&#8217;ll even do it with bifocles on and in a library he helped bring to America too ;)<\/p>\n<p>Happy experimenting!<\/p>\n<p>******<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> &#8220;Despite creating some of the most successful and popular inventions of the modern world, [Benjamin] Franklin never patented a single one, believing that they should be shared freely.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fi.edu\/benjamin-franklin\/inventions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Franklin Institute<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>*<\/strong>I only wake up extra early on *work days*&#8230; I use the weekends to fully refresh so I&#8217;m ready to roll again come Mondays.
