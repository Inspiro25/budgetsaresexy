Getting into anything good this weekend?<\/p>\n<p>This is an extension to Wednesday&#8217;s post on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/08\/awesome-money-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kick-ass money ideas<\/a> that I wanted to separate out just because it&#8217;s so chalk-full of great pointers. Especially if you&#8217;re interested in the real estate game &#8211; though it applies to ALL areas of life and business\/career growth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You gotta surround yourself with people DOING the stuff you want to be doing! And *actually* doing it too, btw, not just talking or blogging about it ;)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This note comes from &#8220;Simple_Chaos&#8221; after reading fellow blogger Jeff Rose&#8217;s story on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/12\/how-i-failed-buying-rental-property\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how he crashed and burned trying to buy his first rental property<\/a> here on the blog 3 years ago.\u00a0 Take it away, Chaos!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*************<\/p>\n<p>Hey Folks,<\/p>\n<p>Reading all the comments. Some great ideas being passed around.<\/p>\n<p>In my personal experience with owning several <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-im-transitioning-away-from-rental-properties\/\">rental properties<\/a>, I&#8217;ve learned some valuable lessons.<\/p>\n<p>Take advice from people who have what you want!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before I started in the RE game I was 25 (I&#8217;m 33 now), and I knew nothing about Real Estate.\u00a0 Reflecting back on my sphere of influence at the time, I didn&#8217;t really know anybody that had rentals or were millionaires.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I focused my time and energy on surrounding myself with positive like minded people that had what I wanted. I learned about Passive income and some basic rules about the real estate game.<\/p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to spend some time with a very humble and modest Financial advisor who turns out owns 170+ doors worth millions. One of the first things he told me was the tip about taking advice from people who had want I wanted&#8230; He also encouraged me to surround myself with a strong team of professionals that matched the first piece of advice.<\/p>\n<p>He connected me with his accountant who <span class=\"il\">only<\/span> takes clients based on referrals. Funny thing&#8230; he&#8217;s a millionaire also who owns rental properties including commercial and multi-Family buildings. The accountant agreed to take me under his wing and basically mentored me for free because I asked. Normally his fees are $200+\/hr (I still pay him for doing my taxes. Though he taught me how to prepare my own taxes now so that I don&#8217;t have to pay him to much).<\/p>\n<p>He then connected me with his RE agent who has <span class=\"il\">become<\/span> a great friend. No surprise &#8211; he owns a bunch of rental properties too and works with an awesome contractor\/handyman that basically does all of our repairs or renos on all of our properties. It&#8217;s mutually beneficial, which is always a focus for me when structuring deals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve set up referrals deals with all these people, so every time I refer them someone that generates them new business they pay me a small referral fee. It&#8217;s a win\/win\/win.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I built two properties through a custom builder that was small at the time and family ran. I built a great relationship with them and the gentleman that does the sales for the company connected me with his daughter, who is a mortgage broker who &#8211; Surprise again!! &#8211; owns a bunch of rentals as well.<\/p>\n<p>I think you get the point :)<\/p>\n<p>I buy or build my properties based on <em>cash flow<\/em>, not growth in equity through appreciated. Although it has turned out very well for me from that standpoint as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The <span class=\"il\">only<\/span> <span class=\"il\">way<\/span> to <span class=\"il\">every<\/span> <span class=\"il\">become<\/span> an <span class=\"il\">expert<\/span> <span class=\"il\">IMO<\/span> is to <em><span class=\"il\">do<\/span> it.<\/em> You can read 1,000 books, articles, attend seminars, etc. Experience will always be the best teacher.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before I start any business or project I always ask myself&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the absolute Worst case scenario, and can I live with that?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The worst case scenario getting into rentals would be if all of my tenants didn&#8217;t pay rent, then vacated the premises after causing major damage, and then me losing my job while we were in the middle of a market recession. That seemed like a pretty awful situation to find myself in. It would basically mean I&#8217;d lose everything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Could I handle that? My answer was YES. Why? Because in the end it&#8217;s <span class=\"il\">only<\/span> money. I still have my health, my relationships with family and friends, and all the experience I&#8217;d gained up to that point.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I had to do it all again, I&#8217;m certain I could in a much shorter period of time while being more efficient. What&#8217;s the difference between giving 1 set of keys back to the bank or 10? Also, the likelihood of that happening is very low. On the other hand from a risk vs. reward standpoint if it pays off in 8 years from now I&#8217;ll have $3M+ in property paid off and $15,000+\/month in positive cash flow.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s without doing anything different from today on.<\/p>\n<p>Onwards and upwards!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*************<\/p>\n<p><strong>Again, all good stuff to think about whether real estate related or not! <\/strong>Surround yourself with people already accomplishing what you dream of, weigh the worst case scenarios for all ideas\/projects, and then more importantly &#8211; *take action*. We won&#8217;t win everything we go after, but we&#8217;ll lose ALL of them if we never try anything out.<\/p>\n<p>Look for someone new you can talk to this weekend who&#8217;s already reached one of your goals and get that ball rolling! It usually only takes an &#8220;ask&#8221; and a coffee (or if you get nervous like I do, a beer :)). I bet you&#8217;re only 1 person removed from your friends and family too &#8211; a great place to start.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy Friday!!
