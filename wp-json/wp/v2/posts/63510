I know many people say it&#8217;s not an asset. It&#8217;s your home, you have to have a roof over your head, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just wondered the reason. I include ours in the equation but didn&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the typical way. :)\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This question pops up a lot, and it sparks a pretty interesting debate. So I thought I\u2019d share my reply and thoughts with y\u2019all. I\u2019ll also talk about why including your home equity in your net worth calculation could either help or harm your retirement expectations, along with some hypothetical examples!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and to answer that first question about my personal situation\u2026 The reason that I don\u2019t include my residence is because <\/span><b>my wife and I don\u2019t own the house we live in.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We are renters&#8230; and happy ones at the moment!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is Your Primary Residence an \u201cAsset\u201d?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, yes. When you\u2019re taking a snapshot of your net worth, your house <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be included in the asset column (and corresponding mortgage in the liability column).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>So why do so many people leave their residence out of their net worth calculation? All assets should be included, right?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, that\u2019s where we reach a fun grey area\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Remember, Income Production Is a Big Part of Net Worth\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-5-man-alive\/\">net worth report<\/a> is just a wealth snapshot from a single point in time. It doesn\u2019t actually explain someone\u2019s true financial trajectory or readiness for financial independence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically for retirement planning, we need to try and look past an individual net worth snapshot, and try to envision a <\/span><b>long-term stream of income<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. After all, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really saving up for \u2026 recurring cash flow we can live off of, not just a big pile of \u201cassets.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most primary residences don\u2019t provide <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">income<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (unless they are sold, refinanced, or rented out). So this is why some people leave out home equity in their <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-8-garden-gate\/\">net worth reports<\/a>, because they are more concerned with tracking and growing <b>income-producing assets only<\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some examples to illustrate the impact of including (or not including) home equity as a part of your net worth calculation\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Net Worth Examples: *Including* Home Equity<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron, Alex, and Jamie all have a personal net worth of $1 million dollars.

All $1 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if we drill down into what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">type of assets <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they each own and start retirement planning, we uncover a totally different story. Each asset serves a different purpose, which affects how these people meet their financial goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s drill down into each individual situation and discuss retirement savings&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Cameron Wants to Retire Early<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron\u2019s FIRE buddy recently said, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWith a $1M net worth, you can withdraw $40,000 each year (based on the 4% rule), and never run out of money again!\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron loves this idea, because their expenses are about $40k per year.

Even if they did a refinance or got a home equity loan, they couldn\u2019t withdraw enough money to provide $40k consistently year over year. Cameron doesn\u2019t want to sell the house or move out, so this $700k \u201casset\u201d isn\u2019t really useful for retirement.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron can\u2019t pull any money out of their 401(k) retirement account either &#8211; until age 55. (Technically it\u2019s possible to withdraw funds early and pay penalty fees\/taxes). So this $300k \u201casset\u201d isn\u2019t very useful right now either, and wouldn\u2019t last very long if they started withdrawing money from it anyway.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, even though Cameron has a net worth of $1M, those underlying assets can\u2019t help them retire.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cameron needs more income-producing assets to make up their retirement savings.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BTW &#8211; this is why people sometimes call their primary residence a \u2018liability\u2019 instead of an \u2018asset\u2019. Cameron\u2019s $700k in equity seems more like a burden than a help at this stage (based on the goal of retiring early). Cameron has a lot more saving\/investing to do before they can use the 4% rule to retire.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex and Jamie are in a slightly different financial situation, which we\u2019ll get into in a sec&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Net Worth Examples: *NOT Including* Home Equity<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\u2019s look what happens if all three of these hypothetical people *didn\u2019t* include their primary home in their net worth statement.

But, <\/span><b>there are definitely benefits to tracking your home equity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, it helps track your mortgage paydown and progress, and overall debt to equity ratio. Over time, your house increases in value, and the mortgage slowly decreases in value. It\u2019s fun to watch your equity grow organically, and it\u2019s motivating to track constant progress!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks, lenders, and potential business partners like to see ALL your assets included in your financial statement. The more assets you include, the better financial health you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appear<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be in, and the more favorable you look to do business with. Tracking everything is a good thing in the banking world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, even though your primary residence might not be income-producing <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right now<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it might become part of your investable net worth later. Recall Jamie\u2019s scenario above&#8230; assets can change in purpose over time, so it\u2019s good to track everything and always consider your options.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Should You Include Your Primary Home in Your Net Worth?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, this is something everyone can really decide for themselves. I think the answer strongly hinges on <b>what you are using your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-lucky-7-and-free-finance-course\/\"  >net worth report<\/a> for.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re tracking your progress to financial independence, and retirement is your sole goal, be careful about including assets that you can\u2019t rely on for retirement income. If you include too much dead equity, you could be artificially inflating your progress to FIRE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m curious to hear what you readers do.
