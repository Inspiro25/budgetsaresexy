Money defines making money from side projects as <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/03\/hustling-for-better-lifestyle\/\">hustles<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One of my hustles that I\u2019ve been doing for the past 5 years in addition to my 9 to 5 job is <a href=\"http:\/\/rentingoutrooms.com\/\">renting out my spare bedroom<\/a>.\u00a0 This really isn\u2019t a skill, it\u2019s more like an asset that is not being utilized to its fullest potential.\u00a0 So why not take full advantage of it and cash it in?<\/p>\n<h2>How Did It All Start?<\/h2>\n<p>It all started about 5 years ago when I wanted to go to graduate school when I didn\u2019t have any wiggle room in my budget for tuition.\u00a0 The most obvious choice was to take out student loads.\u00a0 However, I didn\u2019t want to take out student loans because I already had loans from my undergraduate studies.<\/p>\n<p>I needed a way to make cash on the side without spending too time on it because anyone that has pursued a degree knows that school work consumes a fair fit of time.\u00a0 Although, drug dealing for profit or operating a ponzi scheme would fit the bill as a money making scheme, it is however, highly illegal.\u00a0 After some thought, the next best option was to rent out my spare room.<\/p>\n<h2>The First Few Months<\/h2>\n<p>I started by placing advertisements online looking for a roommate that would rent my spare bedroom.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t take too long before I found a suitable roommate who was around the same age as I was, and held a professional job.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m a seasoned traveler and stayed at numerous hostels (a place to sleep with share common areas) across the globe, so having a person who I didn\u2019t know move in didn\u2019t make me too uncomfortable.<\/p>\n<p>In the first six months, I made $3,600 bucks.\u00a0 Considering the amount of time I put in this endeavor, this was a nice little chunk of change that paid for the first several classes of graduate school, but it was just the stepping stone.<\/p>\n<h2>Pimpin&#8217; My Budget<\/h2>\n<p>The rental income from one roommate didn\u2019t pimp my budget enough to pay for two graduate classes per semester (one class costs $1,600 bucks).\u00a0 I needed to turbo charge my rental income so that I could afford to pay for two classes a semester and graduate in a reasonable amount of time.<\/p>\n<p>At that point, things were working well with my first roommate; I figured I could get another roommate.\u00a0 I renovated the basement by buying material and such on a zero percent credit card.\u00a0 After finishing the basement, I moved in there and found a roommate for the bedroom I was currently living in.\u00a0 Once the second roommate moved in, my budget was officially pimpin\u2019 &#8211; I had enough cash to pay for two graduate classes per semester and then some.<\/p>\n<h2>Actionable Steps<\/h2>\n<p>As J. Money put in <a href=\"..\/2010\/03\/hustling-for-better-lifestyle\/\">his post<\/a>, think about the actionable steps so that if the need ever arises you have a plan to execute.\u00a0 In my case, I did just that.\u00a0 I knew the steps it took to rent out a room \u2013 place advertisement for roommate, select roommate, and collect rental income. (it\u2019s a little more detailed than that, but you get the basic idea).\u00a0 The key part was executing the actionable steps when I needed the extra flow.\u00a0 Of course, there was some refinement to the steps.\u00a0 But once I got the ball rolling, I started slow by renting out only one room then learned the ropes of the business and process.\u00a0 I then expanded my operation by renting out another bedroom.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This hustle has allowed me to pay for graduate school without borrowing a single penny as of 2009.<\/strong> I still continue to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-rent-out-your-stuff-for-extra-cash-this-summer\/\">rent out<\/a> my spare bedroom because I\u2019ve discovered it\u2019s a great way to make some extra cash without too much of a time commitment.\u00a0 Since I graduated with my graduate degree, I no longer have tuition to pay for, now instead, I\u2019m using the rental income to pay off my underwater mortgage debt.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em><strong>Mike <\/strong>blogs over at <a href=\"http:\/\/rentingoutrooms.com\">Renting Out Rooms<\/a>, and tweets <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mchoi9\">@mchoi9<\/a> &#8211; click over and say hello!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>And if you\u2019d like to be featured in our <a href=\"..\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">Side Hustle Series<\/a>, give me a shout and let me know what you\u2019re up to!
