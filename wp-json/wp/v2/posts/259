I&#8217;ve been hoping to resolve this for a few weeks now, but sadly it looks like it&#8217;s finally gotten to me. What makes it worse is that we had finally gotten a hopeful response last week, but then THAT failed as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:130%;\">Is it that hard to ask for something you&#8217;ve paid for a YEAR in advance?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Seriously, we&#8217;re not talking about anything genius here. They&#8217;re pictures. You take them, develop them, and then give them to the exuberant bride or groom. Here&#8217;s the dilly so far: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mid-June<\/strong>: Back from our honeymoon, we ask how long it may take. His response? 6-8 weeks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mid-August<\/strong>: &#8220;It&#8217;s taken a bit longer to develop the black &amp; white images. A cple more weeks go go&#8221; First off, i&#8217;m fairly certain it doesn&#8217;t take that much longer (if at all) to develop B&amp;W over color, and ESPECIALLY not for the 4&#215;5 proofs! I asked my sister who works for a photographer doing weddings herself, and they didn&#8217;t buy it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Early Sep<\/strong>: &#8220;I&#8217;ll call you this week so we can meet up and go over it all&#8221;. Nothing that week. nor the next. nor the next.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:130%;\">*This is the point at which i jump in and start getting irrated.<\/span><\/strong> The guy is an old high school friend of the Mrs., so we cut him some slack thinking all would be dandy. A couple of weeks ago she was done with him, so i got to play bad cop ;) which is perfectly fine as i get it all day long @ work anyways being a customer service manager.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sep 11th<\/strong> &#8211; I call and leave a calm but important message on his cell phone. no response.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sep 13th<\/strong> &#8211; Text him &#8220;What&#8217;s the deal, bro?&#8221; hoping to get anything at all back. nothing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sep 16th<\/strong> &#8211; The Mrs. calls him and leaves a message. nothing again.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sep 18th<\/strong> &#8211; The Mrs. emails him:<br \/>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;D-head <em>(edited),<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s going on? You haven&#8217;t returned our phone calls\/voicemails to you and I haven&#8217;t heard from you since Sept.1 when you indicated you&#8217;d be calling me that week.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;d really just like to see our proofs. I&#8217;ve been asking for them for months now and have received numerous indications from you that they would be forthcoming, but we have still not received them.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing we&#8217;ve seen at all so far has been a few pictures on Facebook. Though we enjoyed seeing those, we waited until 3 months after our wedding to catch a glimpse of 13 pictures, whereas the other wedding you posted had taken place one day prior and they had 3 times as many pictures up. Clearly, we are not a priority for you right now but this is becoming increasingly frustrating&#8211;and disappointing. Our wedding pictures are important to us and we&#8217;d really like to see how they turned out.<\/p>\n<p>I would really appreciate the courtesy of receiving some communication from you as to what&#8217;s going on regarding our proofs, and when we can expect to receive them. We&#8217;re approaching 4 months from our wedding date at this point.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Budgetsaresexy <em>(edited)&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sep 25th<\/strong> &#8211; Success! An email into Facebook AND gmail. AWESOME! And as much as i&#8217;d LOVE to post his sad story of a response, there&#8217;s too many details that would give up who it is :( I did think about it though ;) He did, however, say he&#8217;ll be in town for a few days (he said he moved), and will stop by early Sunday morning to review it together.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sep 28th, Sunday<\/strong> &#8211; No show. We call him at 1pm and he calls back, clearly aggitated, stating he&#8217;ll drop it off during the day, even if we&#8217;re not at home. And surprise, surprise, he didn&#8217;t.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sep 28th, evening<\/strong> &#8211; The mrs. leaves a voicemail asking for an update. nothing. i text him a &#8220;still stopping by?&#8221; text as well, but nothing again.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sep 29th, evening <\/strong>&#8211; I repeatedly try calling him from 7pm-10pm but phone appears turned off &#8211; i didn&#8217;t leave a message&#8230;and that&#8217;s where we are today.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 0, 0);\">UPDATE:<\/span> Sep 30th, morning<\/strong> &#8211; The Mrs. emails him again,<br \/>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;D-head <em>(edited),<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your phone has either been not working or turned off for the last 2 days, and again, we&#8217;ve left a number a messages.

Can we please get a status update on the proofs???&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 0, 0);\">UPDATE:<\/span><\/strong> <strong>Sep 30th, evening<\/strong> &#8211; I call him every hour, on the hour, for 4 hours straight. just rings and rings and then hits vmail (better than just going straigth there i suppose). I leave one message stating that i basically just want him to drop them off before leaving town, and that i can care less about the reasoning behind it. I also say a call\/email\/text\/facebook\/myspace message or whatever is fine. Just make contact.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 0, 0);\">UPDATE:<\/span> Oct 1st, morning<\/strong> &#8211; Nothing yet&#8230;will wait until tomorrow, and then it&#8217;s on.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 0, 0);\">UPDATE:<\/span> Oct 1st, afternoon<\/strong> &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/10\/wedding-pictures-update-proofs-are-now.html\">He emailed us back!  but it&#8217;s not good&#8230;<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So, now not only has he pissed us off for months on end, but he has crushed our remaining hope of getting this resolved asap.<\/strong> And keep in mind, after getting these proofs, we STILL have to order the freakin&#8217; pictures from him!! arghhhhhhhh&#8230;what a dick. (sorry, but it&#8217;s called for here.)<\/p>\n<p>I think the worst of it all, though, is that i&#8217;m starting to wonder if something&#8217;s just wrong with the pics? Like, perhaps they came out horribly? Or maybe his team accidently erased them or something? I&#8217;m sure they were all digital, so who knows what&#8217;s possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:130%;\">Whew, that felt good! Thanks for listening, and\/or skimming ;)<\/span><\/strong> All in all it&#8217;s not the worst thing going on these days (bailout anyone?), but it certainly is at the top of my $hit list. And if we never get them? Well, at least we&#8217;ve got plenty of other pics from our friends and family that portray the beautiful day! We&#8217;re certainly not going to let it &#8220;ruin&#8221; the wedding.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll keep ya posted&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can you believe that?
