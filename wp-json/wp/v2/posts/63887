I just found out my rental property in Texas needs a new roof!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a nasty hail storm last month that ripped through the area and smashed a bunch of cars and houses \u2014 unfortunately, my rental property was one of them. &#x1f926;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that nobody was hurt, and insurance will cover the replacement roof cost (~$10k). The bad news is I still have to pay the insurance deductible (~$2k) and figure out the claims process and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly, dealing with insurance isn\u2019t as bad as I thought it was going to be. Since it\u2019s my first time filing a claim like this, I thought I\u2019d share some notes, numbers, and things I\u2019m learning along the way. This might give any new and aspiring property investors out there some insight into what it\u2019s like being a landlord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before we get to the boring stuff, here are some fun facts I just learned while googling hail storms. Did you know\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 4,611 hail storm events last year (2020) in the US. &#x1f328;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">601 of them were in Texas! By far the most of any other U.S. state.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ALL these events had hailstone balls larger than 1 inch in diameter!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 24 people each year are injured and go to hospital for hail hitting them &#x1f915; Ouch!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And sadly, 4 people have actually been killed by hail in the last 20 years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world record for the largest hailstorm was in 2010 near Vivian, South Dakota, where 8-inch diameter (~20 cm) hailstones fell from the sky! Daaaaang!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63923 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Hail-storm-pic-scaled-e1620947926558.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the hail that hit my rental. The biggest stones were about the size of golf balls!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>When Disaster Strikes Your Rental Roof, What Happens Next?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My property manager emailed me and said there had been a huge storm in town the night prior. Whenever this happens, she gets a million phone calls from every roofing company in town asking if they can go out and assess all of the roofs of the properties she manages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because roof assessments are free (or at least that\u2019s how it was offered to me), I was glad to have someone go out to see if there was any damage at my duplex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s pretty cool actually &#8230; roofing companies these days use drones that fly over the house with cameras to look for damage. They can zoom in, take photos, and sometimes even provide a repair quote the same day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my place, they determined that a whole roof replacement was necessary. There were no massive holes or water leaks into the house (thankfully), but the shingles were bashed so hard by the hail they need to be replaced.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Insurance Claims Work for Your Rental Property<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m no expert in this area. (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And actually this is a great side note for new real estate investors &#8212; It\u2019s OK if you have no clue what you\u2019re doing\u2026 <\/span><\/i><b><i>Owning rental properties is mostly about figuring stuff out as you go along<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As long as you ask good questions and are willing to learn, every problem you come across is figure-out-able.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clueless, I called the 1-800 number for my insurance company (Travelers), and asked about the claims process. Here\u2019s a simplified overview:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They ask basic info about the disaster.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24 hours later, a claims person gets assigned.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The claims person schedules a visit to the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They write up a report and tell you how much $$ they think the damage will cost.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They send you a check for that amount (minus deductible and stuff I\u2019ll explain in a bit).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You use that money to fix whatever happened.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the repair cost ends up being higher, you call back and ask for more money. If not, you\u2019re all good.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty simple, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Much Insurance Will Pay for My Roof Replacement<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My claims dude also used a drone to assess the roof. He emailed me this assessment and summary afterward, and also called me to walk through and explain it:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63924 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/New-Roof-Quote-Joel-e1620947935617.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"316\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The depreciation line item can be a little confusing. But really all you need to know is that it is \u201crecoverable.\u201d Meaning it still gets paid to you, but only after you go ahead and complete all the repairs. The adjuster posted me a check for $3,810, and I\u2019ll get an additional $3,673 after the roof is fixed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, my total out-of-pocket cost should be $2,310 (which is exactly my policy deductible). Kind of a bummer that I\u2019m out 2 grand, but it only puts a small dent in my $15k+ <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-big-should-an-emergency-fund-for-a-rental-property-be\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rental property emergency fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What to Ask Your Insurance Company If You\u2019re Thinking About Filing a Claim on Your Rental Property<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since this is my first property insurance claim, I took the opportunity to interrogate my claims guy and ask him as many questions as possible. Here are the main things I asked, as well as his responses:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How bad is the roof damage? Do I need to replace it <\/b><b>right now<\/b><b>?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 (I asked this to understand if there was a time limit in which I needed to make the repair). He said there are no holes or leaks into the units, and advised me to hold off on making the repair until *after hail season is ove.r* Great advice! He said there is actually no time limit on my policy to make a repair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>If I file a claim, will my insurance premium go up next year?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Unlike car insurance, property insurance typically doesn\u2019t go up for your individual policy after a single claim. Property insurance rates are more tied to the general area and fluctuate based on how many claims are filed in the whole region. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(This is nice to hear, but honestly Texas and my small town have been getting hammered the past 12 months with disasters. My insurance premiums will go up regardless, so I don\u2019t really know why I even asked this!)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>What if the new roof costs like $20k, instead of $10k?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If my new roofing quotes come in any higher than the estimate I was given, I can submit them to Travelers, and they\u2019ll adjust my claim. The max I will pay out of pocket should be my deductible &#8212; $2,310.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What if the new roof cost is *lower* than the estimate?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If I can repair the roof for less than the $10k, Travelers will actually lower my second reimbursement. It doesn\u2019t matter how low or high the repair cost is &#8212; I will be out of pocket $2,310.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Can I choose the roofing company?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yep, I get to handle the repair and choose the company to work with. (Well, actually my property manager will do this).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Is the new roof cost tax-deductible? And do I pay income tax on the insurance reimbursement?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> THIS is such an interesting grey area\u2026 I asked the claims person, who quickly said I should consult a tax professional. But, from my initial research online it looks like a) I do *not* pay income taxes on the $7k reimbursement checks, and b) I *can* claim my new roof repair as a deduction for property expense. Seems shady &#8212; I\u2019ve got a call with my tax guy this weekend anyway and I\u2019ll bring it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whelp, that\u2019s it for now! Happy to answer any questions if you have any, or if any of you experienced real estate peeps have advice for me on how to handle this insurance crap better &#8211; I\u2019m all ears!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>TLDR Summary:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hail storm smashed my rental property roof!
