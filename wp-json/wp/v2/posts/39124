There&#8217;s tons of stuff in this life that I&#8217;m good at (saving, hustling, getting the money TO invest somewhere), but the one area I&#8217;ve failed over and over again in is coming up with a robust investing strategy. Though I was never shy at getting creative.<\/p>\n<p>Here were the last two strategies I used in maxing out my RothIRA:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/05\/just-call-me-warren-buffett-2nd-in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Copy what Warren Buffett is doing<\/a>&#8221; Strategy<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/what-if-we-only-invested-in-companies-we-loved\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Invest in the companies you love (and use)<\/a>&#8221; Strategy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s literally been years (2? 3?) since I last paid real attention to all my investments<\/strong> (other than pouring in the money), so I finally pulled the trigger and made the switch from USAA to Vanguard, effectively ending my &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/i-now-have-16-accounts-at-one-place-is-that-bad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all accounts under one roof&#8221;<\/a> mantra I had lived all these years.

I&#8217;m not out to become a billionaire over night (though that would be nice!) but I do want to make a fair amount over time and I&#8217;m totally fine being patient and waiting for it.

UPDATE: It also has a dividend of 1.84% &#8211; forgot to mention that earlier (hat tip to &#8220;Whiskey&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about the fund according to Vanguard:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Created in 1992, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is designed to provide investors with exposure to the entire U.S. equity market, including small-, mid-, and large-cap growth and value stocks. The fund\u2019s key attributes are its low costs, broad diversification, and the potential for tax efficiency. Investors looking for a low-cost way to gain broad exposure to the U.S. stock market who are willing to accept the volatility that comes with stock market investing may wish to consider this fund as either a core equity holding or your only domestic stock fund.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>(Vanguard has an &#8220;Investor shares&#8221; version of the fund too, fyi, for those who can&#8217;t invest $10,000 or more into the fund (<a href=\"https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/funds\/snapshot?FundId=0085&amp;FundIntExt=INT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VTSMX<\/a>). The expense ratio is a tad bit higher @ 0.17% (still drastically better than 87% of the competition) but the stocks you hold here are exactly the same)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now it may look dumb\/scary to &#8220;have all your eggs in one basket&#8221; here &#8211; which was my first concern &#8211; but the reality is it isn&#8217;t just one stock.<\/strong> It&#8217;s one stock<em> ticker<\/em>, but over 3,600 stocks (ie companies). When you invest in index funds you invest in itty bitty fractions of hundreds\/thousands of companies. If any one of them die out at any time, it doesn&#8217;t kill your money.<\/p>\n<p>See! Answering &#8220;one to &#8220;should I buy one stock or multiple&#8221; isn&#8217;t really as scary as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>But on the flip side, it doesn&#8217;t grow your money as fast either like, say, if one of them takes off like Apple. It&#8217;s an average person&#8217;s game, with better than average results over time (and by &#8220;average&#8221; I mean compared to most of those day traders and probably your friends).<\/p>\n<p>There are, however, downsides to this VTSAX strategy, specifically you&#8217;re not invested in bonds or international markets at all. But at this stage and age of my life I&#8217;m okay taking on more risk (ie no bonds), and most, if not all, stocks in VTSAX <em><strong>does business around the world<\/strong><\/em> anyways. So from my understanding you still do have <em>exposure<\/em> to the foreign markets, just not directly like, say, by investing in funds that hold actual foreign companies.<\/p>\n<p>This is one area I&#8217;d like to learn a lot more about, though, so if any of you care to chime in with thoughts I&#8217;d love to hear them! I&#8217;m definitely learning as we go here.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">VTSAX vs. VASGX<\/h2>\n<p>The other fund I was considering, if you&#8217;re interested, was <a href=\"https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/funds\/snapshot?FundId=0122&amp;FundIntExt=INT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VASGX <\/a>(Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund). This is the fund <em>Mike Piper<\/em> from Oblivious Investor has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.obliviousinvestor.com\/are-we-still-using-the-lifestrategy-growth-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">every one of<em> his<\/em> retirement pennies in<\/a> (see, I&#8217;m not the only crazy one!), and which is still aggressive&#8217;ish, but less so than VTSAX. I debated hard going this route instead -which would still be just ONE fund, only diversified more, but ultimately chose the more aggressive route &#8211; at least for now.<\/p>\n<p>(And btw &#8220;aggressive&#8221; in index funds is much different than &#8220;aggresive&#8221; in stock picking :) With one you&#8217;re invested in hundreds or thousands of companies and the other you&#8217;re invested in a single company. So &#8220;risk&#8221; here is different)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the quick bio on this fund:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The LifeStrategy Funds are a series of broadly diversified, low-cost funds with an all-index, fixed allocation approach that may provide a complete portfolio in a single fund. The four funds, each with a different allocation, target various risk-based objectives. The Growth Fund seeks to provide capital appreciation and some current income. The fund holds 80% of its assets in stocks, a portion of which is allocated to international stocks, and 20% in bonds, a portion of which is allocated to international bonds. In addition to stock market risk, the fund is also subject to currency risk and country risks. Investors with a long-term time horizon who are looking for growth of principal over time and who can accept stock market volatility may wish to consider this fund.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And here is what VASGX holds:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>56.1% &#8212; (<a href=\"https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/funds\/snapshot?FundId=0085&amp;FundIntExt=INT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VTSMX<\/a>) Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares<\/li>\n<li>24.0% &#8212; (<a href=\"https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/funds\/snapshot?FundId=0113&amp;FundIntExt=INT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VGTSX<\/a>) Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares<\/li>\n<li>16.0% &#8212; (<a href=\"https:\/\/advisors.vanguard.com\/VGApp\/iip\/site\/advisor\/investments\/productoverview?fundId=0635\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VTBIX<\/a>) Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Investor Shares<\/li>\n<li>3.9% &#8212; (<a href=\"https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/funds\/snapshot?FundId=1231&amp;FundIntExt=INT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VTIBX<\/a>) Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So as you can see, almost half of the fund covers international exposure along with bonds, and only 56% of the fund I&#8217;m currently invested in<\/strong> (again, I&#8217;m in the <a href=\"https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/funds\/snapshot?FundId=0585&amp;FundIntExt=INT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Admiral Shares&#8221; version<\/a> of VTSMX since I have more than $10,000 invested taking advantage of the lower fees). And this VTSMX has a low expense ratio too of only 0.17%.<\/p>\n<p>When I asked my good blogging friend <a href=\"http:\/\/jlcollinsnh.com\/ask-jlcollinsnh\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jim Collins<\/a> what he thought between the two, whom I trust heavily since he&#8217;s been retired for over 20 years and <em>only<\/em> invests in index funds &amp; Vanguard himself (he&#8217;s in a few vs one due to his age and phase in life), he told me this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>VTSAX is the total US stock market index: 100% US stocks. Holding VTSAX is very aggressive. Recommending it as a sole holding, as I do, is very much an outlier concept. In fact I am aware of no other financial writer who does. So Mr. Piper definitely has the majority opinion on his side.<\/p>\n<p>Holding VASGX is also very aggressive at 80\/20, but less so than VTSAX&#8230; also with it being a fund of funds, the ER is a bit higher. You are paying for that multiple fund diversification.<\/p>\n<p>It is certainly not a dumb choice. As you know, personally my preference is VTSAX. But I am Very aggressive in my investing and have proven my ability to stay the course during crashes. That&#8217;s absolutely critical, with either of these actually.<\/p>\n<p>Looking 20+ years out, VTSAX will very likely make you richer, unless we go the way of Japan. But the race will be close and your savings rate will be the more powerful element in the mix than your fund choice.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I then asked what he would do if he were me and he responded with:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Yep, if it were my money I&#8217;d do VTSAX. In fact I do, 75% and the other 25% in bonds. Then I just rebalance occasionally to keep the percents where I want them, Easy peasey and cheaper ERs than with a TRF.<\/p>\n<p>If I were still working and adding new money it would be 100% VTSAX. The new money has the same kind of smoothing effect as the bonds do for me now.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It was at that point I pulled the trigger :) I don&#8217;t have a problem with risk(ier) &#8211; I&#8217;m young and have plenty of time to ride the waves!
