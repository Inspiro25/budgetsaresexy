He had tried a number of other tricks unsuccessfully over the years, but it was something about seeing that big honkin&#8217; thing everywhere he went that got him to accomplish his daily mission.<\/p>\n<p>So of course I had to go out and pick one up for myself :)<\/p>\n<p><em>[<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Update:<\/strong> <\/span>Been going strong w\/ bottle trigger for almost a year now! Here&#8217;s my update with it, as well as a handful of other great triggers I&#8217;ve since come across: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/04\/financial-triggers-grow-your-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20+ Triggers to Hack Your Life &amp; Money<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>As I alluded to last week, I too have failed numerous times to stay adequately hydrated over the years.<\/strong> And if all it took was a cheap $5.00 container to do the trick (I found it at my grocery store, but if you&#8217;re lazy you can get one for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B005SRXYGW\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005SRXYGW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkId=QUQJJZLTHNWP6JTZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$8.00&#8217;ish<\/a> @ Amazon ;)) I was all about it! And after almost 8 days in a row of downing every last drop of that beautiful liquid (I slip a little on the weekend, but again I don&#8217;t care cuz <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/do-the-best-you-can-dummy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I&#8217;m doing the best I can, dummies<\/a>!), I can confidently say this trick works. Every time I see it I&#8217;m reminded to pick it up and drink from it &#8211; it&#8217;s as easy as that.<\/p>\n<p>A few days after the bbq I had my yearly check-in with the brilliant <a href=\"http:\/\/jamesclear.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">James Clear<\/a> &#8211; former blogger over at PassivePanda.com &#8211; and being a health that he is, I had to gush to him about my new found glory :) He loved hearing about it, and quickly chimed in with:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You know what that&#8217;s called, right? It&#8217;s a &#8220;trigger.&#8221; Every time your eyes lock in on that bottle it reminds you what you have to do and you don&#8217;t even have to think about it. We should all have such triggers for our goals!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>He then went on to share the famous &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/jamesclear.com\/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seinfeld Strategy<\/a>&#8221; with me,<\/strong> in which a budding comedian, Brad Isaac, approached Jerry Seinfeld backstage one night and asked if he had any tips for a young comic. According to Isaac,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;He said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to write every day.<\/p>\n<p>He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter a few days you\u2019ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You\u2019ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job is to not break the chain.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>BOOM! Another visual trigger to keep you going &#8211; I knew that guy was more than just laughs ;) The <a href=\"http:\/\/jamesclear.com\/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whole article<\/a> of Clear&#8217;s is actually pretty good, you should check it out when you get a chance. Great tips on how to stop procrastinating&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Triggers, of course, apply to our personal finances too<\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll hear time and time again that successful people always attach something tangible to a goal in order to help them stay on track. For some it may come in the form of a picture of a dream house or vacation they&#8217;re saving up for on their walls, while others could be credit cards on the dart board or a picture of their family to remind them of what&#8217;s most important. It doesn&#8217;t matter <em>what<\/em> the trigger or goal is, just that you have it set up and snuck into your normal daily lives so they work!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So step #1 is to figure out the item that motivates you to take the action, and step #2 is to place it in a prime location.<\/strong> Say, like around your desk at work or home, or in the kitchen or family room &#8211; wherever you spend a lot of time. I remember reading a different story of a guy who <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theminimalists.com\/triggers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">installed a pull-up bar at the bottom of his stairs<\/a> to get himself to work out more. Every time he went downstairs to get to the kitchen, take a shower, go outdoors, whatev, he&#8217;d do a push-up or two on his way and habitually snuck in over 60 a day! Simply by adding a trigger in his natural environment.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some others too, specifically relating to money :)<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">This one says, &#8220;SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!&#8221;<br \/>\n(Also, &#8220;MY PIGGY BANK CAN BEAT UP YOUR PIGGY BANK!&#8221; :))<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39370\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rock-star-piggy-bank2.jpg\" alt=\"rock star piggy bank\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rock-star-piggy-bank2.jpg 400w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rock-star-piggy-bank2-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rock-star-piggy-bank2-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>This is a financial trigger in its purest form.<\/strong> Every time you walk by it you can&#8217;t help but check your pockets for change to fill it up! But it can also be a much bigger, broader, trigger as well &#8211; reminding you to keep saving for those bigger dreams of yours and never give up. You could even place one in random places to have some fun with it like on your car&#8217;s dash, in your underwear drawer, or even the shower ;) All places I hope you at least wee once or twice a day! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&#8217;s another&#8230; This one screams, &#8220;PAY OFF YOUR DEBT!!&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.getrichslowly.org\/blog\/2010\/08\/29\/reader-story-patience-and-persistence-pay-off\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39369\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/paper-debt-chain1.jpg\" alt=\"paper debt chain\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/paper-debt-chain1.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/paper-debt-chain1-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Actually, this one is an INCREDIBLE trigger to put in place,<\/strong> no matter how much you owe and to whom you owe it. Could be used for credit cards, car loans, student loans, or even mortgages (better be some sturdy links, haha&#8230;). The idea (and picture) comes from Alissa who was once in $30,000+ of debt and shared her story on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getrichslowly.org\/blog\/2010\/08\/29\/reader-story-patience-and-persistence-pay-off\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Rich Slowly<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;To get the ball rolling, I decided that I needed a visual reminder of my debt, something I could look at every day. So I made myself a literal paper chain of debt. I made each link worth $100 and each color group a thousand. Each time I dipped below an amount on a link, I could reward myself by cutting it off. I was so psyched each month when I could cut off more than one link!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty motivating stuff.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">And these: &#8220;I&#8217;m Financially AWESOME!!&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.escapingdodge.com\/visual-cues-matter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39388\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-affirmations.jpg\" alt=\"financial affirmations\" width=\"600\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-affirmations.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-affirmations-300x113.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>These come from the beautiful, and talented Ree Klein from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.escapingdodge.com\/visual-cues-matter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EscapingDodge.com<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I keep visual cues (reminders) around me to keep me focused on my goal: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at\/\">financial freedom<\/a>.
