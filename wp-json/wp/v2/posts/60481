Two and a half years later (mid 2013), when I was just starting to feel that I was back on my feet, I was diagnosed with an aggressive B cell lymphoma. Again, I almost lost my house while battling cancer and unable to work with the physical consequences of chemo. Three years later (2016), in remission, and in a job I was loving, I was diagnosed with a cardiac issue as a consequence of the chemo that meant I was not longer able to drive. While that crimped my lifestyle, I was no longer able to manage my house and downsized in a buyers market, just able to clear the mortgage and put down 20% on a new place.<\/p>\n<p>Please seriously consider the longer term mortgage, and if you have the capacity, pay it off faster. It is a safety net that you don&#8217;t you will need until you do.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi J Money,<\/p>\n<p>If you go for 15 years, you would be in the mindset of paying it off as early as possible. Meaning that it would be priority no# 1. Owning your own house would be such a relief, knowing that no matter what happens to your investments (or your job), you always have a roof over your head. If you have it set at 30 years, the loan may suddenly drop to priority no#2 or no#3.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewahman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Working At Home Man<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Everyone has a strong opinion on this and mine surely doesn\u2019t matter as much as yours or your wife\u2019s, but we had the same discussions and ended up with a solid compromise.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted 15, wife wanted 30 for \u201cjust in case.\u201d We ended up with what I consider a win for both sides.

Then I took the first principle payment and doubled it the first year but then the second year tripled it because an extra $300 in savings wasn\u2019t going to do much since everything else was maxed out.<\/p>\n<p>So instead of the basic $1,000 payment for 30 years, it was $1,333 the first year and $1,667 onward. We had it on auto-pay so I couldn\u2019t decide month to month to cheat.
