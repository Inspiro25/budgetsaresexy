I&#8217;m sure they were all just jealous (at least that&#8217;s what our mothers always says, right?) but either way I say who cares.<\/p>\n<p>Who cares if our frugality and craftiness distracts people? Are they the ones saving a few dollars? Anope &#8211; we are.  And because of that I say keep on doing your thang!  As long as you&#8217;re happy and not breaking any rules (*ahem* <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Secrets-Stingy-Scoundrel-Little-Money-Grubbing\/dp\/1602397546\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1253896621&amp;sr=8-1-catcorr\">Phil Villarreal<\/a>) who cares about these boring people and their spend-crazy lives. We like saving money and we&#8217;re not afraid to admit it!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, I&#8217;ll even admit to some thriftiness right now: <b>I used to sneak cheeseburgers into my pockets all the time at the movie theaters :)<\/b> I&#8217;d swing by McDonald&#8217;s 10 mins. before start time and pick up some double cheeseburgers right off the $1 menu! Not only was it cheap, but it was craaaazy filling.  And when that didn&#8217;t work out, I&#8217;d just raid the nearest 7-Eleven instead and grab myself 3 assorted candies back when they were 3\/$1 (remember those days?).  No way in hell was I spending $50+ on theater food.<\/p>\n<p>And after thinking about this for a bit, I wondered how many others got made fun of for similar things? There&#8217;s gotta be a lot of us, right? Oh yeah, DEFINITELY right.
