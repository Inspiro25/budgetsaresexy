Nickel!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><strong>I&#8217;m baaaaaaaaaack!<\/strong> And I come bearing babies :) Even though they like to keep mommy and daddy up all hours of the night, those little boogers&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s our new little one pictured above &#8211; already two weeks old now, crazy! You&#8217;ll find more down below too, for those who only care about pics today, haha&#8230; (you know who you are &#8211; MOM!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s been a whirlwind of a couple weeks now<\/strong> (fun fact: Nickel was supposed to be born on Mother&#8217;s day!), but due to some complications we had to get him outta there weeks early. Turns out momma had <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/cholestasis-of-pregnancy\/basics\/definition\/con-20032985\" target=\"_blank\">Cholestasis<\/a>, where your liver bile doesn&#8217;t go where it&#8217;s supposed to go, and instead makes you annoyingly itchy all over while seriously endangering the baby. It got so bad that we had to go into the docs first thing in the morning, and for once it turned out Dr. Google was correct &#8211; she indeed had this problem! So now I&#8217;m never allowed to make fun of her for thinking she&#8217;s dying with X, Y, and Z diseases cuz of what Google says ;) She saved our baby!!<\/p>\n<p>From that moment forward (Monday), we rushed around getting all our stuff together for an induction the next morning (our first babe was <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/07\/cute-baby-j-money\/\">8 days LATE<\/a> so we didn&#8217;t see this one coming!) and 24 hours later (Tuesday) he was born a happy &#8211; and healthy! &#8211; baby boy :) 7 lbs 3 oz, and as chill as can be.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38765\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-nickel-mouth.jpg\" alt=\"j nickel\" width=\"450\" height=\"443\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>And the funny part is I almost missed it!<\/strong> I had gone home to help put Baby #1 down (now referred to as J. Penny), and my phone starts ringing off the hook as my wife frantically tries to get me to turn around and rush back. The doctor had come in to do a check up, thinking the baby was still a few hours away, and when she looked under she saw a head popping out :)<\/p>\n<p>So I rushed back &#8211; driving as cautiously as I possibly could in such a situation, even though I wanted to run every red light! &#8211; and as soon as I walked in my wife started pushing and out he came literally 2 minute later. What a miracle. Just in time for me to cut the chord and hold his wrinkly purple body too for the first time ever :) (Fun fact #2: unlike in the movies, babies never look like babies when they first come out. They&#8217;re more like purple little wrinkle monsters who scream at the top of their lungs, haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And just like that our Money clan grew by 33% &#8211; now a family of four.<\/strong> Man that sounds weird to say&#8230; what am I, 40? (No offense to the 40 y\/o&#8217;s out there). I totally need one of those stickers to go on the back of our car w\/ all those stick figurines, haha&#8230; Or in this case would they be coins? ;)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the updated glossary of our family:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>J.

Though I know I&#8217;m gonna confuse myself calling the new little guy Nickel when it&#8217;s such a larger denomination! ;))<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Some things I&#8217;ve learned so far&#8230;<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It IS possible to love another person so much!!!! I was kinda scared about that one.<\/li>\n<li>J. Penny just ADORES J. Nickel. It&#8217;s &#8220;baby this&#8221; and &#8220;baby that&#8221; all day long :) &#8216;Cuz now he actually talks!!! Which avoids <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/baby-costs-update-15-months-20000-later\/\">another scare of ours<\/a> in baby land&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s much easier dealing with just ONE baby.<\/li>\n<li>Though with two, at least you have one baby per person which is still do-able (the wife swears we&#8217;re done, but I&#8217;m going to push her for one more try for a little girl once the hormones wear off ;))<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;ll have less time than I did before to work &#8211; mainly because of the above (now that I&#8217;m &#8220;in charge&#8221; of the eldest, it&#8217;s my job to take him back and forth to daycare, as well anything else related to his upbringing &#8211; shaving off a solid work hour I used to have)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m pretty pumped to watch them both grow up and have fun with each other :) I know I already told you this before, but the VERY first thing I thought once I found out we were pregnant again was &#8220;Awesome! <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/getting-better-at-making-babies\/\" target=\"_blank\">Our boy&#8217;s gonna have a best friend forever!!<\/a>&#8221; I have a brother myself close in age, so I was overly thrilled to give him a playmate to hang with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38766\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-penny-j-nickel.jpg\" alt=\"j penny and j nickel\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-penny-j-nickel.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-penny-j-nickel-300x203.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">{Look how drastic their sizes are! It looks like Penny&#8217;s gonna eat him!}<\/p>\n<h2>Some Money Stuff&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>So, money. Well, the good news is most of the hospital stuff should be taken care of with my wife&#8217;s insurance she gets through school (she&#8217;s in a PHD program). The bad news, however, is that I just added little Nickel to my own health insurance &#8211; where little Penny is too &#8211; and now it&#8217;s jacked up $130 extra a mo, ugh&#8230; Not that I expected anything different, really, but still &#8211; we just got used to a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/07\/moving-saved-us-money-insurance-cable-daycare\/\" target=\"_blank\">lowered $270 premium<\/a> and now we&#8217;re back in the $400 range again. Though thankfully down from <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/health-insurance-premiums-increased-baby-adjustments\/\" target=\"_blank\">$643<\/a> when we had our old plan (that&#8217;s a car\/house\/tank payment!).<\/p>\n<p>(I have Anthem BlueCross BlueShield btw, which I found through <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ehealth\" target=\"_blank\">eHealthInsurance.com<\/a> and quickly signed up. They&#8217;re bad ass, if you&#8217;re on your own and looking for a good place to start (they&#8217;re like an aggregator which filters plans based on your needs).<\/p>\n<p>In other money news, I&#8217;ll now of course have to open up a new savings account for the little guy (yay! the fun part!), and then start looking into 529 plans again as well. Depending on our financial situation here over the next handful of months (we may have to wait until the wife goes back to work next year). Oh, and I&#8217;ll also be <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">updating our net worth<\/a> here this week too &#8211; so look for a post out on that for those who enjoy &#8217;em&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ll tell you this much &#8211; I&#8217;m damn glad I don&#8217;t have to keep updating that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/03\/how-much-babies-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\">baby money tracker<\/a> anymore!! I have barely enough time to THINK these days!

Only this time I&#8217;ve focused more on cool LEARNING videos\/interviews\/shows instead of reality TV :) Oddly enough I don&#8217;t miss Pawn Stars or Storage Wars one bit?<\/p>\n<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some of my favorite clips with you in case you&#8217;re looking for some inspiration yourself (or in case you, too, have a baby and want to use your time more productively at night!):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vrl5PFB35Ec&amp;sns=em\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cuban: How I Became a Billionaire<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Jobs&#8217; 2005 Stanford Commencement Address<\/a> (I had never seen this before &#8211; SO GOOD!)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MGsalg2f9js\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Zuckerberg at Y Combinator&#8217;s Startup School 2013 <\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8yh1u5AsFU4\" target=\"_blank\">The Path To Meaningful Work: Chris Bailey at TEDxGatineau <\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/wMGd4dpFyx0\" target=\"_blank\">Motivational Mark Cuban Interview at The Howard Stern Show<\/a> (He&#8217;s so freakin&#8217; down to Earth)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/sivers.org\/ml\" target=\"_blank\">The Meaning of Life by Derek Sivers<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Pics snapped at the hospital<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m still debating on whether this was a smart move or not, but something the hospitals like to do is send in a professional photographer the day after your baby&#8217;s born to snap pics when you&#8217;re all emotional in hopes of plucking a few bucks from your wallet ;) And by &#8220;a few bucks&#8221; I mean &#8220;a shit ton of bucks.&#8221; Those 2 pics below cost us a staggering $50. For TWO. And don&#8217;t even ask what the top-tier packages went for, aye ye ye.<\/p>\n<p>But again, pictures of your newborn right there on the spot when you&#8217;re all lovey dovey? It&#8217;s a hard one to turn down. And to this day we regret saying no to the first round w\/ lil&#8217; Penny, thinking we&#8217;d go and shoot them ourselves which of course we never ended up doing. So we splurged and just did it, and so far we&#8217;re pretty happy about it :) While still feeling bad we don&#8217;t have cool shots of #1, haha&#8230; oh well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s baby Nickel on Day #2::<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38768\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-nickel-cuddle-bug.jpg\" alt=\"j nickel cuddle bug\" width=\"551\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-nickel-cuddle-bug.jpg 551w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-nickel-cuddle-bug-300x177.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38767\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-nickel-palm.jpg\" alt=\"j nickel palm\" width=\"550\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-nickel-palm.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-nickel-palm-300x211.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pretty cool shots for being taken on a hospital bed, eh?

Pretty incredible, considering we thought we might not even be able to have any (took us two years to conceive the first, and then literally <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/getting-better-at-making-babies\/\" target=\"_blank\">ONE DAY<\/a> to conceive the next!
