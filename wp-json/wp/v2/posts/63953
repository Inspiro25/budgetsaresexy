(A.k.a. sustainable investing, ESG investing, or impact investing?) I got this question from a reader recently\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI want to start investing in more sustainable, equitable and ethical ways.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have it invested in TD&#8217;s E-series funds and bonds right now (60% stocks\/index funds; 40% bonds), but I don&#8217;t know where or how to find index funds that would meet sustainability or ethical standards I am interested in as well as having a similar level of risk I am already taking on.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I suppose this is one of the ways I am trying to make an individual change to our world, by no longer investing in the businesses that are causing local or global harm (environmentally, socially, etc.)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Fushia\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, I must say I really admire people like Fushia who think along these lines. The way we <\/span><b>spend money<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (our budget) should align with our values&#8230; The way we <\/span><b>earn money<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (our jobs) should align with our values\u2026 So it only makes sense that the way we <\/span><b>grow money<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (our investments) should also be in line with our values. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said &#8212; full disclosure &#8212; I don\u2019t personally do any socially responsible investing. This might change one day, but for the time being I only invest in a total stock market index fund which includes every publicly traded company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll get into some of the pros and cons later on this strategy, but first, here\u2019s more about what socially responsible investing is, and how someone might go about picking funds to invest in&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Would love to hear input from the community on this one, too! Please drop comments if you\u2019re knowledgeable around ESG &#8211; I\u2019m no expert!**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Socially Responsible Investing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it\u2019s investing your money in companies that align with your personal beliefs. Or at least ones that are <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trying their hardest<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to do so within their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term \u201csocially responsible\u201d is pretty loose and covers a wide range of criteria. While there\u2019s no specific set of principles (every investor has different beliefs and priorities), some of the main areas of concern include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Environmental impact:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This includes stuff like using green\/clean technology, using renewable energy, prioritizing sustainability, conserving resources wherever possible, minimizing waste, and promoting the same causes to their customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Corporate governance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Examples in this area are companies that have diverse workforces and leadership, aren\u2019t corrupt or heavily influenced by outside interests, make political contributions to support beliefs, and take corporate responsibility for their actions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Social responsibility:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Companies providing good employee benefits, promoting workplace safety, diversity and inclusion, human rights and community development. Investors also might want to exclude entire industries they don\u2019t feel produce responsible products (like firearms, alcohol or tobacco companies).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cESG investing\u201d is another term used, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance being these main areas of concern. The overall goal is to invest more money with companies that you feel meet your ESG criteria, and less (or nothing) with companies that don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Build a Socially Responsible Investment Portfolio<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here comes the tricky part!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few ways to approach sustainable investing, and they depend on how much involvement you want, how much risk you\u2019re willing to take on, and what is really important to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, you can always build your own portfolio of individual companies to invest in. Or, pick a handful of companies that specifically interest you and dedicate a certain amount of your portfolio to invest in them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, let\u2019s say you have a specific interest in clean energy, and want to dedicate 10% of your investment portfolio to the biggest renewable energy companies in the world. You could research and find companies that you like (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/investing\/top-alternative-energy-companies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here are 10 big ones I just found<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and purchase portions of individual stocks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The downside to this method is of course that manually picking individual stocks is time consuming, not to mention risky. This is probably suited for people who enjoy researching and doing the legwork, as well as only want to dedicate a small portion of their investments to specific areas they are passionate about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For passive investors &#8212; and this includes most of us FIRE peeps &#8212; investing in socially responsible mutual funds or index funds is an easier approach to sustainable investing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Socially Responsible Mutual Funds (Actively Managed)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of building your own portfolio, why not have professionals do all the legwork for you? There are a ton of mutual fund managers who do extensive due diligence to make sure companies are meeting specified ESG factors, so you just have to pick a mutual fund (or a few) that aligns with your goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few well-known SRI mutual funds are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1919 Socially Responsive Balanced Fund (<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/money.usnews.com\/funds\/mutual-funds\/allocation-50-to-70-equity\/1919-socially-responsive-balanced-fund\/ssiax\"><b>SSIAX<\/b><\/a><b>)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This is a pretty broad, \u201cbalanced\u201d fund that includes a mix of stocks (65%), bonds\/fixed income (25%), and also 10% cash holdings.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Vanguard ESG Select Stock Fund (<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/mutual-funds\/profile\/VEIGX\"><b>VEIGX<\/b><\/a><b>):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This actively managed mutual fund includes about 40-50 global stocks that are both financially productive and meet the highest ESG practices.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alliancebernstein.com\/funds\/us\/equities\/international-global\/core\/sustainable-global-thematic.htm\"><b>ATEYX<\/b><\/a><b>):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The managers of this mutual fund use a \u201cbottom-up\u201d company analysis, typically holding 30-60 stocks of companies that have quality management and bigger exposure to ESG factors.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Shelton Green Alpha Fund (<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/fundresearch.fidelity.com\/mutual-funds\/summary\/82301Q692\"><b>NEXTX<\/b><\/a><b>): <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This fund invests primarily in companies that the fund manager believes are leaders in managing environmental risks and opportunities, have above average growth potential, and are \u201creasonably valued.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Fair warning** Actively managed mutual funds typically have high management fees (~1-2%), upfront commissions (front load), and minimum investment amounts. This stuff can eat away at your profit over time! I realize the goal with sustainable investing is not all about making\/saving money, but minimizing fees is important, which is why <\/span><b>index funds <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might be a better fit for a new socially responsible investor. &#x1f447;&#x1f447;&#x1f447;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Socially Responsible ETFs and Index Funds (Passive &amp; Robo Management)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, if I were to start sustainable investing as part of my strategy, I would use broad ETFs and index funds. What I like about index funds is low fees, a lot of diversification, and generally better fund performance. The downside is that these funds seem to have much broader guidelines on ESG criteria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some common SRI funds that are passively managed or align to an index:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Vanguard ESG US.

As much as I want to be socially responsible (in all areas of my life!), I can\u2019t see past the downsides when investing. I realize this is a pretty selfish view, and the more I research this ESG stuff the more I feel bad about not being a socially responsible investor. Perhaps I\u2019ll make some changes in the future, but for now here\u2019s why I\u2019m sticking with total stock market investing&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Ethics &gt; Performance.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number one reason<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for investing is to achieve the best return possible in the simplest way possible. I feel dirty writing this, but excluding certain unethical companies limits my investment options, which limits my potential investment return.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>\u201cEthics\u201d is very subjective.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Due to every person having a different view on what\u2019s right or wrong to invest in, it\u2019s difficult to find a funds manager or an exact sustainable investing ETF that matches my personal views 100%. For example, I really liked the sound of Vanguard\u2019s ESGV Index Fund\u2026 But when I looked at the specific <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/etf\/profile\/overview\/ESGV\/portfolio-holdings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">companies inside the fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are several in there that I don\u2019t personally want to invest in.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>It\u2019s too easy for companies to tick the \u201csocially responsible\u201d checkbox. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many companies report the good things they do and hide the bad things. One example of this is my ex-employer\u2026 In 2020 they were recognized for the seventh straight year as one of \u201cThe World&#8217;s Most Ethical Companies\u201d (or so their marketing department claims). BUT, when I worked there I witnessed first hand some unbelievably disgusting work practices, toxic environments, and even some illegal dealings! I believe many well known \u201cethical companies\u201d are the same\u2026 they highlight their strengths publicly, but in reality can have bad practices behind the scenes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, I realize these reasons are selfish and cynical. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t want to be a socially responsible <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">person<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s just not how I want to invest my money right now in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Socially Responsible Investing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the main reasons sustainable investing is growing more and more popular.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>It benefits society at large! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Socially responsible investing allows you to financially support the companies you believe in and contribute to the change you want to see in the world.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>A personal protest against unethical companies.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Sustainable investing isn\u2019t just about supporting the \u201cgood guys,\u201d it\u2019s also a boycott against the \u201cbad guys.\u201d It\u2019s a nonviolent way to take a stand against the things you\u2019re opposed to in this world.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Aligning to your core values more. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FIRE movement is all about aligning more to your core values and living a life you are proud of. We encourage people to earn money and spend money according to their values&#8230; Sustainable investing is another way to align your existence with what you believe in.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>It feels good!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 Money is emotional, and it\u2019s connected to how well we sleep at night! Impact investing gives you peace of mind that your money is working toward not only providing yourself a richer life, but it\u2019s also providing everyone else a richer life, too.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Should You Do More Socially Responsible Investing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is something every investor needs to decide for themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to Fushia\u2019s original question <\/span><b>**and keep in mind that I am NOT a financial advisor**<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, here is how I would respond\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I\u2019d educate myself as much as possible about ethical investing. Probably the best resource I\u2019ve found is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ussif.org\/index.asp\"><b>US SIF<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They\u2019ve got <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ussif.org\/courses_individualinvestors\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free online courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for individual investors, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ussif.org\/fastfacts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fact sheets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ussif.org\/trends\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trend reports<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and seem to be a legitimate leader in shareholder advocacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this learning should include evaluating the pros and cons of socially responsible investing and making sure you personally feel it\u2019s the right strategy for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, determine the level of involvement you want to have on an ongoing basis. From the sounds of Fushia\u2019s email, they would probably be best suited to choose some passive ESG funds similar to the TD e-series ones they have currently. There are a TON to choose from, but my advice would be to keep things simple, and start with broad, low-cost ETFs. I can\u2019t recommend which funds specifically would be best, because the goal is to align them to your personal ethics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as portfolio risk, each fund has individual risk ratings that should be reviewed carefully, but I\u2019d recommend checking with a financial advisor (one who is also a fiduciary) to make sure long term retirement goals are still met with the chosen investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I\u2019d recommend doing a portfolio review and check in every so often. Values based investing is still a relatively new strategy, and new mutual funds with different criteria seem to be emerging continually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whelp, even if you\u2019re not a socially responsible investor, I hope you learned something new in this post.
