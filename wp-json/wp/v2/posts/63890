Woohoo!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more people are realizing that financial independence is not a binary achievement (FI, or not FI), it\u2019s more of a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lifestyle<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">journey<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an early start on saving and investing, many of the freedoms of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/coast-financial-independence-building-wealth-even-if-youre-not-saving-any-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial independence can be realized long before \u201cretirement\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowing down your FIRE timeline gives you more work\/life flexibility and allows you to enjoy the journey, vs. focus solely on the finish line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>As someone who\u2019s currently pursuing Coast FI, I think it\u2019s pretty awesome. :)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, there are definitely downsides to Coast FIRE. Living with a less formal structure can lead to uncertainty, uncomfortable feelings, and can sometimes add more stress to your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today I\u2019m gonna talk about some of these downsides &#8212; some technical, some emotional &#8212; and most of which I\u2019ve experienced personally.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How I\u2019m Doing Coast FIRE<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, a quick recap on my FIRE situation: My wife and I left our full-time jobs in early 2018 to travel and slow down a bit. We have no debt, a sizable investment portfolio (~$1M) and a decent cash emergency fund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our basic financial plan moving forward is:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work enough to cover our annual spending<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leave our current investments untouched (maybe do some minor shuffling)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our nest egg should magically grow over time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will achieve FI sometime in the next 5 &#8211; 100 years &#x1f605;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As loosy-goosy as this plan sounds, we are caring less and less about our exact financial forecast or FI date. Most of the hard saving\/investing work has already been done, so <\/span><b>our biggest focus now is <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/money-time-master-both\/\"><b>how we want to spend our time<\/b><\/a><b> in life.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re still young, so our strategy can and will probably change. But for now, this is where we\u2019re at. We are still loving and enjoying life, but here are some Coast FIRE downsides we\u2019ve experienced\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Coast FIRE Can Be Perceived as \u201cLazy\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got the following comment on this blog last year, and I\u2019ve heard similar remarks about people who quit their job to try Coast FIRE&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis sounds more like a \u201cbackFIRE\u201d strategy \u2013 one that young folks will regret.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For several years, I was a manager hiring and firing people in an up-and-down business, seeing thousands of resumes and I would have just thrown away any resume of someone that didn\u2019t look like they were trying as hard as they could while they were working. It was OK with me if they had taken time off or slowed down specifically to raise their children, but any resume that looked like they were putting in minimal hours to get by would get thrown away without a second look.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s kind of sad\u2026 I bust my balls at my part-time job, my volunteer job, my hobbies, home duties, side hustles, you get the point. I\u2019m an extremely hard worker and good teammate. But no matter how hard I work or how efficient I am, many people will confuse my \u201cpart-time\u201d employment status as \u201cnot trying very hard\u201d in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess if I ever need to go back to full-time work, my resume will end up in the trash? &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hear it in personal situations, too\u2026 I was out surfing on a Tuesday morning recently, and a guy in the lineup asked me if I had \u201ccalled in sick\u201d that day for work. I was a little offended &#8212; I\u2019ve never faked being sick in my whole life! Maybe he was just joking &#8212; but the fact that I\u2019m a young dude surfing during a time most people my age are working, I was immediately labelled a slacker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality is <\/span><b>if you\u2019re living a lifestyle different from the norm, you\u2019re gonna be perceived as different from the norm. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means you\u2019ll be called lazy, selfish, confused, childish, or unprofessional. People jump to conclusions about your work ethic if they think you\u2019re enjoying life \u201ctoo much.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are someone who cares what everyone else thinks (I am sometimes!) then you might have a hard time adjusting to Coast FIRE and working less.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>More Options Mean More Decisions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the beauties of Coast FIRE are deciding when you want to work, how much travel or play time you want to pursue, and custom-designing your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sounds like a dream to most people!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in reality, having unlimited options in life can be quite overwhelming (and scary). As humans, we crave structure. We like to follow the leader and subconsciously like it when other people make decisions for us. (That way, if it doesn\u2019t work out, we can complain and pass blame to others.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m not gonna lie\u2026 Several times over the past 3 years I\u2019ve been tempted to return to a full-time corporate job. Not because I particularly want to join a specific company, but because going back to a 9-5 is the \u201ceasy button.\u201d They will assign me work, give me health care, a 401k, and look after me. It\u2019s familiar, and familiar = comfort and security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, every time I\u2019ve thought this way, I\u2019ve been able to slap myself silly and remind myself why I started this Coast FIRE journey in the first place. I\u2019m committed to figuring out my purpose in life, and working on anything else is just delaying that mission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet having more options is confusing and takes more time to figure out. If I asked you to choose a flavor on the left side of this chart below, it\u2019s quite easy. If I asked you to choose a flavor on the right, it\u2019s not so easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63931 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-13-at-12.32.40-PM-e1621567072175.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>It\u2019s Hard Watching Your Friends\/Peers Progress Professionally, Without You<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past 3 years, my friends have been promoted, gotten raises, and progressed in their careers. They have interesting new challenges, are leading larger teams, and coaching younger co-workers. This will happen more and more over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know I\u2019m not supposed to be comparing myself to others, but it\u2019s soooo hard not to! Sometimes I feel like everyone else my age is progressing as a grown-up, with fancy work titles and such, and I\u2019m staying in the same spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s getting harder to shoot the shit with my friends because I can\u2019t relate to their work situations anymore. There\u2019s nothing I hate more than FOMO, but I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I am experiencing a tiny bit of it. Maybe I just need more self-confidence? Or to meet some more real life financial independence friends?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, while I might be missing out on all the benefits and joys of corporate progression, I\u2019m also missing all the negatives and downsides of corporate life. I guess there\u2019s 2 ways to look at it. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Worst of Both Worlds: Same Work Headaches With Less Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coast FI is usually proposed as semi-retirement. It appeals to people as the best of both worlds &#8212; having low-stress, meaningful work plus a healthy amount of free time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some people actually end up experiencing the <\/span><b><i>worst<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of both worlds. They can\u2019t find work that\u2019s meaningful or enjoyable, and they don\u2019t have the extra spending money to splash around during their downtime. The frustrations of this flexible lifestyle might outweigh the benefits of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if your low-stress dream job ends up having the same crappy work politics as your last job? Maybe your dream job only pays half of what you need to survive, and you have to hustle your ass off and trade all your free time for extra cash to continue Coast FIRE? Maybe the work you want to do is available only in full-time capacity &#8212; not allowing you any time off at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re in Coast FIRE range and are considering quitting your job to pursue passion work, keep these things in mind\u2026\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWork\u201d doesn\u2019t go away. You are not retired yet, even though it feels like it. You still have YEARS or maybe even decades of work and hustling to do.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to spend more money, you need to earn more. It\u2019s probably a good idea to build extra spending money into your Coast FI expectations so you can try new hobbies and travel.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>Unpredictable Market Returns and Retirement Date<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are no longer contributing to your retirement savings (and not making any withdrawals), then you\u2019re banking on the fact that your investments will grow organically over time. <\/span><b>You\u2019re relying solely on market growth <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to reach your FI number.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly how quickly will your investments grow? &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f; Nobody knows. You could reach FI quickly with stellar market growth, or you could suffer bad returns and hit financial independence 20 years later than you expect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re about to try Coast FIRE, be prepared to live with a ton of uncertainty. When you drop your savings rate to 0%, you are also dropping all control of your early retirement timeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Lifestyle Inflation and Increasing Living Expenses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve written about this before &#8212; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-my-fire-number-keeps-changing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why my FIRE number keeps changing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8230; My wife and I still have some pretty big life decisions to make, and each one affects our annual spending: Kids or no kids, deciding which city we want to retire in, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each time we increase our annual spending, our FI number gets a little higher, and our retirement date is pushed out a little further. This affects all financial independence followers; it\u2019s not limited to just Coast FIRE. But with Coast FIRE, the fact that you\u2019re not saving any more compounds the issue &#8230; Since we\u2019re not personally saving more, any new FI number gap needs to be filled solely by investment growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your age and how much you have life figured out, Coast FI might be a really risky path. If you start coasting with a very <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lean<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> savings pile, you could be screwing yourself if you later realize you need a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fat<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> savings pile.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Despite the Downsides, I Still Love Coast FIRE<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All things considered, my wife and I are still really enjoying our slow and uncertain path to financial independence. The reason I want to share my crappy feelings and experiences along the way is to give people a wider perspective. Coast FIRE might seem alluring from the outside, but there\u2019s a messy middle that exists, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you Coast FI, Slow FI, Barista FIRE (or whatever the cool kids are calling it these days)&#8230; Are you experiencing this stuff, too? Or am I the only nerd complaining about these privileged problems?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a good one,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coast FIRE is growing in popularity!
