We all know we don&#8217;t *need* a gadget like this as we&#8217;ve been doing fine for centuries now, even though it would be damn cool to have, but the question of the # of cards is a pretty important one. And obviously caters to the (enormous) gang of people who DO carry a ton of them everywhere they go. Especially those super consumers!<\/p>\n<p>(So, pretty much, this device is for all those people who *shouldn&#8217;t* be buying it, haha&#8230; OR, those travel hackers who sign up to one card a day and reap all the free benefits like flying around the world in first class while getting hotel rooms comped everywhere they go too &#8211; those guys are hardcore!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Over the years I&#8217;ve been trying to cut down on all my &#8220;things&#8221; in general to be more minimalistic<\/strong>, and this certainly has influenced my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/new-money-management-system-and-banking\/\">financial doings<\/a> as well. Like, how we&#8217;ve made the following changes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keeping all accounts under <em>one<\/em> roof. [With <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa\">USAA<\/a>, of course]<\/li>\n<li>Keeping all expenses on <em>one<\/em> main credit card. [Another shout to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa-credit-cards\">USAA<\/a>]<\/li>\n<li>And keeping all savings into <em>one<\/em> main savings account. [Also, USAA &#8211; hot damn!]<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Now on one hand you&#8217;d think this Coin contraption would then of course make sense<\/strong> &#8211; after all, you can swap out ALL your cards for one fancy pants one instead! &#8211; but really what&#8217;s the point if you&#8217;ve already cut down on most of your cards already?<\/p>\n<p>I will say, however, even with me cutting down as much as possible, I&#8217;m still left with 3 total cards in my money clip day in and day out: Our main credit card, our main debit card (as to pull cash out as needed), and my business Amex card. So it *would* dwindle them down to just 1 main card for sure, but going from 3 cards to 1 rather than 13 is a pretty drastic difference. I&#8217;m not sweating the burden of hauling around 3 little pieces of plastic every day, haha&#8230; And plus that card wouldn&#8217;t even fit <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/09\/wallet-crashers-1-j-money\/\">in my money clip<\/a> I don&#8217;t think?<\/p>\n<h2>Questions About Coin<\/h2>\n<p>This brings us to a multitude of other questions that would arise too:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does this fit in a money clip? Or snuggly in a wallet?<\/li>\n<li>What happens if someone steals it?<\/li>\n<li>Can anyone change the card type on the screen when you hand it over to pay?<\/li>\n<li>What if it runs out of batteries? (Does it even use batteries?)<\/li>\n<li>How easy is it to damage?<\/li>\n<li>What if you lose it?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a warranty you can buy w\/ it to get a free replacement?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>And so on and so forth&#8230;<\/strong> They do answer a lot of those questions in their Q&amp;A section (I won&#8217;t spoil the fun and tell you which ;)), but regardless it&#8217;s catered to a whole bunch of people who at the end of the day really isn&#8217;t me. Except for purposes of blogging about it since it does fall smack in the middle of money AND sexiness no matter how you slice it. Perhaps I&#8217;ll try it when it becomes FREE later ;)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(Speaking of slicing things &#8211; did any of you ever watch that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/movies\/news\/david-blaines-real-or-magic-ranking-the-celebrity-reactions-20131119\" target=\"_blank\">David Blaine special<\/a> last week where he was doing magic tricks for celebrities?? It was off the chain!!! He hid a card in the middle of a peace of freakin&#8217; FRUIT and made Harrison Ford cut it open to find it all curled up in there and blurt out an expletive! Haha&#8230; It was bad ass. But I digress&#8230;)<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">10 People Coin <em>is<\/em> For:<\/h2>\n<p>So who&#8217;s the card <em>really<\/em> for? Here are my guesses:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>People who have a lot of credit and debit cards (d&#8217;uh)<\/li>\n<li>People who have TOO MANY credit and debit cards (this sounds like what I just said, but it&#8217;s not &#8211; some people have a lot of credit cards on purpose, while others just have too many because they don&#8217;t like to pay attention)<\/li>\n<li>People with a ton of rewards cards and it&#8217;s overloading their key chain<\/li>\n<li>People who don&#8217;t have money clips (I know, I know, I&#8217;m obsessed with this one, but I really don&#8217;t think it would get along in there! It would prob break in a week!)<\/li>\n<li>People who just want the latest greatest thing<\/li>\n<li>People who like spending money<\/li>\n<li>People who hack travel rewards (like these guys over at Noob Traveler &#8211; they&#8217;re dope)<\/li>\n<li>People who will buy it because it&#8217;s 50% off so it&#8217;s &#8220;saving&#8221; them money (you laugh, but there are a lot of people who confuse spending a lot of money with <em>saving<\/em> a lot of money! ;))<\/li>\n<li>People who think this will help them get laid (again, these people are out there, haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li>People who are just curious&#8230; I would fall the closest into this category.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I can think up more, but I&#8217;ll save you the time and drivel ;) The point is, this is one new fancy pants card out there, and you should stop for a few before you rush to go buy it. Even IF it&#8217;s 50% off (but if you do end up wanting it for real &#8211; hurry up and get it before the deal goes away!!!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regardless, I&#8217;m sure these folks won&#8217;t have a lick of trouble selling these things out.<\/strong> This is America after all, and we sure do love some game-changing technology. Especially those which promise us time saved and convenience. Just think of all our iPhones!! You know how much freedom we now have because of those? I have all the time in the world now &#8211; I&#8217;m never on that thing.<\/p>\n<p>Oh wait&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Now who wants to sign up for this thing? :)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><strong>PS:<\/strong> I don&#8217;t make any money if you buy Coin or not, though I did want to sign up to their affiliate program to do so!
