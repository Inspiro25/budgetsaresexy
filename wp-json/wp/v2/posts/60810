I could not be more excited!!! Also, to be truly honest, I kinda teared up when I clicked it. After 9 years (for me) and 10 years (for him), we&#8217;re finally done.<\/p>\n<p>I started getting serious about paying down the loans at the end of 2015 (December 28, to be exact), with a grand total of $246,301.18. I finally got sick of having this debt hanging over my head and calculated that if we lived cheaply, we could seriously be done with them after 5 years or so. We figured out a way to live off one income and basically put the other into loans. After almost 3.5 years of paying over $5000 a month into loans&#8230;we&#8217;re done ahead of schedule!<\/p>\n<p>Please excuse me while I go cry and laugh and force-hug my cat. :D<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Humor <em>and<\/em> debt-freedom, how does it get better? :)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I had to follow up with a &#8220;HOWWW??&#8221; though and pry a little further, and our friend here was kind enough to oblige and recap their journey for us&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure some people will write it off the second they see &#8220;6 figure incomes&#8221;, but remember that it takes a lot more than just money to tackle such things, and it was all those 6 figure *loans* that got them to this level to begin with!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>So way to go, Jana &amp; husband! Enjoy this next chapter of your lives, and congrats on <\/strong><\/em><em><strong>your new found freedom!!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The 10 year journey:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>We graduated pharmacy school 1 year apart from each other, with a combined total of around $330k.<\/strong> Both of us were in denial (and for pharmacy school kids, this is apparently <i>normal<\/i>), so we blissfully paid the minimums and went about our lives, buying $7 cereal in Hawaii and eating out almost daily.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>End of 2012:<\/strong> We moved to Seattle from Hawaii, reducing our tax burden (due to lack of state tax in Washington state). We moved, deciding to live off of 1 salary and put the rest towards the loans &#8211; this was simple to do as we both made in the low 6 figures, but it was an adjustment for me to be given an &#8220;allowance&#8221; each month. Luckily my pride got in the way of asking myself for more money, so no matter how hard that last week of the month got, I refused to go over budget!<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>A year and a half after this decision, we decided to buy a condo due to rising rent prices in Seattle.<\/strong> We paused the loans for 3 months to save up a down payment and revamp our financial duties (made possible due to our early payments pushing out our next due dates), but our 3 month pause really turned into 6 months as we bought furniture for the condo, etc etc. In December of 2015, I decided to add up all the loans&#8230;<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>December 28, 2015:<\/strong> I added our loans up and wanted to cry. <b><u>$248,301.18<\/u><\/b> to pay off. We decided to really focus. And by we, I mean *I* got super anal about it and put myself on a strict budget!<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>Many (OMG MANY) spreadsheets were made.<\/strong> And sure, I went over budget a number of times, but the focus was always on the loans. I made sure that I paid the loans on payday so I couldn&#8217;t give myself an excuse to put less into it, but always made sure to keep a $500 buffer in my checking account in case of forgotten auto-debited items (in addition to my emergency fund in savings).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/debt-spreadsheet-loans.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-60893\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/debt-spreadsheet-loans.png\" alt=\"debt spreadsheet loans\" width=\"611\" height=\"186\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/debt-spreadsheet-loans.png 1251w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/debt-spreadsheet-loans-300x91.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/debt-spreadsheet-loans-768x234.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/debt-spreadsheet-loans-1024x312.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" \/><\/a><em>[Click to see bigger]<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>I refinanced with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sofi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sofi<\/a>,<\/strong> bringing my interest down from 6.8% to 3.75%. <b><i>Why didn&#8217;t I do this earlier?!<\/i><\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>I got a raise in 2016, letting me put <i>even more<\/i>\u00a0into the loans<\/strong> (from $6k\/month to about $8k\/month), until 2018 when I decided to change jobs (and take a $33k pay decrease for better quality of life). I cashed out my vacation from the old job and dumped an $8k lump sum into the loans. I was still able to spend about $1.5k on stuff outside of these payments (not including the HOA), so I didn&#8217;t really feel deprived. I got addicted to watching the principle drop on my loans every payday!<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>A few of my friends definitely felt weird about me making 6 figures and living off what amounted to about $18k a year,<\/strong> but they soon learned that I would come and hang out, but would decline pricey meals out&#8230; Unless it was the beginning of the month. Please keep in mind that when I took the $33k drop in pay, I still ended up in the low 6 figures. We still put 4% (for him) and $530\/month (for me) into our respective 401k\/403b plans.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>We picked a combination of the avalanche and snowball methods.<\/strong> We started the pay down process before we were married, but we&#8217;d also been together for about 8 years by then. We figured we were in it for the long haul. To make it fair, I planned it out so that we would alternate paying on our loans, but I had consolidated a number of mine so by far mine were the biggest chunk. We combined methods for 1) practicality and 2) positive reinforcement to help fuel our (read: my) obsession.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\"><strong>We were due to be done originally in December 2019&#8230; then extra payments were made<\/strong> (from taxes, vacation payouts, holiday and\/or OT pay) and it moved slowly to September. Then August. Then July. Finally, we were to be done in June&#8230; until I said &#8220;I&#8217;M DONE WITH THESE LOANS&#8221; and raided my emergency fund to pay off the last $6k.
