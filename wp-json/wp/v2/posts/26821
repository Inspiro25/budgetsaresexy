But like the previous 4 trips of me talking with a manager (I get a different one each time), the answer was a solid &#8220;No,&#8221; and instead I was left with the only option that&#8217;s ever available to me each time: Get a brand new version of the same ring.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it could certainly be worse in that I&#8217;d have to PAY for this new ring every 2 years to get it replaced (I was smart enough to purchase a lifetime warranty that allows for replacements any time it&#8217;s deemed necessary &#8211; which is ALWAYS in my case), but it still sucks knowing I have to go back over and over again just to have something I thought was pretty secure from the start: A *solid* wedding band made of beautiful white gold. Is it too much to ask for something like that to remain in tact for years and years to come? Or at least THREE??<\/p>\n<p><strong>I can never go back in time and pick out a different one, but one day I hope to be able to at least SWITCH it out and convince them that it makes sense for *every* party involved.<\/strong> How could a company be okay with giving out a brand new ring every 2 years to someone rather than just allowing them to swap in a DIFFERENT one of equal size and value? That&#8217;s gotta be expensive, right? It makes no sense to me at all &#8211; financially OR customer service-y. I wouldn&#8217;t think a business wants their customers complaining about how a product of theirs falls apart all the time, or they get so frustrated they went out and BLOGGED about it, right? ;) That can&#8217;t be good&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m asking for something crazy here. And I can guarantee I&#8217;m not the only person with this same problem too &#8211; especially considering I RARELY even wear the ring much anyways (I don&#8217;t like having them on my fingers when I type, so I only slip it on when we go out and about outside the home). If that thing can break being worn a few hours (if that) every other day or so, others&#8217; are breaking too. And probably at a much faster pace. It&#8217;s bad enough I already lost my original ring that was blessed by a good priest friend of ours who no longer lives in the area :( These rings are special!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maybe I&#8217;ll try writing a nice old fashioned letter to the president or something?<\/strong> I love the company (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.helzberg.com\/\">Helzberg Jewelers<\/a>), but man, I&#8217;m just in awe&#8230; Have any of YOUR wedding bands or rings broke? I know it&#8217;s handwoven and all, but jeez &#8211; I&#8217;ve never heard of such a thing&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>OH! And get this. Not to get totally off topic here (which is pretty funny cuz THIS was what I was originally planning to write about in this post! Haha&#8230;), but when I went to go look at rings that were of similar value, <strong>I saw that my ring now goes for over <em>$1,500<\/em>!!<\/strong> When I purchased it 4 years ago it was only around <em>$500<\/em>! How crazy is that? Because of the value of gold over the years though, the ring has more than TRIPLED in price even though it&#8217;s still the EXACT same thing! Haha&#8230;. if only I picked up <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/03\/bought-first-gold-coin-us-mint\/\">my gold coin<\/a> back in the day too ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Y&#8217;all should see how much YOUR rings are worth now :) <\/strong>Especially if they&#8217;re made of gold. I&#8217;m sure those who picked &#8217;em up a looooooong time ago are wearing some pretty expensive metal around your fingers now! I can&#8217;t even imagine how low it all was even 10 or 20 years ago?<\/p>\n<p>Anyways though, back to my letter writing campaign idea &#8211; I think I&#8217;m gonna try it. Other than them finding this blog post or maybe getting lucky one day, I don&#8217;t see how I&#8217;ll ever be able to resolve this situation 100% to my liking.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What would you do if YOUR ring kept falling apart every few years?<\/strong><\/em> I know it&#8217;s just a piece of metal and not the REAL love my wife and I share together, but it&#8217;s still a symbol of it, ya know? I&#8217;d prefer not to have another 35 more rings over the course of my lifetime if possible &#8211; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s too much to ask ;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong> I tweeted back and forth with Helzberg (@Helzberg) and they&#8217;ve promised to have a rep call me soon to see what we can do :) FINGERS CROSSED!!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE #2:<\/strong> We chatted and they&#8217;re working on a solution! I really REALLY hope it works out, and will blog about the outcome soon!
