Each is also associated with a particular area of your life. The idea is this: emotional stress affects our physical bodies (duh!). The emotional stress will often show up in the chakra of the body associated with the area of our life that\u2019s stressing us out.<\/p>\n<p>The second chakra is the area where our reproductive organs live and it also includes the lower back. <strong>The second chakra is connected to our relationship with money, sex, and power.<\/strong> Given this association, it\u2019s no surprise that so many people in our financially stressed out society suffer from lower back pain.<\/p>\n<p>And given the fact that money and sex are connected by the second chakra of the body, it was also no surprise when I read about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/have-more-sex-make-more-money-2013-08-17\">a recent study<\/a> published at the University of Cambridge in England. It reported that people who have sex often earn significantly more money than those who don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>The study, of course, may show a correlation between more sex and more money, not a causation, but economists are paying attention, regardless.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what does this mean for you? How do you make both your sex life and your financial life mind-blowing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, many of the factors that make someone more likely to have more sex and more likely to have more money overlap. So, if you want to have more of both (and honestly, who doesn\u2019t?) all you have to do is focus on these 3 areas:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Enhance your self-confidence\/self-esteem<\/h2>\n<p>People who are more confident make more money and have more sex. It\u2019s just a fact. So how do you become one of those people? Focus on the ways that you\u2019re awesome instead of the ways that you suck. Our culture doesn\u2019t really celebrate people celebrating themselves, but do it anyway. People who go against the cultural norm tend to flourish.<\/p>\n<p>Every day, notice ways that you\u2019ve added value to someone else\u2019s life. Write down 3 ways that you\u2019re awesome before bed. Building the muscle of noticing your greatness will build your self-confidence. Pretty soon you\u2019ll become a love and money magnet!<\/p>\n<h2>2. Get in better emotional shape<\/h2>\n<p>People who are emotionally healthy tend to be nicer to be around and perform better at work. Hence, they earn more money. And guess what? They\u2019re also more attractive.<\/p>\n<p>How can you improve your emotional well-being? You can be more positive. I know you\u2019ve heard it before. But you know why everyone talks about being more positive? Because it works! When you find yourself complaining, stop. When you find yourself worrying about something, find something in your immediate environment to appreciate. When you find yourself being negative, find a way to reframe the situation and find the lesson in it or the silver lining.<\/p>\n<p>Being more positive will make every aspect of your life better, but it would be worth it just for the sex and money, don\u2019t you think?<\/p>\n<h2>3. Get in better physical shape.<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/richard-branson-over-sharing-and-how-to-talk-about-fire\/\" >Richard Branson<\/a>, one of the world\u2019s richest men, said that the number one thing that he can attribute his success to is exercising regularly. That\u2019s right. Exercise gives you more energy, helps you stay focused, gives you mental clarity, and also releases endorphins, which make it easier be positive. Not to mention the fact that it makes you way sexier!<\/p>\n<p>Eating vegetables, whole grains, and a low-glycemic diet also contribute to feeling better. And people who feel better make more money and have more sex.<\/p>\n<p>So next time you get a case of the \u201cwoe is me\u2019s\u201d thinking about either your bank account or the state of your sex life, remember your self-esteem, your emotional health, and your physical shape. Work on one, or better yet, all three of these and get ready for some heftier deposits and more boot knocking!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em><strong>Kate Northrup<\/strong> is the author of the new book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moneyalovestory.com\">Money: A Love Story<\/a>.
