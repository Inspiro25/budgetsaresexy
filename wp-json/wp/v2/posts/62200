Courtesy of your fellow readers here, and perhaps even from <em>you<\/em>! ;)<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;one hanger rule&#8221; is my personal favorite&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Money Binder<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Years ago I got into some deep trouble with credit card debt and owing the IRS back taxes. I declared bankruptcy back in 2008 and since then have kept a binder with monthly tabs and 4 sheets of loose leaf paper in each section.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m the type of person who needs to see physical things in front of me to remember to do things, so online spreadsheets just don&#8217;t work for me.The 4 pages are headed &#8220;Household Expenses&#8221;, &#8220;Food and Groceries&#8221;, &#8220;Income&#8221; and &#8220;Business Expenses&#8221;. As I pay bills and receive income, I record everything by hand in my binder. This also makes doing my taxesa breeze. I pay estimated taxes quarterly, and when it&#8217;s time to do my annual return everything is in one place&#8230; no scrambling around to find receipts, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This system works for me and for the first time in a long time I am debt free and am building a nice brokerage and retirement fund with Vanguard. I keeps tabs on my checking account and brokerage account online so I know exactly where I stand on any given day&#8230; no surprises and less stress.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Magdela<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Two-Person Finance Group<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t track my net worth because it&#8217;s not worth anything&#8230; BUT, on the plus side, my new neighbor and I just started our own two-person finance group! :P We&#8217;re planning to meet every other weekend to talk over our situations and share what we are doing to improve them and swap any ideas that we have.<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s a single mom just a few years younger than me, so we&#8217;re at least around the same age and both single. I don&#8217;t have any kids to take care of like she has, but it&#8217;s &#8216;nice&#8217; to meet someone else who has to watch their pennies too, rather than a lot of these stories where two people both work at lucrative jobs and make good money. I mean, that&#8217;s great for them, but it&#8217;s not realistic to our situations.<\/p>\n<p>So we&#8217;re forming our own club. :) I think it should be called &#8216;The Brokes and Otherwise-Not-Yet-Financially-Successfuls&#8217;, what do you think?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Leah<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: I think it&#8217;s brilliant, haha&#8230; And will one day have to change the name to &#8220;The Riches Because-We-Held-Each-Other-Accountable&#8217; group!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Car Payment Pretender<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One day I called a tow truck to have my car towed for a starter problem, and my neighbor asked if I was ready to buy a new car. I said no, and that I love not having payments, since my car has been paid off for several years. My neighbor told me, &#8220;a car is never truly paid off.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those words hit me, and I began to save up every month. I am pretending that I have a car payment, and setting aside $300 a month. If and when my car needs a repair, I&#8217;ll tap into that fund. So far I have saved over $3k in one year. Eventually I hope that will pay for my down-payment on the next car, or cash out a used car.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; John<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The &#8220;One Hanger&#8221; Rule!<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rule in my house is that we each only get so many hangers. When you go out to buy something new you have to know what you will get rid of because no new hangers are allowed :)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Roxanna<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Book Diet<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on a book diet ever since giving up Amazon for Lent. Giving up Amazon revealed a HUGE leak in my budget and I&#8217;ve since cancelled my renewal for Prime. It was just too easy to buy things. A little friction for making a purchase is a good thing!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; SJF<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Petty Cash Saver<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a money saving idea that I have implemented into my daily life:<\/p>\n<p>I withdraw a predetermined amount each week (petty cash: lunch, coffee, snacks, etc). At the end of each week I deposit the leftover cash into my &#8220;my want &#8221; account (in my safe). The reason behind this was to stop eating &#8220;junk&#8221; for lunch because of my cholesterol level. The second reason is to fund my &#8220;want account&#8221; (firearms and precious metals collection). Every time I want that $5 cup of coffee or that $15 lunch I think about an ounce of silver or a box of ammo. Needless to say, I&#8217;ve been packing a lunch or coming home for lunch. It doesn&#8217;t happen everyday because I&#8217;m all over town and occasionally take clients out to lunch.<\/p>\n<p>Its been a &#8220;win-win&#8221; situation thus far. I don&#8217;t feel guilty pulling money out of the account for &#8220;want&#8221; stuff and my hobby gets funded on a regular basis. Its a great reward and discipline system. And its still contributing to my investment portfolio, right?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Max<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The &#8220;One Bag a Week&#8221; Rule<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For the past few years, I\u2019ve been donating one bag per week to Goodwill \u2013 52 bags per year adds up! House is much easier to manage now. No more junk drawers, no more stuffed closets, and the garage is on the path to becoming manageable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Holly R.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Santa Boxer-Upper<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;So my daughter just had her 6th birthday and we&#8217;re buried in new stuff. But when my daughter turned 2, we started a tradition that she actually looks forward to:<\/p>\n<p>The weekend after her birthday we pack boxes for Santa. She goes through all her toys and the ones she no longer plays with (but are still in good condition) go into a box. The next day I mail this box to Santa so he can clean up the toys and give them out to other kids at Christmas.<\/p>\n<p>She gets so excited about her Santa box! And this has an added bonus in that at Christmas unboxed toys are acceptable as some other kids sent them to Santa because they don\u2019t play with them anymore.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; K.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Modern Day Window Shopper<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I like to put like ten items that I want in my cart at a time from Amazon, so then the price is several hundred dollars and I know I can&#8217;t afford that right now. So then I have to wait, or cull my cart to find out what it is I really want. Because on Amazon, I could spend every cent I have, and I&#8217;d still never have &#8216;enough&#8217;; there&#8217;s always something else super cool! :)<\/p>\n<p>(And if I can&#8217;t decide, I&#8217;ll move everything to the saved portion of my cart and refill it with new things to consider. I think I have 400+ plus items in my saved cart, and three 2,500+ wishlists full, so I have lots of things to look at!)<\/p>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;m what you&#8217;d call a window shopper in the &#8216;old days&#8217;; I LOVE to look, but I know that&#8217;s where most of the allure lies anyway&#8211;after I buy most things, the rush is gone, and I really don&#8217;t care half as much about the purchase anymore. Or I frankly just never use it. So I stick to my dreams, and enjoy looking, but I try not to buy much. I&#8217;d rather save my money for experiences.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Leah<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Unexpected Money Saver<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For 15+ years I have taken nearly every form of \u201csurprise\u201d money (a refund, a rebate, money back from reselling my textbooks, deposits returned, etc) and deposited it into savings or an investment account. If I wasn\u2019t expecting it, then I wasn\u2019t counting on it, and therefore I won\u2019t miss spending it.<\/p>\n<p>Looking back I realize our family has received hundreds of such checks. I estimate the total to be in the $25-$30K range. Just last week my 16 and 13 year old kids each received a check for $9.45 for drawings they had entered at our local interstate fair two months ago. I have no idea what role their submissions played in the checks, and it really didn&#8217;t matter because I promptly added them to the children\u2019s savings accounts.<\/p>\n<p>I estimate that my \u201cnever spend unexpected money\u201d practice will be worth $150-$200K in retirement. Not bad for money I didn\u2019t lift a finger to earn.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; D.G.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Just had a flash back of our old <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/spavings-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spavings challenge<\/a>!!
