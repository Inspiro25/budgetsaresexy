WOOHOO! And instead of writing out some long boring blog pots about each of them (which I&#8217;d been trying to do for the past two months now), I figured I&#8217;d just shoot y&#8217;all the summaries and call it a day ;) If anyone wants me to elaborate on any of them or go into deeper details, just ask away in the comments and I&#8217;ll be more than happy to hook ya up!<\/p>\n<p>The 3 latest issues we kicked in the ass:<\/p>\n<h2>1. The Wedding Ring Fiasco<\/h2>\n<p>This was the most recent situation, and also the easiest one to resolve! Though I didn&#8217;t really know it going in ;)\u00a0 I had been trying for years to get my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/my-handwoven-wedding-ring-and-gold-prices\/\">dumb wedding ring swapped out<\/a> because it kept falling apart (crazy, I know), but every dang manager at the store told me it couldn&#8217;t be done &#8220;due to their policies.&#8221;\u00a0 So, as many of you probably recall, I blogged my heart out about it last month and was quickly met with a lot of &#8220;that&#8217;s messed up!&#8221;s, as well as a few suggestions to tweet or call them up on top of it.\u00a0 And I did!<\/p>\n<p>I first tweeted the link to my post to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/helzberg\">@Helzberg<\/a>, and literally seconds later I got a response saying they&#8217;d love to help me and to DM my contact info.\u00a0 So I did, and a few hours later a rep called me back to hear my story out and see what they can do. And they must have given me their start player over there cuz this guy (Courtney) was by far the best customer service rep I have ever dealt with over the phone in my 32 years on this earth.\u00a0 He was kind, respectful, and most importantly LISTENED to me and understood that there was a problem here than needed to get fixed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/novell-wedding-band-gold.jpg\" alt=\"novell wedding band gold\" width=\"230\" height=\"154\" border=\"0\" \/><strong>Fast forward a few phone calls and approvals here and there, and 2 days later my issue was resolved!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not only did I get a full value replacement of my ring that had shot up 3 times worth since I bought it years ago (we paid around $500 for it and the exact same ring now goes for $1,500+ due to the increase in gold!), but they also let me keep my life-time warranty on the new ring as well &#8211; something that originally I was gonna have to pay for again, and would have gladly done so (a $150 value). So my love was restored with Helzberg Diamonds, and I&#8217;m the proud new owner of a ring I&#8217;ll actually wear again every single day of my life ;) That&#8217;s a picture of my new ring up above there &#8211; I def. should have called a lot sooner!<\/p>\n<h2>2. The Moldy Bathroom<\/h2>\n<p>Oh man, I never thought I&#8217;d see the day when <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/moldy-bathroom-super-wife\/\">this one<\/a> was wiped from our to-do list ;)\u00a0 The wife had been talking about it for literally two years, but as soon as we realized it could not only be endangering OUR health, but also our baby&#8217;s!, we knew we finally had to do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>So we <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/moldy-bathroom-super-wife\/\">hired a handyman<\/a>, decided to &#8220;do it right&#8221; and upgrade the tiles and features of the shower since it would only cost a few hundred dollars more, and 3 weeks later we were set!\u00a0 Total price tag: $2,500.\u00a0 More than we originally budgeted for, but at the end of the day we were done dealing with it and just happy to be mold-free again as well as now having a sexy place to take showers going forward ;) That before &amp; after picture at the top was\/is our new shower!<\/p>\n<h2>3. The Leaking Bathroom<\/h2>\n<p>The month of May was a nightmare for us here out our house. Not only were we dealing with that moldy bathroom situation above there, but our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/04\/water-heater-problems\/\">water heater had just burned out<\/a> and needed replacement, and then our 2nd bathroom <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/house-keeps-falling-apart\/\">started acting up<\/a> because we were using it more due to our moldy bathroom being fixed!\u00a0 It was a nightmare!<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately though we decided to do a LOT more research this time than the first go around w\/ the handyman services, and instead of paying the $700 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/house-keeps-falling-apart\/\">initially quoted<\/a> to fix the water leakage, it ended up costing us about a little less than $200 by contracting a plumber instead :)\u00a0 And then a drywall guy just to patch it up on the side, which is included in that $200 total (the plumber only charged us $65 for his time &#8211; part of the drainage tube just needed to be attached better &#8211; and the drywall guy charged $125 to patch up two holes we had made in the process). The only reason we did this job so fast was because the baby was hot on our trails, but I&#8217;m sooooooo glad we did cuz now &#8211; for the first time in a while (knock on wood) &#8211; our house is completely up to date and problem free! Woo!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So all of that to say KNOCK OUT THOSE PROBLEMS as fast as you can so you don&#8217;t stress yourself out too much ;)<\/strong>\u00a0 I would have gone back and fixed all of these right from the beginning if I could because it was def. not worth the heart ache.\u00a0 And I imagine the same goes for you and your current problems you&#8217;re dealing with too &#8211; whether it has to do with debt, or loans, or patching up your houses\/cars, whatever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If something&#8217;s eating away at you, make it your mission this weekend to start fixing it!<\/strong> And let us know what&#8217;s on your mind in the comments below so we can all support and encourage you to do so :)\u00a0 Life doesn&#8217;t need to be lived more complicated!, so so suck it up and get &#8216;er done! (I think I&#8217;m actually gonna print that out in bold letters and staple it on my wall, haha&#8230; I need the reminder just as much as anyone does!)<\/p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I enjoy out of this life (besides babies, money, love, sex, beer&#8230;), it&#8217;s putting a close to unresolved issues ;) The&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/your-mission-this-weekend-resolve-something\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[99,8,58],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-27580","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-awesomely-awesome","category-home-ownership","category-wedding"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Your Mission This Weekend: Resolve Something! | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/your-mission-this-weekend-resolve-something\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Your Mission This Weekend: Resolve Something! | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"If there&#8217;s one thing I enjoy out of this life (besides babies, money, love, sex, beer&#8230;), it&#8217;s putting a close to unresolved issues ;) The...
