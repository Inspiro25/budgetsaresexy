It sounds silly, but we love it.<\/p>\n<p>We do this because:<\/p>\n<p>1) It began when we bought our first <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-im-transitioning-away-from-rental-properties\/\">rental property<\/a> together. Rent checks come in on the 1st of each month, and even though most (sometimes all) of the rent goes to pay the property expenses, this was our first taste of \u2018passive\u2019 income.<\/p>\n<p>2) It encourages us to talk about finances and check in with each other regularly. Over the years we\u2019ve watched our plans come to fruition, which reinforces how important our communication is.<\/p>\n<p>3) It makes\u00a0celebration\u00a0a regular activity in our household. Small things or large things, everything in our life deserves to be celebrated. We never forget how lucky we are.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 A.M.

I wanted them to find something else to talk about me apart from my loss, so I bought new stylish clothes.<\/p>\n<p>People would still talk about my loss, but they could not help talking about how good I looked. I had not known until then that I (apparently) had a beautiful structure, and people started looking at me in a different way \u2013 not disrespectfully, but appreciating what they saw.<\/p>\n<p>My girlfriends and female colleagues kept on saying how beautifully the bodycon clothes fitted me. I also bought very stylish non-bodycon dresses. At first I was self-conscious, but now I am used to it after five years of both old and new colleagues mentioning the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, I had the disposable income to change my wardrobe and this was really good for my mental health.<\/p>\n<p>-Claire<\/p>\n<p>In re: to our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/when-does-it-makes-sense-to-spend-more-on-your-looks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when it make sense to spend more on your looks<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>[And if you&#8217;re wondering what the heck a &#8220;bodycon&#8221; dress is like I was, here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dress#Bodycon_dress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the answer<\/a> ;) &#8220;A bodycon dress is a tight figure-hugging dress, often made from stretchy material.
