It&#8217;s an awesome read :))<\/em>. Needless to say, there has been some interesting discussions!<\/p>\n<p>As such, I thought it might be useful for everyone if I shared a strategy I have been using to<strong> <\/strong>land killer deals on quality hotel rooms. This strategy involves a combination of using both the Priceline Negotiator &#8220;Name Your Price&#8221; tool, and Hotwire.<\/p>\n<h2>How Do Priceline &#8220;Name Your Price&#8221; and Hotwire Work?<\/h2>\n<p>I realize that many of you reading this have most likely already used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.priceline.com\/\">Priceline <\/a>or <a href=\"http:\/\/hotwire.com\/\">Hotwire<\/a> (or both), and therefore are very familiar with how they work and the functionality offered. However, I wanted to briefly review them for a bit to ensure that everyone is indeed on the same page.<\/p>\n<p>At a high level, Priceline&#8217;s <em>Name Your Price<\/em> tool and the Hotwire site connects hotel room finders with nightly rates that are deeply discounted from the normal rates published by the same hotels. Hotwire\/Priceline is able to offer these cheaper rates because these hotels contract the two companies to fill hotel vacancies that would otherwise go unsold. The benefit of obtaining these rates, however, can come at a cost &#8211; depending on how specific your preferences for hotels are.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In order to take advantage of these discount sites&#8217; rates, you are only allowed to specify the following preferences:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The geographical area where you want to stay.<\/em> A metropolitan area is usually separated into different sections that are about 5 miles in diameter. You must choose one or more of these for where you want your hotel to be located. <em>(Hint:<\/em><em> <\/em>By expanding the geographical search area, you can often find even better discounts off the hotel rooms)<\/li>\n<li><em>The star level of your hotel.<\/em><em> <\/em>This ranges from 1 star Economy class motels to 4-star Luxury hotels.<\/li>\n<li><em>You cannot select the *specific hotel* you&#8217;d like to stay in.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>My Strategy for Getting Even Better Deals with PriceLine and Hotwire:<\/h2>\n<p>As the name implies, Priceline&#8217;s <em>Name Your Price<\/em> tool gives you the option to actually specify the price you&#8217;d like to pay for a room. This is the main difference between Hotwire and the Priceline Negotiator. It&#8217;s a truly genius idea on their part, since it engages customers more and empowers them with the ability<em> <\/em>to receive lower prices than Hotwire. For this reason, I like to make my final deals with Priceline&#8217;s <em>Name Your Price<\/em> tool instead of Hotwire.<\/p>\n<p><strong>However, the biggest problem I had when originally using Priceline was deciding on *what* price to actually offer when choosing my hotel.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After electing a geographical sub-area, along with a hotel star class, Priceline then gives you the &#8220;median&#8221; retail price of the hotel rates in the specified category. Now maybe I&#8217;m just overly skeptical, but I personally don&#8217;t trust those quotes at all! I would much rather do my own research on what a good market price is, than take their word for it.  Additionally, the whole point of using Priceline&#8217;s Negotiator tool is to get a deep discount to begin with, not pay retail price for a hotel room?<\/p>\n<p>As such, I would often start out with a very low price and incrementally increase it as necessary. However, this ended up taking a lot of time and required me to input my credit card information again and again every time I had to increase the price (since Priceline rejects your offer if it is below their undisclosed required pricing minimums).<\/p>\n<p><strong>It soon became clear that a more reliable procedure was needed.<\/strong> After some trial and error, I came up with the below process that has worked incredibly well for me during this past year &#8211; maybe it will help you a lot too?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"http:\/\/Hotwire.com\">Hotwire.com<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Enter your preferred hotel dates, star level, and geographic area in order to find out the price that <em>Hotwire<\/em> is offering the room you&#8217;re currently looking for.<\/li>\n<li>Next, go to Priceline&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.priceline.com\/\">Name Your Price Negotiator<\/a> interface.<\/li>\n<li>Specify the same hotel dates, star level, and geographic area you input into Hotwire&#8217;s system.<\/li>\n<li>When it asks you to name your price, <em><strong>enter a price that is 70% of the price quoted by Hotwire<\/strong> (a 30% discount). <\/em><\/li>\n<li>Click enter to see if your offer is accepted.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>A Current Example of the Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, the strategy is pretty straight-forward and simple. I thought it would help, though, if I showed you a quick example of how putting this strategy to work goes. Thus, below is how I would apply this strategy for obtaining a 3-star hotel room in the Arlington, Virginia locale of the DC suburbs, from April 16th to April 18th, 2012.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Hotwire.com.<\/li>\n<li>Enter your preferred hotel dates, star level, and geographic area in order to find out the price that Hotwire is offering for the hotel room you&#8217;re looking for.\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #008000;\">The price being charged by Hotwire for this type of hotel is $177 per room per night.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Next, go to Priceline&#8217;s Name Your Price Negotiator interface.<\/li>\n<li>Specify the same hotel dates, star level, and geographic area you input in to Hotwire&#8217;s system.\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #008000;\">For a 3 star hotel during the specified dates in Arlington, Virginia, Priceline is &#8220;suggesting&#8221; to use $270 as the &#8220;median&#8221; retail price for this type of hotel.<\/span> However, it&#8217;s important to note that this is a RETAIL price, and not the price that you&#8217;re looking to obtain via the deep discount.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>When it asks you to name your price, <em>enter a price that is 70% of the price quoted by Hotwire.<\/em>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #008000;\">70% of the $177 per room per night quoted by Hotwire = $123.90.<\/span> This is the price I would enter in to the Priceline Negotiator system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Click enter to see if your offer is accepted.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>My Experience With the Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>As I mentioned previously, I&#8217;ve had pretty good success using this strategy to get low-priced hotel rooms over the past year. While I definitely won&#8217;t make any claims about the method being &#8220;flawless,&#8221; it has indeed saved me a lot of money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Listed below are some of the prices I&#8217;ve landed recently, compared to the &#8220;discount&#8221; Travelocity prices of similar rooms<\/strong>. Both hotels were located in the Richmond, Virginia area &#8211; a great place to find cheap hotels, by the way!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crowne Plaza Hotel &#8211; Downtown &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><em>$70<\/em><\/strong><\/span> per room per night is what I paid from<em> <\/em><em>Priceline<\/em>.<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><em>$118<\/em><\/strong><\/span> per room per night quoted from <em>Travelocity<\/em>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Best Western Plus &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><em>$37<\/em> <\/strong><\/span>per room per night is what I paid from <em>Priceline<\/em>.<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><em>$59<\/em><\/strong><\/span> per room per night quoted from <em>Travelocity<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Shown below is a picture of the hotel room I had in the Best Western Plus. Not too shabby &#8211; complete with a microwave and flat screen TV! You&#8217;ll have to excuse the clothes on the beds, though. I was frantically getting ready to run a half marathon in the morning and had to wake up at 4:00 AM :)<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 10pt 0px 0px 0pt; float: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/messy-hotel-room.jpg\" alt=\"messy hotel room\" width=\"500\" height=\"310\" border=\"0\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Coincidentally, both of the prices obtained from Priceline were right around <em><strong>60%<\/strong><\/em> of the prices quoted by Travelocity. So there may be a pattern there as well, but that would have to be the subject of a separate investigation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And that&#8217;s how I save on all my hotel rooms!<\/strong> Have any of you experienced similar results with these places? <strong><em>Do you use any other sites you find to be even better?<\/em><\/strong> If so, share your experiences below!
