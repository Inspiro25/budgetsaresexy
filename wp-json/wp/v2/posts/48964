Really excited to get the new phase of our lives going and feel like it was def. a good call. The wife&#8217;s back to her career for the first time in 6 years (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/05\/graduation-advice-money-love-apps\/\">she was getting a PHD<\/a>), and the kids are down the street playing legos at a home daycare. I miss them already, but hey &#8211; life&#8217;s all about changes, eh?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also be lying if I said I miss the pressure of supporting my entire family on one blog income too :) We&#8217;ve weathered some big storms over the years &#8211; and still not out from all of them &#8211; but our money continues to grow so hopefully this latest move will only catapult it further.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not gonna suck <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/from-single-income-kids-to-dual-income-kids\/\">being a DIK<\/a>, that&#8217;s for sure!<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s a snapshot of how this affects our finances now:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rent: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">+$500\/mo<\/span> <\/strong>compared to VA<\/li>\n<li><strong>Car:<\/strong> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>+$340\/m0<\/strong><\/span> as we needed to get a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/bye-bye-frankencaddy-hello-car-payments\/\">new (to us) car<\/a> to replace dear ol&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/franken-caddy-car-keeps-making-money\/\">Frankencaddy<\/a> now that I&#8217;m in charge of the boys on a daily basis (miss you, buddy!!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Daycare:<\/strong> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>+$1,600\/mo<\/strong><\/span> for two boys full-time. This was the cheapest by far, if you can believe it, as all other options (centers, camps, etc) ranged from $2,000 to $2,800\/month (!!!). And they love their new caretaker so far and have friends again to play with (their own age &#8211; hah).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost of living:<\/strong> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>+$200\/mo?<\/strong><\/span> Not sure how to calculate this, but it&#8217;ll def. be more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Car insurance: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">+$20.14\/mo<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Renters insurance: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">+$2.90\/mo<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So about $2,700 tacked onto our monthly expenses.<\/p>\n<p>The good part? A new income is coming :)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Salary for year one: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">+$4,400\/mo<\/span><\/strong> (before taxes\/deductions)<strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Salary in year two: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">+$5,300\/mo <\/span><\/strong>(gets automatically bumped up)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Healthcare savings: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">+$700\/mo!!<\/span> <\/strong>No more $950 health insurance payments!!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retirement investments: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">+$400\/mo?<\/span> <\/strong>Looking forward to taking advantage of all those gov&#8217;t accounts\/matches!

And since it&#8217;s with the gov&#8217;t, it&#8217;s safe to say it&#8217;s more stable than online income. Though according to the interwebs, the world as we know it will crash whether Trump or Clinton wins, so maybe none of this will matter in the end? ;)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Some other things of note throughout this process&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>There&#8217;s a big difference between maintaining a rental vs a house you own.<\/strong> In the three years we rented our house in Va, we probably spent about <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$500<\/strong><\/span> total on maintenance. And this includes a $250 deduction in our rent deposit for scruffing up parts of their hardwood floors in my office &#8211; oops. Want to take a guess how much it cost the owners of the home in comparison? <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Over $15,000!!!<\/strong> <\/span>Not only did a handful of items break down and needed fixing\/replacing, but in the last year there the house started leaking and needed the entire roof to be replaced &#8211; yikes.<\/p>\n<p>Again this why I love renting so much!!! Even though it&#8217;s &#8220;throwing money down the drain!&#8221; Now to be fair, I <em>was<\/em> helping them pay down their mortgage every month so it wasn&#8217;t like they exactly lost $15,000, but by and large this is the part most people forget about in their calculations of renting vs owning &#8211; the maintenance. And that doesn&#8217;t even account for the mental side of things either. Nothing wrong with whichever route you go, just please know how it affects your overall lifestyle! <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/01\/we-sold-our-house-no-more-mortgages\/\">It&#8217;s okay to rent<\/a> if that suits you the best!<\/p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ll never hire &#8220;per hour&#8221; movers again.<\/strong> For the first time in our lives we hired some burly men to come and load up a moving van with all the boxes we packed ourselves, and what was supposed to be a 6 hour deal at <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$700<\/strong> <\/span>turned into a 12 hour one at <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$1,300<\/strong><\/span>. I&#8217;ve never seen grown men move so slowly, and considering I was in there moving stuff alongside of them, you&#8217;d think it would have sped up the process pretty well. But nope. They took their sweet time, and then magically &#8220;got stuck in traffic&#8221; one hour more than it took us, even though we were 5 minutes behind them. So yay to getting it all done and having nothing broken at least, but a big boooooo for how it all came together. Next time &#8211; flat fee only and\/or never allowing my friends to ever vacation again :) (I swear we weren&#8217;t like those people Jeffro dealt with during his moving nightmare!! We really did have mostly light stuff!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tote containers are AWESOME for moves.<\/strong> We picked up this trick from another friend during the last move, but pretty much we just pick up dozens of decently-sized tupperware-like bins from Target or Walmart at like $3.00 a pop, and then we just start stashing everything we can in them. Especially books. This makes both packing, and carrying\/unloading, them much easier and faster. They also stack up well together making things look much more organized than they are :) However&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For being an aspiring minimalist, I still have a bunch of crap to get rid of.<\/strong> We probably donated over 20 boxes of stuff before the move (which alone shocked me!), but as we started loading up the truck I realized half of the stuff in our basement still hadn&#8217;t been gone through. So I set all these aside in our newer basement, and came out to be about 18 tupperwares full of stuff from previous moves, along with numerous bins labeled &#8220;memories&#8221; that we haven&#8217;t gone through in forever. So our goal is to go through one box a week until we&#8217;re all through four and a half months later. Should be do-able?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Decluttering your key chain is the best!!<\/strong> I don&#8217;t know why I never pay attention to it, but I literally had 9 random keys on it that I had no idea where they go to anymore. I kept saying to myself, &#8220;well maybe one day you&#8217;ll find out and need them?&#8221; but then I slapped myself and took them all off making my keychain look incredibly wimpy with only three keys left :) But what a feeling!!! When was the last time you sorted yours?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, downsizing is cozy :)<\/strong> We lost 600 sq feet in our move (1,700 <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/wont-be-homeless-next-month\/\">down to 1,100<\/a>), but we gained so much. We all feel closer as a family so far, and not only physically, haha, and since most things are all on one level now we get to see each other more. It&#8217;s also been a ton easier to clean and even decorate\/sort things. We&#8217;ve had to get rid of some stuff already that didn&#8217;t fit, but a few easy replacements later did the trick and by and large we&#8217;ve settled in quite nicely. This bodes well for future dreams of moving into an <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/02\/pros-cons-rving-across-country-how-to-do-it\/\">RV<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/think-you-could-live-in-a-houseboat\/\">houseboat<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/10\/think-could-live-in-hotel-pros-cons-living\/\">hotel<\/a>!! :)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Some pics of our eating nook and kids basement playroom&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>(They love the new home too!
