Woohoo! And a sexy stainless steel one at that &#8211; even IF my wallet wasn&#8217;t ready for it yet&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But isn&#8217;t that the case with everything <del>awesome<\/del> about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/house-keeps-falling-apart\/\">home ownership<\/a>? One day everything&#8217;s running as smooth as can be, and the next appliances start breaking down and you&#8217;re forced into the market for a new piece of $1,000 metal, ugh.\u00a0 (And of course you always feel bad while window shopping earlier in the year at big sales events cuz you don&#8217;t want to replace something that&#8217;s working perfectly fine!) If anyone ever wants to invent a future-telling machine, please put me down for an order.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This came about last week when we opened our freezer and saw ice cream melting all over the place.\u00a0<\/strong> Oh the humanity! That poor dessert didn&#8217;t stand a chance in the freakin&#8217; heat&#8230; And sadly neither did any of our other tasty groceries we had luckily been low on at the moment. I don&#8217;t know how long the thing was shut off for, but either way it wasn&#8217;t a pleasant thing to wake up to.\u00a0 And unfortunately we were too dumb to understand the warning signs that had been coming to us over the past 6 months prior&#8230; Things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our fridge making weird beeping noises<\/li>\n<li>Our fridge <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/stuff-new-home-owners-never-think-about\/\">randomly shutting off and on<\/a> in the middle of the day<\/li>\n<li>Our fridge getting louder and louder as if it was about to take off and shoot through our roof!<\/li>\n<li>And a number of other things I&#8217;m forgetting that should have alerted us through our thick heads&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>But it is what it is, and we were forced to go fridge shopping with a screaming baby which really doesn&#8217;t mesh well together<\/strong> &#8211; especially when there&#8217;s lots of dimensions to be careful of and every dang manufacturer is different! (Seriously, why can&#8217;t all fridges be the same size?? I swear I saw at LEAST 62 varying shapes and colors &#8211; there can&#8217;t be that many exceptions can there?).<\/p>\n<p>And as luck would have it, Best Buy was remodeling and had exactly 3 units in stock (!!) &#8211; none of which matched the size we needed &#8211; and Home Depot seemed to only have $3,000 super fridges on display with all kinds of bells and whistles and flat screen tvs imbedded in them. Who the heck wants their fridge entertaining them?? (Okay, well I didn&#8217;t see those THIS time around, but I have in the past and they&#8217;re kinda freaky).<\/p>\n<p><strong>So we shot back home and started a major research project online.<\/strong> Which was equally mind numbing. If you&#8217;ve ever searched for appliances for over 5 hours at a time, you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about.\u00a0 It&#8217;s hell. Which is surprising because I thought I&#8217;d enjoy picking out a new fridge as I&#8217;d never done it before?\u00a0 I bet it would be different if we had a normal sized one though&#8230; Ours seemed to be on the smaller side than your average beefcake model which kinda puts a damper on the options.<\/p>\n<p>It also doesn&#8217;t help when:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The fridge needs to be DELIVERED to you (we have no SUV\/truck still)<\/li>\n<li>And you have to have it within the next 24-48 hours (we had no food!)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>So on top of the crazy ass dimensions we were working with, we were also on a time and delivery crunch.<\/strong>\u00a0 Which not shockingly adds more money and restrictions to the whole process. I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t want to give up approximately 1,012 times throughout the process.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/rockstar-magnets.jpg\" alt=\"rockstar magnets\" width=\"300\" height=\"233\" border=\"0\" \/><strong>But alas we found a diamond in the rough, and the price and everything else was right on the money.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but we started getting EXCITED about it too!\u00a0 Because it would mean a total upgrade in our kitchen making our house even easier to sell or rent down the road :) Thus checking off that other &#8220;make it better for the future&#8221; box, which we&#8217;ve been trying to stick to throughout our ownership.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re gonna replace something in the house, make it BETTER than it was before, right?<\/strong> Boy Scouts style, just like we did with our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/your-mission-this-weekend-resolve-something\/\">moldy bathroom<\/a> the other month. No point in spending the money just for an exact replica of something you weren&#8217;t too keen on anyways &#8211; that&#8217;s the worst.<\/p>\n<p>This is the fridge we ended up picking: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whirlpool.com\/-%5BGB2FHDXWS%5D-1001305\/GB2FHDXWS\/\">Whirlpool Gold\u00ae Resource Saver\u2122 Bottom Freezer Fridge<\/a>. MSRP of $1,650, Energy Star, stainless steel, and overall bad ass looking. We didn&#8217;t have the option for french-doors, or that would have totally made the cut (those were too wide for what we needed).<\/p>\n<p><strong>And we paid about <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$1,300<\/span> for it, not including delivery\/takeaway of $80.\u00a0<\/strong> We had found this originally at Best buy for $1,500 with FREE shipping &amp; delivery, but ended up going through Sears.com who I didn&#8217;t even know was still in existence? Haha&#8230; We landed a deal at $1,300 after finding an online coupon code which saved us an additional $100! Best 2 min search of my life. (I highly recommend doing this no matter WHAT you buy online btw &#8211; you never really know what you can get for free like that until you give it a quick shot. It&#8217;s super easy, just type &#8220;PRODUCT coupon code&#8221; into Google, that&#8217;s it.)<\/p>\n<p>Then, two days later, it was installed!!\u00a0 And, OMG, two quick things here on that too:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>MAKE SURE TO TRIPLE CHECK all measurements!!<\/strong> We had done it over and over again, and then ALSO looked up the dimensions of our 15+ old dead fridge, and still we *barely*\u00a0squeaked by with this one. We literally had 3 millimeters left from the top of the fridge to the cabinets, even though everything pointed to us having an entire inch. It was nuts.\u00a0 The delivery men thought there was no way it would fit and we got so lucky!! It would have been a night mare to send back, get a refund, swap in a new one, etc etc&#8230; This post would have been totally different in that case ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Upgraded appliances make ALL the difference in a kitchen.<\/strong>\u00a0 Seriously. I literally feel like I&#8217;m walking into a new home every time I see it out of the corner of my eye! It&#8217;s awesome :) $1,300 now, for a much better return in the future. Home psychology is wild&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And that&#8217;s the story of a nightmare turned happy ending :) Minus the $1,300 I now have to account for in this month&#8217;s budget, damn&#8230; That&#8217;s a big chunk to be unexpected. But that&#8217;s what <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/new-monster-cash-account-emergency-fund\/\">savings is for<\/a>. To calm you in times of panic and disgust ;) So make sure you&#8217;re building this into your financial goals. It&#8217;s not as sexy as stock investing or other things, but you know it&#8217;s super important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now I gotta find out if we can get some sort of tax credits for upgrading to an <em>Energy Star<\/em> appliance&#8230; <\/strong>Anyone know off the top of their heads?\u00a0 Anyone excited to go out and buy a new home after reading this? Haha&#8230; It&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/stuff-new-home-owners-never-think-about\/\">always something<\/a>, that&#8217;s for sure.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Also, anyone know how to *clean* stainless?
