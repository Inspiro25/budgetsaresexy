Check it out and then show him some love over on his site! (As long as you&#8217;re not one of the people doing the following below &#8211; hah)]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019ve spent the last 3 years as a bank teller at a major American bank.<\/strong> It can be fun, and it can be boring, but it\u2019s always stressful.<\/p>\n<p>We deal with money which people have a strong emotional connection to and makes them do stupid stuff. I&#8217;ve seen fraudulent check-writing grannies, customers getting beat up and robbed right outside our doors, and a kid once cashing stolen checks from a businessman who happened to be at the bank when the cops snuck up to arrest him. It&#8217;s always something!<\/p>\n<p>A lot of you probably don\u2019t step foot in a bank branch much these days with the technological advances that we\u2019ve seen lately, but when you do, here are some sure ways to piss us off (and some ways to avoid doing so). At the end of the day we have the same goal as you: to process your transaction correctly and efficiently.<\/p>\n<h2>What to Not Do at a Bank:<\/h2>\n<p><strong>#1. Sneeze, cough, bleed, wipe your butt, wipe your snot, or sweat all over your money or your ID and then have the nerve to hand it to us.<\/strong> Basically, no bodily fluids. Ladies, it\u2019s not cute when you pull your ID from your bra after you just hit the gym. We have to handle that stuff with our bare hands! With all the fluids, dust, dirt, and who knows what else we come in contact with, our hands are filthy at the end of the day. I have to wash my hands before I eat or go to the bathroom. Basically, be a decent human being. Is that too much to ask for?<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. Joke around with bomb threats, robbery threats, or death threats.<\/strong> There is a time and place (I think?) for these kinds of things. Your bank is absolutely, definitely not one of them. We take them very seriously and don\u2019t like to joke around with our lives. We want to go home to our families at the end of the day. It gets old and it\u2019s not amusing. Ask us about the weather instead or how our days are going.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. Ask us \u201cDO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!\u201d<\/strong> Never utter those words to us. We don\u2019t give a shit who you are and it won\u2019t make us treat you any differently. Treating us with respect, instead of trying to intimidate us, will get you further with whatever your request is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. Slap on perfume\/cologne to hide the odor of being a drug dealer.<\/strong> If you sell the good stuff, we do get a contact high whenever we open our cash drawers. Use the ATM and save us the hassle or simply don\u2019t be a drug dealer. Whichever works for us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. Line up at the door before we open.<\/strong> Is it that important that you have to deposit your pay check bright and early before most people are even awake? (including me; I\u2019m not much of a morning person) There\u2019s other ways such to do this such as using an ATM, your smart phone, or you can avoid the situation altogether by setting up direct deposit! It\u2019s also fishy and causes security concerns. We aren\u2019t afraid to call the cops\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>#6. Bring us 20 pounds of loose, unrolled coin and expect us to deposit it the same day.<\/strong> No, we can\u2019t roll it for you; that would take all day. And no, we don\u2019t have a machine that counts it. That\u2019s called a CoinStar. Good news is that we can ship it to our main cash vault and it\u2019ll be deposited to your account within a couple business days. It\u2019s actually pretty awesome and convenient if you can wait a couple of days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#7. Slip us your phone number, expect a date, and cuss us out when we reject you.<\/strong> It\u2019s just weird. We\u2019re not gold diggers, but we do know what your bank account looks like. How many times has such a stunt worked out in your favor? Show some respect and we\u2019ll respect you. Doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll say no, but you\u2019ll have more of a chance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#8. Walk in and expect to receive more than $10,000 in the exact denomination that you want it.<\/strong> Believe it or not but we don\u2019t have that much money on hand at any given time. We have to forecast how much money we\u2019ll have on hand at any given time that has to last us a couple days until our next shipment comes in. This large of a withdrawal can throw things off and poses a security and safety risk for us, you, and other customers. People go crazy when they see \u201clots\u201d of money and things could potentially escalate quickly! We can definitely accommodate you but we\u2019ll have to special order it for you. Give us a call a couple days in advance and we can work with you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#9. Staple your deposits together.<\/strong> We have to scan every piece of paper so if there\u2019s a staple attached that we don\u2019t catch, it\u2019ll break our machines which in turn means your trip to the bank will take longer than usual\u2026.and so will everyone else\u2019s which just makes everyone livid. Paper clips are fine; staples are a big no-no.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#10. Bitch at us for doing our jobs.<\/strong> Part of our job description includes minimizing risk for ourselves, our co-workers, other customers, and our shareholders. If we need a second opinion from a supervisor, don\u2019t freak out and cuss at us. One, it\u2019s rude\u2026.and two, it makes us want to help you a little less than we already wanted to. Seriously, just be nice! You\u2019d be surprised how much this will change how much we\u2019re willing to help!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#11. Try to cash a check without the other person being there.<\/strong> When a check is written out to someone, that person specifically, has the right to the funds. If it\u2019s not you, I can\u2019t give you the money because the person who the check was written to can say that we gave someone else their money. We\u2019re just trying to minimize the risk and keep our jobs. However, we can make exceptions; we take into account what your relationship is with us such as if you guys have a joint account, how much the check is made out for, how long you\u2019ve been a customer of ours, and what your balance looks like. At the bank I work at, we are able to make judgment calls for anything under $100 without any repercussions if things don\u2019t end up well. Again, be nice to us, and it\u2019ll help you get the result you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#12. Be a complete ass.<\/strong> A large part of our job is talking to you. Yes, we want to genuinely know how your day is going and make a personal connection but we also are in the sales business. If you\u2019re going to be an ass to us, don\u2019t use a teller. With all these technological advances these days such as online banking, mobile banking, and ATMs (which have been around forever,) you can choose not to interact with us. Please, use them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#13. Expect to receive foreign currency the same day you walk in.<\/strong> Sure, branches are in different geographical areas so banks close to the Mexican border might have Pesos on hand and banks close to the Canadian border might have Canadian Dollars on hand but it doesn\u2019t mean a branch in any other region does. It most cases, you can order foreign currency and you can pick it up from us in 1-2 business days depending on what time of the day you place your order. If you need it sooner, airports usually house foreign currency exchange businesses that will usually give you a worse exchange rate than a bank will but you can get it right away.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#14. Complain when the exchange rate is different than what you see in the newspaper or online.<\/strong> The exchange rate is constantly changing. The bank doesn\u2019t take a \u201ccut\u201d or a \u201cpercentage\u201d but we do \u201cbuy\u201d (take in) foreign currency and \u201csell\u201d (give you) foreign currency at different rates because of the fact that the exchange rate can be so volatile. Believe it or not, but most banks are in it to make a profit (shocking!) so they can\u2019t afford to lose money from this risk. Don\u2019t expect to get the rate that you see in the newspaper or online. Unfortunately, it\u2019s just not gonna happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#15. Hide your money under a mattress.<\/strong> It has a certain disgusting odor that makes us gag. It\u2019s also displeasing to touch and that dead skin, old sweat, and whatever other nastiness is now on our hands, clothes, and our work area. Thanks\u2026. There\u2019s really no reason to put it in your mattress. If you\u2019re that paranoid that your bank will fail, put it in a safe. Also, the FDIC insures all checking and saving accounts up to $250,000 so if your bank fails, your money is safe. See, there\u2019s nothing really to worry about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#16. Complain when we have to fill out extra paperwork when it comes to federal regulations.<\/strong> We\u2019re really just doing our jobs. You know how difficult it is doing taxes and stuff like that, right? Well it\u2019s even more tedious when the government oversees everything that you do. You have nothing to worry about if you\u2019re not doing anything illegal. Actually the more you complain, the more suspicious we become.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#17. Don\u2019t fill out a deposit slip fully or correctly.<\/strong> We ask you to fill them out because all the information is needed to make a deposit. It makes our lives easier and gets you on your way quicker. If there\u2019s a problem with your deposit, the more information we have, the easier the problem can be resolved and the quicker you can get your money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#18. Complain if you have to wait or if we ask you if you bank with us if you don\u2019t.<\/strong> You aren\u2019t our customer so we really don\u2019t owe you a damn thing. I can cash your check and give you your money but it doesn\u2019t really motivate me to move things along if you complain and bash me or the company I work for. Just be nice, it\u2019ll get you a lot further and out a lot quicker. We\u2019re actually doing you a favor. We know nothing about you so there\u2019s more risk involved for us. If you want to avoid dealing with us, there\u2019s usually no reason why your own bank won\u2019t cash your check if you aren\u2019t complete scum.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#19. Complain that it\u2019s busy on a pay day, Friday, 1st of the month, 3rd of the month, middle of the month, day right before a holiday, or the end of the month.<\/strong> These are peak days and are extremely stressful for us. You mouthing off to us doesn\u2019t help and it slows us down which not only slows you down, but all the people waiting in line behind you. Don\u2019t be that guy. Usually, the best time for you to come in would be Tuesday or Wednesday around 10 am or in the afternoon around 1:30-2 pm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#20.\u00a0 Walk in a couple minutes before we close.<\/strong> Don\u2019t be that guy! We\u2019ve been open for hours and are exhausted. Being a teller involves paying close attention to everything you do and talking to every customer you help; it\u2019s mentally draining! The last thing we want to do is deposit your check, withdrawal cash, pay your mortgage, your credit cards, and your auto loan. It takes a little longer than the 3 minutes you\u2019ve allotted yourself to go to the bank.<\/p>\n<p>So I\u2019ve told you a couple of easy ways to make your branch teller mad, but that\u2019s no real help, is it? What can you do to make your trip to the branch as pleasant as possible?<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s pretty simple: help us have fun and enjoy being at work.<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re not machines and we like interacting with our customers. We enjoy the face-to-face human interaction of our jobs. If we didn\u2019t, we\u2019d be in a call center.<\/p>\n<p>Talk to us and get to know us; finance can be a boring, monotonous subject if you let it get to you. Help us break up the monotony. Anything you can do to make our job easier such as having a deposit slip fully filled out, having all your information readily available, or knowing how you\u2019d like your cash back when you cash a check is a huge plus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Treating us with respect and how you\u2019d like to be treated will make your trip to the branch as enjoyable as possible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>*********<br \/>\n<em><strong>Marc<\/strong> blogs over at the <a href=\"http:\/\/selfemployedmovement.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Self Employed Movement<\/a> where he helps people (including himself!) go from being unemployed, underemployed, or unhappy in their jobs to being self employed.
