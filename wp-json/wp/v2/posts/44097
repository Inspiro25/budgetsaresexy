Still a nice chunk of change considering it was all <em>free<\/em>, but it appears my hustling in this department has since waned&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Am I mad at myself? Yes and no. Yes in that I started slacking in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/craigslist-selling-rule\/\" target=\"_blank\">my Craigslist postings<\/a> and I STILL haven&#8217;t gone outside of my 3 main bills there to cut down (I should start calling this the &#8220;Challenge Some-things&#8221; mission! Hah!), but no in that my time has been redirected in other &#8211; much more income producing &#8211; areas of my life in exchange. Such as taking on that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/05\/more-you-slack-less-you-stack\/\" target=\"_blank\">high paying writing gig<\/a> from last week, as well as other areas more linked to my online projects. It&#8217;s hard to swallow the fact that spending just a few hours on writing one article can produce more money than 7 months of selling my junk on Craigslist! But I guess it&#8217;s just the way the money crumbles&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I&#8217;ve really been trying to focus on that old adage of &#8220;working smarter, not harder.&#8221;<\/strong> And when you do that &#8211; as I&#8217;m now figuring out &#8211; it means dropping the ball in other areas\/goals of your life and stinging a little. Even though it makes the most sense, and I&#8217;d highly recommend it all day, every day ;) If you don&#8217;t allow yourself to adapt as time goes on, you&#8217;ll stay stuck in your ways forever. Even if they&#8217;re solid ways&#8230; Gotta keep tweaking and swapping in *better* avenues as you come across them so your cash continues to grow! Hustling 2.0!<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, hard to complain when you&#8217;ve got an extra $250 for doing absolutely nothing. And I challenge all you new readers to the site to really stop and think about where all <em>your<\/em> money&#8217;s going too to see if there&#8217;s a better path for it! The beauty with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/challenge-all-expenses\/\" target=\"_blank\">cutting your recurring expenses<\/a> is that it then becomes recurring savings EACH MONTH. And if you bank it all away into a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/the-new-challenge-everything-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\">separate savings account<\/a> as I&#8217;ve been doing, you&#8217;ll find it really stacks up and motivates you along the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what our balance now looks like:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44086\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/challenge-savings-usaa-apr.gif\" alt=\"challenge savings usaa april\" width=\"494\" height=\"59\" \/><\/a>And here&#8217;s the progression over the past 8 months to show you the power in this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Month #1 balance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/challenge-savings-account-update\/\" target=\"_blank\">$203.96<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Month #2 balance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/11\/challenge-savings-account-update-oct\/\" target=\"_blank\">$406.60<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Month #3 balance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/12\/challenge-savings-account-1k\/\" target=\"_blank\">$1,209.16<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Month #4 balance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/01\/challenge-savings-account-update-2k\/\" target=\"_blank\">$2,029.81<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Month #5 balance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/02\/challenge-savings-account-update-5\/\" target=\"_blank\">$2,954.14<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Month #6 balance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/money-experiments-update\/\" target=\"_blank\">$3,442.39<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Month #7 balance: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/04\/challenge-everything-savings-goal\/\" target=\"_blank\">$3,843.70<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Month #8 balance: $4,097.22<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>That&#8217;s $4,000 towards maxing out our Roth IRA &#8211; BOOM!<\/strong> Which I only know because I separated it all out from day 1.

Makes all the difference in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the breakdown of how April went:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44084\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/challenge-savings-april.gif\" alt=\"challenge savings- april\" width=\"467\" height=\"287\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cell Phones &#8212;<\/strong> $100+ savings every month totaling almost $1,000 now since <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/07\/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\">switching over to Republic Wireless<\/a>.

I&#8217;d consider nixing cable again too if it was massive savings, but it only costs $20 or so more to keep it around since we need internet already, so it&#8217;s worth the value in entertainment it gives us. I love me some escapes from reality for a little each night.

Which is why you don&#8217;t find every &#8220;how to&#8221; in the world here &#8211; if I&#8217;m not actively participating\/experiencing a particular financial thing, I won&#8217;t write about it! Helps me stay as &#8220;real&#8221; as I can here. And plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/blogroll\" target=\"_blank\">other kick-ass bloggers<\/a> cover the rest anyways :) That link there goes to my blogroll of fave sites &#8211; check &#8217;em out sometime.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the recent experiments we&#8217;ve since shut down and added to the list:<\/p>\n<h2>The $2.00 Bill Trick<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/two-dollar-bills-savings-trick\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/two-dollar-bill-hoard.jpg\" alt=\"two dollar bills\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>There was a brief moment in time where I was obsessed with $2.00 bills<\/strong> and realized the more I came into, the more I was saving and not spending them. Which lead me to a light bulb moment: the more I actively pile up these bills, the more I&#8217;ll force myself to save and have fun at the same time! :)<\/p>\n<p>So every time I walked by a bank I had a rule where I&#8217;d have to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/two-dollar-bills-savings-trick\/\" target=\"_blank\">walk in and &#8220;buy out&#8221; any $2 bills<\/a> that the teller had in their drawer. Sometimes this would be $4.00 worth, and other $40.000 (they&#8217;re super common at banks, even though you NEVER see them in the real world &#8211; isn&#8217;t that strange?). After a couple of months I had like $600 or $700 I wanna say, and ultimately decided that it was dumb just holding onto all this cash in my safe not earning or growing anything.<\/p>\n<p>So I slowly started using them up instead of taking out cash at the ATM every month like I do (I always pull $100 or $200\/mo to be used as &#8220;blow money&#8221; where I don&#8217;t have to account for it and give my brain a break :)). I gave them out as tips, gifts, stocking stuffers, you name it. They&#8217;re literally only worth $2.00 a piece, but people just love receiving them! And a fair number of them also asked me if they were &#8220;real&#8221; money, haha&#8230; Yes. They are definitely real. They don&#8217;t really serve a purpose, but they&#8217;re real. And if you&#8217;re having trouble keeping money around, consider giving this a shot yourself!<\/p>\n<h2>The &#8220;Active&#8221; vs &#8220;Passive&#8221; IRA Test<\/h2>\n<p>This was one of my crazier ideas&#8230; After <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\" target=\"_blank\">I left my 9-5<\/a> to blog full-time, I had the decision of what to do with my old 401(k). I wanted to roll it over into my own USAA accounts so it wouldn&#8217;t be tied to my old employer anymore (who later screwed me), but where to put these funds were beyond me as I hadn&#8217;t discovered the joys of Vanguard yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I did what any normal person would do &#8211; I split up all $180,000 of my money into 3 separate IRA accounts<\/strong> and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-401k-ira-test\/\" target=\"_blank\">pinned them against each other<\/a> in a friendly competition :) These 3 accounts looked like this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A portfolio that USAA recommended, but didn&#8217;t manage (I set it up once and then left it alone)<\/li>\n<li>A portfolio that USAA recommended, but DID manage (with only USAA funds in it)<\/li>\n<li>A portfolio that USAA recommended, managed, but had both USAA funds <em>and<\/em> outside funds in it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The test ran for almost three years, and we had a clear winner throughout almost the entire time. Wanna take a guess on which one won out? <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/net-worth-update-april-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\">The final results<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>IRA #1 (NOT Managed): $79,141.43<i><br \/>\n<\/i><\/li>\n<li>IRA #2 (Managed, USAA funds only): $73,199.26<\/li>\n<li>IRA #3 (Managed, ALL different funds): $74,024.92<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The unmanaged (and no fees) one beat out the two other <em>managed<\/em> ones by $5,000+.<\/strong> Not a scientific test in the least (and three years is a horribly short amount of time to compare anything in the stock market!), but still a fascinating thing to watch. At least to me ;) Only some people over at USAA appreciated it, haha&#8230; (they were nice to get on the phone with me afterwards to explain why they performed as they did &#8211; which made sense to me at the time &#8211; but unfortunately I have since all forgotten the reasons why&#8230;).<\/p>\n<p>While I still have love for managed\/mutual funds, nowadays I have my entire portfolio in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\">one main index fund at Vanguard<\/a> and it&#8217;s nice and streamlined. Most people consider this an even <em>crazier<\/em> experiment &#8211; hah! &#8211; but for now I&#8217;m happy with its home and will take average gains any day of the week vs trying to chase the next &#8220;hot thing&#8221; every other month. I much prefer betting on the market as a whole.<\/p>\n<h2>The &#8220;Non-Spending&#8221; Tracker<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/my-new-non-spending-tracker\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/no-spending.gif\" alt=\"non-spending\" width=\"500\" height=\"142\" \/><\/a>This was the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/my-new-non-spending-tracker\/\" target=\"_blank\">quickest experiment of them all<\/a>, basically because I totally forgot to do it the second I hit publish on the post :) But I still think it&#8217;s actually a pretty damn good one!<\/p>\n<p>You know all the times you find a killer deal on something, or even just something you REALLY REALLY want, but you hold yourself back and don&#8217;t get it, feeling awfully proud of yourself? Well, the idea with this Non-Spending Tracker would be that it would serve as a place to give yourself a pat on the pack and just motivate you even more to continue saying &#8220;no&#8221; to stuff you don&#8217;t really need or can&#8217;t afford. You&#8217;d just list each item you passed up on one side (like in a spreadsheet or piece or paper or something), and then on the right jot down the price tag.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It would look like this:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flower oil painting: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$20.00<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Hand-painted table from Peru: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$40.00<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li>TOTAL SAVED: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>$60.00<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those are literally the only two items I listed before I unintentionally gave up on this. Killer idea though, right? I hope some of you do try it out and then share your results with me at some point :) At the very least it helps you stay cognizant of where all your money is going!<\/p>\n<p><strong>That&#8217;s all of them for now, but I&#8217;m sure more will pop up in no time ;)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I share these with you just to show there are soooooooo many different ways to manage and save\/ invest your money, and the more you experiment the more you&#8217;ll stumble across the tricks that work for YOU.
