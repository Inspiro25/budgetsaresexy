Woohoo! That&#8217;s my wife&#8217;s check above she just claimed from the great state of Maryland this weekend :) How they knew her last name was BudgetsAreSexy is beyond me&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>You may recall from last year that my wife is an <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/06\/do-not-be-like-my-wife\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accidental hoarder of money<\/a>.<\/strong> She forgets cash in birthday cards, jacket pockets, graduations cards from 11 years ago (true story), and apparently also PAYCHECKS WORTH HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS she never cashed! WTF?<\/p>\n<p>That check up top was long earned and forgotten over a decade ago from temp work she picked up after graduating college. I finally convinced her a year ago to do her own search for unclaimed money (and by &#8220;convince her&#8221; I mean I did it FOR her), and she finally got around to submitting the claim. If I didn&#8217;t know better, I&#8217;d think she&#8217;s allergic to money ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Still, this is solid proof that this stuff&#8217;s legit.<\/strong> And I&#8217;m willing to bet a good portion of <em>you<\/em> are probably owed money you&#8217;ve long lost too.

How insane\/awesome is that?<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why or how, or even <em>what<\/em> unclaimed money&#8217;s about, read further&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>What is Unclaimed Money?<\/h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unclaimed.org\/what\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unclaimed.org<\/a> (run by <em>The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators<\/em>):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Unclaimed property (sometimes referred to as abandoned) refers to accounts in financial institutions and companies that have had no activity generated or contact with the owner for one year or a longer period. Common forms of unclaimed property include savings or checking accounts, stocks, uncashed dividends or payroll checks, refunds, traveler&#8217;s checks, trust distributions, unredeemed money orders or gift certificates (in some states), insurance payments or refunds and life insurance policies, annuities, certificates of deposit, customer overpayments, utility security deposits, mineral royalty payments, and contents of safe deposit boxes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Here are some other interesting facts:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every U.S. state, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands &#8211; and Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta in Canada have unclaimed property programs that actively and continuously find owners of lost and forgotten assets (Yeah Canada!).<\/li>\n<li>Claims can be made into perpetuity in most cases &#8211; even by heirs.<\/li>\n<li>Unclaimed property laws have been around since at the 1930s, but have become much broader and more enforced in the last 25 years.<\/li>\n<li>Unclaimed property is one of the original consumer protection programs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/gallery\/pf\/2013\/03\/05\/celebrities-unclaimed-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Even celebrities are owed money<\/a>! As of 2013 Lindsay Lohan is owed $1,560, Cindy Crawford $101,900, Justin Timberlake is out $3,579, and even our own president Barack Obama is owed money &#8211; to the tune of $700. How busy can they be to ignore such fortunes? ;)<\/p>\n<h2>How to Claim Your Abandoned Property<\/h2>\n<p>If you finally believe me that this is real, and you&#8217;re now excited to go see just how much YOU&#8217;RE owed too (fyi I&#8217;m not getting paid a penny to pimp out these sites &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to get <em>you<\/em> the pennies!), here are the steps to get going.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"http:\/\/missingmoney.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MissingMoney.com<\/a> and type in your name\/state.<\/li>\n<li>See if anything shows up (more than likely there will be like 200 of you out there, so try to narrow the search by using middle initial and city\/state to speed it up. If you&#8217;ve lived in over 20 places in your life like I have, it may take you longer ;) But hey, it&#8217;s &#8220;free&#8221; money!)<\/li>\n<li>If you find something that could be yours, and you answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to all those questions it pops out, it&#8217;ll then direct you over to the place to file your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/1-in-10-people-in-the-u-s-have-missing-money-heres-how-to-claim-yours\/\">missing money<\/a> report (not to be confused with missing persons report).
