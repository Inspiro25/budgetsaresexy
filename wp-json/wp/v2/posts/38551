If I may be so bold to ask, do you make more\u00a0money than YOUR husband? :)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Ask away! You know I\u2019m not shy, J! That\u2019s a great question and the answer is yes. I make more than my husband, Tim.\u00a0 It was actually what triggered my curiosity and fascination with this topic.<\/p>\n<p>While my husband is super supportive and we don\u2019t bicker often over money, I\u2019ll be the first to say that we weren\u2019t totally ready for this financial dynamic and, as a result, we faced some perplexing issues (which you can read all about in the book!). And, while I\u2019ve spent more than 10 years helping individuals and families with their finances and consider myself a pretty solid money manager, this was the first time I felt a bit lost at sea. There was no established guide or recipe on how to make your partnership succeed when <i>she<\/i> is the breadwinner. Emotionally and psychologically, this is heavy stuff. There was no roadmap! So I decided to research and discover the secrets, myself.<\/p>\n<h3><b>What are some of the reasons us men have such a hard time with women making more than us?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>I think part of the reason is that men face a set of unfair societal expectations about what it means to be a man and a \u201cprovider.\u201d Researchers at Pew, in fact, found that 67 percent of Americans still believed it was \u201cvery important\u201d that a man be ready to support a family before getting married, while only 33 percent believed the same about women. And many men still personally believe that it\u2019s important for them to make more than their wives. It\u2019s a powerful social and psychological norm that\u2019s here to stay for now. So when it\u2019s violated, it can make men feel emasculated.<b><\/b><\/p>\n<p>At the same time, I also want to point out that it\u2019s not necessarily just men who have a problem with their wives making more. Sometimes it\u2019s that <i>she<\/i> has issues with it because, perhaps, she has more traditional expectations of what it means to be husband and wife, as well. At the end of the day, some women still want to feel like they\u2019re being \u2018taken care of\u2019 by their partners in some capacity. There are a lot of ways to feel \u2018taken care of\u2019 that have nothing to do with money, of course. But if her definition of being \u2018taken care of\u2019 involves feeling financially protected, then she may be in for a rude awakening as the breadwinner.<\/p>\n<h3><b>I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;d have no qualms with my wife bringing in more than me if\/when that occurs, so assuming that&#8217;s accurate, what % of the male species would this put me in?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re not a rare species for thinking that way! But it is not how the majority of men feel deep down. I think that in theory many men would say that they\u2019d have no problem if their girlfriend or wife made more and I have thrown this hypothetical out at many a dinner parties and work events, but in practice, studies \u2013 and my own interviews &#8211; discover a totally different emotional scenario.<\/p>\n<h3><b>You say that for the top-earning woman, the rules are &#8220;different.&#8221; What are a few of these different rules exactly?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The rules are different in many ways \u2013 and often stem from a need to address his or her emotional challenges.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in marriages where the wife brings home a bigger paycheck, she is twice as likely as her husband to make all the financial decisions, and while on the surface this may seem like a positive thing (since we always want to encourage women to be more engaged in the family\u2019s financial planning), this could \u2013 and does \u2013 emotionally backfire at times. She may begin to feel stressed and resentful that she\u2019s taking on so much responsibility. And he may begin to feel slighted, as so much of his ego and dignity may be tied to <i>feeling<\/i> financially significant in the relationship. So, partners need to, as I say in the book, find a way to \u2018level the financial playing field.\u2019 This is a consideration that couples with equal incomes or a male breadwinner don\u2019t have to consider as much.<\/p>\n<p>There are also unique challenges for top-earning women and their partners when it comes to raising a family. You must take extra precautions in terms of work\/life balance. I discuss in the book that it helps to think in terms of \u201cmaking it all work,\u201d rather than the stereotypical \u201chaving it all.\u201d And no, it\u2019s not always a smart decision for him to become the primary caregiver just because he makes less. There are some serious trade-offs to consider when designating a stay-at-home parent, especially if it\u2019s dad.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XyVTffh4wVA?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><\/p>\n<h3><b>Without giving the book away, what are a couple of tips breadwinning women can start enacting now while waiting for it to be released? (It comes out\u00a0May 1st\u00a0fyi, and you can <a href=\"http:\/\/farnoosh.tv\/books\/when-she-makes-more\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">preorder it here<\/a> for a chance to win some cool gifts and to hang out with Farnoosh at The Today Show!)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#1) Stop asking for \u2018help\u2019 and establish more \u2018accountability.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Identify the most significant way(s) your partner can support you \u2013 and ask him to provide that. And rather than ask for his \u2018help\u2019 here and there, find out what major area or domain he can completely take charge of. Perhaps it\u2019s managing the big-picture finances like retirement and college savings (with your periodic review and consent, of course) and\/or perhaps it\u2019s taking over all-things food-related in your home which includes not just preparing the kids\u2019 lunches when you\u2019re in a bind, but planning dinners, food shopping and stocking the pantry. For other couples it may mean having him adjust his work hours to be primary caretaker when the kids home arrive from school. Bottom line: If your man isn\u2019t the breadwinner, then it&#8217;s important for him to feel like he\u2019s still providing in a major, major way, otherwise he can begin to question his purpose in the relationship \u2013 and she can start to wonder, \u2018what do I need you for?\u2019<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#2) Think of and plan for ways you can \u2018invest\u2019 in his ambitions so that he can better provide financially for the family in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I look forward to my husband taking over as the breadwinner some day \u2013 even if just temporarily. As much as I feel empowered at times as the top earner in our relationship, it carries a good bit of stress, as well.\u00a0 I encourage higher earning women to invest in their men\u2019s goals, especially if pursuing those goals can mean more money and flexibility in your lives. With your financial support he could pursue a graduate degree, change careers, or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-started-a-quarantini-%f0%9f%8d%b8-business-during-the-covid-pandemic\/\">start a business<\/a> in pursuit of more happiness and income. It\u2019s the kind of investment that can pay off for everyone in the family, especially if kids are in the picture now or down the road. Should you want to off-ramp momentarily and be a stay-at-home mom, he can better provide for the family\u2019s needs in the interim. Or, if you need more money to support costs like day care or college savings, investing in your guy\u2019s earnings potential today can reap benefits in the future.<\/p>\n<h3><b>I&#8217;ve always liked the question you ask on your <a href=\"http:\/\/farnoosh.tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">main website<\/a> about being ready to live a &#8220;richer and happier life.&#8221; What&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve found that really works for you in achieving this?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>When I got married, we started working with a financial advisor, which has really helped us feel more financially empowered and prepared for life\u2019s unexpected twists and turns. Part of what feeds my happiness is having a support system in my life and access to resources that can help me make healthier choices.\u00a0 I certainly don\u2019t pretend to know everything and I\u2019ve gotten really good at asking questions.\u00a0 And that has served me \u2013 and my family \u2013 in living a richer, happier life.<\/p>\n<h3><b>As a fellow hustler and finance blogger, the biggest challenge I&#8217;ve found is managing my time efficiently. With being an author, expert, and freelance writer (and let&#8217;s not forget kick-ass TV host from The Bank of Mom &amp; Dad!), how do you get it all done? And so well?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Well thanks for saying that! I certainly don\u2019t feel very efficient at times. I am just as much a procrastinator as the next person, but it\u2019s true that I jam pack a lot of responsibilities in my work life and somehow the work gets done. In my younger years it was thanks partly to not needing a lot of sleep! I could work until 3am and pull all-nighters. I don\u2019t have that kind of stamina anymore \u2013 especially now as I write this 7.5 months pregnant!<\/p>\n<p>But with experience comes knowledge of what you <i>have<\/i> to do versus what can wait. I prioritize my work checklist now by placing income-generating tasks at the tip-top.\u00a0 I also outsource a few things. I use an online transcription service. I have a copy editor assisting me with my newsletter and I have an awesome web support team that makes sure my site looks beautiful and runs smoothly.\u00a0 And over the years, having gotten a lot more comfortable on camera, I\u2019ve managed to eliminate the nerves and just concentrate on giving sound advice. And let me tell you, not being nervous has chopped down my need to prepare for media hits significantly!<\/p>\n<h2>Want a copy of her new book, <em>&#8220;When She Makes More&#8221;<\/em>?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/farnoosh.tv\/books\/when-she-makes-more\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38563\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/when-she-makes-more-book.jpg\" alt=\"when she makes more book\" width=\"600\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/when-she-makes-more-book.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/when-she-makes-more-book-300x119.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Like what <a href=\"http:\/\/farnoosh.tv\/books\/when-she-makes-more\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Farnoosh<\/a> is about?
