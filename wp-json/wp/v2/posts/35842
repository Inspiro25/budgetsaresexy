Haha&#8230;\u00a0 until said pills were discontinued and he woke up from a fun, yet very strange-like, haze ;) (They were part of the narcotic family)<\/p>\n<p>But this post isn&#8217;t about tasty pills, rather how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nimh.nih.gov\/health\/topics\/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd\/index.shtml\">the disorder<\/a> affects your MONEY. And how to help manage it better according to an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/09\/16\/us-personal-finance-adhd-idUSBRE98F0SH20130916\">article on Reuters<\/a> I stumbled across yesterday.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a clip of some of the consequences of ADHD from those who have it MUCH MUCH worse than I<\/strong>, thank God. Those that are classified as &#8220;severe&#8221;:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of her clients&#8230; went out to buy groceries, got distracted on the way by a sign advertising an open house, and returned sans groceries, but with a contract on the house. Another client went to jail because he couldn&#8217;t face filing his federal income tax returns or paying his taxes. Another, who earned over $100,000 a year, lived for two weeks without electricity or running water because he forgot to pay the bills and was too embarrassed to call the utilities and sort it out.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Pretty crazy, huh? It sounds funny reading that since they are exceptions to the rule, but it&#8217;s still a rather serious problem for many adults out there &#8211; approximately 4.1% according to the National Institute of Mental Health. And while I&#8217;ve never gone to jail or been too embarrassed to resolve a situation, I HAVE been known to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/10\/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house\/\">buy a house on a whim<\/a>. Which coincidentally led me to starting this blog you&#8217;re now reading 6 years later :) So at least there&#8217;s that&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some other surprising tidbits about those with ADHD vs those without,<\/strong> according to a book the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/09\/16\/us-personal-finance-adhd-idUSBRE98F0SH20130916\">same article<\/a> on Reuters referenced &#8211; &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1609180755\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1609180755&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20\">ADHD in Adults: What the Science Says<\/a>&#8220;:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>57% are far more likely to miss loan payments, compared to 27%<\/li>\n<li>62% are more likely to buy items impulsively, compared to 18%<\/li>\n<li>54% are more likely to have a poor credit rating, compared to 8%<\/li>\n<li>and 71% are more likely not to save for retirement, compared to 42%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sad sad numbers indeed. All of which makes sense if you&#8217;re completely scatter brained and constantly have your attention diverted every 5 seconds (oh look, a squirrel!). But luckily there&#8217;s hope for us yet :) And plenty of proof that successful people come from all types of backgrounds, an idea for a project that someone REALLY should put together one day actually.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m Tom Brady, and I have ADHD&#8221;<\/strong> (I have no idea if Tom Brady does or does not have attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder, but it would make for a motivational blog nonetheless :)). In fact, I think my brother game me that idea a while back, though for celebrities with OCD (obsession compulsion disorder) instead&#8230; which he&#8217;s suffered from for many many years now, poor brother :( But I digress&#8230;. (oh look, Tom Brady!).<\/p>\n<p>This same awesome article also goes into a few tips that can help those with ADHD too. Things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Developing a bill storage system that is simple, consistent and visible.<\/strong> I use a basket which then gets xferred to a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/desk-filing-drawer.jpg\">filing box in my desk drawer<\/a> (I have one of those old school desks which has huge cavernous drawers that allow me to place filing stuff in it :) So it&#8217;s right there next to my computer once I&#8217;ve paid things!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Putting yourself on a schedule.<\/strong> Easier said than done, but it def. helps.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Using financial record keeping software.<\/strong> Tools like <a title=\"mint\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/mint\">mint.com<\/a>, <a title=\"ynab\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/ynab\">you need a budget.com<\/a>, etc<\/li>\n<li><strong>Using strategies to curb impulsivity.<\/strong> Like &#8221;\u00a0taping receipts to impulse purchases and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/are-you-good-at-returning-things\/\">leaving them in the trunk of your car<\/a> for 24 hours before deciding to keep them.&#8221; &#8211; Something I&#8217;ve said for yearrrrrrs to do! Minus the tape.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Getting help.<\/strong> From a professional.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All good ideas for sure. To which I&#8217;d also tack on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make to-do lists.<\/strong> On paper, or better yet, your hand! Something you can never lose, hopefully.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Put things on the calendar &#8211; and READ the calendar!<\/strong> Google has made this easier than ever.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Drink coffee to help you focus (if you don&#8217;t like medication).<\/strong> For whatever reason it reigns me in like none other which is one of the most important things for those with ADHD or ADD.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t commit to things you know very damn well you have a good chance of flaking on.<\/strong> Not like dreams or goals or anything &#8211; those are good to strive for &#8211; but the every day tasks\/meetings\/lunches\/whatever. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with saying &#8220;no&#8221; more and even admitting you suck at keeping meetings. I learned to do this at the very first <a href=\"http:\/\/financialbloggerconference.com\/\">financial blogger conference<\/a> I attended when I failed to show up at over 50% of my scheduled meetups because of lack of focus, craziness at conferences, and my hatred of stopping in the middle of something I&#8217;m ACTUALLY focused on. The more you can give yourself a realistic environment to thrive in (which for me is a &#8220;go with the flow&#8221; one), the better, and less flaky, you&#8217;ll be in the end. Win-win for everyone!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Okay, I should probably wrap this up there as it&#8217;s already taken me 2 hours to put this together as my mind keeps wondering elsewhere, haha&#8230; not even joking, though I wish I were :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The point is, disorders in general &#8211; whether ADHD or OCD or any others out there &#8211; really do affect our lives.<\/strong> Both financially and in every day living. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t lessen the effects of it and continue on accomplishing our goals like every other &#8220;normal&#8221; person out there! And I put quotes around that because there really is <em>no such thing<\/em> as a normal person, really. We all have our hangups, some are just more noticeable than others.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to share your own with us, we&#8217;d love to hear them and support you :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/jimmybrown\/\">jumpinjimmyjava<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post is for all you LEGIT ADHD&#8217;ers out there, like yours truly ;) Who was diagnosed unofficially 8 years ago with it, and more&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-manage-your-money-adhd-add\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[74,5,105],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-35842","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-advice","category-life","category-money-management"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How to Manage Your Money with ADHD | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-manage-your-money-adhd-add\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How to Manage Your Money with ADHD | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"This post is for all you LEGIT ADHD&#8217;ers out there, like yours truly ;) Who was diagnosed unofficially 8 years ago with it, and more...
