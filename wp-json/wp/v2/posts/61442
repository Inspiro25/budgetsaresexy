Haha&#8230; (probably why it&#8217;s going so good &#8211; the realities haven&#8217;t set in yet ;)).<\/p>\n<p><strong>1 year anniversary of&#8230;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/when-you-find-out-youre-having-another-baby\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turning into a stay-at-home daddy blogger<\/a>! One of my first goals when we found out <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/when-you-find-out-youre-having-another-baby\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my wife was pregnant again<\/a> and I&#8217;m happy to report that everyone is still alive! Most especially my boys! There are days that are a real struggle and those I&#8217;m not proud of, but by and large I feel exceptionally fortunate to be able to watch them grow up each and every day and I&#8217;m slowly remembering what it&#8217;s like to live in &#8220;the real&#8221; world again vs online all the time&#8230; And I&#8217;m hopeful that my kids are enjoying it just the same! (Although I swear, as soon as Mommy comes into the picture she becomes the Queen and all of a sudden no one wants anything to do with me! Haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>1 1\/2 years anniversary of&#8230; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-i-fired-myself-from-rockstar-finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">selling Rockstar Finance<\/a>. Something that allowed me to have this better life\/work balance and enjoy such things as above! So definitely wouldn&#8217;t ever go back and undo this one, though it is sad to see it slowly trickle out\/stop?, now that it&#8217;s on its <a href=\"https:\/\/esimoney.com\/why-i-sold-rockstar-finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3rd owner<\/a>&#8230; I def. miss connecting with all the newer bloggers out there and spreading the love around.

One of the top 5 decisions I&#8217;ve ever made in my life! I can&#8217;t tell you how beneficial this has been for me\/my brain\/stress levels over the months&#8230; It&#8217;s just so nice to have that *cut off* from things when so much of our lives seem to be mushed together by the internet and Go-Go-Go mentality of modern times&#8230; And when you put limits like that into your life it better helps balance things out and you STILL manage to get everything done you need to! Because there&#8217;s no pushing it off until the weekend when it&#8217;s no longer an option!<\/p>\n<p><strong>3 year anniversary of&#8230;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/good-vs-bad-reasons-to-quit-something\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quitting my podcast<\/a>. Which is still rockin&#8217; with Paula at the helm as she heads into episode #200 already! Work it!! But similarly to my feelings with leaving Rockstar, it&#8217;s hard to regret opting out of projects when it frees up so much extra time and opportunity for other things in life. Even if it seems crazy leaving a project that&#8217;s well on its way to success! I did recently hop onto the show just for fun though, and you can check out our reunion again here if you like ;) A helluva lot more fun on this side of the mic than the other, I&#8217;ll tell you that much! <a href=\"https:\/\/affordanything.com\/199-ask-paula-the-three-year-reunion-with-j-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#199: The Three-Year Reunion with J.

Now this change out of all of them so far I get sad about every now and then&#8230; Not that my newer ride is horrible or anything (it&#8217;s one of the most comfortable, and reliable, cars I&#8217;ve ever had!) but I 100% miss my Caddy and wish there was a way I could have saved her :( There was just something about rollin&#8217; around in that beat up ride, windows down and blaring hip-hop music without a care in the world&#8230;. She was great!! And even <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/franken-caddy-car-keeps-making-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">made me money<\/a> at times! Haha&#8230; But such is life&#8230; Perhaps one day I can get a replacement when I&#8217;m no longer playing chauffeur 24\/7 to my kids&#8230;.(&#8220;BUT NOT BEFORE I GET MY MINIVAN!!!!&#8221; &lt;&#8212; Wife)<\/p>\n<p><strong>4 year anniversary of&#8230;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/anniversary-waking-up-early-like-benjamin-franklin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">waking up at 5 a.m.<\/a>! Another move I&#8217;ve made over the years that continues to pay dividends! Still very much waking up early and enjoying it (weekdays only), and definitely helps with the &#8220;getting everything done&#8221; during the week mission too. Though I also like to use part of the mornings to just reflect a little and soak in all the peace while everyone&#8217;s down and sleeping as well &#8211; including the sun :) It&#8217;s one of the only times I get 100% ME time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>4 year anniversary&#8230;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/thoughts-after-cutting-cable\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">of cutting cable!<\/a>! And can&#8217;t even tell you what I&#8217;m missing! Haha&#8230; One of the easiest transitions over the years, and like others wish we had only done it sooner :) We still pay for internet and thus connected to cable companies for life (ugh), but it&#8217;s a helluva lot nicer not having to battle them every 6 months when they jack up those rates! I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve had to call in yet over the past 4 years &#8211; it&#8217;s been magical&#8230; (And we still get lots of shows too using a cheap <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/updates-money-decluttering-cable-reader-submitted-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$16 antenna<\/a> from Target, including all Redskins games &#8211; woo!!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>5 year anniversary of&#8230; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">giving up my iPhone and switching to Republic Wireless<\/a>! And now over $6,000 total saved which is enough to max out a Roth IRA!!! :) So def. still happy with this one, haha&#8230; And not surprisingly, Android phones do pretty much the same thing as iPhones or really any other smart phones for that matter these days&#8230; You can call\/text\/snap photos\/download apps\/get internet and pretty much anything else! So why not keep going and pocketing that free $100 every month?!<\/p>\n<p><strong>7 year anniversary of&#8230;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/cute-baby-j-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">having my first kid<\/a>!

Haha&#8230; Although my wallet doesn&#8217;t appreciate it nearly as much ;) Anyone remember that time I tried <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-much-babies-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tracking every last penny they cost<\/a> back in the day?!<\/p>\n<p><strong>8 1\/2 year anniversary of&#8230;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/i-just-got-fired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">getting fired from my day job and becoming a full-time blogger!<\/a> It&#8217;s hard to remember what life was like back then, but I do succinctly recall that initial excitement and anxiety all rolled into one and not knowing what the outcome would be&#8230; Promised my wife I&#8217;d go back to a 9-5 if I couldn&#8217;t figure out a way to make it work in 3 months, and now here we are almost a decade later! Hasn&#8217;t always been rainbows and sunshine, and I&#8217;m definitely tired of calling the shots on everything that a business requires, but it&#8217;s been an incredible experience so far and will keep going until something more exciting comes along. Even if that&#8217;s a 9-5 again!
