I built out a couple of new projects (All-Star Money, <a href=\"https:\/\/pfswagger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PF Swagger<\/a>), schemed on a few others that remained in my head, and then after a year or so kinda got complacent and couldn&#8217;t find anything to work on that REALLY moved me. Which is typically the problem I have these days &#8211; lots of extra time but nothing worthy enough to spend it on! Until now!<\/p>\n<p><b>Opportunity <\/b>&#8211; This was also a biggie &#8211; finding the *right* company and *right* people and *right* terms to be able to hand over the blog. And the opportunity that The Motley Fool brought with its culture and vision aligned too perfectly to pass up&#8230; I never fully trusted other organizations during talks, and I knew it would be in good hands with them or at least not implode as so many do! And as I mentioned on Monday&#8217;s post, they were indeed great stewards &#x1f44d;<\/p>\n<p><b>Identity <\/b>&#8211; What happens when the ONE MAIN THING everyone knows you from is your blog, and then you\u2019re not there anymore and go away?! Do you fade into oblivion?? Do all your friends and experiences and street cred go out the window?! Of course not! But MAN is it a scary thing to test when you pull the trigger!!! Haha&#8230; I&#8217;ve spent literally more than 1\/4th of my life with this blog so I didn&#8217;t know what would happen or how it would feel once I was away from it all&#8230; Obviously I survived and all was well in the world, but it was a good thing to test and know for sure.<\/p>\n<p><b>Collaboration <\/b>&#8211; After years running projects by yourself, you start missing other people and teams. And the Fool offered me a salaried gig to stay on to consult and help them build out All-Star Money, so I was able to easily transition into something else fun and new, while at the same time being part of a team again and it worked out nicely&#8230; Though I will admit there were a few times where it sucked not being The Boss and being able to make some of the bigger decisions you thought were right ;) But that&#8217;s the trade-off of working with others and being an &#8220;employee&#8221; again! Can&#8217;t have it all!<\/p>\n<p><b>Capitalization<\/b> &#8211; We kinda already hit on this, but I basically wanted to capture ALL the hard work I&#8217;ve spent on the blog over my life, especially as the stats were relatively high at the time in case it crashed later! lol, so selling towards the peak was the ultimate way to capitalize on everything while setting up my family better for the future as well. And since I constantly think about death and the point of life and blah blah blah, it was also nice to be able to take this off the plate of my family in case anything *did* ever happen to me as they&#8217;d have no idea how to keep the blog running or sell it, etc. So selling was basically a nice way to wrap everything up with a pretty red bow on top :)<\/p>\n<p><b>Change<\/b> &#8211; I was also getting burnt out back then, and honestly just tired of talking about myself all the time , haha&#8230; It was time to shake things up!<\/p>\n<p><b>Financials <\/b>&#8211; And then of course there was the $$$&#8230; And while I never did prioritize it over the content and mission of this site, I did do enough to at least make a living off it and get mid 6 figures out of the deal. Which I then turned around and invested, of course, so that the mid 6 would turn into higher 6 one day!! Something I very much considered when I was working through the deal :) &#8220;If I did NOTHING for years my money would double &#8212; orrr\u00a0 &#8212; I can keep blogging 40 hours a week and probably make the same amount of money?&#8221; &#8211; HAH! And as we now know looking back, those 2019-2021 years sure were good to us&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then lastly, selling was the ultimate Minimalist Challenge<\/strong> &#8211; There&#8217;s a lot of things you can get rid of in life and be fine, but letting go of one of the <em>most important<\/em> things to you (at least at one time) is a whole other thing. And I REALLY wanted to see if I could do it! And true to the written word, it was perfectly fine and not nearly as big a deal as it looked peering in. In fact, it even reinforced the idea that you don&#8217;t need to *own* a thing in order to *enjoy* it! When I continued writing for the blog under the new management I experienced just as much joy as if it were mine! And possibly even more since I was getting paid more reliably and didn&#8217;t have to deal with any of the hassles of ownership! Lol&#8230; So definitely proud of myself for this one and glad I got to put it to the test :)<\/p>\n<p>Now onto Round II and seeing what we learn!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65202\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard.jpg\" alt=\"j - half beard\" width=\"460\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard.jpg 1259w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-1024x1022.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-768x766.jpg 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-1060x1057.jpg 1060w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-550x550.jpg 550w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-501x500.jpg 501w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-half-beard-1083x1080.jpg 1083w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s all about me, my money, and some blog background&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Your turn!<\/p>\n<p><b>Share some fun facts about yourself &#8211; where you live, how long you\u2019ve been reading the blog, how you manage your money, what stage of FIRE you\u2019re in &#8211; and whatever else helps us get to know you more!\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Even if we already know you, still share, as so much has changed in the past 14 years and we\u2019re constantly evolving!<\/p>\n<p>And to all new people here I haven\u2019t personally met yet, I hope you\u2019ll stick around and see if you enjoy my style or not :) Some say it\u2019s an acquired taste, but I do like to have as much fun as <a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5am Joel<\/a> does even if I&#8217;m not *as* cheery, haha&#8230; But I will curse more and get feisty, so buyer beware!<\/p>\n<p>Alright, lots of fun things ahead\u2026 See you in the comments &#x1f44a;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64642\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-money-signature.jpg\" alt=\"j. money signature\" width=\"186\" height=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Morning, fam!
