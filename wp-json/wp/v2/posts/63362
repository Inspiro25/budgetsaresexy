As much as I love the holiday season, the tight-ass inside me calls the next 3 months the \u201cexpensive season\u201d where our costs get a little crazy on food, travel and gifts!\u00a0 &#x1f383; &#x1f983; &#x1f384; &#x1f381; &#x1f385;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today I\u2019m sharing my very first ever <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-2-one-little-duck\/\">net worth report<\/a>. Well, kind of &#8230; this is a partial and simplified version, which excludes shared <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/rental-property-vs-stocks-tracking-experiment-continued\/\">rental properties<\/a> and private partnerships. This report is the first of many I\u2019ll publish monthly going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why I\u2019m Sharing Net Worth Tracking With You<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are hundreds, (maybe even thousands?) of bloggers who are <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/is-net-worth-tracking-the-new-budgeting\/\">tracking their assets and net worth<\/a> online. But what\u2019s cool is that everyone does it in a slightly different way. Also everyone shares it publicly for different reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are my reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>To keep encouraging others to track their net worth, too<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In fact, everything I write online is to share processes and methods that have helped me, and hopefully can help others out there increase their financial situation. If you don\u2019t track your net worth &#8211; <\/span><b>start TODAY<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you don\u2019t know how, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">start here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and email me if you have any questions!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>A unique-ish perspective.<\/b> Since my wife and I are pursuing \u201c<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/slow-down-fire-is-not-a-race\/\">Coast FI<\/a>\u201d we are pretty much solely relying on the compounding growth of our existing assets. Even if we don\u2019t add any more contributions, we *hopefully* will still reach our FI number. <b>We\u2019re trying to prove that the slow and boring path to FI is just as good as any other!<\/b> This slow strategy lets us work in jobs we enjoy, even if it means having a 0% or even a negative savings rate for a few years. You will never hear us complain about our jobs, which is rare these days.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>It\u2019s about the process, not the numbers.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s always fun to check out someone\u2019s net worth or assets statement&#8230; But, the true value is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">watching how things change over time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Plans change. Things fail. Life gets in the way. We all approach obstacles and windfalls differently. It\u2019s the tiny decisions we make along our journey that have the biggest impact in the long run. Each monthly report is just a snapshot. But together, over time, they all tell a story.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>Drumroll, Please &#8230;<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s jump into the big-picture numbers, then afterwards delve into the details and whatnot. Here\u2019s a list of our assets (for my wife and me) and their balances as of October 1, 2020:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63371 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net_worth_10_1_2020_jpeg_Iaaib7DL-e1602210322942.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"309\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>Breakdown of Assets<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Checking &amp; Savings Accounts ($38,868):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is the liquid cash across our regular bank accounts, including our personal <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/emergency-funds-are-not-funbut-theyre\/\">emergency fund<\/a>. I know, it\u2019s probably a little too high for what we need going forward. My wife and I are just getting back into regular W2 income after our lengthy sabbatical, so we will reduce this cash balance over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Rental Property, and Reserve Account ($235,931):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The backstory of this duplex <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/yes-you-can-buy-a-rental-property-in-another-state\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is posted here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I recently ordered a Market Comp for the property which confirmed a $220k evaluation. The reason I keep a dedicated reserve account for this rental (and I recommend people do this for all their investment properties) is because I track it separately from my personal income\/expenses. I view each rental property like a self sufficient business &#8211; all of the incoming rent gets paid into the reserve account, and all expenses taken out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>IRA &#8211; Rollover ($118,633):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This account is the combination of a few old employer <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/401k-rollover-ira-why\/\">401k plans rolled over into an IRA<\/a>. The full backstory <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-rollover-ira-account-the-backstory\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is posted here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since my new workplace offers a 401k plan, I won\u2019t be contributing to this specific IRA, and its growth solely depends on the overall stock market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/bye-bye-bonds-hello-roth-iras\/\"><b>IRA &#8211; Roths<\/a> ($61,162):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 We were a little late to the Roth game, starting both our accounts in 2016. Going forward, our plan is to max out our Roth contributions each year, even if we have to pull from other retirement accounts to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joint Brokerage Account ($158,853):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is an after-tax, self managed brokerage account. Since my wife and I will most likely need access to retirement funds before we turn 59\u00bd, this account is a big part of our early withdrawal strategy. Our long term plan is to slowly sell off our real estate holdings and move money into this brokerage account (and our Roths) going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>HSA ($1,677):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Quick update on my <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/health-insurance-worth-it\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthcare situation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026 I\u2019ve enrolled in a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shithouse<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> HDHP plan, but one of the benefits is the ability to invest in a Health Savings Account. Although its purpose is for healthcare expenses only, the tax advantages of an HSA make it an excellent investment vehicle. The max contribution I can make is $3,550 this calendar year, which I\u2019ll be adding shortly when my coverage kicks in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>New 401(k) at work ($0):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was on the fence about contributing to my <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-new-401k-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new workplace 401k plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since my wife and I have almost a 0% saving rate (making just as much as we spend), adding any money into this 401k would put us in a negative cash flow situation each month. But, since our emergency fund and cash position is quite high right now, we feel OK living off of our checking account cash and investing parts of my income. At least for a little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Breakdown of Liabilities<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Rental Property Mortgage (-$122,997):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This balance will slowly decrease over time as principal is applied with each mortgage payment. There are options for refinancing this rental property and borrowing more money, but we need to stabilize our income a bit more so we can qualify for a new loan :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Credit Card Balances (-$304):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Although we pay off our credit cards in full each month, there\u2019s typically a few hundred or maybe a couple thousand dollars in new charges. This balance represents whatever we owe at the time we do a net worth snapshot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I have no other consumer debt. :)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Stuff Not Included in These Monthly Net Worth Reports<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Our Car:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Personally, I don\u2019t consider a car as an \u201casset\u201d because it\u2019s something that takes money <\/span><b>out of our pockets<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> each month, and doesn\u2019t contribute towards growing our wealth. Our Prius (nicknamed \u201cThe White Shite\u201d) is owned outright, so there are no payments or debt attached.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Wife\u2019s CalSTRS Retirement Plan:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The saddest and most frustrating thing about being a teacher is the tiny compensation and absolute ripoff retirement options. The State of California deducts a small portion of my wife\u2019s paycheck (involuntarily) and hides it in a secret, invisible, web of trickery. It\u2019s almost impossible to determine where her contributions are actually being invested, and if she\u2019ll ever get them back one day. Needless to say, this retirement account is about as dependable as Social Security later in life. It\u2019s an asset we hope to one day benefit from, but unfortunately something we can\u2019t control or rely on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Australia SuperAnnuation:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you think the USA has confusing government sponsored retirement plans, you should check out Australia\u2019s weird fee-ridden system! The good news is I have about $25k AUD in a self-managed Super account down there&#8230; The bad news is the account is growing at a rate of about -2% YoY even though it\u2019s invested in the best available index funds. The only way I can access this money is either when I turn 60, or if I renounce my Australian Citizenship. :(\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joint Rentals, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-vs-stocks-a-real-life-look-at-returns\/\">Real Estate<\/a> Partnerships &amp; Reserves:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My long term strategy is to slowly downsize and eventually exit from owning and managing rental real estate. Shifting money from these assets over time into our IRA &amp; Brokerage account will simplify our withdrawal strategy and be way less crap to manage in retirement. I\u2019ll chat more about this real estate stuff over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Goals and Future Milestones<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the short term, like 3-6 months, we\u2019ll slowly add money into the new 401k account. We\u2019ll probably fund the HSA before year end ($3.5k), and then think about maxing our Roths in January ($12k). To do all this, we\u2019ll need to take cash directly from our reserves. I don\u2019t anticipate a huge increase in overall net worth, just a shuffle of money between accounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our longer term goals are still shaping, and much of these depend on market performance, offloading some of our rentals, and possibly increasing our income a bit next year. More to come on all this stuff &#8212; things are a bit wonky right now!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as milestones, looks like we\u2019re in sight of a $500k report pretty soon! J$ hit the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-half-a-million-mark\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half Millie mark back in May 2016<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, then it only took 3 years from him to double it to $1M! &#x1f605; I can\u2019t promise my assets will grow as fast, but it\u2019ll be an interesting journey nonetheless!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are your net worth updates for the end of September?
