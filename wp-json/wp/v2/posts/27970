(And who doesn&#8217;t like free beer tastings at 11 am?)<\/li>\n<li>Went <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/metal-detecting-is-cool-damn-it\/\">metal detecting<\/a> again w\/ my pops &#8211; And broke my winning streak for the first time in 10+ years :(\u00a0 Every year we take turns finding and digging, and almost every single time I come out finding more valuable stuff &#8211; but not this time!\u00a0 My dad more than doubled my 16 cents findings and took the prize ;) That pic up there is everything we came home with this week, haha&#8230; though in our defense we did only go once.<\/li>\n<li>Took dozens of walks along the beaches and other fascinating new places (like an art show!).<\/li>\n<li>And, of course, browsed all the antique and thrift stores we could find ;)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It was a fun-filled trip for sure, and it was nice to have built in baby-sitters with us all week too &#8211; Thanks grandma and grandpa!<\/p>\n<p><strong>My favorite part BY FAR, though, was when we all went around the table and talked about what we accomplished in the last year, and what we hoped to do so in the next one.\u00a0<\/strong> I know most people like creating New Years Resolutions and all that every year &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/12\/time-to-rock-those-new-years-resolutions-again\/\">including myself <\/a>&#8211; but the goals I set during our annual beach trips are always held at a higher level for me.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m much more relaxed and clearer minded at these times, or if it&#8217;s just the rush of the Summer and week-long vacationing that does the trick, but either way the last 2 years have been pretty prophetic (SAT Word!).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2010, I hoped that I&#8217;d be living the good life and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/full-time-blogger-goal\/\">blogging full-time<\/a>.\u00a0 It happened :)<\/li>\n<li>In 2011, I wanted to grow my blogging biz even more and start SAVING MONEY instead of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/05\/is-a-dream-job-worth-it-if-you-cant-save-any-money\/\">breaking even all the time<\/a>. This also happened!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course it didn&#8217;t just come overnight or with a snap of a finger &#8211; there was a lot of planning and hustling going on to reach these major milestones &#8211; but I will attribute a lot of the success to dreaming BIG and always working towards that next goal. And the beauty of these family vacations is that we do them every single year so we always have a solid point in time where we can stop and look back to see how much we&#8217;ve accomplished (or not). Kinda like New Year&#8217;s too I guess?<\/p>\n<p><strong>And this year was no different.<\/strong>\u00a0 We were drinking some beers down by the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk (one of the best kept secrets is the old English pub in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boardwalkplaza.com\/\">Boardwalk Plaza Hotel<\/a> btw) and when it was my turn to spill the beans, I thought long and hard and came up with the following list:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I want to have Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy pregnant again.<\/strong> Something *not* on her list quite yet, haha&#8230; but I think that will change once she gets some decent sleep ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I want to ONLY be working on BudgetsAreSexy and 1 other project<\/strong> &#8211; no more half- completed ideas all over the place (or even finished ones for that matter) taking up all the space in my head. It&#8217;s time to focus on as much of the stuff I LOVE as possible.<\/li>\n<li type=\"_moz\"><strong>And I want to move to a new area.\u00a0<\/strong> Preferably out of state, but I&#8217;ll take any change at this point. My A.D.D. has finally gotten the best of me after living in the same house for more than 5 years now. Something I&#8217;m not used to having grown up in a military household!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Two of those things are already in the works (not #1 cuz I guess you have to wait 6 weeks until you can start having sex again? Pshhh&#8230;), but they&#8217;re not gonna be easy to pull off. For one, I suck at giving up and\/or handing stuff off (which is why I end up working on so many things at a time!), and the moving part got put on hold after <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/07\/cute-baby-j-money\/\">baby #1<\/a> came into the picture. With enough time and patience though, they&#8217;re all certainly do-able. Just a matter of prioritizing and taking the baby steps, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think that&#8217;s the key to everything we talk about here Coming up with a goal and then taking all those tiny steps to achieve it.<\/strong>\u00a0 Some take years to accomplish like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/mortgage-payoff-plan\/\">paying off your mortgage<\/a> or getting rid of your student loan debts\/etc, while others can be squashed much faster with a little research and ingenuity.\u00a0 What matters most though is that you&#8217;re WORKING towards them.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the baby steps I&#8217;ll be taking to accomplish these three new goals of mine by next year:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>RE: Getting Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy pregnant<\/strong> &#8211; Well, you know how we make one of those ;) But in all seriousness, we def need to be on the same page with this one and make sure we&#8217;re BOTH happy with our finances and living situation\/etc if we want to plug away at it again so quickly.\u00a0 So step #1 is to talk more seriously about it once things calm down over here in the Money household over the next few months, and then #2 would be to start trying if we do end up going for it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>RE: Only working on 2 projects total<\/strong> &#8211; This one will require a LOT more work since my responsibilities are much higher with these guys, as well as my future cash flow for that matter (or the possibility of it with some of the projects), but I do think it&#8217;s possible if I sit down and sketch it out the right way. I just have to figure out *what* that right way is since at this given point in time I am the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/now-living-off-one-paycheck\/\">sole provider of our entire household<\/a>. I can&#8217;t be nixing stuff willy nilly just because I want my perfect world! There&#8217;s things you have to do that are annoying, even with your dream job ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>RE: Moving<\/strong> &#8211; The easiest, but trickiest, of all my goals. Physically it&#8217;s pretty simple &#8211; you just pack up your stuff and head out to your new home! But rationally\/emotionally\/lifestyle&#8217;y, it&#8217;s a whole other ballgame.\u00a0 WHERE do we move? How far can we go away from friends\/family now that a baby&#8217;s in the picture? What will the wife end up wanting to do? A ton of variables that we won&#8217;t know the answers to until mid-Winter comes along (The Mrs. will be starting and ending a fellowship by then, and then we&#8217;re 100% free to move anywhere in the world we want, all depending on her next move in the career department). Our next steps here, though, are as follows: 1) Make a list of 3 places we really think would be cool to live. 2) Go visit them on long weekends and pretend house-shop (or house-rent, which we&#8217;d first do starting out). And then 3) Have the Mrs. apply to any and all jobs she finds interesting no matter where it&#8217;s located.\u00a0 This would solve the problem of *where* if she decides she does in fact want a 9-5 again.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Lots of unknowns with all of these, but I&#8217;m feeling hopeful! And can&#8217;t wait to hit up next year&#8217;s family vacay to go over all our progress and see where others in our family have grown too :) Some of theirs on the list was: Make a million dollars of revenue with a new biz, find a steady girlfriend, stay at home creating art and raising their kids, and then advancing one more notch on the corporate ladder.\u00a0 All great goals to shoot for, and I wish them the best!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How about you guys?
