Interesting question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the day, my wallet was the most important thing I carried around. I still remember my first wallet, one of those waterproof tri-fold velcro ones that carried my student ID and some train tickets. (Maybe also a few cut-out pictures in there from skateboard magazines &#8212; you know, the important stuff).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that was before everyone had cellphones. These days, my wallet is probably the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">least<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> valuable thing I carry. Since the invention of Venmo, virtual insurance cards, virtual coupons, and \u201cthe cloud,\u201d I don\u2019t carry too much important stuff on me physically. It\u2019s all on my phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interesting question, though \u2026 what hurts more &#8212; losing your wallet, your phone, or your keys?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the question comes down to how hard it would be to replace each one. Let\u2019s look at the time, effort, and money it would take &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Losing My Wallet<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/whats-in-your-wallet-purs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Things in my wallet<\/a> right now:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Drivers license: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dang, losing this would suck the most. Just the thought of lining up at the DMV in Santa Monica makes me cringe. Even with a scheduled appointment, I\u2019ve waited in line there for two hours. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mic.com\/articles\/182203\/what-to-do-if-you-lose-your-id\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ID card replacement<\/a> would be a small fee, maybe $25, I\u2019m guessing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>1 x debit card: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty easy to replace. A 10-15 minute phone call to the bank and I\u2019d have a new one in the mail in three days. No cost to me.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>3 x credit cards: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not hard to replace. It\u2019s more a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/make-list-of-where-all-your-credit-cards-are-listed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pain in the butt to change the CC *numbers*<\/a> because my bills are auto-deducted on my main credit card. This is probably an hour or so of work. No cost to me.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>$139 in cash: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oops, I didn\u2019t realize I had so much on me at the moment! I usually keep about $60 in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/3-things-you-should-always-keep-in-your\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash on hand<\/a> &#8212; mostly for garage sales and quick Craigslist buys :)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The wallet itself:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019d say this would cost about $20 to replace and maybe 20-30 mins to search for a replacement. The one I have now I got eight years ago from a Kickstarter campaign &#8212; they promised it would last 10 years, and I think it will!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Losing My Cellphone<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now I\u2019m rocking an iPhone 6s Plus. Got this one about two years ago from a friend who upgraded to a new model. It was supposed to be a loaner, but I never got a new one and my friend never asked for this one back! Ooops &#x1f60a;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I don\u2019t have phone insurance or anything, I\u2019d be up for the cost of a replacement:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New iPhone would be prob $400 to $600 depending on the model. The latest and fanciest versions don\u2019t really interest me, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go with one of those payment-plans or lock-in contracts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondhand, I\u2019d probably fork out $100-$150 for someone\u2019s old phone that still works. Could grab one online somewhere or ask friends if they have an old one lying around.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My last data back-up was a few weeks ago, but most of my apps and stuff keep data in the cloud so I wouldn\u2019t lose any valuable information. For time to replace, I\u2019d say it would probably take three to four hours to get a new phone, program it all the way I like it, and get used to the new operating system. Grrr&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Losing My Keys<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an interesting one. Back in the day, keys to my crappy cars were just metal cut-outs. I kept a spare one duct-taped under the wheel hub! But now I drive a Pruis, which needs an electric wireless key. Key replacement options look like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get a *new* key from a Toyota dealer: Wow! Seems to be around $500 to buy and program a new key! I didn\u2019t realize my Prius was such a rare, luxury vehicle.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buy a replica FOB key online ($100 to $150) and get it programmed somehow by a local car repair place ($100 to $150). Still hurts!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other factor here is *where* I am when I lose my keys. If I\u2019m stuck in a random parking lot and need to get my car towed home, I\u2019d be up for tow costs too! Probably $100 there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>All in all, here\u2019s my replacement time and costs:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Lost wallet: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4-5 hours of work and about $180 to replace what\u2019s in it<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Lost phone: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3-4 hours of work and $100 to $600<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Lost keys: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3-4 hours work and about $300 to $400 for a DIY replacement and car tow<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Losing ALL three things: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10+ hours and $480+ minimum to replace all three. Ouch!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I guess that answers the original question (for me at least!): <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would you rather lose\u2026 your phone, your wallet, or your car keys?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, the least expensive thing for me to lose would be my iPhone. Funny, because I would consider it my most valuable and most used item of the three. Weird!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about you? What would you rather lose if you had the choice?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hmmm. Interesting question.
