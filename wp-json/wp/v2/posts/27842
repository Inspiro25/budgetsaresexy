I understand people\u2019s concerns and fears about investing. Truthfully, it\u2019s only natural to be fearful of things you don\u2019t understand. Warren Buffet\u2019s infamous quote <em>&#8220;Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful&#8221;<\/em> is, basically, the foundation to investing.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the concerns I hear:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cInvesting is like gambling.\u201d (Gambling carries more risk)<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI would rather invest in real estate.\u201d (You can, they are called REITs and real estate funds. But you can still lose money investing in property, too)<\/li>\n<li>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s the right time to invest.\u201d (No offense, but there\u2019s no golden opportunity)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>My response to above concerns and anyone else\u2019s concerns about investing is to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Keep It Simple and Stupid<\/span>.<\/strong>\u00a0 And I\u2019m not the only one who feels that way. Investing is a long-term approach. The long-term approach means that you have time to allow your money to compound and weather the ups-n-downs of the market.<\/p>\n<p>In a weird way, you can take advantage of both the <em>upside<\/em> and <em>downside<\/em> of the market. The truth is volatility is necessary for your investments to grow. You definitely don\u2019t want to buy high and sell low, that&#8217;s for sure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All too often, financial analysts spew tons of information in our direction and our minds are overloaded. Facts and important figures become obscure.<\/strong> The media drills in to our heads the slash backs, cuts backs, and bad news that are detrimental to good-will, and subsequently have a negative impact on the value of our investments. In many cases, information of that kind isn\u2019t necessarily relevant. And I\u2019m sure we can recall a time when analysts have been incorrect.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve had people say to me you should sell your losing stocks or investments. This is where you should get a financial professional involved to make sure the decision you make is appropriate for your financial circumstances. My point of today\u2019s post is not to provide with all the answers to investing, rather to keep it as simple and as stupid as possible. If later on you want to delve into higher levels of investing, go right ahead.\u00a0 But, I feel, it\u2019s best if you can KISS it for now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do we know already about investing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can\u2019t time the market.<\/strong> You have to recognize there are things that are just out of your control, such as what will the markets do next.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You have to mix up your assets.<\/strong> Have some equities, bonds, and cash. The more time you have to invest (10+ years) the more equities (aka stocks) you can hold in your investments.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Diversify is a must.<\/strong> Diverse your investments among different sectors, like technology, retail, real estate, beverage industry, foreign markets, energy companies, etc. Diversification helps to minimize risk, but you already knew that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rebalance your investment portfolio.<\/strong> By periodically rebalancing, no more than once a year, you can reduce your exposure to risk relative to your target asset allocation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now that we already know what we know about investing, here are some tips to help you keep investing <em><strong>simply and stupidly<\/strong><\/em> as possible:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consider what you already know about investing.<\/strong> (Hint: it\u2019s the four bullet point right above)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Start with index funds.<\/strong> Because I\u2019m a licensed investment advisor I have a choke-hold around my neck from saying the name of any index fund. What I CAN say, though, is that index funds are a great starting point because they are really low-cost. Choose an index fund(s) that has a low expense ratio less than .5%. I\u2019ve even seen less than .1%!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Strategize:<\/strong> Know your target asset allocation mix. Rebalancing is very important because it will help you stay aligned with your target asset allocation. It will help you sleep better at night, too!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Know why you pick that investment.<\/strong> Write out a few short sentences of your reasons for buying into a particular investment. Maybe something like, \u201cI am investing in this {insert name of investment) because the expense ratio is low, research has shown most actively managed mutual funds fail to beat the passive index funds, blah blah blah.\u201d Then, review your choices periodically and be mindful of your basic reasoning for it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Turn away from the negative media<\/strong>. I think it\u2019s safe for me to say you know what happens if you listen to too much negativity. It will lead you to making emotional and irrational decisions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Keep investing as simple and as stupid as possible. Then move on with your life!<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>How do you balance investing in your life?<\/em><\/strong><em> Do you allow it to consume you?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Ornella Grosz<\/strong>, CFEd\u00ae is a financial expert, keynote speaker, author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0984575111\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0984575111&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20\">Moneylicious: A Financial Clue for Generation Y<\/a>, and member of the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) Financial Literacy Curriculum Advisory Board.
