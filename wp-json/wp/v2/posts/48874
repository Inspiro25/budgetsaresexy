It just doesn\u2019t excite me anymore in the same manner that it did when I started out.

If you\u2019re absolutely sure that it is time to part ways with your employer (J$: and remember, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/04\/job-is-means-to-end\/\" target=\"_blank\">sometimes a job is just a job<\/a>!), follow these 10 simple tips for a smooth breakup with your boss:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Think carefully before you act<\/strong>. Chances are high that this decision is irreversible. If your issues with your boss are your primary motivation for leaving, consider seeking a transfer to a different department.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Craft a short, dated resignation letter<\/strong>. Be sure the letter indicates your intended resignation date and plans for passing along key projects to other colleagues. Thank your boss for their investment in you, even if you don\u2019t mean it. Deliver the letter in person, and prepare what you intend to say when delivering the letter. Keep it short and sweet.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t burn any bridges<\/strong>. Talking badly about your boss, colleagues, or the company in general may provide short-term vindication, but it is unprofessional. Remember, your emotions are temporary, but your reputation is eternal.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Read your employment contract to be sure you aren\u2019t missing anything<\/strong>. Recently, I resigned from my job as a school administrator and petitioned the school board to return to a teaching position. Because I had a superior employment record as a teacher and had earned tenure, my return to a teaching position was guaranteed. However, I had to continue in my position for nearly four months due to my contract structure.I have heard of countless horror stories of employees who resigned in anger right before bonuses were to be paid out. Again, be sure you know how much time you will have in your position after announcing your intent to resign. Two weeks is standard, but some employers will hand out a box and give you an hour to clean out your office.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Do your best to secure new employment before resigning.<\/strong> Depending upon your industry, this one may be tough, but it is the best move, financially-speaking. (J$: Another great reason <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">to start hustles<\/a> on the side! Never know which can turn into full-time gigs down the road, or at the very least make the transition easier&#8230; It also helps <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\" target=\"_blank\">when you get fired<\/a> too (like when your boss catches you reading this at work ;)).)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>If at all possible, engineer your layoff rather than quitting<\/strong>. A severance package never hurt anyone! (J$: Sam from FinancialSamurai.com has a GREAT ebook on this if anyone&#8217;s interested: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/engineer-layoff-book\">How To Engineer Your Layoff<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Ensure that you don\u2019t allow any gaps in insurance coverage during your transition<\/strong>. If you allow your medical insurance to lapse, you will break your leg playing hoops with your boys at the park. And then you\u2019ll be headed toward bankruptcy. Not good.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Examine your 401k\/403b and other retirement benefits and plan to roll them over as soon as you leave<\/strong>. Don\u2019t fall for the temptation to cash out your plan. The tax hit will hurt, and you\u2019ll lose out on the power of time and compound interest.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>Make the most of your last few days and weeks on the job<\/strong>. Be sure you finish any lingering projects. Make sure you collect any valuable contacts and files to bring with you to your next position, assuming your current employer does not prohibit this action. Don\u2019t steal anything on the way out. If it\u2019s not yours, don\u2019t take it with you. Period. Gather your personal belongings, say your goodbyes, and hit the road.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>Celebrate, baby!<\/strong> Enjoy a nice meal and pop a bottle of champagne. You\u2019ve escaped a soul-sucking job and are moving on to new and exciting times!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em><strong>How have you quit a job in the past? Any epic stories like the ones above? What other advice do you have for someone contemplating resignation?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: I&#8217;m too much of a wussy to ever quit in such fashionable form (and I know how damaging it could be so I never would!), but I <em>have<\/em> gotten creative in the &#8220;getting hired&#8221; department :) I once sent out notices a la James Bond to some of the biggest Ad agencies when looking for a design internship (think &#8220;your mission if you choose to accept it&#8221; and &#8220;this notice will self-destruct in 24 hours and my offer will be rescinded&#8221;) and it worked well to get their attention, but then I dropped the ball in the end &#8211; oops. One of the CEOs wrote back &#8220;you have 4 hours to give me a call and the job is yours&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t see it until the next day when it was too late :( Still, it pays to get creative when trying to stand out from everyone!
