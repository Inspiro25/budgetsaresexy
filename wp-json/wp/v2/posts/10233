If all you get out of this post today is to ask for stuff more often, I will consider my work done here :) It really does work &#8211; I promise. As long as you continue to WORK hard and really kill it too &#8211; it&#8217;s not just gonna &#8220;happen&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/04\/the-secret-is-not-my-friend\/\">a la Secret<\/a>, that&#8217;s for sure.<\/p>\n<p>I know I talk about it all the time cuz it&#8217;s dear to my heart, but let me give you a quick example about how it&#8217;s made such an impact w\/ Love Drop.\u00a0 For all that don&#8217;t know, L.D. is our <a href=\"http:\/\/lovedrop.us\">pay it forward project<\/a> where we choose a family to help every month and then surprise them with a ton of gifts &amp; money &amp; just overall support from our online communities.\u00a0 Sometimes we give out whatever we end up bringing in at the end of the month, and others we shoot for something pretty high in hopes of pulling it off and REALLY making an impact in their lives.\u00a0 And that&#8217;s where this power of asking comes in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Last month, we asked for a car for our family. <\/strong>A freakin&#8217; CAR :) They were struggling to get around their daily lives without owning one, and though we knew it was a HUGE task we decided to just go for it.\u00a0 After all, if you don&#8217;t tell people what you want (or need?) how are they supposed to know, right?? Sometimes you just have to put it out there and hope for the best.\u00a0 And that we did. On May 1st we put it up on our site, and on May 16th &#8211; just 2 weeks later &#8211; we got a note from an incredible family ready to give us their car :)\u00a0 And not just any ordinary car, but a Ford Mustang convertible!!! I don&#8217;t know how the stars aligned like they did, but I know we&#8217;d have never received it had we never thrown it out there in the first place. It turned out perfectly for the donators who were packing up and heading across the country for a year in their RV, and it was even better for the family who really needed it and who died with happiness <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovedrop.us\/stalnaker\/episode-5-the-stalnaker-love-drop\">when we gave it to them<\/a> :)<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying all this to pat ourselves on the back or to show how easy it is to get stuff just by asking for it &#8211; no way, <strong>you have to WORK TOWARD it at the same time for things to really come together properly<\/strong>, BUT&#8230; and this is a very important *but* here, you DO have to say exactly what you&#8217;re striving for sometimes in order for it to happen!\u00a0 Whether that&#8217;s out loud, on a blog, on a status update, wherever.\u00a0 If you don&#8217;t ASK for the things you truly want (or need), there&#8217;s a good chance you may never get it. And this applies to ALLLL aspects of your life as well, not just charity projects and the like.<\/p>\n<p>Here are 3 4 areas off the top of my head where this could really prove successful:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Asking for a raise!<\/strong> You think your boss is just gonna come up to you and give you one out of the blue?\u00a0 Hah! It&#8217;s been known to happen, but better odds with setting the stage and then ASKING for it when the timing&#8217;s right.\u00a0 Or hell, even when it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 If you&#8217;re one of those people who wait foreverrrrr just for that *perfect* time, I&#8217;ve got bad news for you I&#8217;m afraid &#8211; it usually never comes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Asking for personal help.<\/strong> Do you know how easy it is to shoot an email or IM or tweet\/etc to your friends if there&#8217;s something you really need?\u00a0 Or are curious about? It&#8217;s amazing the people out there who would gladly take the time to help you out and point you in the right direction.\u00a0 They care for you, let them help you if you&#8217;re in need!\u00a0 (And if you have questions about money\/blogging\/whatever you want, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\/\">ping me<\/a> as well!\u00a0 Some things I can answer in literally 2.3 seconds and would love to help you out :) Or forward you to the right person if I&#8217;m not your man.\u00a0 Not a problem at all.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Asking that person out on a date!!!<\/strong> My favorite &#8220;ask&#8221; &#8211; haha&#8230; but man, if only people DID THIS when opportunities arose!\u00a0 I swear, it&#8217;s amazing the number of times you&#8217;ll surprise yourself with that one. From the start you already have 50\/50 odds! :)<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Thought of another one &#8211;&gt;<\/span> <strong>Ask to lower your interest rate!!<\/strong> &#8211; It can literally take 5 mins and save you HUNDREDS of dollars over time!  Or even *every* month depending on how much debt you have and how high your % is.  I&#8217;ve seen people drop from 17% down to 10% on thousands of dollars of credit card debt.  That is HUGE for a 5 min phone call!  And if they say No at first, ask to speak to a manager and your odds will get even better!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I can go on and on and on here, but it all comes down to the same principal: <strong>Ask for what you want<\/strong>.\u00a0 The more times you put yourself out there, the more chances you&#8217;ll have at achieving your goals &#8211; whatever they might be.\u00a0 You&#8217;ll still have to work for it, and you&#8217;ll still get turned down  every now and again, but at least you&#8217;re putting things into motion and actually going for it. And that&#8217;s more than I can say for a lot of people. So don&#8217;t be afraid to reach for the stars! Good stuff does happen! :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><strong>PS:<\/strong> Special shout out to the Liberated Life Project who blogged about Love Drop which prompted Britt and family to LEARN about our project in the first place!
