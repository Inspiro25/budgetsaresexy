And then you could form <span class=\"il\">guilds<\/span> that could be applicable to your real-life area, so you could meet offline as well as on.<\/p>\n<p>And it would be great to tackle some of the big things together. Like if the &#8216;monster&#8217; was &#8216;Increase income by $2,000\/month&#8217; and anyone who wanted to battle that monster could team up and swap ideas and help each other out until everyone in their guild had defeated that goal.

If so, I try to experience it if the opportunity presents itself. If not, I don&#8217;t. Either way, I don&#8217;t want fear to rule my life. So I actively try to face and conquer them. :)<\/p>\n<p>Everyone I&#8217;ve shared the idea with has really seemed to like the idea, so I&#8217;ve thought it could make a good book and\/or blog content someday. It was first the subject of a speech I gave at my local Toastmasters group that I think I just called: Item 29 on my Anti-Bucket List. :D<\/p>\n<p>That got people&#8217;s attention!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Leah (again)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>[I told her she needs to get that blog up and going as she&#8217;s always coming up with fun ideas!!

At the end of each month, I calculate the total and find the percentage of the planned, relational, bucket list items. I aim for 90% value spending.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been slacking on this the past couple months and there has been quite a bit more sporadic, thoughtless spending, so I plan to refocus and make sure I\u2019m considering the value of any extra spending I do before handing over the cash.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/financiallyfitkid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Financially Fit Mom<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mortgage Time Travel!<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I\u2019ve got a sexy idea: Mortgage Time Travel!

Such a good challenge!]<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Morning &#8211; Crazy, crazy thing I did.<\/p>\n<p>I teach part time as an adjunct professor to MBA students.\u00a0 They have a ton of student loans and many have credit card debt. In thinking of ways to pay them off (of which I have explored many), I looked at those &#8220;checks&#8221; that come in the mail from the credit card companies &#8211; wherein you pay 1%, 2%, or 3% for use of credit line for 12, 16, 18 or even 24 months.<\/p>\n<p>I was curious the impact to FICO score so I thought, let me try it out. I don&#8217;t have any credit card debt, so I just used the money to pay down the principal on my mortgage.\u00a0 It was tens of thousands that I took because the first two borrowings didn&#8217;t impact my credit score.\u00a0 So, my score went down from 802 to 733.\u00a0 I paid back the loans (early) by working it into my cash flow (I have rental income).<\/p>\n<p>So, now my credit score went back up to 807, but then a crazier thing happened &#8211; I started to question how it was that I managed to work that kind of payment into my cash flow.\u00a0 Bottom line, I realized how many things I was purchasing &#8211; I have two kids &#8211; that were wants, not needs.\u00a0 It was a serious wake up call.\u00a0 So, now I&#8217;ve spent the last couple of months with a new experiment &#8211; living paycheck to paycheck &#8211; meaning, I put the majority of my paycheck and other cash flow into a separate account and only enough to cover the &#8220;needs&#8221; &#8211; groceries, gas and wellness (martial arts, ballet, tumbling, haircuts, etc).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve even managed to induce a level of stress that is consistent with what my students tell me they experience when they cannot pay bills or there is an &#8220;emergency&#8221; &#8211; car repairs, etc.\u00a0 Needless to say, it&#8217;s been a life lesson that reminded me why I have the goals I do and how much better I will feel with building my net worth beyond the $1M it is today.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Best Regards,<br \/>\n&#8211; Prof Ackerman<\/p>\n<p>PS: I attached a picture of the 12 month FICO score trend.

Before I start any business or project I always ask myself\u2026 &#8220;What\u2019s the absolute worst case scenario &amp; and can I live with that?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In terms of rental properties it would be like if all of my tenants stopped paying rent, vacated the premises after causing major damage, and then I lost my day job AND we happenend to land in a market recession &#8211; all at the same time. That&#8217;s a pretty awful situation to find myself in. It would basically mean I lose everything!<\/p>\n<p>Could I handle that, though? My answer is YES. Why, because in the end it\u2019s only money. I still have my health, my relationships with family and friends, and all the experience I\u2019d gained up to that point. I could do it all again in a shorter period of time, and more efficiently I\u2019m certain. What&#8217;s the difference between giving 1 set of keys back to the bank or 10?<\/p>\n<p>Also, the likelihood of any of this happening is very low. While on the other hand from a risk vs. reward standpoint, if it pays off in 8 years from now I\u2019ll have $3M+ in property paid off and $15,000+\/mth in positive cash flow.

Not at birthday or holiday and not even in person where both people have the potential of awkwardness. Perhaps dropping off a bottle of wine (practical) with a note of gratitude for ongoing friendship (touchy feely crap people love but not wasting money) on a doorstep. Sometimes when I find that \u201cthis is oh so perfect\u201d I will even wrap it up like a birthday\/Christmas gift, especially if I know the person enjoys receiving gifts, no matter what time of the year it is to make it feel a little more special.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/financiallyfitkid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Financially Fit Mom<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Something I learned from by BFF is that if you find a product you really like to use (in her case it\u2019s a hard case credit card holder \u2013 inexpensive and practical), more than likely your friends will like it too. So, when she is out and about and comes across something she likes, she will buy 4 or 5 of them. Then during random times or special occasions she will give a small \u201cgirlfriend gift\u201d as she likes to call it. It\u2019s such a welcome surprise.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Cindy<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Origami money is always a &#8216;oh my gosh! how did you do that?&#8217; sort of gift.

We get catalogs and a few magazines. We both go through them and dog ear a page on something we like. Not as a gift indicator, just something that caught our eye. Sort of if I have a few bucks, I might get this.<\/p>\n<p>My wife has a thing about llamas so I surprised her with a llama doormat. An example of a catalog we like (but rarely get anything from it due to becoming more minimalist) is AWE \u2013 At West End. We both usually dog ear a page or two. I will retrieve the catalog and either tear out a page or go to website and bookmark the item for future reference.<\/p>\n<p>I would guess you two probably don\u2019t get many catalogs with the hope of minimizing temptation, but this approach could work on pretty much any catalog even if it is unilateral. Pilfer the catalog she might have marked before disposing of it.

Like, I\u2019ll be asking those close to me what they want for Christmas around this time of year, hoping they\u2019ll forget I asked them when December rolls around.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Blair<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have a simple principle that I can share with you! Go for the smile!<\/p>\n<p>I had an old Christmas card that I saved for years that had a little mouse on the front with its nose pressed against the glass of a snow globe with a snowman in it and a huge grin on its face. The sentiment was, &#8220;May your Christmas be bright with surprise and delight!&#8221; So, I like to start at the end &#8211; what do you want their face to look like when they open the present?<\/p>\n<p>If you are walking around looking in stores (or online) and saying, &#8220;What can I get ____? What can I get them? What?&#8221; then you are overtaxing your thought process, which is work. And it is hard to hold that focus long enough to come up with the answer. Or you are waiting for the universe to magically pop up the perfect present for you to stumble on.<\/p>\n<p>The What Can I Get question is asked in the rational part of your brain, but what you really want is happiness for the other person (or at least a feeling of warmth and friendship if not actual delight) and happiness lives in the feeling part of your brain.<\/p>\n<p>So start with <em>the feeling<\/em> and that should take you to every other time that you saw that look of happiness on your giftee&#8217;s face, which starts a chain of happy associations that not only tell you a lot about what that person likes, but probably the general direction to go to stumble on something. Did your friend smile when talking about going to a Comic Con? Stumble around your local comic shop for a while. Does your friend&#8217;s face glow when they talk about their cat? Stumble around a pet shop.<\/p>\n<p>Following the feeling is more fun than wracking your brain, so you will do it for longer. So, to sum up, my advice is: Follow the feeling, chase the smile, and have fun!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Jane<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p>Hope you found something helpful here :)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Let me know which you liked the most or were just plain ridiculous!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>(And if you have any good ones you&#8217;ve been testing out lately too&#8230;.
