After brief convo&#8217;s last month I assumed she had about $2k in her &#8220;do as i please&#8221; account. But nope, there was almost $9k!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Crazy impressive considering she&#8217;s in <\/span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/12\/how-were-putting-mrs-through-grad.html\">Grad School<\/a><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> and not making much from her Teaching Assistantship.<\/span> Plus, she got it past her frugal husband! haha&#8230;good for her. Maybe next month I&#8217;ll find another stash somewhere? I def. won&#8217;t be complaining, that&#8217;s for sure ;)<\/p>\n<p>So that was the biggest &#8220;gain&#8221; of cash for the month, followed by our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/02\/ohhh-how-i-love-me-some-taxes-just-got.html\">$6k back from taxes<\/a> &#8211; of which most was split between the two of us. And what did I do with part of mine? Oh, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">I PAID OFF MY CAR LOANS<\/span>!!! Aww yeahhhhhh, ZERO dollars on the ol&#8217; credit card now ;) It was pretty hard parting with $1,300 all at once like that, but the feeling from being back outta debt is freakin&#8217; awesome. Now just gotta work on those damn mortgages&#8230;<span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 180%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Here&#8217;s how Feb&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours\/\">Net Worth<\/a> breaks down:<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<strong><u><span style=\"color: #000000;\">CASH SAVINGS<\/span><\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #006600;\">+$12,300<\/span>): So yeah&#8230;.as I mentioned the Mrs. had even *more* money saved up that i missed on my last checkup &#8211; a whopping $6,500 more! Add that with a good portion of our $6k from taxes and some better budgeting last month, and it was a helluva good month. Most of this was a one-time occurrence, but I&#8217;m hoping we can at least increase our cash reserves by $1k every month.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u><span style=\"color: #000000;\">EMERGENCY FUND<\/span><\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">$0<\/span>): Our $10k is still socked away in a Money Market just chillin&#8217; and makin&#8217; a little money on the side. It would be cool to see just how much extra it&#8217;s bringing in every month, but we have some other money mixed in with it at the same time so it&#8217;s a bit tricky to calculate. We&#8217;ll be leaving this at $10k for quite some time as it&#8217;s a great # for us.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ROTH IRAs<\/span><\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #990000;\">-$270<\/span>): That would be MY part of it too since my Roth is invested in one of those Target Mutual Funds&#8230;pretty sucky over all, but I&#8217;m not allowed to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/03\/complaining-will-now-cost-this-blogger.html\">complain<\/a> about it ;) I would like to note, however, that my Roth is hovering @ $2800 down from $5400 a year ago&#8230;but that&#8217;s all i&#8217;ll say.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u><span style=\"color: #000000;\">401(k)s<\/span><\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #990000;\">-$3,400<\/span>): Yikesy Mama! Just keeps on a crashin&#8217; without a care in the world. Sadly, this even includes my $1,250 worth of new 401k $ that got sucked out before it had a chance to play with the others. Although I am still waiting for some deposits that still haven&#8217;t been made&#8230; ho-hum.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>SAVINGS BONDS<\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #006600;\">+$3<\/span>): Every month brings a little joy into my life :) Haven&#8217;t added anyting here for almost a year now, but you can check out the breakdown of them all <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/investing\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>AUTOS WORTH (kbb)<\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #006600;\">+$400<\/span>)<strong>:<\/strong> Now THIS, I cannot explain. The only thing i can think of is that I calculated the Mrs&#8217;s Toyota wrong on Kbb.com last month, but I&#8217;m usually pretty good about that stuff. Maybe gas-sippers are going up now? Guess we&#8217;ll see what the next month brings&#8230;The breakdown of our car values are as follows:<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&#8211; Pimpin&#8217; a$$ caddy<\/span> &#8211;&gt; $3,595. Holding this value for at least 6 months now!<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&#8211; Toyota Gas-Sipper<\/span> &#8211;&gt; $11,010. An increase of $400 in &#8220;weirdo&#8221; dollars.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>HOME VALUE (Realtor)<\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #990000;\">-$3,500<\/span>)<u><\/u><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">: <\/span>After some more thought, I decided to ditch the idea of averaging out Zillow&#8217;s &#8220;Zestimate&#8221; with my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/02\/its-official-our-house-is-upside-down.html\">realtor&#8217;s estimate<\/a>. This made sense for two reasons. 1) &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/zillow.com\/\">Zillow<\/a>&#8216;s estimate kept fluctuating every other day! It would be $306k one second, and $318k the next (it&#8217;s currently @ <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">$324k<\/span>!). While I&#8217;d LOVE to believe this, it just doesn&#8217;t seem all that plausible. And 2)I took the advice of a commenter and checked out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/\">redfin.com<\/a> which averages out 3 different home sites to give you a better idea of how sites value the homes. And out of these 3, Zillow was by far the highest, with the total average coming to just below $300k.<\/p>\n<p>Sooo, for now I think it&#8217;s wise to keep the value at $300k and hope for the best. I&#8217;ll then hit my realtor up again later and get a better update since I know he&#8217;ll continue to give it to me straight. Afer all, he&#8217;d be the one to help us sell\/rent out the place so it&#8217;s in his best interest to be upfront from the beginning.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>CREDIT CARD (car loans)<\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #006600;\">-$1,600<\/span>)<u><\/u>: <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ZEROOO!!!!<\/span> Yup, the cards are finally paid off after 8 whole months of chipping away :) The last time it was at zero was back in August when we paid off all <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/our-store-credit-cards-are-back\">3 store credit cards<\/a>. A post will be coming out shortly on this, but this $7,500 basically came from picking up my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/07\/i-just-bought-caddy-and-i-slapped-it-on.html\">Caddy<\/a> and selling my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/08\/i-did-it-i-sold-elusive-suv-in-todays.html\">Highlander<\/a> (i owed more than i sold it for) last year. It was more of a &#8220;loan&#8221; rather than your ordinary consumer debt, but I just happened to use a credit card to finance it all.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>MORTGAGES<\/u><\/strong> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #006600;\">-$14.22<\/span>)<u><\/u>: This was due to just random timing of me checking the accounts &#8211; we didn&#8217;t pay anything extra against any of our mortgages this month. Our 1st is still @ $288,000 (30 year fixed, interest-only @ 6.875%), and our 2nd Mortgage @ around $62,800 (maxed out HELOC w\/ 2.8% interest). I do see us starting to pay them off though now that our budget is looking sexy again :)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">That wraps it up for the sexy month of February.<\/span><\/span> March should pan out pretty well too if all goes as planned (and if the market perks up on everyone&#8217;s behalf). I&#8217;m looking forward to having a few extra hundred now that i don&#8217;t have that $443 monthly car payment anymore! Oh and as promised, I updated <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/02\/budget-is-back-baby-and-will-be-updated.html\">my budget<\/a> again to reflect how it all came together last month &#8211; I&#8217;ll continue to do so during all the roundups.
