Here&#8217;s how mine did!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHey Mum, this is my friend Daniel from school.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNice to meet you, Daniel, and welcome to our home! Joel, do you want to wash the dishes, hang the laundry, or vacuum the house?\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAh, Mum&#8230; Daniel came over to play. Can I pleeeeease skip my chores today?\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNope. If you live in this house, you must do chores. Sorry Daniel, that\u2019s the way it is around here.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOK, fine. C\u2019mon Daniel, it\u2019ll only take 10 minutes to bust out these dishes and then we can go practice skateboarding in the driveway.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><b>Teaching Kids Independence: Financial or Otherwise<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can\u2019t thank my parents enough. Growing up, what I called \u201ctorture\u201d at the time was actually just stellar parenting. The lessons my Mum and Dad ingrained in me back then gave me a huge advantage today. They taught me how to think, live, and thrive independently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am by no means perfect, and I&#8217;m sure my parents would say they did a bunch of stuff wrong when raising me. But, I became self-sufficient very early in life, and that made me confident in taking care of myself and gave me a good start on my journey toward financial freedom. Here are some fun stories from my childhood:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lesson #1: Everybody Works. Life IS Work.\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how much I complained, negotiated, or pretended to be sick, my parents would never let me out of doing daily chores. Mum put a chore chart on the fridge with a morning and an afternoon task for every day of the week. These mandatory chores started when I was about 6 years old and continued until I moved out at age 22.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dishes, laundry, washing walls, scrubbing toilets, vacuuming, making dinner for the family, changing bed sheets, gardening, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustle-how-to-clean-wash-cars\/\">car washing<\/a> \u2026 You name it &#8212; my siblings and I did it. There was no compensation, weekly allowance, or reward for these jobs. It was just the cost of living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, I thought this was horribly unfair at the time! My friends at school would get paid $5 by their parents to clean their room once in a while. I was paid $0 for 10 times as many chores!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, all this manual labor taught me a solid work ethic. I learned how to do things myself, without dependencies or hired help. When it came time to move out of home and run my own household, it was an easy transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lesson #2: Independence vs. I<\/b><b>nter<\/b><b>dependence<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning how to take care of yourself is important. But, learning how to *also* take care of others and contribute to a community is equally important. Looking back, the household chores my parents made me do went way beyond cleaning up after myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I helped prepare lunches in the morning for our entire family, everyone benefited. It meant someone else was going to help make <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> school lunches the week after. When I folded 7 loads of family laundry, it meant that one of my siblings was vacuuming that day so I didn\u2019t have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If everyone pitches in, everyone benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal independence is important, but Mum and Dad made sure my siblings and I grew up contributing to a society that also took care of us in return. That\u2019s how the real world works. We should all contribute, according to our means and capacities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lesson #3: Personal Responsibility<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a few things I remember growing up\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents didn\u2019t let me drive their car until I showed them a bank account statement with an $800 balance. This was the deductible for their <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-much-do-you-pay-for-car-insurance\/\">car insurance<\/a> policy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I went out with friends on a night when it was my turn to make dinner, I had to buy take-out for the whole family with my own money.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I slept in and was late to school, my parents threatened to charge me $6. This was the per-day expense they paid for my school at the time. (Honestly, I don\u2019t recall them fully enforcing this. I could be wrong). They saw my <\/span><b>education as an investment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and if they let me sleep in without consequences, it would demonstrate that the investment had no value. Charging me for missed school meant me owning responsibility.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I made a commitment or set a goal, they would hold me to it at all costs. Well, reasonable costs :)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These stories might seem harsh. But they were all blessings in disguise. As a kid I was held to the same personal responsibilities that most adults live by. (Actually, I still don\u2019t think many adults have enough $ in their checking account to cover their car insurance deductible. WHY are they driving!?)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lesson #4: Financial Responsibility: The \u201cBank of Mum and Dad\u201d Doesn\u2019t Exist!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents would cover the basic costs for us kids, but they weren\u2019t going to fund an excessive lifestyle. They bought us clothes, but if we wanted anything \u2018designer style\u2019 or if we wanted fancy sports gear, we had to chip in and buy it ourselves. They encouraged us to earn our own money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From about age 14 onwards I was earning about $50-100 per week <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/crappy-jobs-on-my-path-to-fire\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working at McDonald\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I could afford my own movie tickets, skateboards, games, and after-school activities or clubs. (I remember that I paid $10 a week for breakdance lessons on Tuesday nights after high school. Don\u2019t laugh &#8212; breakdancing was cool back then!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my later teens, my siblings and I each paid my parents $10 per week for access to their car when they weren\u2019t using it.\u00a0 At age 18, my parents started <\/span><b>charging me rent to live in my own room<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! (According to Mum, after high school I showed no signs of \u201cmoving on\u201d &#8212; so she increased my cost of living to encourage me to work\/earn more.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might be wondering if my parents were trying to make a profit off us kids! It\u2019s actually the opposite. They gave us everything they could. By slowly introducing living expenses, I learned money management skills and became a self-sufficient adult child sooner rather than later. I also learned that if I wanted the finer things in life, there was no entitlement or financial help. I would need to get off my butt and earn stuff myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, if Mum and Dad never forced rent on me, I would have never moved out. In fact, if they\u2019re willing to take me back tomorrow rent-free, I\u2019ll start packing tonight! ;-)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lesson #5: Budgeting and Money Management<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents taught me to keep a detailed ledger for every cent I ever earned. 10% of all income went to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-include-charity-in-your-budget-and-other-ways-to-give\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">charity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 45% went to piggy bank savings, and 45% I could spend however I wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I earned $2 cleaning the old lady\u2019s gutter down the street, I would have 20 cents for charity, 90 cents for my savings account, and 90 cents to buy candy :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mum and Dad were pretty open about their own budget. They showed me how they pay bills (with a credit card to earn points, then pay the card off immediately with cash). They took me to meetings at our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/11th-reason-credit-unions-kick-ass\/\">credit union<\/a>. We sat down to review phone bills together, grocery receipts, and my Dad showed me how to file tax returns manually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember hating all this at the time &#8230; it was like extra math homework! But it taught me financial literacy and prepared me for budgeting in the real world. I\u2019ve never been in debt, my income has always trumped expenses, and saving money has always taken priority over spending.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lesson #6: Cooking and Grocery Shopping<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, one of my friends asked me how to cut an onion. This person is in their late 20\u2019s, and had never cut one before. At first I thought it was a joke &#8230; but they were dead serious. Making meals using raw materials was hard for them because they never learned to cook growing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember my Mum taking me and my siblings to the market and different food stores each week. She showed us which shops had the cheapest deals for meats, vegetables, milk, etc. She taught us how to cook meals for the family like lasagna, shepherd\u2019s pie or baked meat and vegetables.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning how to cook gave me freedom as a teenager, and it helped me financially as a young person. Teaching me and my siblings how to cook also freed up my parents because we were not dependent on them for every meal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Caveat: I&#8217;m Not a Parent!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a parent is the hardest job in the world, I can only imagine. My wife and I don\u2019t have any children right now, so I can&#8217;t really say from experience how to teach kids financial independence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I <em>did<\/em> learn about financial independence from my parents, and I\u2019m sharing these stories because it\u2019s a frequent topic in our financial freedom community and I wanted to give input based on personal experiences. If\/when I do have my own kids, I\u2019ll be trying my best to pass down some of these financial lessons I was taught by my awesome parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I certainly had a privileged upbringing. One that I\u2019m so thankful for. My parents are still married, happy, and our whole family has a very close relationship, even though we live on different continents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What personal finance lessons were you taught as a young child? How did your parents teach them, and did they give you a head start on your journey to financial independence? If you have kids, how are you teaching your children about their financial future?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Family photo up top is from ~30 years ago at the 12 Apostles off the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, Australia.
