Like partnering on rental properties, businesses, and joint estates or lending them money?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not talking about your spouse or significant other \u2026 I mean investing with siblings, aunties and uncles, your parents or kids. I\u2019m curious to hear your experiences and if you recommend it as a good idea to others?<\/p>\n<p>For me, the first property I ever bought was a joint real estate investment with my parents and older brother. We owned the place for 15 years before selling it and parting ways. While there were certainly squabbles and times we wanted to all kill each other, for the most part the experience doing real estate investing with family was pretty positive.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Should you invest with family members?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Most people would say NO. And my off-the-cuff advice to any investor is usually, <em>\u201cIf you have to ask, the answer is probably no.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But, every family has different dynamics and it could be a great move to meet bigger financial goals. It worked out well for me, and it might work out for you. Either way, here\u2019s a bunch of pros and cons to weigh before jumping into an investment with fund Aunt Susie or lending money to cousin Vinnie for his crypto ladder scheme!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Advantages of investing with family<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Pooling your money together can have further reach:<\/strong> I would\u2019ve never <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-vs-stocks-a-real-life-look-at-returns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gotten into real estate<\/a> so young if it weren&#8217;t for my brother and parents. I didn\u2019t have the down payment or the knowledge to buy a property on my own. Combining our money gave us a head start in buying a larger property we wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford individually.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diverse experience and skills:<\/strong> Two sisters I know here in LA co-own a rental property. They\u2019ve owned it for three years now and they work really well as a team. One of them is excellent with numbers and handling the money side of the business like the rental income and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/know-the-tax-facts-about-renting-out-residential-property\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax stuff<\/a>, while the other one is great at dealing with tenants, negotiating leases, and operational stuff. They are stronger as a team versus investing alone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You know who you&#8217;re getting into bed with:<\/strong> It can be easier to trust family members because you know more of their backstory, values in life, and prior demons. (This is also a good reason *not* to invest with some family members.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can possibly strengthen your relationship:<\/strong> Investing with your family forces you to have conversations that you otherwise would never have. In my experience, this has given me a deeper sense of appreciation for my family. We win together, or we lose together. Either way, we do it together.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Difficulties investing with family<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Different goals and risk tolerance:<\/strong> A big reason my parents and I sold our joint investment property is because our goals changed over time. My parents are now in their late 50s and want less risk in their life. They are simplifying their investment portfolio. I on the other hand am comfortable with a more risky asset allocation. We don\u2019t make suitable partners anymore because we approach investments with different financial goals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Families grow and change:<\/strong> Marriages, divorces, financial hardships, kids, moving locations, changing jobs, etc. As each person in the partnership grows older and lives life, this brings new complications in managing things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It can be hard to split tasks \u201cfairly\u201d:<\/strong> This is a sneaky one that can ruin relationships over time. I\u2019ve seen a couple of joint investments where one family member does all the property management work and the other does nothing. It might be OK for a little while, but over time it can wear down the partnership. Finding &#8220;fair&#8221; is quite difficult.<\/p>\n<p><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><b>More stakeholders means slower decision-making:<\/b><\/span><span data-slate-node=\"text\" data-slate-fragment=\"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\"> This is a downside of any group <span class=\"getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic\">investing<\/span>, not just with family.
