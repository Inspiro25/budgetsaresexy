Free as a bird, my friends &#8211; free free free!!! It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re at the airport just waiting to take off to our next fabulous adventure &#8211; I love it. Bags are packed, and now it&#8217;s just a matter of time until we move into that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/we-found-a-new-place-to-live\/\">new place of ours <\/a>in a bit. Things are happening fast!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh, I should probably back track a bit and tell you WHY we&#8217;ve moved in with my mother-in-law too, haha&#8230;<\/strong> it wasn&#8217;t just to give her some company, although that is nice :) Must be hard when all your kids are fully grown and out of the house &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t want to be all alone at home! But nope, it&#8217;s so we can clear the way for our contractors to come in and renovate our entire house in preparation for future renters (and selling it one day). Much easier to do when all your stuff, and YOU, are out of the way while installing new floors and what not. Probably cheaper too since there aren&#8217;t any hours built into moving furniture around and what not&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another reason to hurry up and get out of there is that we can do exactly that &#8211; hurry up and get out of there! :)<\/strong> I figured the faster we physically can get all our stuff out, the faster\/more motivated we&#8217;ll be to get the house fixed up and then rented out. Rather than us taking our good ol&#8217; time and letting it drag on for weeks and weeks at a time. So this way we did everything WE needed to do at this point, and now the contractors come in and do THEIR work. Which should be all completed by the end of the week :) When you&#8217;re on a mission, you&#8217;re on a mission!<\/p>\n<p>This also saves us a few weeks of the place not being rented out since we would have had to wait until we moved into our new one first to then put in on the market, with all the work that needs to be done first. At least to show it the best way possible. <strong><em>So in theory our mother has saved us over $1,500 by letting us crash with her for a while!<\/em><\/strong> Go mom! And her house isn&#8217;t too far to the one we&#8217;re putting on the market either, so that&#8217;s even better for us. Being able to stick around and check on the progress of everything before we head out for good.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll be an interesting ride for a bit living in temporary quarters with a loud baby and trouble-making cat (and probably more so for our mom! Haha&#8230;) but you gotta do what you gotta do to reach that finish line, right? We&#8217;re just thankful she was up for it too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyone else living with their moms right now? ;) Would you do it for a few weeks if it meant saving about a month&#8217;s worth of rent?<\/strong> And\/or continuing along with your goals? I always joked about living back at home to save tons of money for a while, but something tells me it&#8217;s a lot easier to do in shorter spurts than in long ones&#8230; it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if we still have any curfews ;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Stay tuned for tomorrow&#8217;s post in which I divulge just how many thousands of dollars we&#8217;re about to put into our old house now &#8211; our wallet&#8217;s not going to be happy with us!<\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/slushpup\/\">Dani P.L.<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whelp, everything went nice and smooth this weekend!
