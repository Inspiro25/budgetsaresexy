Are you facing this question? Let&#8217;s look at this and help you get to an answer you feel comfortable with.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Man, this morning&#8217;s radio shows were off the hook!<\/strong> There were TWO really interesting convos going on at different stations so I&#8217;m gonna post one up today, and then the other in a few days ;)<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s question is brought to you by sir Elliot In The Morning &#8211; the king of talk here in DC.\u00a0 And the crazy who WOULD live in a house where someone passed away!\u00a0 Even if they were outright murdered!\u00a0 That guy&#8217;s got balls. And dreams of steel too &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t do it.\u00a0 *Maybe* if the previous occupants died of old age, it wouldn&#8217;t be as scary, but even then it gives me the heebie jeebies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But what if you could get a house at a bargain?!<\/strong> Say, instead of $250k you can pick up a jaded house at $200k?\u00a0 Or $150k?\u00a0 Would the price eventually win you over?<\/p>\n<h2>Would You Buy a House Someone Died In? Let&#8217;s Look at This From All Angles<\/h2>\n<p>I think there are a lot of variables to consider when asking the question, &#8220;would you buy a house someone died in.&#8221; Here are the biggies that come to mind:<\/p>\n<h3>Are you afraid of ghosts?<\/h3>\n<p>This has to be number one when looking at this question about would you buy a house someone died in? Or a better question, do you BELIEVE in ghosts?<\/p>\n<p>Cuz if not, then you wouldn&#8217;t be haunted or creeped out every time something creeks in the middle of the night ;)\u00a0 I get freaked out pretty easily so it&#8217;s an automatic sleep depriver for me.\u00a0 That, and I happen to believe in ghosts because I&#8217;ve actually SEEN one with my very own two eyes.\u00a0 You probably don&#8217;t believe me, and that&#8217;s okay &#8211; no one does until the day they come across one themselves &#8211; but when you experience something like that it tends to open up a world of possibilities. Remember how I used to live on an old <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/metal-detecting-is-cool-damn-it\/\">Civil War campground<\/a>?\u00a0 Well, we believe he had something to do with that.\u00a0 I did dig up a lot of artifacts after all :) It was a kid-ghost too, so I like to think he was just coming to find his belt buckle, haha&#8230;and on the plus side, I now believe in &#8220;nice&#8221; spirits!\u00a0 (we can talk about this later if anyone&#8217;s interested. I can go on and on.)<\/p>\n<h3>Do you believe in bad luck?<\/h3>\n<p>If someone died in that house right before you, do you think YOU could be next?\u00a0 Elliot got on this whole kick to begin with &#8216;cuz a beloved principal person who had moved into a house like this here in Silver Spring, MD recently died in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2010\/04\/16\/AR2010041601598.html?sid=ST2010041602258\">same house<\/a> too!\u00a0 Police were saying it&#8217;s the first time in like 30+ years this has happened.\u00a0 There didn&#8217;t seem to be any connection to the deaths, but you gotta admit it&#8217;s pretty strange.\u00a0 On one hand you can argue that if someone died in there once, the odds it would happen again are slim to none so you should be golden! But on the other hand, if it&#8217;s a super un-lucky house, then maybe it attracts such occurrences? And we&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about middle-class neighborhoods here, not the projects.\u00a0 Which brings us to the next variable.<\/p>\n<h3>Where is this place located?<\/h3>\n<p>When the call lines were opened, a number of people called in to share their own experiences in relation to the question would you buy a house someone died in.\u00a0 One in particular said that he was checkin&#8217; out a place in a not-so-nice area that was a HUGE bargain (like, $50k I wanna say. Which, in the DC\/MD\/VA area is incredibly cheap). It was a foreclosure and pretty much boarded up.\u00a0 But here&#8217;s the nasty part, when he opened up one of the closets a body fell out!\u00a0 A BODY!!!\u00a0 Needless to say he didn&#8217;t buy it, but my word.\u00a0 The next caller said that was fairly common in the lower class areas because it was a perfect place for drug dealers to drop those who crossed them or couldn&#8217;t pay up. (Am I freakin&#8217; you out yet?)\u00a0 My point though is that location matters.\u00a0 If we&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about an area where crime is high these deaths may not phase you.\u00a0 If it happens right down the road from your million dollar estate though, you&#8217;re gonna be thrown. At least for a second.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the PRICE?<\/h3>\n<p>I tend to think that everyone has a price tag for *something*.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s good or bad, but usually when it drastically swings one way or the other people seem to cross that border more ;)\u00a0 I can tell you to your face I wouldn&#8217;t spend $500k on a haunted mansion, but if you hit me with $50,000 it&#8217;s going to be much much harder to turn down &#8211; not taking &#8220;flipping&#8221; into consideration, of course.\u00a0 I&#8217;d take that transaction in a heart beat!\u00a0 But if I had to LIVE there?\u00a0 Toughie.<\/p>\n<p>But that brings up another question&#8230;if real estate is an investment and thus a business transaction, you&#8217;re supposed to keep the emotions out of it right?\u00a0 Based on price alone it would be stupid NOT to pick it up. So it would also depend on why, exactly, you&#8217;re looking to buy. You might not want to live in it, but as a rental property it may be worth it (which brings up yet another question &#8211; do you TELL prospects about the history?)<\/p>\n<h3>How&#8217;d they die?<\/h3>\n<p>We already touched on this a little, but I think this goes up there along with price in the top 2 variables of consideration.\u00a0 If someone died accidentally, or of old age, I&#8217;d imagine that changes your views.\u00a0 But if they were shot\/committed suicide\/anything else equally as horrible, it may be enough to scare you away for good.\u00a0 Another interesting question Elliot brought up was if the home owner did die, but he\/she did so out of town &#8211; say, like on a vacation or something.\u00a0 So basically it didn&#8217;t happen AT the house.\u00a0 Does that change things?\u00a0 Cuz if we&#8217;re takin&#8217; it to that level pretty much every house would fall into this category, yes?<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, I&#8217;m gonna stop there :)\u00a0 This very well may be my most morbid post yet!\u00a0 And it scares me that I can keep on talking about this as if it were anything else.\u00a0 Haha&#8230;guess I&#8217;m just fascinated by this one. So help feed my intrigue by telling me what YOU think! <em><strong>Would you buy a house someone died in<\/strong><strong>?\u00a0 Or are you much more mature than I am?<\/strong><\/em> I want stories.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n(Creepy photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/genbug\/\">GenBug<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Would you buy a house someone died in?
