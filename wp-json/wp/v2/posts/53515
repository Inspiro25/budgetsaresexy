(In case you&#8217;re missing him here btw, I do too! But scroll down to the bottom to see how you can get more of him while he&#8217;s on break here ;)).<\/p>\n<p>Here was my favorite comment that trickled down to our blog from it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>You are an idiot! Buying nice cars (and kites) will leave you with little money in a few years. 1.9 million dollars is really not that much money and will not last a lifetime. Your advice is hopeful at best. My advice to you, go back to work and save more money.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I always laugh at these because first of all, you have to assume that anyone leaving comments such as these must be multi-millionaires and thus speak from experience, right? (Hah!) And secondly, how do random people on the internet even know how much your daily expenses are anyways? <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/magical-number-needed-to-retire\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The key ingredient to financial freedom? <\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for someone one day to say &#8220;you know what? You are completely right! Let me dust off the resume and get back to work again because my life totally sucks! Thanks for saving me!&#8221; Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s the thing: if you&#8217;re smart enough to retire early, you&#8217;re smart enough to figure out how to live for the rest of your life.<\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ve already done the hardest part! You hit <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your early retirement number<\/a>! And we all know damn well that &#8220;retirement&#8221; really isn&#8217;t &#8220;retirement&#8221; for folks in our community anyways&#8230; What blogger, or early retiree, do you know who\u00a0 just lays around all day wasting away their lives?<\/p>\n<p>(Answer: no one)<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve figured out how to get &#8211; and keep! &#8211; millions of dollars for yourself, and certainly by your 20s\/30s\/40s, you&#8217;ve earned the right to do whatever the $hit you please in life. Whether that&#8217;s to keep working for more or just completely change your life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plus, a million dollars, or in this case $1.9 Million dollars, is still $1.9 MILLION FREAKIN&#8217; DOLLARS!<\/strong> Maybe *you* can&#8217;t live off that much, Mr. Hater Pants , but you ask anyone off the streets if they think $2 Mil is a lot of money and I guarantee you&#8217;ll get more Hell Yes&#8217;s than you would No&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m so confident, in fact, that I&#8217;ll gladly give you MY <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/new-net-worth-676k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$0.6 Million<\/a> dollars if I&#8217;m wrong ;)<\/p>\n<p>So sure, the future is never known and the money may or may not last for your entire lives because of health insurance and the stock bubble and yada yada yada, but if you&#8217;ve managed to stack a couple of million in your lifetime already, I <em>guarantee<\/em> you&#8217;ll be just fine later regardless of whether your plan works out perfectly or not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And btw &#8211; this applies to <em>anyone<\/em> who has saved $10,000 or $100,000 or whatever too.<\/strong> Not on the retirement side, of course (def. no way to live off that ;)) but you should certainly be PROUD of how far you&#8217;ve come and know that you&#8217;re well on your way to financial freedom yourselves if you keep going strong. No matter what the outside world tells you. And we all know <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-first-100-thousand-is-the-hardest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the first $100,000 is the hardest<\/a> anyways, so once you cross that barrier things just get turbocharged!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another gem we received on the blog lately about our friends who <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-we-saved-1-million-dollars-and-became-financial-independent-at-30\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retired off a million dollars and started traveling the world at 30 years old<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Amazing how a posting like this gets encouragement from complete strangers thinking their accomplishment is cool, lets see how they help when sh. hits the fan if they still post their problems, wake up people, it\u2019s the journey, not the finish line.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Grammar aside, I find it hilarious that he\/she? mentions the &#8220;journey,&#8221; considering these guys are literally journeying around enjoying life and *not* chasing the &#8220;finish line&#8221; haha&#8230; And again &#8211; these guys have literally saved over a MILLION dollars! Why not see if you can\u00a0 live off it for the rest of your lives? If it doesn&#8217;t work out you go back and get a job or do whatever it takes, right?<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re smart enough to hit your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-my-fire-number-keeps-changing\/\">FIRE number<\/a>, you&#8217;re smart enough to manage the ups and downs of life.
