It\u2019s about making sure their life can go on as normal once they retire. It\u2019s continuing to do the things that make them happy without worrying about financial interruptions. Put simply: Keep living life as you know it&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>YES!! 100%! It&#8217;s not a magical day where your life changes overnight &#8211; it&#8217;s just the time when you <em>no longer have to worry<\/em> about money anymore!
