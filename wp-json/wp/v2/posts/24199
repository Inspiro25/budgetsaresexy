What I\u2019ve witnessed would have most people running for the hills, but it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve enjoyed very much over the years.<\/p>\n<h2>My Background<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a little background:\u00a0 I\u2019m a 28-year-old, single male who stands 6\u20195\u201d and comes in at 240-245, depending on whether I had a protein shake or waffles for breakfast. (Yes, that was a shameless plug for a bachelor.)\u00a0 After getting a liberal arts degree, I found myself hungry\u2026not hungry in the sense that I needed to eat, but more in the sense that I wanted better than what I knew growing up.<\/p>\n<p>My parents were (and still are) hard-working, industrious people. They are loving and fantastic providers. However, with not a college degree between them, there\u2019s only so much they could do with two young children.\u00a0 So after interviewing and being hired onto my first \u201cbig boy\u201d job, I soon found myself looking for ways to supplement my income and earn some extra jack.\u00a0 A friend took a look at me and said, \u201cHow would you like to bounce?\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>How to Become a Bouncer<\/h2>\n<p>Every bouncing job I\u2019ve ever come into has been through word-of-mouth and relationships. From what I\u2019ve learned, this seems to be the case across the board. \u201cHey, I have a friend who runs a bar and he needs some security. You look like you can handle it. Whattya\u2019 think?\u201d If you don\u2019t have any contacts starting out, you can usually find jobs by checking out online job boards too like <a href=\"http:\/\/craigslist.org\/\">Craigslist<\/a>, or even just asking around the next time you go clubbing.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>(Of course it goes without saying that you gotta have the guns.<\/strong> <strong>It also helps if people feel a bit intimidated just by looking at you.)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some states also require training to obtain gainful employment in the field.\u00a0 Both California and New York require all bouncers to be registered with the state and have taken the proper training courses.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m entirely informed as to what they entail though, as working in Ohio we just don\u2019t have such a thing.\u00a0\u00a0 As long as you do not have a criminal past or any felonies, finding a bouncing job isn\u2019t very difficult with the proper connections.\u00a0 Aside from these connections, or simply being flat out asked, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve ever heard of someone getting a bouncing job through any other avenue.<\/p>\n<h2>Bouncing Basics<\/h2>\n<p>So, what with crying girls, pumped up dudes and wacky waitresses, the world of bouncing can get pretty hairy. <strong>Bottom line,<\/strong> <strong>the job of a bouncer is to protect interests of the bar or establishment you work for.<\/strong>\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty vague job description &#8211; and that\u2019s on purpose.\u00a0 Though there\u2019s a list a mile long of unsafe behaviors that happen, what\u2019s \u201cagainst the rules\u201d is pretty much up to the bouncer.<\/p>\n<p>Successful bouncers are usually \u201cbig boys,\u201d though I\u2019ve worked with and seen men (and even a few women) that don\u2019t fit the mold.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen everything from amateur bodybuilders to a few \u201cfat slobs.\u201d\u00a0 And as you might suspect, steroids are a bouncer\u2019s drug of choice.\u00a0 Generally I\u2019ve noticed that unless you\u2019re a needle-dicked meathead with no self-esteem, steroids add nothing to your abilities in the profession and usually do more harm than good.\u00a0 Roid rage is real. I\u2019ve seen it and it isn\u2019t pretty.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I would strongly recommend that every bouncer have some type of training in hand to hand combat or martial arts.<\/strong>\u00a0 The second week on the job I was involved in trying to break up a fight in the parking lot in which I was punched in the back of the head, tackled to the ground from behind, and as result fell victim to 3 or 4 lovely lads trying to kick my head into the pavement. (Believe it or not, aside from a wicked headache, I didn\u2019t have a scratch on me!)\u00a0 At that point I made the decision to join a local mixed martial arts gym and now have belts in judo, jiu jitsu, muay thai and have boxed with golden gloves and Olympic qualifying level boxers.\u00a0 Needless to say, there have been very few situations since where I have found myself on the short end of the stick.\u00a0 It\u2019s an expense, but \u00a0a worthwhile one as you can absorb it into your normal budget for health and fitness needs too.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the physical chops, a firm but friendly, demeanor is best.\u00a0 More often than not, I\u2019ve found that if you can properly remind someone that what they are doing is outside of the acceptable rules and behavior of the establishment, they are generally pretty responsive and apologetic (and you won\u2019t have a problem with them for the duration of the night).<\/p>\n<h2>Come Hell or Hot Chicks<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/hot-chicks-bar.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"hot chicks at bar\" width=\"500\" height=\"308\" \/><br \/>\nThe ability to say no to a pretty face comes in handy when you spot a fake ID and a good looking girl says they would do \u201canything\u201d to get in the bar. Lesser men would use their power to allow the babe to \u201cdo anything\u201d to get into that bar, but I guess mama taught me well. You give an inch \u2013 and it\u2019s a slippery slope from there.\u00a0\u00a0 So, I guess here\u2019s where the ability to not think with your wiener comes in handy:\u00a0 I can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve turned away a hot chick (aka \u201ckryptonite\u201d)\u00a0 who \u2013 had I not been working \u2013 would have been the first girl I would have hit on myself. \u00a0It\u2019s a regular occurrence and it happens to me almost every shift!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bouncing is all about clear boundaries.<\/strong> You gotta\u2019 have a clear code of conduct and stick to it, come hell or hot women. And you need to be a man of action. It\u2019s a yes or a no; <em>maybe<\/em> doesn\u2019t cut it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You also have to be a super hero who can see what others cannot.<\/strong> (It helps that they\u2019re all drunk and you are as sober as a priest. Errrr, make that a nun.) The ability to judge and read people is an essential characteristic that every bouncer should have.\u00a0\u00a0 Personally, this is an ability that I had to learn.\u00a0 The more I worked, the more I\u2019ve learned what to look for in people in regards to body language and disingenuous bull$hit excuses for things.<\/p>\n<h2>The Evil-Demon Alcohol<\/h2>\n<p>Most people in a bar have had too much to drink. So, how do you identify someone who is over the top and heading for trouble?\u00a0 Your \u201cdrunk-o-meter\u201d becomes well -tuned. If someone can\u2019t even stand in a line, or walk\/stand up straight (or their head is down and most obviously vomiting), they are probably too drunk to continue safely staying in the establishment, and need to be escorted out.\u00a0\u00a0 What it boils down to is this: <strong><em>you have to have an uncanny<\/em><\/strong><strong><em> <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>ability to stay observant and sharp<\/em><\/strong>.\u00a0 Not only will bouncers need to be able to read people, but they\u2019ll also need to be aware of a myriad of other things, such as noticing people sneaking alcohol in from the outside, or little ladies passing out in a corner.<\/p>\n<p>While I am a firm believer that every person has a right to defend themselves, and those around them, bouncers really do not have any more rights to physically engage with people than others do.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure there are a lot of you out there that instantly envision scenes from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7Ikfz-S6Tjo\">Roadhouse<\/a> with Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliott beating the $hit out of everyone in their paths, but that\u2019s generally not the way those situations work in real life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ability to ignore and brush off insults is another absolute key for the job.<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0 I have literally been called ever insulting and degrading name in the book, from f**king f*ck head, to asshole, to d-bag bouncer, to straight up being told I\u2019m a terrible person. It\u2019s amazing to me how incensed some people become when asked to show an ID to come into a bar that legally requires it. I find it comical that if you throw someone out of a bar for whatever reason, they stand outside the door of the establishment and talk trash to you and try to bait you into something further.\u00a0 The best thing to do once you\u2019ve escorted someone out is to turn around (as long as you\u2019re sure you\u2019re not going to blasted on the back of the head), and go back inside.<\/p>\n<p>In all the times I\u2019ve been around the block, I find that patience pays off most at the end of the night.\u00a0 Whenever I go out, I certainly don\u2019t make it a point to be the last one out the joint.\u00a0 <strong>For some reason, a lot of today\u2019s young party goers always seem to want to be the last one to leave, like it\u2019s hip or trendy.<\/strong>\u00a0 People generally get pretty mouthy at this point and when you tell them they need to drink their booze and leave, they tend to react pretty negatively &#8211; regardless of how nicely a manner it\u2019s done in.\u00a0 It\u2019s a long and drawn out process to get people out of the joint.\u00a0 Sometimes it ends up with having to literally pull drinks out of people\u2019s hands, and other times everyone walks out shaking your hand, so you never know which way the chips are going to fall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>After midnight is when both your drunk-o-meter, and patience, needs crank up a notch and you need to become a little more tuned in to what\u2019s going on.<\/strong>\u00a0 Most bouncers that have been around for awhile know that this is a magical hour.\u00a0 People don\u2019t turn into pumpkins, but instead vomiting and rambunctious jackasses.\u00a0 After midnight I have seen tons of things happen.\u00a0 The very first person I ever threw out of a bar was because I found him urinating in a corner not too far from where I was posted up. In his barley pop induced haze, surprisingly he was extremely calm and understanding as I walked him out of the place with urine dribbled all over the front of his cargo shorts.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also seen domestic abuse, fights between patrons, and most recently have been assaulted by a woman after being an absolute sweetheart to her.<\/p>\n<h2>How Much You Can Make Bouncing<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/neon-alcohol-money.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"neon alcohol money\" width=\"500\" height=\"313\" \/><br \/>\nAs many of you would imagine, a lot of how much you can make as a bouncer depends on the establishment, and the owners of the establishment you work for.\u00a0 Many places you work are most likely going to pay you only in cash. I\u2019ve made anywhere from $<strong><em>7.75 an hour<\/em><\/strong> to work at some crazy and dangerous nightclubs, to making a good <strong><em>$90 a night<\/em><\/strong> at the current bar I bounce at now &#8211; which actually has me on payroll due to insurance reasons. So I get paid $180 every two weeks, and I don\u2019t have to worry about the taxes either since they\u2019re automatically taken out.<\/p>\n<p>Up until September I had an additional job working for another bar too, where they paid me nightly in <em><strong>$50 cash<\/strong><\/em>, including tips&#8230; not much considering I would drive there after an eight hour work day at my full time job, and then stay until closing time (which was usually about 3am). I\u2019ve since stopped this 2<sup>nd<\/sup> bouncing job of mine, and now usually only work on Saturdays and the occasional Thursday or Friday.\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Based on some rough estimates I\u2019ve done, I\u2019d say I\u2019ve cleared about $6,200 last year.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are certainly plenty of other ways to increase the amounts you make each night too, but 99% of them are both immoral and highly illegal \u2013 so we won\u2019t get into them at all here (And I can honestly say I don\u2019t participate in them anyways, not worth the trouble).\u00a0 I will say though, that at the end of the night there\u2019s generally an opportunity to comb the floor for bills dropped by drunken patrons.\u00a0 I once found a $100 bill which was great since I had been in the midst of an 18 month stretch of unemployment! So if you\u2019re lucky, maybe you can scrounge up some <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-rent-out-your-stuff-for-extra-cash-this-summer\/\">extra cash<\/a> that way too\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>In Closing (Time)<\/h2>\n<p>All in all there are both good and bad sides to every bouncing job you\u2019ll come across. How many of you can actually say that you\u2019ve drank on the job or gotten laid as a direct result of being at work?\u00a0 On top of that, there\u2019s a ton of earning potential as there are constant needs to fill shifts and pick up extra work \u2013 which also means plenty of late hours, hassle, and personal sacrifice. I can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve had to turn down invitations to go out and have fun with friends because I had to go into work last minute. <strong>Some nights you\u2019re a rock star, and others you\u2019re the absolute most hated man in the establishment.<\/strong>\u00a0 Either way it goes, you have to be ready, willing and able to embrace it.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part I\u2019d say that my bouncing experience has been a pretty positive one as I\u2019ve never been hospitalized or sued.\u00a0\u00a0 Some might say I\u2019m lucky, but in my humble opinion, I feel that this is reflection of both my people skills and my abilities as bouncer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I welcome all of you who think you have the stomach, fortitude, and personal motivation to perform this job and give it your best shot!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Guest Post by Ryan<\/strong> &#8211; a 28 year old male, living and working both full and part time in the\u00a0Greater Cleveland area.\u00a0 He has been a bouncer for the past 6 years.\u00a0\u00a0The job has seen him through life&#8217;s highs and lows, and at one point 3 bouncing jobs were the only thing keeping him afloat.
