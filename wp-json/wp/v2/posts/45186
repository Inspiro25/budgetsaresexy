And sometimes, quite literally. People are coming up with all kinds of incredible ideas around money and new technology, making it a completely different world than even just 3-5 years ago. These guys are bringing the sexy back* to financial management, and I&#8217;m now happily eating it all up! (Though some I chew and spit out &#8211; not all services are created equally)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, out of the dozens of companies I&#8217;ve tried or looked into this year, here are my favorites along with any updates since last reviewing them. They seem to be only improving with each passing month.<\/p>\n<h2>My Favorite Financial Services This Year:<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-43132\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/digit-savings1.jpg\" alt=\"digit savings\" width=\"527\" height=\"295\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>#1.

Ever?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>These guys are by far my favorite new service out there, and the one that kick started this renewed interest in technology due to how much it just blew me away. So much so, in fact, that I later became an &#8220;advisor&#8221; to them and spend a few hours each week helping them out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What they do is pretty straightforward:<\/strong> every day their algorithm analyze your spending (checking account), and if they see any money they don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll miss\/need, they push it over to a savings account for you. Small chunks here and there ($5-$50) that all add up without you lifting a finger. It&#8217;s all automated, and you can take it out whenever you want.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s even text-in commands like &#8220;save more&#8221; or &#8220;save less&#8221;, &#8220;checking&#8221; to check your balance, and all kinds of ways to interact with your accounts (another favorite is &#8220;recent&#8221; to see your recent transactions). In fact, most communication is via text messaging making it as fast and easy as it comes!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45199\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/total-digit-savings-aug.gif\" alt=\"total digit savings\" width=\"520\" height=\"619\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s new: As of last Thursday (8\/13\/15), they now pay &#8220;cash bonuses&#8221; for saving!<\/strong> I.e. the same as interest basically only called something different due to the way they&#8217;re set up. This is huge because it crushes the one main con people had with them &#8211; not that anyone will get rich over pennies whether at Digit or their own bank. Still, Digit now pays its members $0.05 for every $100 we keep sitting there for 3 months. It&#8217;s not much, but comparatively it beats out most savings accounts out there.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s a smart upgrade for sure&#8230; And just wait until they move into other areas of finance! Debt? Investing?? Imagine having a little robot paying all your bills for you as efficiently as possible? Shooot&#8230; Gonna be a game changer, I say &#8211; you heard it here first! ;)<\/p>\n<p>(Other companies are catching on now too &#8211; both USAA and Betterment recently announced similar features.

What it does is round up all your transactions to the nearest $1.00 (or however you set it), and then invests the difference for you into a pre-selected portfolio of ETFs and index funds. Even some with Vanguard in it!<\/p>\n<p>You can also have them invest additional money anytime you want with a quick click of a button, say, after getting a bonus at work or wanting to reward yourself for not spending money on something ;) What better gift to yourself than that of financial freedom??<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s new: they recently waived their fees for all students and people under 24.<\/strong> A cool move to remove any obstacles for younger people to get started and building up that nest egg. While you can certainly use them as your main source of investing, I&#8217;d suggest making them an &#8220;extra&#8221; or secondary one to put some money aside. Their normal rates aren&#8217;t horrible ($1.00\/mo for accounts under $5,000, and 0.25%\/year for accounts over $5,000) but you can do better elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>The question, of course, is whether you take the action to do so.

And while the idea of Motif <em>is<\/em> actually pretty genius and a ton of people are using them, I&#8217;m realizing more and more just how much I prefer my index and similar funds. I&#8217;m not the day trader I was back in the day (I was the typical &#8220;do not be like that guy!&#8221; warnings you often hear) but maybe they&#8217;re something up your alley?<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell Motif allows you to invest in a bunch of stocks or funds all at once &#8211; creating your own &#8220;fund&#8221; &#8211; without having to pay a handful of fees to do so. This new bucket of stocks you pick up is called a &#8220;motif,&#8221; and then you can buy future motifs anytime you want at the same 1-time cost: $9.95. It&#8217;ll also be shared with the Motif community there (unless you prefer it not to be), allowing other people to see how you invest in case they&#8217;d like to try it too. And vice versa. The minimum needed to open up an account is only $250, and it comes with absolutely no maintenance or inactivity fees either.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So a great way to pick up a bunch of stocks w\/out being gorged on transaction fees.<\/strong> I joined 19 other bloggers in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/motif-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a friendly competition<\/a> using Motif back in January, and it was pretty cool to see everyone&#8217;s strategies. I tried the dividend investing route copying my man Jason from DividendMantra.com to learn a little bit, while others went super risky to try and beat everyone out. They&#8217;ll either win or lose badly at the end of the year, haha, whereas I&#8217;ll be stuck in the middle since obviously dividend investing is more for the long haul ;) I&#8217;m currently #11.<\/p>\n<p>UPDATE: Forgot to mention that you can now buy single stocks with them too ($4.95) as well as creating different &#8220;motifs.&#8221; This makes it easier for people who want to do their investing in one spot.<\/p>\n<p>(FYI: I believe there&#8217;s a $100-$150 bonus for any new members who sign up to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/motif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motif<\/a>, btw, though that could have changed)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/billcutterz.com\/jmoney\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bill-cutterz.jpg\" alt=\"billcutterz\" width=\"291\" height=\"70\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Billcutterz<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>To sign up:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/billcutterz.com\/jmoney\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Billcutterz.com<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>My mini review:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/05\/money-apps-time-machines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This Week in Money, Apps, and Time Machines<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, if you hate dealing with your bills and\/or are lazy in getting them lowered, Billcutterz might be an interesting option for you.
