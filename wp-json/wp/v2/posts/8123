Haha&#8230;\u00a0 Okay, so here&#8217;s what came to mind just a little bit ago:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>&#8220;I think I ripped that girl off at the yard sale last year&#8221;<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Haha&#8230; WHAT?\u00a0 Why am I just NOW thinking about that? :) And why didn&#8217;t it come to me DURING that yard sale last year? I have no idea, but let me give you the quick scoop so I can get y&#8217;alls thoughts on it.<\/p>\n<p>Last year when we were traveling around Seattle and parts of Victoria, BC (where I fell in love with my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/think-you-could-live-in-a-houseboat\/\">house boats<\/a>!) we had a couple hours to kill so we decided to go yard sale&#8217;ing.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve been doing this since I was just a wee little kid, and any chance we have to do it together again as a family we jump on it ;) At one of these sales I came across this little bag of weird lookin&#8217; (fake) coins that had a sticker of only like 25 cents on it or something.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know why I picked it up in the first place, but the second I put it down I noticed that it had a much heavier, cooler, lookin&#8217; coin hangin&#8217; out at the bottom of the bag.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I took it out, and after a few seconds of looking it over I realized that this was a) not a very fake coin at all, actually, and b) was most DEF worth more than 25 cents!<\/strong>\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much at the time, but I knew I had my iPhone in the car and could find out in about 2.3 seconds.\u00a0 And this is where my feeling bad comes in &#8211; only to fester for 8 months apparently, and then have me wake up in the morning to it :) These were the next few thoughts outta my head:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pretend you didn&#8217;t know you just came across something valuable\u00a0 (which would have been a lot easier had I not picked it out and yelled &#8220;Mom!\u00a0 Look at this!&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>Hurry up and pay for it so you can hightail it outta there!<\/li>\n<li>And lastly, make sure to pay MORE than 25 cents for it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That last part was me justifying the sale so I wouldn&#8217;t feel *as* bad later ;) I think I ended up giving her a dollar. Which, interestingly enough, was exactly what I had found &#8211; a 1 troy ounce of silver, otherwise known as a silver dollar!\u00a0 (That exact one I found is pictured above)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now, it wasn&#8217;t worth as much as I had thought it was gonna be<\/strong> (I was hoping for $50-$80 since it was 25 years old and looked &#8220;antique-like&#8221; haha), but it is valued anywhere from $13-$20, depending on what silver&#8217;s going for that day.\u00a0 And either way, worth MUCH more than the 25 cents it was originally labeled for.<\/p>\n<p>So the question this brings up today is this: <em><strong>At what point does a &#8220;bargain&#8221; become &#8220;taking advantage of?&#8221;<\/strong><\/em> Is there a certain threshold that would change your mind one way or the other? (For example, the difference between the value of this coin and what I paid for it was roughly about $14, or 1400% more. But would it have made a difference if it was worth $1,000 instead?) And does it really matter anyways since all parties agreed to the deal in the first place?<\/p>\n<p>Obviously for me *something* mattered or else I wouldn&#8217;t have woken up feeling bad about it this morning ;) But I&#8217;m curious to see what you all think. I don&#8217;t know how I would have changed this looking back, other than offering more money since I knew it was worth a lot more, but then again that&#8217;s why you go to yard sales to begin with, right? To get a steal? And I&#8217;ve been rockin&#8217; deals my entire life, so that&#8217;s surely not going to change. I dunno&#8230; <strong>I guess for me it has more to do with the fact that I KNEW it wasn&#8217;t a silly little coin, and the seller did not &#8211; even though we all walked away happier.<\/strong> Maybe I shoulda just told her that?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I woke up this morning feeling pretty bad about something.
