Starting from scratch in Dallas, however, was easier than I thought it would be.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lifeaftercollege.org\/blog\/alive-12-ways-to-wake-up-light-up-find-bliss\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 0px 0pt; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/jenny-blake-yoga.jpg\" alt=\"jenny blake yoga\" width=\"250\" height=\"349\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>First, I contacted quite a few group fitness coordinators and studio owners. \u00a0I found my own class to teach within a week and broke into some other places by offering to be on their sub list (teachers or managers will contact you when a class is available to be subbed and this happens ALL THE TIME). \u00a0<em>I&#8217;ve actually found that substitute teaching is more convenient for me<\/em> (since I also work full-time) so that I can teach when I want to and as my schedule allows.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>I started teaching in September and have already recouped all of my training fees.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The money I&#8217;m making now via teaching goes directly into a new travel bank account I set up. \u00a0Doing it this way has made me more motivated to pick up classes as each one makes that vacation fund grow! \u00a0I&#8217;ve also had some regularly schedule classes fall into my lap as time has gone on, and I&#8217;m at the point where I&#8217;m turning things down from time to time because I&#8217;ve gotten so busy.<\/p>\n<p>My original thought behind getting certified was that I might do it as more of a full-time hustle if we ever have kids and I want to quit my current gig. \u00a0For now, my goal is to get on every sub list in town and continue to get my name out there so that when I do want to take this as more than just a side hustle, I&#8217;ll be ready.\u00a0 I&#8217;m currently turning down 1-2 classes a week that I&#8217;m offered, and in fact I was just offered another permanent class opportunity via email while writing this up for J$!<\/p>\n<h2>Other Things to Keep In Mind<\/h2>\n<p>As a fitness instructor, you are typically paid as an independent contractor so you will have to be aware of the taxes that need to be paid at the end of the year. However, you can also write off quite a few of your expenses related to teaching:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>workout clothing<\/li>\n<li>mats and other props\/gear<\/li>\n<li>pedicures (because who wants a yoga teacher with gross feet!)<\/li>\n<li>cell phone usage\/internet<\/li>\n<li>music purchases for class playlists, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some places will also require you to have your own yoga liability insurance (less than $200\/year) and to get CPR certified, but again, one of my employers pays for me to do this and pays me for the time in training. \u00a0Next year, I will most likely not carry insurance for myself since my current employers don&#8217;t require it (unless I have an influx of private lessons coming in).<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>You also have to be comfortable in front of people as your students will watch your every move.<\/strong><\/em> \u00a0 I was nervous before I started the certification program, but my teachers did a great job of preparing us for that.<\/p>\n<h2>Yoga in The Future<\/h2>\n<p>The yoga and fitness community is exploding right now and there are constantly opportunities for growth. \u00a0In the six months we&#8217;ve been in Texas, several new studios have opened, existing studios have remodeled and expanded, and most gyms are trying to offer more classes to their members.<\/p>\n<p>I had to hustle for a couple of months when we got here, but now that I&#8217;ve become more established the opportunities to make money have been falling into my lap. \u00a0It&#8217;s especially great as a side hustle since most of the classes are held in the early morning, lunch hours or evenings.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>If you love yoga or fitness, give it a shot!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>Got a side hustle YOU&#8217;D like to share with us? <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\">Let us know<\/a>!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>(Top photo by lululemon athletica, bottom photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seanogle.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sean Ogle<\/a> of the beautiful <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jennyblake.me\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jenny Blake<\/a>!)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Guest article by your average 30-year-old with a full-time job, teaching yoga for the peace of mind and extra dough :) As part of our&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-be-yoga-instructor-fitness-teacher\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[329,179],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-25562","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-making-money","category-side-hustle-series"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Side Hustle Series: I&#039;m a Yoga Instructor | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-be-yoga-instructor-fitness-teacher\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Side Hustle Series: I&#039;m a Yoga Instructor | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"(Guest article by your average 30-year-old with a full-time job, teaching yoga for the peace of mind and extra dough :) As part of our...
