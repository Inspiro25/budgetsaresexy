We usually only care about the<\/span><b> average <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investment return over a long period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><b>average<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> annual return is what we use in our FIRE calculators, our retirement projections, and almost every long-term investment analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might be OK when you are <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building wealth<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, (in fact, we are told never to worry about when the market crashes &#8211; just keep investing and stay the course!)&#8230; but the sequence of returns has a huge impact when you actually hit FI and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">start taking withdrawals for retirement income.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at some sequence math\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Sequence Example: $100k invested, left untouched&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 2 scenarios showing a different sequence of returns over a 20 year period. The left example shows a 10% return in year 1, then a 9% in year 2, slowly losing returns year after year.\u00a0 The right example shows the <\/span><b>exact opposite sequence <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of returns, starting with -10%, then -9%, and gaining a better investment return each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each example starts with $100,000 invested with compounding interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63524 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1__Sequence_Maintain_jpeg_FvU-c47H-e1606711410727.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"492\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, no matter how the sequence goes (from bad \u2192 good, or good \u2192 bad), both of these scenarios end up with the same amount of money. They both have $96,211 at the end of the 20 year period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, you can mix\/match these investment return percentages in whatever order you want. The average return will always add up to 0, and the retirement portfolio outcome will always be $96,211 after 20 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let\u2019s see what happens when we start to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subtract money<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year over year&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Sequencing Risk: Withdrawing $4k Each Year&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these examples, we\u2019re using the same sequences as above. We\u2019re also starting with the same $100k initial nest egg, and the only difference is we\u2019ll be taking out $4,000 each year from the investment portfolio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63525 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2__Sequence_Withdrawals_jpeg_L1QOcESu-e1606711431180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"495\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow, this is a pretty staggering difference. <\/span><b>Starting in a good market<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with things slowly getting worse each year for 20 years, the portfolio value on the left ended up with about $40k.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But <\/span><b>starting in a bad market<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and things slowly getting better and better over time, this investment portfolio on the right would run out of money in year 15!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is sequence risk. <\/span><b>Bad return years at the beginning of retirement<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throws the portfolio way off course.

For the most part, people retire when they turn a specific age. Somewhere around 65 &#8211; 70 years old\u2026 which happens every single year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63522 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/4__SP500_people_retire_by_age_jpeg_oJxE-Xs5-e1606711386358.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"363\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let\u2019s look at when people hit FI and <b>retire early, <\/b>shown with orange dots below\u2026 People usually retire early when they hit their <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-my-fire-number-keeps-changing\/\">FIRE number<\/a>, no matter their age. And most people hit their FIRE number during excellent economies, when their portfolio has had killer growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63523 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5__SP500_when_people_retire_jpeg_uEY4yCPS-e1606711397771.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"363\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, this is a very oversimplified and highly exaggerated illustration\u2026<em> If you wanna see a better calculated graph of endogenous retirement timing, <a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2017\/12\/13\/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-22-endogenous-retirement-timing\/\">check out this post<\/a> from Early Retirement Now!<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would appear that anyone retiring at the top of a bull market is doomed! That\u2019s not necessarily the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Just because you have a series of positive returns, it doesn\u2019t mean it will be followed by big negative returns<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But, looking at the orange dots, can you see why people retiring early might be feeling a bit more exposed to sequence risk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other factor that compounds this issue is longevity risk. Early retirees need their retirement savings to last them many more years than traditional retirees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is, no matter when you retire, everyone has to plan ahead for sequence risk. Here\u2019s a few tricks we can learn to lower the impact of bad early investment returns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, a quick note on safe withdrawal rates&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The 4% Rule and Safe Withdrawal Rates in Retirement\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that the 4% rule has a lot of sequence of return risk mitigation already built-in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dude who invented the 4% safe withdrawal rate studied all of the past sequences and market returns data from 1925 to 1995. His study concluded <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><\/i><b><i>If history is any guide for the future<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, then withdrawal rates of 3% and 4% are extremely unlikely to exhaust any portfolio of stocks and bonds during any of the payout periods\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes me feel pretty good, but not 100% confident. History is a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decent<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> guide for the future, but it\u2019s not always accurate. (2020 has proven this true &#8211; we\u2019ve experienced many historic firsts this year).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So although the 4% rule was built to withstand bad sequencing risk, most people call it a \u201cguideline,\u201d or \u201crule of thumb.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t be taken as gospel.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Managing Sequence of Returns Risk<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quickest way to be in a more comfortable position in retirement is to build a slightly bigger nest egg. This sounds like a no-brainer, but if you\u2019re young and in the wealth accumulation phase, why not stay there a little longer and build yourself a buffer?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider saving 33x your annual spend, instead of 25x. This lowers your withdrawal rate to 3%, instead of 4%.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider inflating your future budget numbers a tiny bit, so that in the event you have an immediate market crash you can simply spend less than you were planning for, without impacting your lifestyle.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When calculating future projections, use conservative growth numbers and account for higher than usual inflation.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t want to enter retirement with the absolute bare minimum saved. You\u2019ll sleep better knowing you have over-prepared and have less risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to plan ahead is to <\/span><b>keep a large cash reserve bucket <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when you retire. 1, 2, or even 3 years of living expenses held in cash can be used for spending instead of withdrawing from your portfolio in down years. This may sound dumb, because holding money in cash means it\u2019s not working for you, so your portfolio is growing at a lower average return. But, the goal in retirement is not to accumulate wealth as fast as possible anymore, it\u2019s to preserve capital so it can keep feeding you &#8211; forever. Trading a lower return for lower risk is worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed income assets are another tool you can use to lower the impact of sequence risk. This is more preferable than the cash bucket idea, because it has a better risk-adjusted return. You can purchase bonds or annuities that provide a fixed retirement income amount no matter what the market performance is. Again, these types of investment vehicles have a lower return, but could be worth it to lower the risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, a broader asset allocation can help in managing sequence of returns risk. Using rental properties, for example, you could depend on positive rental cash flow to provide a portion of your retirement income, in which case you\u2019re relying a little less on market portfolio withdrawals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Plan Ahead for Less Risk in Retirement!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s funny\u2026 As we are accumulating wealth we are taught never to try and \u201ctime the market.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if the market is overvalued or undervalued, we are encouraged to keep <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing-what-to-do-with-a-pile-of-cash\/\">dollar cost averaging<\/a> with every leftover cent we can afford. Full steam ahead!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, this attitude needs to change and mature as we get closer to reaching our FIRE number. Lowering risk and preserving our hard earned capital is important &#8211; especially in the first few years of retirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other great reads I found while digging around:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.physicianonfire.com\/buffer-assets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201dBuffer Asset\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by PhysicianOnFIRE<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2017\/05\/24\/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-15-sequence-of-return-risk-part2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimate Guide to Safe Withdrawal Rates<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Big ERN<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i>PS\u201d It\u2019s never a bad idea to consult a financial advisor and have them double check your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-covid-is-changing-americans-retirement-plans\/\">retirement plan<\/a> and help in managing sequence of returns risk.
