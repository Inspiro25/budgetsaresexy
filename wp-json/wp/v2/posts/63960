This post examines how Americans spend their money and how that information can help you manage your own household expenses. By the way, this post uses 2019 data because, you know, 2020 was weird.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64164 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2-Jerry.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2-Jerry.png 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2-Jerry-300x160.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Average American household income and spending<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, the average U.S. household made $71,487 after taxes.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of that, $8,451 was saved and the rest was spent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a more detailed breakdown of household spending, which shows that housing is the biggest expense, followed by transportation, insurance, health care, and then other stuff:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64161 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/3-income-e1628824564799.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"413\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add it all up, and we see that 68% of after-tax income is spent on housing, transportation, insurance, healthcare, education, and food prepared at home (mostly grocery spending). For the most part, those are necessities, i.e., non-discretionary spending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, the cost of some of these necessities has generally increased (a.k.a. inflation), which we millennials love complaining about &#8230; I mean, seriously, am I ever going to own a home? I\u2019d need a mortgage payment just for a storage locker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, we can see that Americans\u2019 share of after-tax spending on housing costs has grown to 23% in 2019 from 18% in 1973. The budget percentages on insurance and health care expenses have risen, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64166 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/5-share-after-tax-e1628824607755.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"285\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be fair, the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">value<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> received in some of these spending categories has arguably increased with the cost.

But the average household doesn\u2019t need to be so insecure &#8230; the BLS survey reveals that American households are saving $704 per month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what that could look like over a 30-year period if invested well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64155 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/10-Growth-e1628824498972.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"258\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, monthly savings of $720 will grow to $250,000 if it\u2019s kept in a checking account for 30 years.

That urge is more than just curiosity &#8212; it\u2019s research. Hard data can provide some context for budgeting; it\u2019s a frame of reference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, let\u2019s say you are looking to tighten your pursestrings and save a little more. You\u2019re reviewing your expense habits and figure you spend $2,000 per year on clothes. Is that a lot? A little? Everything in personal finance is relative and subjective, so it\u2019s hard to say.\u00a0 Benchmarking, though, can help you arrive at a conclusion with confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a rough visual breakdown of the average American household\u2019s apparel spending (with women\u2019s clothing claiming the top spot):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64154 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/12-Apparel-e1628824487894.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"309\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a good start but might not be relevant to your household type, like if you\u2019re living alone. Plus, discretionary spending is a function of income &#8212; the more disposable income, the more you can spend on clothes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a breakout of apparel spending by single women based on income:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64159 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/13-Women-Apparel-e1628824543657.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll see that women who make less than $15,000 spend $557 a year on clothing. Women who earn $40,000 to $50,000 spend about twice that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kind of contextualizing can help you understand where you stand. If you<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financialbestlife.com\/how-much-should-i-spend-on-clothing\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spend a lot of money on clothes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that\u2019s fine &#8212; but checking the data keeps you honest with yourself, which makes you more thoughtful about your decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Where to get more data on Americans\u2019 spending habits<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the data in this post comes from the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cex\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> US Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) Consumer Expenditure Survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They publish really detailed data. If you can\u2019t be bothered to dig through their files for analysis, I don\u2019t blame you (it\u2019s boring), but even just googling or asking some peers about their normal household bills is better than nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of benchmarking as a budgeting method is to get an outside perspective. Even if you just ask one friend, or just google one statistic, it can help you get a little perspective. Even small efforts to be intentional and thoughtful can make a big difference &#8212; and this is not the first time I\u2019ve ended a personal finance post on that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a parting thought, here\u2019s the answer to my burning question on our fellow Americans&#8217; average spending on canned ham: $0.78 per year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64153 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/14-household-meat-e1628824473782.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"362\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, which out of these stats surprised you most?
