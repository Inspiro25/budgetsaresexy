No one&#8217;s supposed to know about him, shh!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the email I just got asking for some advice&#8230;<\/strong> sounds like every other guy I know ;)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My money situation with my husband is kind of tight. Right now, we have two car payments and a mortgage, plus have to repay my student loans soon. We also have an infant daughter.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s been working on losing weight, which I&#8217;m very proud of him for doing, but it&#8217;s driving me crazy in some ways. He pays $149 a month to attend a martial arts studio and $32 a month for a gym membership.<\/p>\n<p>The problem? He never actually goes to the gym! He hasn&#8217;t been to it since at least last March, and we have the same discussion every month &#8211; I urge him to close the account, and he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go!&#8221; Yet if he works out anywhere other than the studio (which he attends at least 2-3 days a week), it&#8217;s at the gym at his job (which is free for employees).<\/p>\n<p>How do I convince him to close the membership? $32 isn&#8217;t a lot, but over the course of a year, it adds up and could go towards other expenses, like the car payments. Please help!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks,<br \/>\n&#8211; Fitness Widow (not real name &#8211; obvs)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Well, dear Fitness Widow, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s going to change his mind on that gym membership anytime soon, I&#8217;m afraid. Us men can be stubborn like that. What you need to do, in my humble opinion, is figure out a way to make it *his decision*about it instead of yours. And that can be done a number of ways:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Set up a &#8220;do whatever you want with this money&#8221; fund for him<\/h2>\n<p>(And for you, if you don&#8217;t already have one in place. If you do, it&#8217;s time to tweak the numbers!)<\/p>\n<p>You both sit down one night with a beer or glass of wine (very important), and figure out the total amount of discretionary income you guys have every month. Include all the *extra* stuff you&#8217;re already doing too when coming up with this number &#8211; like his martial arts class, gym membership, as well as anything YOU&#8217;RE doing already for yourself too. This should be fairly easy as it&#8217;s just a lot of adding up if you don&#8217;t already know these numbers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then, you both decide how you want to split it up<\/strong> (this is important &#8211; both of you need to agree 100% as it&#8217;ll be locked in for a while going forward!), and you create two new &#8220;do whatever&#8221; budgets to follow. Or, better yet, you literally create two new bank accounts to divert these funds into every month. And when it&#8217;s gone, it&#8217;s gone! You have to wait until the beginning of next month to get it filled back up again. This will:<\/p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Leave ALL the decisions up to your husband because he can now, well, do whatever the hell he wants! Even if that means keeping the gym membership for another 8 pointless months&#8230; (though I bet you $10 bucks he cancels it within 30 days ;))<\/li>\n<li>Offload the stress and hassle to BOTH parties. It&#8217;ll be a-okay with you because all of this has already been budgeted in and accounted for, and it&#8217;ll be perfectly fine with him since he&#8217;ll be able to spend carefree without anyone harping on him! You no longer become a nag, yay!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s a win-win situation in my book.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Come up with more &#8220;fun&#8221; alternatives to this $32\/mo<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like this idea as much because it still doesn&#8217;t help your car goal there, BUT, it would at least make you feel better knowing the funds are being put to a more substantial use. Which is not hard to do in this case ;)<\/p>\n<p>The thing about your husband is that he probably DOES know it&#8217;s a waste, but there&#8217;s something more to him wanting to keep it than just plain exercise &#8211; which he&#8217;s clearly getting elsewhere. Maybe it&#8217;s the &#8220;idea&#8221; of the gym he likes, or it makes him feel more responsible or something, or it&#8217;s simply a nice getaway for him shall he need one one day? Even if it&#8217;s all in his mind?<\/p>\n<p><em>[Look at me &#8211; I&#8217;m such a psychologist!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>If any of that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s just a matter of substituting this gym &#8220;satisfaction&#8221; with a different type of satisfaction. Perhaps:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A night out with the boys once a month for him?<\/li>\n<li>A date night for the two of you once a month?<\/li>\n<li>Upping the eating out\/entertainment budget ea. month?<\/li>\n<li>Just giving him $32 to do whatever he wants as long as it&#8217;s *not* the gym? (Haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li>Splitting up the $32 to go half to him for &#8220;fun stuff&#8221; and half to you? Which you then throw against the car debt if it makes you feel better than increasing your lifestyle?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>And I&#8217;m sure you could think of a billion other ideas as well.<\/strong> You can have a lot of fun on $32!! And again, I know it&#8217;s not the <em>best<\/em> alternative because it&#8217;s still not being applied to any *needs* like you prefer, but hell &#8211; it&#8217;s still a lot better than it just flying out the window! And I guarantee you&#8217;d be able to tweak\/divert it a lot easier later if need be without &#8220;making a scene &#8221; ;)<\/p>\n<p>Those are my two ideas anyways &#8211; coming from a guy. Who&#8217;s very emotional, haha&#8230; The only other thing I could think of is to just flat out get naked or pull the sex card, but that&#8217;s reserved for more serious issues, of course ;) Gotta keep that one in your back pocket for when it&#8217;s REALLY needed!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What would you guys suggest?
