Booooooo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many counties across Texas decided that 2020 was a good time to increase everyone\u2019s assessed property value, raising <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/annual-property-tax-bill\/\">bills by a whopping 10 &#8211; 20% for the tax<\/a> year. It\u2019s a kick in the groin&#8230; Because not only are many people under a financial squeeze this year, Texas was already ranked #3 for<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/best-and-worst-states-for-property-taxes-3193328\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">states with the highest property taxes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, the tax rate is worse than most. While the average county in Texas charges 1.81% of a property&#8217;s value, the lovely little county where my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2020-review-roi-rental-duplex\/\" >rental duplex<\/a> sits has a tax rate of 2.357%. Ouch! Tax is by far my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/biggest-budget-expenses\/\">biggest annual expense<\/a>. Actually, it\u2019s bigger than ALL other house maintenance, insurance, prop management fees and repairs combined. :(<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>What can I do? Property taxes are mostly unavoidable, right?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After I got that bummer assessment notice, this year I tried filing my first tax appeal. I was kind of successful, reducing my bill about $200. But I recently learned some other things that might have gotten me a better deal. Stuff I\u2019ll maybe try next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Yes, You Can Protest and Appeal Your Property Taxes<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently, only 1 property owner out of 10 protests his property tax bills in Texas each year. The other 9 just accept whatever is given to them, or pay without even looking. Most years I\u2019m fine with just paying, but this year the increased property tax assessment was too big to ignore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appealing was also <\/span><b>free, all done online, and took less than 20 minutes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My 2020 Appraised Value Notice came by mail in late April. It said my duplex&#8217;s current assessed valuation was now $229,040 compared with 209,650 last year. An increase of $19,390, or 9.25%! The value has been increasing every year since I bought the place in 2015. Here\u2019s the tax values and history of increases&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63427 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/tax_history_jpeg_Ph98uGF0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/tax_history_jpeg_Ph98uGF0.jpg 453w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/tax_history_jpeg_Ph98uGF0-300x102.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I got the first notice in April, mid global pandemic, home sales had stopped, and the stock market was down 30% at the time, I thought there is no way a $229k valuation was fair.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Here\u2019s How I Appealed My Property Taxes (Warning: Amateur Hour)<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The notice listed a county website for property tax appeals, so I created a login and filed a formal appeal online.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were only 2 fields to fill in for the online appeal form&#8230; A number field where I could input what I thought the property value should be, and an explanation box to provide evidence or background information on why I was seeking a revaluation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since this was my first time and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, I just entered $200,000 as an approximate value, and then wrote a long angry rant in the explanation box. In hindsight, this was a poor choice because I\u2019ve since learned a few other tricks that could have possibly made my assessment appeal better (which I\u2019ll get into below).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, 4 days later I got a response that said a manual re-assessment had been completed, and the appeals board dropped the value to $220,047. Not a huge reduction, but lower by $8,993.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This reduction <\/span><b>saved me $212<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on my bill. Woohoo! Not bad for 20 minutes of work (which really isn&#8217;t much effort for any kind of appeal process)!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Ways I Could Have Make a Better Case to Appeal My Property Taxes<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After I accepted the reduction in my duplex&#8217;s assessed value, I realized there might have been a better way to petition for a lower property assessment. I started googling and seeing how other taxpayers have protested their property taxes. Here\u2019s some tips I found:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Check property records, tax cards, and house dimensions filed with the city.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One of the ways county assessors come up with your valuation is based on a taxpayer&#8217;s home size, room dimensions, amount of fixtures, and other \u201cfeatures\u201d listed. Mistakes in county records are more common than you might think, especially for older homes. If I found a discrepancy, a feature issue, or something that made my home less desirable, it could lower my taxable value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Expose known property faults.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If I could prove that my property is run down, needed major repairs, or had structural issues, I could include this in the appeal for a lower valuation. Since the ground in Texas moves very slowly over time, almost every house older than 10 years has \u201cevidence of foundation movement\u201d or \u201cirregular soil levels.\u201d Although these aren\u2019t dangerous, I could take a bunch of bad photos and try to sell these property issues as worse than they really are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a photo of \u201cirregular soil level\u201d that the inspector spotted when I bought the property in 2015. Sounds silly, but any evidence I can produce that the property is worse than the neighbors\u2019 will get me a lower valuation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63426 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/irregular_soil_levels_Duplex_jpeg_zP89JfW_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/irregular_soil_levels_Duplex_jpeg_zP89JfW_.jpg 363w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/irregular_soil_levels_Duplex_jpeg_zP89JfW_-300x226.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common (but not critical) issue that could be pointed out is roof wear and tear. Proving that the property roof is getting old and showing unappealing photos could lower the assessment value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Research the neighbors, and be more exact with numbers: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of me submitting my request for a $200k round number with no real justification, I should have researched the area and provided my own property comparisons. Using Zillow, Realtor.com, or other home value sites I could have found nearby houses that gave me a lower average fair market value.\u00a0 The county assessor uses this same \u201ccomp\u201d method to do their evaluations, but I have to assume they use the higher available comps. I would try to use the lowest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Be nicer with my request: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of ranting and complaining in my property tax appeal, I think it\u2019s a better strategy to leave emotion out of negotiations and just stick to facts. And I&#8217;m sure the assessment appeals board appreciates this strategy!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no perfect way to submit an appeal or guarantee that any of this will work. But it\u2019s worth a try I think!? Before any of you property owners out there submit an appeal I urge you to check out your local laws and rights for appealing taxes!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>We\u2019ll See What Happens With My Property Value and Taxes Next Year&#8230;<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I love owning a property that rises in value, if I can\u2019t increase the rents to match the rising tax bills, the investment slowly gets less and less profitable for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure what the rest of 2020 or 2021 will mean for property values, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>TLDR; &amp; Summary About Appealing Your Property Taxes<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appealing my property taxes online took about 20 mins, and saved me $212. It was my first time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, I could have submitted a stronger appeal by projecting my house as less desirable or more run down.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently only 1 in 10 people protest their property taxes, at least in Texas.
