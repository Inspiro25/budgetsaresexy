The whole world went on without me and then one day I snapped out of it and BOOM! I was back.<\/p>\n<p>And then, thank God, I woke up from the dream I was having :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But wow, what a thing to experience&#8230;<\/strong> I&#8217;ve mentioned how vivid they&#8217;re getting since taking on the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/09\/composting-pet-pigs-5-am-wake-ups\/\" target=\"_blank\">Benjamin Franklin schedule<\/a>, but this one tops the cake. It was unreal.<\/p>\n<p>And while I can&#8217;t accurately express the magnitude of how it felt, I can tell you a bunch of the questions that popped up that&#8217;ll better put it in perspective. It was freaky!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;What happened to me?&#8221; (No one knows. One second you were taking the SATs, and the next you were a walking zombie.)<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;What do you mean a walking zombie? I wasn&#8217;t sleeping the whole time?&#8221; (No &#8211; you were <em>you<\/em>, only without memory. So you couldn&#8217;t do anything or remember anything, but you were still walking around trying to live your life. You were dead, but alive.)<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;That sounds miserable! How did you guys take care of me?&#8221; (We took turns. And it *was* miserable. Your mom and I took care of you most of the time, along with your legal guardian. (More on that in a bit))<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Did everyone think I was going to die?&#8221; (*silence*)<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;What time did I go to bed every night?&#8221; (7:30. And you&#8217;d wake up at 5:45 every morning.)<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Aghh!! I broke my Benjamin Franklin routine???!&#8221; (Yes, why is <em>that<\/em> your concern??)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Haha&#8230; And then there were the questions I was too afraid to ask :(<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Where are my two beautiful boys?&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Did you move on? Are you dating anyone???&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>and of course, &#8220;What happens now?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It was pretty surreal to say the least. And I&#8217;m quite happy that it was indeed a dream or else this would have been a completely different post!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Somewhere in that virtual reality, however, I also brought up our finances and was hoping (praying!) they were okay. <\/strong>My wife is anything but a numbers lover, and if she had it her way she&#8217;d never have to think about money again. Which to me sounds like the <em>real<\/em> nightmare &#8211; hah. But I guess that&#8217;s why we work well together :)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, one simple question shed more than enough light on it. I asked her if she was paying the bills, and she just stared back at me in silence&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Oh no&#8230;\u00a0 you didn&#8217;t pay the bills??&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they shut off cable and electricity? What about water?\u00a0 You had to be paying them, right?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Let me guess&#8230; you waited for it all to be shut down and <em>then<\/em> you paid?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, unapologetically.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;d think this would be the least of my concerns considering I WAS IN A COMA FOR A WHOLE YEAR!,<\/strong> but I couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around it and was just amazed at how fast our situation went to shambles in a mere 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>We used to be so GOOD with money! <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/having-enough\/\" target=\"_blank\">Our whole life was good actually<\/a>, I hardly had a complaint.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, here we were just a short while later and I didn&#8217;t even know who I was anymore. Or what my family looked like, or if we even had a penny to our name for that matter.\u00a0 Everything changed in a single instance.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been processing this all morning, and all I can say is that I pray it never happens to any of us in the real world. Though I do hope it does in your dreams so you can pause and appreciate life too! :) It also puts our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/06\/would-you-rather-life-vs-100000\/\" target=\"_blank\">Would You Rather<\/a> question from over 5 years ago into better perspective as well (any of you remember this from back then?):<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Would you rather\u2026 <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Keep the next year of your life, as-is? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Orrr skip out on it entirely but be $100,000 richer in return?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Back in 2010 I guessed I would probably say no to the idea, but now I KNOW I would hit decline. Life is too precious!! I probably wouldn&#8217;t even do it for a million&#8230; And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.assetbasedlife.com\/is-one-year-of-your-life-worth-25-million-dollars\/\" target=\"_blank\">this guy<\/a> wouldn&#8217;t even do it for $25 million! (Check out that link when you&#8217;re done reading &#8211; it was a fascinating article)<\/p>\n<p>All\u00a0hypertheticals aside, though, I did come away with a few reminders out of all this&#8230;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You never know when it&#8217;s your last day! We <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/having-enough\/\" target=\"_blank\">have to appreciate life<\/a> the best we can.<\/li>\n<li>We also have to make sure our finances are in order so others can easily manage them if need be<\/li>\n<li>We need to make sure we TELL our loved ones (significant other, parents, whoever) where all our important documents are! Lists of account info, accounts we have open, insurance stuff, etc.<\/li>\n<li>We have to make sure to marry someone who will take care of us when we&#8217;re sick\/in a fake coma ;)<\/li>\n<li>And lastly, we have to do our best not to let work control us.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>That last point goes with another part of the dream that fit with the randomness that it all was&#8230;<\/strong> Apparently the guy who was administering the SATs the day &#8220;the incident&#8221; happened was appointed to be my guardian for the year since all administers are in charge of their test-takers (hah). And since I had turned into a zombie and couldn&#8217;t finish it, he had to wait around until I came to.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the sad part: he was supposed to retire at the end of that day!!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So he was forced to keep working for another year because his pension relied on it.<\/strong> He had nothing of his own set aside to quit on his own terms, and even if he did he was too loyal to leave anyways. He told me he was consumed by his work.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s try not to be like that guy, okay? Or a zombie for that matter. So many people are working and spending without realizing how fast time is passing them by, and one day they&#8217;re gonna wake up old and gray and hopefully not penniless.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Make sure you&#8217;re not in a coma yourself!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*****<br \/>\n<em> (And also that you&#8217;re not obsessing about money as that can <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/what-happens-when-think-about-money-too-much\/\">lead to scary dreams<\/a> too ;))<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For an entire year, I was in a coma.
