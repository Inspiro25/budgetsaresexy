In a way it works wonders cuz there will be periods where I save butt tons of money by not shopping for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/05\/4-stages-youll-encounter-during-no\/\">X number of days<\/a>, or I de-clutter an entire room or two before going back to normal, but in others I&#8217;m learning it&#8217;s starting to actually SUCK too. Namely, with my wardrobe.<\/p>\n<p>Sometime last year I decided to trash\/donate 3\/4th&#8217;s of my clothes during one of these large binges of mine, which was fine at first and def. needed, however I then took it a step further and got rid of 9\/10 of THOSE clothes too right before our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/05\/moving-all-our-stuff-out-this-weekend\/\">VA move<\/a>. With the idea that it&#8217;s better to *only* keep my favorites so I can not only enjoy them more, but also have less stuff taking up unwanted room. For all you non math people out there, that&#8217;s a total drop of 97.5% of clothes within a year (I think I did that right?). Which means I&#8217;m currently using only 2.5% of all my clothes I normally do.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s A LOT less of clothing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And now my favorite shorts (1), jeans (3), t-shirts (10) and soon to be hats (2) and sneakers (1), are starting to unravel and grow bigger and bigger holes.<\/strong> Which REALLY sucks because not only am I now down to my last pair of clothes, but they&#8217;re also my favorites and will soon see the likes of the trash bin too :( With the only exception of my hoodie collection. I&#8217;ve gotten rid of at least 10 of them this year, but I still &#8211; very happily &#8211; own a solid 15 others ;) And oddly enough they&#8217;re all in great shape! (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/08\/living-minimalist-lifestyle-is-it\/\">Suck that, minimalism<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Now all this would be OK if I just went back out there and started shopping again to replace everything, however I&#8217;ve gotten so damn good at NOT shopping for clothes that I&#8217;ve since lost my touch! The desire to go drive to a store and sort through everything and then try them on and pray 1 out of the 10 will actually FIT (they rarely do), has slowly evaporated from my body. And probably for the better, except for this slight problem we&#8217;re having right now&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Another note I should bring up is that I&#8217;m either too stupid, or too cheap, to drop <em>more<\/em> money on better &#8220;quality&#8221; so that all my stuff doesn&#8217;t wear down so fast now that I literally wear the same pair of clothes every single week. Something I&#8217;m sure upgrading in the quality department can fix (as long as it&#8217;s quality AND something I find cool!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say is that minimalism also has its down sides.<\/strong> And it&#8217;s a learning curve to fix those too, just as it is to get into the habit of *not* bringing home something new every other day too. Which is obviously still a factor in my life since I&#8217;m so in love with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/awesomely-random-yard-sale-finds\/\">yard sales<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/metal-detecting-is-cool-damn-it\/\">metal detecting<\/a> and collecting antiques ;) (Step by step, right?)<\/p>\n<p>In any case, I now need new clothes, and since I visited ONE random fashion site last week, all the internet ads that pop up for me now has something to do with one clothing store or another. All trying to steal my attention, and consequently my wallet. (They&#8217;re getting good at this targeting thing!)<\/p>\n<p>Out of all these ads, two sites have stood out the most &#8211; and for pretty much opposite reasons:<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\">1. Trunk Club \/\/ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trunkclub.com\/\">trunkclub.com<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trunkclub.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"trunk club\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/trunk-club.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"261\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hand-selected clothing for men. Premium clothes. Personal stylists. Zero membership fees.&#8221; And a premium is right!\u00a0 Denim prices are $170 &#8211; $250, casual shirts $100 &#8211; $200, and sweaters $100 &#8211; $300. \u00a0Similar pricing to high-end retailers they say, which is probably true &#8211; I have no idea. To me Express is high-end so all of this looks like it belongs in that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/we-will-never-royals\/\">Royals song<\/a> we just blogged about ;)<\/p>\n<p>On the plus side, I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m digging the idea of outfits in a box and having your own personal stylist. Much like those other &#8220;in a box&#8221; sites like Quarterly and the one that started it all, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birchbox.com\/\">Birchbox<\/a>. Which the wife and I have both tried, but shortly cancelled soon after (the pricing was okay, but there&#8217;s only so much product you can take every month, not to mention going against minimalism). I don&#8217;t think I could ever be okay with Trunk Club&#8217;s pricing though, regardless of quality.<\/p>\n<p>According to their rates, the lowest that box up there would cost would probably be around $400-$500 (they didn&#8217;t leave ranges for shoes, or belts, or even socks which I&#8217;m sure can cost a pretty penny), and the highest $1,000-$1,500. For one outfit. Needless to say this won&#8217;t be the answer to my wardrobe problems anytime soon&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-bottom: 10px;\">2. $6 Dollar Shirts \/\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/6dollarshirts\">6dollarshirts.com<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/6dollarshirts\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"$6 dollar shirts\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-dollar-shirts.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"180\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now THIS one I can get down with! Haha&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/6dollarshirts\">$6.00 only for a shirt<\/a>??? Sign me up! And just look at that sexy beard and beer &#8211; they know exactly how to appeal to those non Trunk Club people ;) And after perusing the site for only a few seconds, I quickly saw that they also have a 10 for $50 deal too &#8211; making it even cheaper per shirt AND shipping I&#8217;d imagine (haven&#8217;t looked into that part, yet).<\/p>\n<p><strong>The downside\/big question here though, is just how good these shirts <em>are<\/em>.<\/strong> Quality-wise, that is. Two seconds on the site I know I can find me some awesome designs (perfect for those who love jeans and hoodies!), but if they&#8217;re going to get all ratty like my current shirts, I&#8217;m not too sure if there&#8217;s a point in looking further. Any of you ever tried them out?<\/p>\n<p>On the plus side, if they ARE decent quality, then I can solve at least my shirt problem within a matter of clicks ;) 10 brand new shirts without leaving my chair! Haha&#8230; It&#8217;s brilliant.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I could probably find more examples of clothes companies trying to woo me via the internet, but for now I think you get the point.<\/strong> Which is that I need to figure out how much &#8220;quality&#8221; I need in my future clothes, and how much &#8220;budget&#8221; should be allotted towards said items. Do I continue going cheap? Splurge a little but have them longer? A happy medium of both?<\/p>\n<p><em><strong><\/strong><\/em>I really haven&#8217;t a clue anymore. I don&#8217;t think my current method is working, and I can no longer get away with the vagabond look anymore now that my beard&#8217;s gone ;) So if you have any advice, now&#8217;s your time to make an impression!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Where do you get all your clothes nowadays?? What websites do you use?
