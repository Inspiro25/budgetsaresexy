And especially if they&#8217;re good looking ;)<\/p>\n<p>The other day we were having another conversation with some people in our neighborhood, and at one point we got to talking about how long everyone has lived there for, and who lives where, and once the convo turned to us and we mentioned we&#8217;re actually renting, one of them responds &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just a renter?&#8221; and not in a complimentary way. I knew we moved to a pretty highbrow community, but the mohawk\/renting combo isn&#8217;t seeming to win us any new friends lately, haha&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to know what they&#8217;d think when they find out I write a diary for a living!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The funny thing is I couldn&#8217;t care less if others own as I know for some people it makes sense, and others (like us) it does not.<\/strong> I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good &#8220;investment&#8221;per se (<a href=\"http:\/\/jlcollinsnh.com\/2013\/05\/29\/why-your-house-is-a-terrible-investment\/\" target=\"_blank\">check out this post to see why<\/a>), but it&#8217;s perfectly fine to own or not to own &#8211; whatever makes you happiest. And perhaps one day we&#8217;ll even go back to it, nothing&#8217;s ever permanent, right?<\/p>\n<p>All I know is that renting still has a pretty negative connotation out there, and we&#8217;re bumping into it a lot lately&#8230; It&#8217;s not always &#8220;flushing your money down the toilet&#8221; though, or for vagabonds!

At least I am.<\/p>\n<p>I caught myself doing just that last weekend when I met up with someone interested in buying my fireplace off Craigslist. I felt like Mark analyzing his &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/09\/teach-my-dumb-tenants-about-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">dumb-ass tenants<\/a>&#8221; post we hosted from the other week!

You&#8217;re the dummy, dummy!&#8221; :)). What he really says, &#8220;Oh, nice. Yeah &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t afford to buy one for $300.&#8221; What I think: &#8220;YOU JUST BOUGHT A TABLET FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS YESTERDAY??&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interaction #5:<\/strong> I carry it outside to help load it into his car. &#8220;Sorry for the mess,&#8221; he says. &#8220;No problem at all&#8221; I respond, pushing it all aside to get the unit in. What I then think: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/01\/new-wealthy-vs-ultra-wealthy\/\" target=\"_blank\">Messy car = messy finances.<\/a> Just like my golfer friend says!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interaction #6:<\/strong> &#8220;Thanks for giving me a discount, I really appreciate it.&#8221; Me: &#8220;No problem &#8211; I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s going to be appreciated again!&#8221; What I think: &#8220;That was the smartest move he had made all day &#8211; asking me &#8220;what the lowest amount I&#8217;ll take for it&#8221; is.
