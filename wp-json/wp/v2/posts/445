Her husband started making quite a bit more money these days, and it seems like their priorities have now been shifted around &#8211; at least in her view.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve already emailed her back, but I wanted to get some more thoughts on the matter as there&#8217;s never a right or wrong answer when it comes to this stuff&#8230;  Here&#8217;s what she has to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">My husband &amp; I have been married a year and are already having problems with our finances.<\/span> We both have the same goals (save for a new house &amp; vehicle) but our spending habits are very different.  I would love to get your opinion on what a good budget would be.<\/p>\n<p>When <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Husband<\/span> &amp; I bought our home together three years ago we were engaged &amp; broke. I was making $11.00 an hour and he was making $9.00 an hour. We were by no means wealthy, but we were so happy and we honestly never fought about money. Our bills were always paid on time but we didn&#8217;t have much extra.  At the time my income covered the house payment &amp; his covered all of the other home expenses. He paid for his truck &amp; truck insurance &amp; I paid for my college and car insurance.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Shortly before we got married my husband got a new job making double what he did before.<\/span> He works overtime some weeks (we don&#8217;t know when it will be offered) and when he does, it adds $300-$565 extra on his pay check.<\/p>\n<p>After he got the job we started going out every weekend, and eating out at least 3 times a week. I looked over our bank statement (for the first time in a long time) and we spent over $1,200 in food and going out in just one month!!! I was shocked and when I spoke to my husband about setting a stricter budget he got defensive, he said that he doesn&#8217;t want to work his life away and that when he works overtime he wants to be able to go out. He even threw the &#8220;it&#8217;s my money&#8221; card (I was not expecting that)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">I&#8217;m more of a saver<\/span>; I put money away for my school &amp; for a new car. I rarely buy myself anything and I&#8217;m starting to get jealous of my husband&#8217;s spending habits. Please help! It was easier when we made close to the same amount of money, but since he&#8217;s gotten this job I don&#8217;t know what to do.<\/p>\n<p>This is our income now and what we do with the money, any advice would be appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>My paycheck: $788.00 bi \u2013weekly<br \/>$332 \u2013 savings account toward a new vehicle<br \/>$25- our home savings account<br \/>$35- school account<br \/>$316-House payment<br \/>$80- my personal spending money including my gasoline<br \/>All automatically drafted into these separate accounts<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">My Husband<\/span>: at least $544.00 a week (his last 4 paychecks added to $3174.60). He puts $200 a week into our house account, and the rest goes into his personal account. When we go out to a bar with friends he always pays for drinks and he pays for our deer hunting expenses (did I mention I live in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(edited)<\/span>). Occasionally he will give me money toward my car savings account.<\/p>\n<p>I know there has to be a better way to divide our money, where we can both work towards our goals and have a comfortable amount of separate spending money. Please help before money ruins our marriage!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">There it is! Open and honest for all the help she can get.<\/span><\/span> She&#8217;s already checked out my ideas on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/01\/to-combine-or-not-to-combine-finances.html\">managing your accounts while married<\/a>, but she needs just a little more direction. As I stated in my email to her, I think this can be broken down in 2 parts.  The first is to sit down with each other (possibly over coffee or a beer) and understand where exactly they&#8217;re coming from 100%.  Once they can acknowledge there is a problem, they can work on resolving it TOGETHER.<\/p>\n<p>The second thing I mentioned was to jot down all expenses (both house-related and personal) and decide afresh who should pay for what, and to possibly implement a % system. This will not only help re-distribute the wealth, but will allow flexibility down the road instead of just a &#8220;quick fix&#8221;. And I like the idea of keeping the separate &#8220;spend however I want&#8221; accounts open as well. It allows for some freedom and a little fun which Mr. Husband clearly finds important :)  Another option would be for Mr. Husband to donate a little more into the &#8220;house account&#8221;, maybe $500 instead of $200? and then allow him to spend any overtime money himself &#8211; no questions asked.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Of course, that&#8217;s only my ideas and they&#8217;re pretty skewed ;) <\/span> All I know is that it&#8217;s better to fix this now &#8211; and not just temporarily- before time continues and our friend Mr. Resentment comes into play. So whatcha got for our dear friend Lost in Louisiana?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ps: &#8220;Legal&#8221; tells me that I have to add the following: I am not a professional, nor a psychiatrist.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yikes &#8211; We got a live one here folks!
