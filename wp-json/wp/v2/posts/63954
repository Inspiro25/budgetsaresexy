Even some couples who did have small COVID weddings, are planning <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another wedding<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just \u2018cause they feel ripped off from not having a big gathering the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anway, this has sparked a lot of chatter about wedding gifts. I got the following note from a reader named Heather last week\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHow much should I give for a wedding gift &#8212; if I am IN the wedding and have to already spend money on bridesmaid stuff? The bride wants to do a traveling bachelorette weekend which is costing $400 each person, im guessing a bridesmaid dress will be $100 and prolly more costs on top of this. Should I still give them a wedding present too and how much? I was planning to give $150 because they are my close friends, but now I\u2019m thinking no present is OK?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Im not tryna be a cheap friend I just have SIX weddings this coming year to attend and will be in 3 of them. I will be a bridesmaid (2 for sure, 1 hasn\u2019t asked yet but I think they will). So it\u2019s an expensive year and have to think about savings.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tough spot! Six weddings in a year is a lot, especially close friends where you might feel you need to give more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m going to share my thoughts on Heather\u2019s situation first, then all you readers can tell me how wrong I am in the comments section. &#x1f923; My guess is everyone\u2019s got a different opinion on this, here is mine\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>When It\u2019s OK to Give a Small Wedding Gift (or None at All!)\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve probably attended 20+ weddings so far in my life and been a groomsman in 6. My wife has been a bridesmaid maybe the same amount of times. Sometimes we give big, and sometimes small.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a baseline, our standard wedding gift is around $100-$150 (per person attending), so that\u2019s $200-$300 for me and my wife. We like to give cash in an envelope with a card on the wedding day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if either of us is IN the wedding, we usually assume much more. Upwards of $500-$1000+ in total costs (pre-wedding events, travel, outfits and gifts). I know that\u2019s a HUGE amount, but if we\u2019re asked to be included in the wedding, it means we\u2019re very close to the couple getting married and are OK spending money on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some guidelines we tend to follow regarding gift giving&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>If you\u2019re in the wedding party,<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and are expected to spend a substantial amount for your role, it\u2019s probably OK to give a smaller gift, or none at all. Dollar amounts vary depending on how close we are with the bride\/groom. (The last wedding I was in cost me $270 for a suit rental, but since there were no other costs (no batch party, etc) and we are close friends with the couple, we also gave a $400 cash gift. If the wedding related costs were more, like $600-$700, we probably would\u2019ve given less. This couple are very close friends of ours).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>If you have expensive travel for a wedding, <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a small gift is OK. I\u2019ve traveled to Australia, New Zealand, and across the country to attend various weddings. In these cases I\u2019ve given smaller cash gifts, or just a nice card. Usually the wedding couple are just happy that we travelled so far to celebrate with them and don\u2019t expect a big gift.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>If you\u2019re not very close with the bride and groom<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, don\u2019t feel compelled to give a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">huge<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> amount. For weddings of distant relatives or \u201ccourtesy invites\u201d from couples we\u2019re not really close with, $100 would be my gift amount, I think.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>If you don\u2019t have much to give<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a small amount is OK! My Mum told me the most meaningful wedding gift she received was just $5. And it wasn\u2019t even a $5 bill &#8211; it was 2 x $2 coins and 1 x $1 coin (Australian money). The family that gave her the money didn\u2019t have much in life, but they gave $5 because that\u2019s what they could afford at the time. Personally, I\u2019m blessed to have never been in this situation. But for anyone out there who doesn\u2019t have much money to give, that\u2019s OK! Any giving is good giving.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Ways to Save Money as a Wedding Guest<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I were in Heather\u2019s situation, here are a few things I can think of that might help&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the weddings I\u2019m a part of (and if I were really close with the brides), I might have a conversation with them about how much the wedding is costing the bridesmaids and if they want a gift, too. This could be awkward, but there might be a few ways to bring it up in a casual way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the pre-wedding events, there\u2019s no harm in bowing out of anything you\u2019re uncomfortable paying for. If a bride or groom asked me to spend money on a trip I couldn\u2019t afford or an activity I didn\u2019t totally agree with, I\u2019d have no problem telling them to continue without me. With the saved money I could give them a bigger gift anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I really wanted to give as much as possible to all 6 weddings, I\u2019d pick up a small side hustle to cover the costs. Making an extra $2k in a year wouldn\u2019t be that hard with all the gig-economy apps available these days. It\u2019s for a great cause.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly,<\/span><b> there are other ways to contribute to a wedding besides cash gifts!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At my wedding, there were several people who stood out as \u201chelpers\u201d&#8230; They solved problems, always made sure my wife and I had what we needed and were having a good time, helped with some coordination, and even put out a few fires we didn\u2019t even know existed until months later! Sometimes just <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">supporting the marriage and wedding day is more than money is worth. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heather might be a perfect spot to do the same. Being a bridesmaid comes with responsibilities, but if you go absolutely above and beyond the role, then THAT is what is remembered in the long run. Not how much $$ you put into an envelope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, that\u2019s my 2 cents on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you guys reckon? What are your standard wedding gifts and giving guidelines?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a great weekend,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love, Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s wedding season!
