One pitch out of the 2,038 I deleted this week &#8211; hah.<\/p>\n<p>Why exactly did I feel like sharing this with you today? Well, for starters, I find it all kinds of fascinating and wanted to see what you thought. But secondly, I&#8217;m hoping one of you will make it on the show so I can live vicariously through you :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what the email read, which can also be found on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backstage.com\/casting\/cash-in-your-life-56307\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backstage.com<\/a>:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A new television series is seeking out couples and families for a chance to cash in their lives for a fresh start!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Have you always wondered, what if?

Just make sure to come back afterwards and tell us you did so we can root for you, and I can ask for my 6-pack of beer as a thanks!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Personally, I&#8217;d be the worst candidate for the show.<\/strong> First off, I avoid drama like the Dalai Lama (oooh, check out them rhymes). Secondly, I&#8217;m already <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/10\/full-time-blogger-goal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">following my dream<\/a>.\u00a0 And it certainly didn&#8217;t happen over night (though I wouldn&#8217;t mind getting a big fat check to &#8220;cash out my life&#8221; and then just move my laptop over to a new house, haha&#8230; do you think they&#8217;d allow that?).<\/p>\n<p>If I were playing along, however, and, say, the internet just exploded leaving me entirely career-less, there are a few jobs I wouldn&#8217;t mind pursuing&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Treasure hunter!<\/strong> I could spend all day <a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/couple-finds-10-million-in-gold-coins-buried-in-yard\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">looking for coins<\/a> and shipwrecked gold. Screw dinosaurs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Kicker for the Washington Redskins.<\/strong> I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;d get me this gig, but I&#8217;d like to think I could do a good job since I was a decent soccer player growing up. And since I&#8217;m &#8220;too tiny&#8221; to play football\u00a0 (as my mom always reminded me), I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about being tackled too much ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mark Cuban&#8217;s or Warren Buffet&#8217;s assistant.<\/strong> I&#8217;m not picky who.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The guy who&#8217;s in all those Corona ads<\/strong>. You know, the guy with the perfect legs on the perfect beach who&#8217;s always with the (what looks like) perfect woman? All he does is lay there and drink beer! How much does he get paid for that?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I also have a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/03\/10-awesome-jobs-to-try-some-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;real&#8221; list of jobs<\/a> I&#8217;d like to try one day too, but those are even worse for reality TV&#8230; And I&#8217;m pretty sure my application would be considered a prank:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Starbucks Barista<\/strong> (I love coffee!)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Bartender<\/strong> (I love beer!)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Barnes &amp; Noble employee<\/strong> (I love the smell of books!)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Garbage Man<\/strong> (I love <del>trash<\/del>&#8230; working outside)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Nurse <\/strong>(just call me Jaylord Focker!)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>The Bachelor <\/strong>(you know why)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><del><strong>Full-Time Blogger<\/strong><\/del> (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">completed!<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Banker <\/strong>(money!!!!)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Professional Poker Player<\/strong> (I&#8217;d get to hang out with my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/08\/confessions-of-online-poker-player\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">professional poker player friend!!<\/a>)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><del><strong>Charity Founder\u00a0<\/strong><\/del> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovedrop.us\/total\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">completed!<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Needless to say I won&#8217;t be applying for this life-changing role :) If I truly cared for any of these jobs I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;d already be working towards them. With maybe the exception of the Redskins kicker (wouldn&#8217;t want to embarrass them even more, if that&#8217;s possible) and the Corona guy\/Bachelor (don&#8217;t feel like getting divorced). The fun, alternate-universe-me, however, would be all over them!<\/p>\n<p>I also wonder about a lot of the lines in that casting ad so excitedly presented to us. Such as&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;a chance to cash in their lives for a fresh start&#8221;<\/strong> &#8211; Sounds both amazing and horrible at the same time. Amazing that you can just up and change your entire life completely on the spot, and horrible if it means you&#8217;d been living a pretty $hitty life up to this point. Unless you just happen to be bored\/needing a change\/an ultimate thrill seeker. In which case, back to amazing again!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Have you always wondered, what if?&#8221;<\/strong> &#8211; This is the quite possibly the WORST phrase in the entire world &#8211; &#8220;what if.&#8221; It usually leads to loads of drooling and dreaming with no action taking whatsoever. And I know, because I do it all the time and it drives myself crazy! Haha&#8230; The only time I really like playing the &#8220;what if&#8221; game is when I&#8217;m about to drop some dolla dolla bills on the lottery (*gasp*). If you can&#8217;t dream there, I don&#8217;t know where you can!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;appraise your life, and offer you a check to cash in and start the life you have always wanted.&#8221;<\/strong> &#8211; This line intrigues me the most. How does one go about appraising another&#8217;s life? What are all the factors included? I can&#8217;t even wrap my head around it, haha&#8230; and half-tempted to apply JUST to find out what my life is worth!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;couples that are tired of being in the same old rut, with the same old job and want to find out what their lives are really worth!&#8221;<\/strong> &#8211; This is also depressing (especially the &#8220;lives are really worth&#8221; part?!), but of course will make for excellent television. I do wonder, though, why you have to be a couple or family? No solos allowed? The drama would be too little?<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;roll the dice and turn your fantasy into reality&#8221;<\/strong> &#8211; Sounds like a gambling ad&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Will you Go Big or Stay Home?&#8221;<\/strong> &#8211; No room to do both? Blasted&#8230; Though that&#8217;s certainly the case for overnight success. But could you then really consider this a &#8220;success&#8221; if it&#8217;s all given to you on a silver platter? Wouldn&#8217;t you want to accomplish it all on your own? Am I reading too into this and spoiling the fun for everyone?? Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The moral to all this, of course, is to be working towards your goals NOW and not waiting for overnight success. And if you then happen to be one of the lucky ones to be granted such dreams in a flash, even better. Just don&#8217;t get caught playing the &#8220;what if&#8221; game forever!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Now who&#8217;s gonna apply for this crazy life-changer?? What dream job would you pick?
