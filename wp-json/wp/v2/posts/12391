A lot of things in our lives DO cost money, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with spending it on the things that are important to us &#8211; whatever it may be!<\/p>\n<p>So today, let&#8217;s talk about some of these things, and see what your fellow money lovers enjoy out of this life too :) There are no right or wrong answers here, so just be open and honest with yourselves. It could be anything at all that&#8217;s special to you &#8211; a toy, a vacation, makeup, a car, whatever. If you&#8217;re spending money on it, and you enjoy every last penny invested, we wanna know!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are this week&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/5-for-friday\/\">5 for Friday<\/a> questions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What&#8217;s something that&#8217;s ALWAYS worth spending your money on?<\/li>\n<li>How much does it usually cost you?<\/li>\n<li>What&#8217;s the MOST you&#8217;ve ever spent on it?\u00a0 (What&#8217;s the LEAST?)<\/li>\n<li>Are there any alternatives to getting it cheaper?<\/li>\n<li>Do people think it&#8217;s a huge waste of money?\u00a0 (Do you care?)<\/li>\n<li>*BONUS* How long could you go WITHOUT this thing?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;ll go first, because it&#8217;s my game and I get to set the rules ;) And also, because I like to talk a lot!<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>My one thing:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/04\/life-experiences-far-outweigh-cost-of.html\">Experiences!<\/a> It&#8217;s probably not a surprise to many of you (including the commenter <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/financial-planning-needs-balance\">last week<\/a> who said I take &#8220;more trips than the traveling circus!&#8221; haha&#8230;), but I can spend a looot of money traveling the world, or doing new things, and have absolutely no problem with it at all ;) As long as I&#8217;m financially sound, of course. There&#8217;s something about getting &#8220;cultured&#8221; that&#8217;s just priceless to me, and I truly believe it adds value over time both in happiness, and in business. It really does expand your perspective of the world.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How much it costs:<\/strong> Haha, this is the fun part ;) I&#8217;d say it depends on a lot of factors that&#8217;s going on around me (job stuff, family stuff, etc) but if I had to guess I&#8217;d say I easily spend at least <em>$5,000-$7,000 a year<\/em> if not more. Between road trips, international travel, bed and breakfasts, flying, boating, ferry&#8217;ing (haha..), hotels, out of state weddings, visiting the homes of our founding fathers (our newest goal! Trying to hit all major homes of important American influencers :)), etc. And this only includes my personal out of pocket expenses too. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to travel the country this year alone via <em>Love Drop<\/em> and all the conferences I&#8217;ve been invited to participate in. If you take on *those* expenses you&#8217;re looking at another $10k-$15k ON TOP of it. Which is why it&#8217;s important to find a way to turn your hobbies into something that can make money or give you perks!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Most I&#8217;ve ever spent:<\/strong> Hmm&#8230; I guess it would have to be our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/06\/im-baaaaaaaaaaack\/\">10-day Eurotrip<\/a> the Mrs and I took a couple of years ago w\/ a dozen or so friends. 10 Days of travel\/food\/hotel\/etc cost us about $4,500 total. DEF the most we&#8217;ve ever spent before, and that beats out our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/04\/wedding-budget-for-10k-fingers-crossed\/\">Honeymoon<\/a>! Which was around $4k if I recall correctly&#8230; I swear we usually don&#8217;t take big trips like that though :) Most of them are weekend getaways here and there.<br \/>\n<strong>The Least amount spent:<\/strong> Probably about $50 &#8211; for gas to get somewhere for the weekend and crash at a friend&#8217;s or family&#8217;s place. We&#8217;ve worked out a lot of GREAT trips that barely cost a thing when stars align :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cheaper alternatives:<\/strong> Yup! Staycations, visiting friends and family instead of longer, more expensive trips, and really just researching the crap out of travel sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.expedia.com\/\">Expedia<\/a> and the rest. It&#8217;s amazing how far you can go on a few bucks when it comes to traveling and adventures!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Waste of money?<\/strong> I&#8217;m sure some people do. Though usually traveling IS one of those things people can relate to easily. They probably frown more on the *amount* of money being spent, than the actual use of it. Like spending $5k on a cruise when you&#8217;re up to your eyeballs in debt. But either way, I could care less what they think about how I spend my money &#8211; it&#8217;s not going to change it. Just like the post last week with those <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/couple-spends-nearly-248000-on-playhouses\/\">$250k clubhouses<\/a>! If that&#8217;s important to them, great! But no way in hell I&#8217;m using my money that way ;) We all have our interests.<\/li>\n<li><strong>*BONUS*:<\/strong> Not very long! I go stir crazy, especially now that I work out of my home, so if you want me to be chipper and all smiley like I usually am, you better allow me to go on an adventure every few weeks or I&#8217;ll get crazy cranky up in here! That may make me spoiled, but as long as I can keep it up you better believe I will! :)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Okay, now that I wrote a book here, it&#8217;s YOUR turn! What do YOU enjoy spending your money on? Tell us loud and proud in the comments!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>PS:  That video up there?
