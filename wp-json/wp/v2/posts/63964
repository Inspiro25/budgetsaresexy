I realize what might not be good for me might be great for others.**<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, here\u2019s my sign-up and \u201cfree stock\u201d experience and some other stuff about Robinhood that I recently learned. Let\u2019s start with the good things I really liked &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Signing Up for Robinhood Was the Good Part<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First thing I loved was how easy the signup process was. Took about 8 minutes to sign up and everything can be done right through the mobile app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything felt very secure with dual authentication for both email and cell number, as well as connecting to my existing bank account for money transfers. RH doesn\u2019t offer any pre-tax or retirement accounts, so I just signed up for a regular trading account &#8212; nothing fancy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing I like about Robinhood is no account minimums, and no trading fees or commissions. I believe RH was a pioneer in this area and was the first to offer free services like this. But over the past few years many brokers have caught up and offer the same free stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My Take on the \u201cFree Stock\u201d Sign-Up Incentive<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incentive itself is legit. Right after signing up, you follow prompts that let you randomly select 1 free share in a publicly traded company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if you read the promotion fine print, you quickly realize that the <\/span><b>odds of getting anything valuable are pretty slim<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (Less than a 1% chance of receiving any stock of decent value.) Here are the actual odds:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64194 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1.-Screen-Shot-duplicate-2021-08-17-at-1.58.55-PM-copy-e1630326379614.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"578\" height=\"352\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shares with a value of $50 to $200 = <\/span><b>1% chance<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shares in the $10 to $50 range = <\/span><b>1% chance<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shares worth less than $10 = <\/span><b>98% chance<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess I fell in the 98% range, because the 1 free share I received was of a company called Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, worth about $5.80. Yay. &#x1f614;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64192 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/2.-Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.43.06-AM-e1630326361451.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"231\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I shouldn\u2019t complain &#8212; I\u2019m the same idiot who celebrates after <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/i-found-3-cents-on-the-ground-woohoo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">finding pennies on the ground<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; but I kind of feel like I just fell for one of those Las Vegas casino tricks&#8230; You know, the ones where they offer you a \u201cfree spin\u201d of the big wheel and it\u2019s all very exciting until you land on the $2 tile. After that disappointment, you feel the need to buy another spin to see if you can beat your last spin, then somehow you leave the casino 45 minutes later $80 poorer than when you walked in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My Biggest Concern With Robinhood \u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, I don\u2019t want to say that people shouldn\u2019t use Robinhood as a broker. In fact, we need innovative companies like RH in every large industry to shake things up and modernize processes and interfaces. They\u2019ve done great things for the financial services industry!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, my biggest red flag is that their platform seems to make it extremely easy for young, novice investors to create harmful money habits. Day trading individual stocks, options trading, and using leverage are notoriously risky investment practices, and are not the tried and true ways to grow wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t you think the average person should solidify their basic financial literacy before experimenting with advanced trading tactics? What about taking advantage of tax advantaged retirement accounts before building up traditional taxable accounts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hey, maybe Robinhood will address these priorities one day (better user education and offering retirement accounts) &#8212; I can hope, right?! They are still a new company and building their products. With millennials flocking to their platform, I think more responsibility might be needed on Robinhood\u2019s part to ensure their users truly are making good financial decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Who\u2019s Using Robinhood?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 50% of all RH users <\/span><b>use the app<\/b><b><i> daily<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (For some perspective, about 65% of Facebook users log in daily.) RH is highly addictive.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of RH\u2019s users are millennials. Of their ~20 million customers, the average age is 31.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only 24% of millennials possess basic financial literacy!
