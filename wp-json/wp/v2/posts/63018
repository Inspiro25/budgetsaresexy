We usually turn down interview requests but when we saw your name, we accepted immediately! We\u2019ve been following Budgets Are Sexy for a while now and J. Money was the one who first inspired us to create a budget! In fact, it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to admit this, but I have a thing for guys with mohawks. I\u2019ve been trying to get Harry to get a mohawk for a while, but he refuses. Hehe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: Nice! Thanks for following our blog. How did you guys first find out about the FIRE movement?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Harry:<\/strong> Well, it was mostly Meghan\u2019s idea to start with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Meghan:<\/strong> Yeah, my family didn\u2019t have much money growing up. So I always lived pretty frugally and learned how to survive on a tight income. Then when my acting career took off, I started making money hand over fist. &#8230; I didn\u2019t know what to do with all this extra income, so I started learning about investing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day I was googling \u201chow to invest in index funds\u201d and I stumbled across an article by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jlcollinsnh.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J.L. Collins<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about a simple path to wealth, or something like that. It took me down a rabbit hole and I discovered all types of blogs and books on financial independence. I got hooked! I didn\u2019t realize there were so many people out there pursuing FIRE. Most of them are spreadsheet nerds, just like me!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: So Meghan, it sounds like you discovered FIRE before Harry. How did you convince him to get on board?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Meghan:<\/strong> Haha that was a really slow process. Before we even got engaged we butted heads quite a bit about finances. We come from very different backgrounds and Harry thought that money grew magically on trees. No matter how much I showed him the math, my spreadsheets, or talked to him about economics, he just didn\u2019t get it! He thinks numbers are boring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then we started to discuss what type of future life we wanted to have. The traveling we want to do. The freedom from family obligations and the time we wanted to spend creating a family. \u2026 I told Harry that we can design our life however we want, and financial independence is the platform we need to do it. After that conversation, something just \u201cclicked\u201d for him, and we\u2019ve been on the same page ever since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: Wow, that\u2019s cool. Do you guys have a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-my-fire-number-keeps-changing\/\">FIRE number<\/a> or dollar amount you are shooting for? What is your FIRE timeline?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Harry:<\/strong> It\u2019s difficult to calculate right now because we are still in the process of figuring out what our future living costs will be. We just moved to the US from the UK, we\u2019re buying a new house, and we\u2019re not even sure how many kids we want to have yet. Our FIRE number is up in the air. But if I had to guess, it\u2019s probably somewhere between \u00a3200-300 million. What do you think, Megs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Meghan:<\/strong> Harry! Our FIRE number will be much less than that! And don\u2019t forget, we live in the States now, so it\u2019s dollars, not pounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we don\u2019t have the math quite figured out, that\u2019s not stopping us from living the FIRE <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lifestyle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> right now. For me, FIRE is just a series of better life choices. It\u2019s about making decisions based on long-term joy vs. short-term happiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve had to make some huge sacrifices to start our journey toward financial independence. But we couldn\u2019t be happier. There\u2019s a long road ahead, but that\u2019s OK, because it\u2019s about the journey, not the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: The world was pretty shocked when you guys excused yourself from your royal duties. How did your family take the news, Harry?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Harry:<\/strong> Oh, man. At first there were a lot of nay-sayers, and people were accusing us of being selfish. But we stuck to our guns and explained that we simply wouldn\u2019t be happy if we kept doing what everyone else wants us to do in life. Slowly but surely, the family came around. FIRE is contagious and we hope to lead by example!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: Meghan, what about you? Any backlash from your family and friends?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Meghan:<\/strong> Well, I\u2019ve always been different from my friends in L.A. Like at my last job on the set, all my co-workers spent their money on fancy cars and stuff. They laughed at me when I rocked up to work in my old 2003 Honda Accord. But I never cared much what others thought of me. So when we announced we were pursuing FIRE, my friends fully supported us. Some of them are even calling me up now and asking for financial advice. I just tell them: VTSAX all the way, baby!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: By the way, congratulations on Archie\u2019s first birthday! How has having kids affected your FIRE plans?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Harry:<\/strong> The birth of our little guy flipped our world upside-down! A couple things changed\u2026 First, Meg and I completely swapped our household roles. She wants to get back to building her career and is currently the breadwinner of our household. I am loving staying at home with Archie and taking care of all the household chores. Never thought I\u2019d be a stay-at-home Dad, but it\u2019s awesome!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing is that our FIRE timeline has extended a fair bit. We didn\u2019t realize how much children cost. Heck, the babysitter costs $8,000 per night, not to mention the salary of our 12 bodyguards that stand by his crib 24\/7.\u00a0 But, it\u2019s all worth it. We don\u2019t mind extending our FI timeline for children. Kids are a big joy in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: Have you guys found any ways to cut costs and reduce your spending?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Meghan:<\/strong> Oh, definitely. This is my area of expertise. I\u2019m always bargain-hunting. Here\u2019s a few ways we are saving money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, since Will and Kate had kids before we did, we are getting all of their hand-me-down baby clothes. Boom! Archie will be dressing for FREE until he\u2019s at least 15.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, we\u2019ve started travel-hacking by opening credit cards with reward programs! Our Amex Black credit card only has a $7,500 initiation fee, but it comes with a TON of travel benefits. There\u2019s a great referral program, Joel, if you\u2019re interested I\u2019ll send you my referral link?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: Ah, thanks, but I\u2019m good for now.\u00a0 Hey, what do you think is the biggest misconception the public has about the FIRE movement?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Megan:<\/strong> There are two misconceptions that I see a lot. The first is that most people think FIRE is just for frugal and young millennials who have high-paying jobs. It\u2019s definitely not. The truth is that financial independence is something everyone should shoot for, no matter your age, income, background &#8212; or even if you\u2019re royalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other misconception is about the \u201cretire early\u201d part of FIRE. Harry and I never want to retire or stop working on the things we love. Sitting and doing nothing all day sounds boring. We owe it to the world (and ourselves) to always work hard on the projects that are important to us.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: Awesome! Any last messages about FIRE you want to share with others?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Meghan:<\/strong> Yep. I want to encourage everyone to pursue financial independence. If Harry and I can do it publicly, you can certainly do it privately. It is a hard but rewarding journey, and you\u2019re not in it alone. Create your own individual path in life, and have FUN along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Joel: Well, thanks again for your time, it was great chatting with you guys!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harry: Anytime! OK, we\u2019ll see you later, we\u2019re late for a tea party with grandma!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, there you have it. Wishing Harry and Meghan all the best on their FIRE journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You guys have any questions for the couple that I can ask them next time? ;-)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey, everyone!
