Britney Spears!! (Woahhh!)<\/p>\n<p>And beer! (double woah!)<\/p>\n<p>And sex!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Okay, well maybe not sex (is anything better than that?), but I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that investing in my 401(k) was one of the best things I ever did for my finances. And while I no longer have access to one as a self-employed degenerate (&#x1f622;&#x1f622;), I still carry on the tradition of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/max-out-roth-ira\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maxing out my SEP and Roth\/Traditional IRA<\/a> every year which alone will get you to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">millionaire status<\/a> in just a matter of time. Even if you spend every other penny you get!!<\/p>\n<p>Here are 4 reasons I love 401(k)s so much:<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. It\u2019s FORCED savings!<\/strong> And you don\u2019t even notice you\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s automated!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. It SNOWBALLS when you leave it alone. <\/strong>Which was mind-blowing for me over a decade ago, and I can still remember to this day watching it climb to $50,000 and not believing how easy it was all because I never touched it&#8230; Something that excessive fees and penalties helped with as it only lowered the temptation to pull from it, unlike with savings!<\/p>\n<p>(so PRO TIP: If you want to stash your money somewhere that&#8217;s hard to access, make it your 401(k)! And then see how fast it takes to become a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-be-401k-millionaire\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">401(k) Millionaire<\/a> like our friend Fritz &#x1f4aa;&#x1f4aa;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. FREE MONEY is involved!<\/strong> (Usually!) I\u2019ve had employers match anywhere from 3% to 100% of my salary contributions (not a typo), and each time I soaked up as much as I could while it was free for the taking\u2026 Especially with the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-we-grew-our-net-worth-to-over-900k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100% company<\/a> which was just INSANE, and even more so &#8211; the fact I was only one of 3 or so who actually contributed to the plan!!!<\/p>\n<p>As soon as I found out about this I upped my paycheck contribution to 90%, thereby living off $200 paychecks (and draining my savings! Lol), until enough months passed where I hit the legal limit of $16,000 or whatever, and then dropped it down to 0% once it was maxed out to start refilling my savings again&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Easiest $16,000 I ever earned. Three years in a row!<\/p>\n<p>(And really, as you know, it&#8217;s *much* more than $16,000 as it&#8217;s compounded year after year after decade now, easily crossing the $100,000 mark with how the markets have been these past handful of years&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>So something to think about when you decide not to invest or save, even for just one day. As my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/wallethacks.com\/eisenhower-matrix\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jim Wang<\/a> recently said,<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;When you delay your savings for one day, you don\u2019t lose today. You\u2019re losing that last day your money would\u2019ve been invested before you started taking withdrawals. If you\u2019re going to invest for 20 years, that\u2019s 7300 days of investing. You\u2019re not giving up Day 1, you\u2019re giving up the fact that Day 1 will have been invested for 7300 days. That\u2019s a lot of money.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keep investing and grabbing that free money!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. And lastly, the more you invest, the higher your CONFIDENCE gets.<\/strong> <strong>Especially if you\u2019re in the early part of your financial journey\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a big difference between having $1,000 in your savings account and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-first-100-thousand-is-the-hardest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$100,000,<\/a> the least of which is feeling more solid and confident in your overall standing and decision making! It\u2019s a lot easier to make moves with a nice cushion behind you than it is without, whether we\u2019re talking career moves or starting new businesses, or even asking a girl out on a date! More money gives you confidence across the board, and your 401(k) is a fantastic, easy way to get that train going&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>(For those who <em>don\u2019t<\/em> have access to 401(k)s, btw &#8211; OR &#8211; have employers who don\u2019t believe in offering free matches (!!), start by maxing out your ROTH IRA first if you qualify (max limit for 2022 is $6,000), and then if you have extra left over from there move to your 401(k) to keep stashing away. Even without matches they still offer some solid benefits (like tax-free growth!), but you&#8217;re tied to your employer&#8217;s fund choices which aren&#8217;t always the best. Thus, why people recommend starting with an IRA first which you control 100% yourself, then moving to the 401(k).)<\/p>\n<p>(And also &#8211; if you have multiple OLD 401(k)s laying around, take the time to consolidate them all into your IRA too! No reason to keep being invested in less than optimal funds if you&#8217;re no longer forced to!! And will help with overall management and planning too &#x1f44d;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So yeah, huge fan of 401(k)s even if they do seem to attract hate these days, so if you currently have access to one and are *not* contributing at least to the company match, please do yourself a favor and fix that by the end of the week! It should only take 5 minutes to log onto your company&#8217;s portal or pick up the phone\/take a trip to your HR department&#8230;<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And then I want an email when you hit your first $50,000 too, or better yet &#8211; $500,000! :) There&#8217;s no way you won&#8217;t get there if you keep at it year after year, but you gotta get the ball rolling NOW so Future You can bask in its glory!<\/p>\n<p>Make it happen!!<\/p>\n<p>And make sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/401kchampion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enter the contest<\/a> for a chance at that $1,000 too.
