Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But if my recent art tour had taught me anything last weekend (my aunt had treated us to personal tour of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kreegermuseum.org\/\">local mansion<\/a>\/museum which housed a handful of Picassos and Monets to awe over), it was that certain art just pops out at us and we &#8220;know what we like when we see it.&#8221; And that was certainly the case for this bad boy. Or should I say, *watcher* of the good and bad boys? ;) And as luck would have it, it was most certainly up for sale that night!\u00a0 Magically in my price range too, even though I had no idea what that was, haha&#8230; (I guess things are worth whatever you&#8217;re willing to pay for them, eh?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interesting thing, too &#8211; have any of you ever bought art before?<\/strong> Like, off the walls of a cafe or restaurant or anything? I always thought you can just take it right down and go ring it up at the register like you could w\/ food or something, but (unless this place was different?) you actually have to CALL the artists themselves and set up an appointment with them to get it all squared away. Kinda neat. And after a few beers celebrating the end of Love Drop last Thursday night, I had no problem calling up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.douglaskoepsel.com\/paintings\/\">the artist<\/a> at 8pm and telling him I wanted his painting pretty bad ;) And also that I needed it right then as I was flying back out to DC in the morning (d&#8217;oh!). But he and his wife were totally cool! They finished up dinner and came right out to meet me, giving me a brief history on the painting too (It was created in Brooklyn 3 years ago, and then brought back with them to Milwaukee when they moved home), it was awesome.<\/p>\n<p>Though, word to the wise &#8211; it is NOT easy to bring a painting on board with you throughout the whole flying experience!\u00a0 I can&#8217;t tell you the number of times I thought I was gonna have to leave it off the plane cuz there was no place to put it :(\u00a0 Especially during the holiday season! Thank GOODNESS I had some pretty awesome seat mates who didn&#8217;t mind losing some legroom when I had to jam it below the foot rests the whole time, jeesh&#8230; I think the fact it was a portrait of Santa helped! Haha&#8230; everyone was in festive spirits ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>I also believe a new passion of mine may have just sparked!<\/strong>\u00a0 I really think I can get into the whole art collecting experience. Everywhere I&#8217;ve been since picking this up, I&#8217;ve been noticing the art adorning all the walls and entrances, and keep asking myself if it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d want in &#8220;my&#8221; collection too, haha&#8230;\u00a0 I can totally see how people get hooked! Not that I think I&#8217;ll have a problem with that considering how much all that stuff costs (a lot of it is crazy expensive!), but I can def. see picking up a new piece here and there as the years go by for sure&#8230; Maybe just casually at first.<\/p>\n<p>The guy who owned that mansion we checked out had a budget of $200,000 EACH for his paintings, and that was back in the 60s and 70s too!\u00a0 It didn&#8217;t hurt co-founding Geico Insurance, of course, but still &#8211; you gotta have one helluva budget in order to pick up some of this stuff out there&#8230; and I doubt any of my art will ever really be worth something down the road like *real* collectors either.\u00a0 Not that it&#8217;s why I bought this Santa one, or why I&#8217;ll continue buying more in the future too. I just think it&#8217;ll be cool to have one-of-a-kinds on the walls that show off my own personal tastes!\u00a0 And would be more than ecstatic if I could meet ALL the artists I get work from too &#8211; it really adds a whole new perspective to the art buying process. In all my years of doing it so far ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>But yeah &#8211; I have my very first piece of purchased art now, woohoo!<\/strong>\u00a0 It&#8217;s already hanging up right near my bookcases and fireplace too, I love it.\u00a0 It just screams &#8220;warmth&#8221; and &#8220;happiness&#8221; to me :)\u00a0 And I&#8217;m gonna keep it up all year long too, I don&#8217;t care what anyone else says, haha&#8230; (believe me, you won&#8217;t be the first to tell me it&#8217;s ugly or tacky &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty sure my parents think I got ripped off!).<\/p>\n<p>So, how much DID I spend for this Christmas gift to myself?\u00a0 Wanna guess real quick before I say?\u00a0 Okay&#8230; well, it wasn&#8217;t $50&#8230; or $100&#8230;. or even $200 (*gasp*)&#8230; it was&#8230; bum bum didum&#8230; <em><strong>$290!<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t have ever guessed it myself, but here we are a brand new art collector just like that :)\u00a0 We&#8217;ll see what my next piece will be, I can&#8217;t wait!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Any of you collect or purchase art?<\/strong> <strong>What&#8217;s the most YOU&#8217;ve ever spent on a piece?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>Here&#8217;s more on the artist if you&#8217;re interested: <a href=\"http:\/\/DouglasKoepsel.com\/paintings\">DouglasKoepsel.com\/paintings<\/a><\/em><br \/>\n<em> He&#8217;s got some GREAT totally un-Santa related <em>stuff too <\/em>;) Though much more expensive&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You like it?
