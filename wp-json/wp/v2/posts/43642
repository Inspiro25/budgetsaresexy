After all, as they say on Shark Tank, a business that doesn&#8217;t make money isn&#8217;t a business &#8211; it&#8217;s a hobby.

I wish I could say it was as enlightening as the first time we took this on 7 years ago, but the sad fact is I didn&#8217;t learn a thing. No epiphanies this time around, but at least it reaffirms that my spending habits are aligned with how I want them to be. Which of course is the point to it all :) (For those who joined me in this, how did your journey go??)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I saved $237.96 more with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\" target=\"_blank\">Digit<\/a><\/strong>. I guess they forecasted my daycare savings? ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I invested $10.35 more through <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/acorns\" target=\"_blank\">Acorns<\/a>.<\/strong> They round up your transactions and invest the pennies into a portfolio for you. You can see my full review of them <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/acorns-app-review\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Stuff That <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">BLEW<\/span> in Money This Week:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Capital One is kicking me out of my business account. <\/strong>They didn&#8217;t say why (other than &#8220;restructuring&#8221; or something lame like that), but I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t pay them jack to use their accounts :) So now I&#8217;ve been downgraded to a different business account and if I deposit anything more than $5,000\/mo they&#8217;re going to charge me $1.00 each additional $1,000. What the freak is that about?? Needless to say I&#8217;m on the hunt for a new business account&#8230; (which USAA doesn&#8217;t offer, arghh). What do you hustlers use?<\/li>\n<li><strong>My wife has to spend $200+ for a graduation gown she doesn&#8217;t even get to keep.<\/strong> &#8220;I don&#8217;t even spend $200 on a dress that I DO get to keep &#8211; what the f*ck?&#8221; was her exact response. Followed by &#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll notice if I just show up in normal clothes?&#8221; Haha&#8230; Go for it mama!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Some asshat stole my credit card info and tried buying something halfway across the country.<\/strong> Which USAA caught in a matter of seconds and shut it down &#8211; along with my credit card &#8211; and promptly re-issued us a new one. This was the 3rd time in a year it&#8217;s happened to us (they say they&#8217;ve seen an incredible upswing in hacks lately), but luckily the annoyance levels have been diminished since I&#8217;ve already made a list of all the places my credit card is attached to. So within minutes of receiving the new card all I had to do was log in to a few places and update the accounts. IF YOU HAVEN&#8217;T DONE THIS YOURSELF I HIGHLY ADVISE DOING SO! Saves you a butt ton of time and stress in the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>This Week Around Blog Land&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/epicbean.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43652\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/epic-bean-coffee.jpg\" alt=\"epic bean coffee\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/epic-bean-coffee.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/epic-bean-coffee-300x191.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Our early retired friend Go Curry Cracker&#8217;s story went viral!<\/strong> He had a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/laurashin\/2015\/03\/30\/how-this-couple-retired-in-their-30s-to-travel-the-world\/\" target=\"_blank\">great feature in Forbes<\/a> which then got picked up by Yahoo Finance and then shot across the front page of a half dozen other media sites back to back to back.
