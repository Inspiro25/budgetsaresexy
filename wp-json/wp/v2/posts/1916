Haha&#8230;You know what I&#8217;m talking about right?\u00a0 You eat $20 worth of food but Bob the Spendthrift convinces everyone to just &#8220;split it,&#8221; now leaving you on the hook for $40? It&#8217;s not fun. And I often <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/07\/people-who-like-to-split-tab-are-no\/\">complain about it<\/a> myself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Got this email from a long-time reader and thought we could help her out<\/strong>, what do you say? Here&#8217;s what she wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Last night, my husband and I went out to dinner with his boss and  coworkers to celebrate a work-related event. \u00a0If it hadn&#8217;t been  work-related, I might have turned down the invitation in this case. \u00a0We  are quite comfortable financially, generally speaking, but this month we  had to spend $2600 on medical bills and tuition expenses. \u00a0I am trying  to save on our discretionary spending this month so I can pull as little  out of our savings as possible to pay the bills. \u00a0(These kinds of  months really suck.) \u00a0I knew we would be going to a rather expensive  restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, my husband and I each got a $16 dinner and he got one drink. \u00a0(I  don&#8217;t drink much so stuck with water) \u00a0Everyone else got 2, 3 or 4  drinks apiece. \u00a0When the bill came, someone suggested just splitting it.  \u00a0One of my husband&#8217;s coworkers realized I hadn&#8217;t had anything to drink,  so they &#8220;kindly&#8221; knocked $20 off of our bill as a rough estimate of the  difference. \u00a0Our total tab for the evening? \u00a0$80. \u00a0Even assuming my  husband&#8217;s beer cost $10, I can&#8217;t imagine that our total bill should have  been more than $60.<\/p>\n<p>I would just shrug and move on, but this happens a lot to us in social  situations, and I never know quite how to respond. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want to  avoid social events because of this, or speak up and risk coming across  as a miser (particularly when out with co-workers) &#8212; I can actually be a  very generous person, I promise! &#8212; but it burns me to have to ALWAYS  subsidize my friends&#8217;\/coworkers&#8217; drinking, and, as my husband and I are  very cautious with what we spend at restaurants, I know it will never  &#8220;even out in the long run.&#8221; \u00a0Moreover, on the rare occasions when we  have spent more at dinner than others, we are cognizant of this and sure  to pay our fair share.<\/p>\n<p>What do\/would you do? \u00a0Is this just the curse of being one of those 1 in  1000 people who actually keeps track of money?<\/p>\n<p>Grrrrrr.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; Frustrated and frugal<\/em><\/p>\n<p>PS: I haven&#8217;t even brought this up with my husband, because I think he  thinks I worry too much about money, and might perceive it as  complaining about what was otherwise a lovely night out.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\"><strong>Ouch!\u00a0 $20-$40 right out the window, all for being financially conscious.<\/strong><\/span> So what do you do when everyone wants to just &#8220;split it?&#8221;\u00a0 Speak up and risk the evil eyes?\u00a0 Never go out again w\/ these people? (Hah!) I haven&#8217;t mastered this myself, but there IS one thing I&#8217;ve been doing more of that&#8217;s certainly been helping:\u00a0<strong> <em>asking for separate checks right from the start<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit it&#8217;s not always easy to do, esp if you&#8217;re a forgetful one like yours truly and\/or shy, but if you can get into the habit of this it REALLY makes all the difference in the world. And you know what?\u00a0 No one cares when you do it! Big groups, small groups, whatever &#8211; if you can ask for separate checks from the beginning (and I only mean for you, or you &amp; your gf\/wife\/etc, not the entire group of friends) you&#8217;ll never have to worry about it again.\u00a0 You pay for what you order!\u00a0 And can <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/01\/my-new-tipping-rule-everyone-gets-20\/\">tip whatever you want<\/a> too. The rest of the group will be fine without you :)\u00a0 And plus, most times they&#8217;ll do the same once they see you doing it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And if they give you a hard time?<\/strong> Well, just tell them you may have to cut out early and you don&#8217;t want to hold up the gang ;)\u00a0 This works 100% of the time &#8211; I have yet to see anyone get mad at me for pulling this one (and it&#8217;s not totally a lie &#8211; you never really DO know if something will come up, right? haha&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>Okay, so that&#8217;s my advice.\u00a0 What do you guys have?\u00a0 Do you get stuck in these situations too?\u00a0 Do you just suck it up?
