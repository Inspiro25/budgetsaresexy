Here&#8217;s the latest from a guy who not only day trades, but day trades penny stocks<\/strong> &#x1f631;<\/p>\n<p>Not a post you&#8217;ll typically see on this blog since I&#8217;m a huge buy-and-hold\/index guy, but as promised earlier in the year, I want to be better about sharing other perspectives and strategies out there&#8230; Plus, some of his &#8220;rules&#8221; here are actually pretty good no matter how you invest!<\/p>\n<p>So please enjoy today, a note from a fellow reader of this blog, &#8220;Brandon&#8221;, who shares his experience with day trading as well as why he loves a newer investing app on the scene over Robinhood.<\/p>\n<p>Links to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/financial-confessions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previous Confessionals<\/a> can be found at the bottom of this post&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">I&#8217;ve Been Day Trading For 3 Years<\/h2>\n<p>So, day trading initially was a rocky start, meeting every expectation that you\u2019ll hear about them: DANGER DANGER DANGER! Hah.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I first started I had a major loss, so I went back to do more research and build my knowledge of how people make money on these things. A few books later, and a golden set of rules that I continually abide by, I now average 1-2% gain on my portfolio each day I trade&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Biggest loss:<\/strong> 84% of original portfolio ($2,000) after becoming too attached to a company called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moviepass.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MoviePass<\/a> \u2014 Big lesson learned here was not to fall in love with these stocks!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Biggest gain:<\/strong> 231% on a company called <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AXSM\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AXSM<\/a> -&gt; after a drug trial achieved its primary endpoint towards FDA approval.<\/p>\n<p>I specifically look for news items pre-market, and then have automatic alerts pushed to my phone from an application called Thinkorswim. These alerts will filter any news items or SEC filings for a watchlist I create. I begin by looking for stocks that are due for news or have had significant runs in the past, and then once I have that list set up, I\u2019ll get an alert, check the chart to confirm volume is coming in, and then enter that stock&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>My golden set of rules:<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. I keep emotion out of it.<\/strong> You have to avoid becoming attached to a stock, or <em>the idea<\/em> of a stock based on its business model or possible FDA approvals etc. as I learned early on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. I always have an exit strategy.<\/strong> This is where having a cash account that allows day-trading like with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webull.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webull<\/a> app is king. Using this strategy you can enter and exit a stock the same day without the risk of being marked a &#8220;pattern day trader&#8221; and having your account locked, or worse closed per the SEC rules. A lot of people starting out will buy a stock, and if they have a margin account (default for the <a href=\"https:\/\/robinhood.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Robinhood<\/a> app) they may not have a day trade in order to exit that stock&#8230; So they\u2019ll hold overnight possibly risking further loss or bad news being released the following morning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. I set acceptable loss and gain goals.<\/strong> I aim to gain 5-7% on any entry to a stock, and\u00a0 calculate the price it would have to reach in order to obtain those goals. Then I watch.. Once it hits that price I exit &#8211; no emotions, no &#8220;coulda shoulda&#8221;. When it hits, 5-7% gains I exit. This is in my personal opinion where a lot of people go wrong. They hope for that rocket that reaches 60-80% and hold just long enough for it to erase any gains at all&#8230; For acceptable losses, I usually mark this between 3-4% depending on the size of the position I enter. Once it hits that mark, I also exit. This is extremely important to avoid any huge losses because these stocks will drop FAST.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. I review trades each day.<\/strong> I\u2019ve developed a habit of going back and looking at all the trades I made that day, and determining if there was something I could have done better in executing those trades&#8230; If there was a loss, was there something I didn\u2019t see that I could look for in the future? Did I make a purchase too close to an earnings release? * ALWAYS RISKY WITH PENNY STOCKS * I then take those findings and incorporate them into my planning for future trades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. I&#8217;m not afraid to take a day off<\/strong>. Just because you have money in an account ready to go to work for you, doesn\u2019t mean you should make a trade&#8230; Like on days President Trump puts out a tweet regarding the trade war. Usually a good day to take off from the market, as even good news won\u2019t respond normally!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#6. I never enter a position with more than 20% of my total portfolio value.<\/strong> You\u2019ve heard the phrase &#8220;don\u2019t put all your eggs in the same basket&#8221; right? The same goes with day trading. If you drop the basket, all your Benjamins get crushed, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How I fund my portfolio:<\/strong> I take 20% of my after tax paycheck and divide it two ways: 10% into a standard savings account (2.2% interest w\/ Ally Bank), and then 10% into my Webull portfolio funds. Half of that portfolio then gets divided into long-term positions, and the other half towards day trading and highly volatile stocks. So basically 5% of my after tax money goes into day trading, which accounts for 25% of my overall saving\/investing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Resources:<\/strong> I love to read, and I\u2019ve read all of the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/recommend\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suggested books<\/a> you currently have up on Budgets Are Sexy&#8230; In addition, I went out and purchased &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2SaoR7r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Penny Stocks for Dummies<\/a>&#8221; which details all the negative and positive catalysts for a movement on these stocks. It also touches on fundamental analysis as well as technical analysis. In addition to that, I read &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2G3sCVP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Candlestick Charting for dummies<\/a>&#8221; which was a HUGE help getting my mind wrapped around which way a stock will go, if it\u2019s reached its max on the current catalyst, or if its oversold and starting to uptrend.<\/p>\n<p>However, the most beneficial resource I found was a Facebook group called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/pennystocksrobinhood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Penny Stocks w\/ Webull &amp; Robinhood for Beginners<\/a>&#8220;. Typically these groups tend to be very toxic, however this particular group is run by a single admin who runs an alert service (similar to Mad Money Jim Cramer\u2019s alerts) but the group is 100% supportive with a zero tolerance policy towards bullying, stock pumping, and referral link spamming. In this group anyone who asks a question is treated like a team member, and actively works to increase each other\u2019s knowledge and strategies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My Cash account strategy: <\/strong>I set myself up in order to enter no more than 5 positions in a single day. Therefore, I take my total portfolio value and divide that by 5 (# of trading days) that will give me the amount I am able to trade each day&#8230; I then divide that number by the number of day trades I wish to make, giving me the amount of cash I can use for each position. Of course I can tinker with it and allow 3 small entries and 2 large ones if I wanted for that day, but I keep it simple by just dividing by an even 5.<\/p>\n<p>All together since I&#8217;ve started day trading again I\u2019ve contributed about $5,000 and I\u2019ve turned that into $12,560.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At the end of the day, if someone randomly came up to me and asked what I thought of trading penny stocks, I would tell them it&#8217;s not for everyone.<\/strong> However if you have a set of rules you follow and always continue to improve your process, there\u2019s money to be made.<\/p>\n<p>******<\/p>\n<p><strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:<\/strong> None of this makes me personally want to go out and start day trading anytime soon (don&#8217;t even have the time for it if I wanted to! haha&#8230;), but I will say that if you re-look at those &#8220;rules&#8221; up there, they&#8217;re actually pretty applicable to *normal* investing too: knowing your limits, not putting in too much where you regret it later, reviewing past actions to improve future results, knowing the end game!, etc. So I will say out of all the day trading stories I&#8217;ve heard over my lifetime, this one is much more focused and strategic which I appreciate ;) So thanks for taking the time, Brandon!<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and then here are his notes on why he switched to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webull.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webull<\/a> investing app after using <a href=\"https:\/\/robinhood.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Robinhood<\/a> for two years and getting frustrated. I haven&#8217;t poked around it much myself yet, but it does look promising and can be used regardless of how you like to invest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pros to Webull:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commission free trading!<\/li>\n<li>Longer pre-market and after-hours trading (also free). Webull&#8217;s extended hours are 4:00am-9:30am and 4:00pm-8:00pm, compared to only 9:00am- 9:30am and 4:00pm-6:00pm w\/ Robinhood.<\/li>\n<li>They have a paper trading system built right into the app for those still learning the way to trading<\/li>\n<li>They give you cash accounts! Cash accounts take a little bit of planning and dedication, but with them comes the ability to day-trade more than three times a day without being locked out<\/li>\n<li>They do awesome promotions. During Christmas season they offered a $100,000 give away split between those members who collect &#8220;cards&#8221; by participating in the app\u2019s various features&#8230; which resulted in me getting a nice $78 contribution<\/li>\n<li>If you refer a friend they get a free stock for signing up, and after an initial deposit they get another free stock<\/li>\n<li>More advanced features than Robinhood like better technical analysis options, including Bid and Ask analysis, news and press releases as well as fundamental analysis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>******<\/p>\n<p><em>**There are no affiliate links to any of these apps or other items in the post, FYI, outside of the Amazon books.
