I thought about the different areas they were currently struggling with, and came up with their respective challenges:<\/p>\n<p><strong>For older bro #1 (8 y\/o): He has to go an entire month eating whatever we serve up for dinner that night &#8211; and not complain about it. <\/strong>We&#8217;d gotten into the bad habit of preparing him something different on nights he didn&#8217;t like what we were serving (a major fail on OUR part, of course, probably due to bad memories of our own childhoods of &#8220;if you don&#8217;t like it, starve!&#8221; LOL) and before we could get into more of the details he quickly complied, &#8220;I&#8217;m in.&#8221; And deal #2 was made.<\/p>\n<p>This time, however, I was smart enough to put a cap on the prize FIRST ($50), to which he said he&#8217;d let us know later what he wanted so he can enjoy all the possibilities first&#8230; Something his old man likes to do too ;) (So far he&#8217;s considered Pok\u00e9mon cards, Robux credit, a music player he can have all to himself, and most recently a drone after a Target visit &#8211; the place where all dreams come true)<\/p>\n<p>As for the oldest boy, 10 y\/o Not-So-<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-much-babies-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Baby Penny<\/a> who&#8217;s perfect in almost every single way (I&#8217;m allowed to say that because I&#8217;m his dad!) the challenge tailored to him was to go a whole month *<strong>without asking any questions he already knows the answers to*, or those he can easily figure out if he thinks hard enough.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s currently at that stage of asking never ending questions, one after another after another &#8211; which is fine! We encourage curiosity in our house! &#8211; but many of them we&#8217;ve noticed don&#8217;t really need to be asked if he just took a few seconds to think about it first. And if he catches himself before we can answer his questions, it doesn&#8217;t count &#8211; that way he&#8217;s got some wiggle room since admittedly he&#8217;s got more opportunity to fail than his brothers who only have to overcome their bad habits *once* each day. We also put the cap at $50 for him too, though interestingly he hasn&#8217;t even so much as *hinted* to what he wants in the end so I&#8217;m super curious to what&#8217;s brewing in there!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>But we&#8217;re now into week #4 of them all, and if you can believe it &#8211; everyone&#8217;s on track to get their prizes!!

And of myself for coming up with the genius plan, hahaha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Really goes to show how powerful rewards can be, though, both mentally and physically. All three of them had said over and over again how <em>hard<\/em> it is to overcome this stuff and that they &#8220;just can&#8217;t do it&#8221; before the challenges, yet here we are weeks later and they&#8217;re just breezing through it!! It was all in their head!! And of course ultimately I&#8217;m hoping it sticks WELL AFTER the deadline which was my ultimate motive for it all. Outside of just having some peace and quite for a little bit ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some of the key parts I think that have made this so successful &#8211; in case you want to try it out in your household ;)<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick things that can go on to become better *habits*<\/li>\n<li>Pick things that are *doable* for each of them <em>specifically<\/em> (all 3 of my kids were saying &#8220;how easy&#8221; each others&#8217; missions were, but that&#8217;s only of course because they&#8217;ve mastered &#8217;em already! The point is to overcome their unique struggles, which will be different for each kid)<\/li>\n<li>Pick things that really annoy you\/the entire family! lol&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Put in the clause &#8211; &#8220;if you miss a day, the clock starts over&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how often that last one comes up in conversation ;) It serves as a perfect back up motivator on days when you think they may slip up!<\/p>\n<p>We also incorporated some general leeway for each of them too, depending on the circumstance. For example, when my 8 y\/o got sick he could &#8220;pause&#8221; the mission until he was feeling better, and for the oldest boy as I mentioned he was able to &#8220;take back&#8221; his question if he catches himself before we answer it. But for the most part this &#8220;clock starting over&#8221; clause has been enough to keep them all on track so far&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s also important to know *what* exactly motivates them too.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some are excited over candy, others want cash, and then there&#8217;s the rare ones who just yearn for the inherent rewards of personal satisfaction ;) Candy and money bribes did *not* work in my case (nor the personal satisfaction &#8211; they laughed in my face when I brought that up!), but turns out the &#8220;world of possibilities&#8221; under a certain amount did motivate them enough to take action. All of which not being that different for us adults.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and here&#8217;s one more silly example of the power of rewards:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BudgetsAreSexy\/status\/1582810390823510016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66777\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/book-find-reward.png\" alt=\"book find reward\" width=\"640\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/book-find-reward.png 877w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/book-find-reward-300x90.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/book-find-reward-768x230.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/book-find-reward-550x165.png 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a>So cash hasn&#8217;t lost its edge entirely!
