Mostly small things, and with strangely accurate amounts. Things like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cracked my iPhone screen and had to pay $60 to repair it. While driving home from the repair store, I found some free side tables on the street and sold them online for $60!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last month my laptop died and I bought a new one online for $1,000. Immediately after ordering, the mailman dropped off some letters and inside were 2 targeted bank promotions. I signed up for both offers, which will earn me exactly $1,000 in welcome bonus cash!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got a surprise $73 discount when I was ordering some items the other day &#8230; But the win was short-lived as I found out later that my car had a parking ticket on it. Exactly $73.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess you could chalk these things up to coincidence, karma, or happenstance. I don\u2019t actually think I\u2019m Even Steven or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I do believe that even though unexpected expenses and bad things will pop up in my life, sometimes unexpected good things and money will fall into my lap, too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Budgeting for Unplanned Expenses<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if every unexpected expense were cancelled out by an unexpected windfall? We wouldn\u2019t ever have to budget, plan for mishaps, or set aside emergency savings!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, that\u2019s not the case in real life. We gotta have some type of plan to cover unforeseen costs. Where does that money come from?\u00a0 Even if we do have an emergency fund to tap into, we still need a way to top it back up after pulling money out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A reader recently asked me this question when I was talking about my very<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-my-fire-number-keeps-changing\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vague FIRE number and unknown future budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This came from Jessamee Sander in NY (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jessamee\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@jessamee<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWondering how you break down costs like &#8220;Phones.&#8221;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this simply the monthly plan amount? If so, should there be any consideration in this figure for an eventual phone repair and replacement? Same question for computers&#8230;and cars.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seems like a big underestimation people tend to make in budgeting like this is forgetting the fact that towels, and phones, and modems and computers and roofs tend to wear out. Where does the money come from to replace these things?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always come up with a low number for my basic existence when I look solely at monthly bills and expenses &#8212; but looking into the true expense of owning a thing paints a different picture.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, I had a fancy $3,500 MacPro that lasted me 8 years, I used it for all manner of personal and work-y things, and during that time it cost me nothing except the electricity it took to run it.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if I were to plan to replace the computer with the equivalent item at the end of 8 years, I would need to save about $1.20 per day or about $438\/year to put toward this purchase.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If one does this exercise for their computer, phone, car and\/or any\/all other consumable items in one&#8217;s life, the &#8220;true cost&#8221; really starts to add up and can destroy what looks like a frugal or conservative budget on the surface.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoughts?\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><b>Problem: Those Pesky Overlooked Expenses<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty interesting to think about. If you know a new computer will cost you $3,500 every 8 years, do you set aside $438 in your annual budget? Most people would say yes that\u2019s a smart thing to budget for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what if your computer breaks down in year 6 and you don\u2019t have enough money saved to buy the replacement? Or what if the future you in 8 years needs a computer that costs $5,000?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t even know where to start with the variable expenses like towels, bed sheets, pillows and other home stuff. How often do those need replacing, anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Solution: Budgets Aren\u2019t Exact. They Need Wiggle Room<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody is a perfect budgeter. It\u2019s almost impossible to predict the exact amount of dollars you and your family will spend each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are <\/span><b>ways to keep a budget flexible<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to accommodate changes within the year and stay on track with our financial goals:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. Round Up on Your Expected Expenses, and Overestimate a Little<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For almost every category in my budget, I round up to the nearest hundred dollars. Or, I overestimate a little for categories that I\u2019m not certain about. This gives us wiggle room for mistakes or unexpected price increases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, my wife and I pay $90 per month for our 2 cell phone plans. I have this as a $100 line item in our monthly budget, which gives us an extra $120 baked into our annual estimate. Not a massive amount, but it could cover a small AT&amp;T plan increase, or pay for the odd cracked screen repair. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(For phone hardware replacements, we buy our friends&#8217; old models when they upgrade, or usually they\u2019ll just give them to us for free &#8212; we have nice friends.)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Keep a \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d Category in Your Budget for Periodic Expenses<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many years ago I started including a \u201ccash &amp; ATM\u201d line item in our budget to allow me and my wife to spend a bit of cash here and there without having to categorize it. Since we rarely use cash these days, this has now morphed into a \u201cmisc\u201d bucket. For 2021 we have $500 in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$500 won\u2019t cover a huge surprise expense, but it could definitely cover things through the year like traffic fines, bank fees, insurance increases, or surprise flowers for my wife one day. &#x1f60a;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3. Be Able to Scale Back Your Spending Plan in Some Areas, If Needed<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth be told, my bare-bones budget isn\u2019t really that bare at all. There\u2019s a bunch of typical expenses I could cut back on. I think many people realized the same in 2020 when they were forced to cut out dining, travel, and other things they may have thought were necessary living expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my wife and I, we have a healthy travel budget ($5k), booze budget ($3k), and even a budget category for charity ($5k). If we had an unexpected emergency expense that needed thousands of dollars, like a medical bill, we could cut back in these other areas and still not exceed our annual total spend.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. Keep an Eye Out for Extra Income Opportunities<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of adjusting your budget to accommodate an expense, you might be able to make a few additional bucks to help cover things.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick up an extra shift at work, sign up for a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.doctorofcredit.com\/best-bank-account-bonuses\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bank bonus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or welcome offer, start a temporary<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">side hustle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sell something you don\u2019t need anymore, go to an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-find-estate-sale-deals-from-a-beverly-hills-bargain-hunter\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estate sale<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one weekend and see if you can flip an item online, or pick up a freelance or tutoring gig.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are income opportunities everywhere!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heck, the other day<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theworkathomewife.com\/cambly\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned about this website, Cambly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that pays you $10 per hour to just chat with people online in English!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m convinced that the reason I\u2019ve been having Even Steven coincidences more and more is because I\u2019m always looking for new money opportunities. The more I look around, the luckier I seem to get!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would love to hear how you guys handle contingency expenses in your budget. I guess it\u2019s not a huge deal if you\u2019re in the wealth accumulation phase of your life and have a high savings rate&#8230; But if you\u2019re retired and live on a tight income budget, every dollar counts.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you guys remember that episode of Seinfeld where Jerry learns he is \u201cEven Steven\u201d?
