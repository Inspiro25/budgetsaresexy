Also, this specific master&#8217;s degree + special ed credential will unlock even more possibilities and challenges within her field of passion in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, this post isn\u2019t about how awesome and smart my wife is (there aren\u2019t enough words to describe that), this is about how we are planning to pay for graduate school. Or rather, how *<\/span><b>her parents* have offered to pay for her grad school.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Accepting Big Gifts as an Adult Feels Weird \u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we started sharing her plans for grad school late last year, my wife\u2019s parents\u2019 eyes lit up!&#8230; They\u2019d been saving for her college education their whole life and proudly put her through undergrad with the intention of paying for more schooling if she wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 10 years ago (before we were married), my wife started grad school but stopped halfway through to pursue other stuff. So, her parents think it\u2019s only fair that they continue paying for the remainder of her education now because they had planned to and never finished.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if I\u2019m being honest, I feel a little uncomfortable accepting their offer. I wasn\u2019t raised with an option of free college <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(don\u2019t get me wrong, I come from an extremely privileged background \u2013 my parents gave me everything *except money*)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so it feels strange accepting a gift of this size.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, my wife and I are self-sufficient adults now. We have earned and saved our own money to pay for the things we want to pursue in life, whether it be vacations, lifestyle upgrades, or continued education. I feel it\u2019s our responsibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why let someone else pay for our stuff when we can afford it ourselves?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you might be thinking\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJoel, this isn\u2019t a gift for YOU, this is a gift for your wife. It\u2019s between her and her parents.\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while yes that\u2019s a valid argument, we actually both benefit financially from this. My wife and I share everything in life \u2013 our money, our passions, our successes, struggles\u2026 everything. A gift to her is a gift to me. And vice versa.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Do I Feel Awkward Accepting Gifts?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I need to grow up and get over this feeling. So I\u2019ve started asking myself WHY I feel weird getting gifts\u2026 And most of my reasons are pretty dumb now that I write them out:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I don\u2019t like feeling \u201cin debt\u201d to other people.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I don\u2019t know why, but whenever I get a gift, I feel guilty until I can give back something equal in return. Especially big gifts\u2026 Like, if a friend got me a gift worth $500 for my birthday, I kind of feel obligated to spend $500 on their birthday, even though that\u2019s way more than I would regularly spend.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I have too much pride and ego.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These are things I\u2019m learning to swallow more and more as I grow older and get more mature. But I\u2019ll admit, earning and paying for my own stuff myself makes me feel better than just getting things for free.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Maybe deep down I don&#8217;t feel worthy?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are 7 billion other people on this planet who probably deserve gifts more than I do. No matter the gift size, someone out there needs it more than me and my wife.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I don\u2019t want to be a financial burden on others.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Having parents pay for stuff feels like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the opposite<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of financial independence. (Although ironically, receiving money brings us closer to FIRE because we can save more.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019d rather be the giver than the receiver.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019m getting better at this as I grow older\u2026 I\u2019m realizing that part of giving IS receiving. Refusing gifts robs the other party of the very feeling that I love.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whoa, that was a lot of sharing my feelings. I know this is a first world problem and you probably think I\u2019m an ungrateful little shit. Believe me, I know how blessed I am in life and I 100% acknowledge these are good problems to have. I\u2019m just sharing my situation and being honest.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Accepting Gifts and Changing My Mind-Set<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sooooo\u2026 long story short, we are accepting the parents&#8217; offer and they will pay for grad school. My wife only has about 12 months of classes left to complete her degree, and she found an online university that\u2019ll cost about $20k all in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And going forward, I\u2019m releasing my bottled feelings of guilt, embarrassment and discomfort when receiving gifts\u2026 Instead, I\u2019m converting all those feelings into gratitude, appreciation, celebration, and respect for the gift givers. Generous parents set amazing examples, and their acts are teaching US how to be more generous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, my wife and I hope to pay forward all the blessings we receive in life. Perhaps we should add some more funds to our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/giving-stock-ugma-custodial-account\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nephews\u2019 UGMA gift accounts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Actually, maybe we should start setting aside money for our future adopted kids\u2019 education?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any of you out there received massive gifts from your parents? Would love to hear your thoughts\/feelings if you\u2019re open to sharing.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sincerely,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I haven\u2019t told many people this, but my wife decided she wants to go back to grad school and finish off her masters in special&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/i-feel-awkward-receiving-gifts-time-to-get-over-it-%f0%9f%a4%b7%e2%80%8d%e2%99%82%ef%b8%8f\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":28,"featured_media":62426,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[196],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-64434","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-other"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>I Feel Awkward Receiving Gifts ...
