Hauling 96 packages of toilet paper, 72 tubes of toothpaste, 66 sticks of deodorant, 84 rolls of paper towels, 69 bottles of body wash\/shampoo, 57 bars of soap, 48 bottles of dish detergent was exhausting, not to mention countless cans of veggies, soups, tomato sauce, peanut butter, jelly, and boxes of everything from cookies to mac &amp; cheese. We have enough toothbrushes to last into the next century.<\/p>\n<p>The list goes on &amp; on but the real killer was 46 heavy containers of laundry detergent. What a pain in the ankle (and every other bone it took to move all these treasures\u2026cough cough).<\/p>\n<p>And yes, I had already donated a ton of my stockpile! This is when I FINALLY realized this obsession had gone off the deep end. God forbid I missed a sale or a coupon expired at one of the 10 stores I shopped &#8211; I\u2019d cry in my pillow all night, LOL. Okay it wasn\u2019t quite that bad but man, this was a drain on my time &amp; emotions running from store to store &amp; hoping to get there before they ran out of stock on a good sale item (I always fell for the fine print in an ad \u201cwhile supplies last\u201d = run to store immediately).<\/p>\n<p>I remember once a month Harris Teeter had &#8220;Super Double Coupons&#8221;. They doubled any coupon up to $2 (so a $2 coupon would double to $4). They were the only store in the area to do this. Lines of people added to my anxiety &#8220;forcing&#8221; me to get up at 4AM to arrive at the store at 4:20AM to beat the competition on the first day of Super Doubles. Store policy though? No check out before 7AM during Super Doubles.<\/p>\n<p>Like an idiot, I shopped the store 2 hours &amp; stood on line over 1\/2 hour until they opened the cash registers at 7AM. Some sale items were out of stock by 7AM on the first day! And they almost never restocked during the sale (I knew this as I\u2019d go back to the store 2-3 times during Super Doubles after I printed out more coupons or if my mother snail mailed me more coupons) so this added to my frenzy.<\/p>\n<p>Coupons were almost a narcotic to me. Today I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve attended Super Double coupons only twice since we moved &amp; it was purely by accident that I walked into the store for something else I needed. It\u2019s nice living off this stockpile, but I now only clip coupons for things needed in the immediate future &amp; only go to 2 grocery stores within 2 miles of each other. I stock up on sale items we use, with or without a coupon &amp; no more big stockpiles.<\/p>\n<p>I no longer HUNGER for this FEEDING frenzy, LOL. No more extreme anything for me except regret for letting myself get caught up in this crap. What good is having 50 jars of peanut butter if they all expire next week?<\/p>\n<p>********<\/p>\n<p>PS: I also used to wait in the parking lot for drug stores to open at 7AM, especially on Sundays, when traffic was low &amp; the sales started. Everyone knew me by my first name since I was a regular customer. Since we moved &amp; I broke the coupon addiction, no one knows me in any store now, LOL.<\/p>\n<p>PPS: I found myself emailing companies often too, asking for <em>more<\/em> coupons and pretending to be a brand new customer wanting to try out their products. It worked every time. Presto, more coupons emailed or snail mailed to me. Lordy lordy, what a trap I allowed myself to fall into&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Oh Debbie :) But rest assured, I guarantee you&#8217;re not alone here.<\/strong> I bet if we polled everyone reading this right now, at least 10% would admit to extreme couponing in some fashion or another! I would have too if I weren&#8217;t so lazy! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But it really was such a craze&#8230; I remember reading <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2GclST5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Predictably Irrational<\/a> over the summer by Dan Ariely (a fantastic book, btw), and a big part of it was how everyone goes gaga for &#8220;FREE&#8221; anything as if it were in our genes and we couldn&#8217;t control it, haha&#8230; But then if the cost changed from $0.00 to $0.10 or even $0.01, the excitement dropped sharply! Even though we&#8217;re talking about literal pennies!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54783\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/its-for-free.gif\" alt=\"it's for free\" width=\"500\" height=\"211\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We are a crazy race, let me tell you&#8230; And I fully admit to falling for this &#8220;FREE&#8221; trick over the years too.
