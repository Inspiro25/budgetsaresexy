You can ignore it all you like, but if you think you&#8217;re invincible to doing any maintenance, think again.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t go into it a moron like I did&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at all the biggies Clever Dude is facing here in the near future &#8211; I&#8217;m not an appliance kinda guy, but I reckon if all those things exploded all at once he&#8217;d be left a solid $30k or $35k bill.\u00a0 Which I think is the point of his post (and also, I just went back to verify and I was right:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cleverdude.com\/content\/were-sitting-on-a-time-bomb\">$30k-$40k worth of damage<\/a> if all went to hell).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Water Heaters<\/strong>: Lasts 10-11 years. We have 2 water heaters. One (gas) is about 15 years old and the electric one is about 13. Both are well past their lifespan.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dishwashers:<\/strong> Lasts 9-10 years. Ours is about 9 years old now.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Carpet:<\/strong> Lasts 10 years. We have 3 rooms where we haven\u2019t replaced yet and all are at least 14 years old and have had pets and most likely smokers on them. Two rooms have original hardwood underneath, but we don\u2019t know the quality and I\u2019d rather just replace with the same Pergo floor as the rest of the house.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fridge<\/strong>: Lasts about 13 years. Ours is about 9 years, but I\u2019ve already replaced a lot of parts on it myself so I\u2019m not sure how long it will last ultimately. I know it was an expensive fridge when they bought it based on the receipt, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s reliable.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clothes washer:<\/strong> Lasts 10 years. Ours is probably 14 years or older. The knob broke off years ago, but we\u2019ve been resourceful and use pliers to start it up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clothes dryer:<\/strong> Lasts 13 years. We\u2019re actually on our 3rd dryer. The first came with the house and the next two (counting our current one) came for free from our friend.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Furnace and Air Conditioner:<\/strong> Lasts 15-20 years. Ours is about 16 years old, but it\u2019s a high-efficiency unit. We\u2019ve spent about $1000 over the years on repairs, but it just takes one crack in the heat exchange unit to jack up the cost of repair to the point of replacement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Roof: <\/strong>It varies, but our shingles are 20 year warrantied. I was just up on our roof recently and the roof looks good, but there\u2019s a bit of buckling in one spot (I noticed it a few years ago) and it appears they just put the new layer of shingles over the original on the old part of the house. That could cause problems.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pool Plaster Lining:<\/strong>\u00a0Ours is supposed to last 15-20 years, but we\u2019re noticing it thinning and lots more \u201cblue stuff\u201d in the cleaner than 8 years ago. We spent $7000 just 2 years ago on brick and tile-work, and I expect to spend another $7000 on replastering the pool in the next 3-4 years (it\u2019s quartz plaster, not the regular stuff that would cost $4-5k).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And here&#8217;s where we are &#8211; not *as* crappy, but still scary:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Water Heater<\/strong>: We have one, at about 6 years old &#8211; I think we&#8217;re okay for a few more years?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Carpet:<\/strong> Our entire main level needs to be done, but the rest is okay for now&#8230; could we go longer w\/out anything updated? Sure, but eventually it gets gross.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fridge<\/strong>: I think ours is a good 10-15 years old.\u00a0 And every now and then it stops working for a few hours. DEF time to get a new one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clothes washer &amp; Dryer:<\/strong> Were on our 4th opair, all of which we&#8217;ve <a href=\"..\/2008\/04\/our-house-likes-to-eat-up-our-dryers\/\">gotten off Craigslist<\/a> for $50-$100 each (which is probably why they keep puttering out, haha&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Furnace and Air Conditioner:<\/strong> This one scares me the most as I&#8217;ve heard they can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000, and our is at least 6 years old that I know, maybe more.\u00a0 It stopped a few times in the past 5 years, but luckily each time it was something small like a fuse or bad wire or something that only cost $100 to fix.\u00a0 But one day?\u00a0 Not so lucky.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Roof: <\/strong>This is our best &#8220;win&#8221; w\/ the house, we got the entire roof replaced as part of our buying contract &#8211; so it&#8217;s now about 4-5 years old. (The one smart thing we did when negotiating&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pool Plaster Lining:<\/strong> N\/A &#8211; I&#8217;ll never own a pool for exactly this reason.\u00a0 But maybe a hot tub one day (bow chicka wha wha!).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Clever Dude&#8217;s def. roughed up more than we are (sorry buddy!), but it just goes to show that this stuff is non-stop and always needs to be handled throughout the entire owning process.\u00a0 Something which is never your problem when renting &#8211; even though yes, you are &#8220;throwing away&#8221; your money (or as I like to think of it, &#8220;buying peace of mind!&#8221; Haha&#8230;).<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then of course, there&#8217;s all the <a href=\"..\/2011\/10\/update-mortgage-payoff-plan\/\">cosmetic stuff<\/a> you&#8217;d be tempted to do too at some point.<\/strong> Things like upgrading counter tops, your cabinets, putting in hardwood floors or tiles, getting everything stainless steel, refinishing the basement, building out secret passages, etc etc ;) Not things you may want to do right away, especially as a new home buyer, but stuff nonetheless that will creep up on you once you&#8217;re nice and settled in. Until you&#8217;re ready to upgrade to a bigger, fancier house of course ;)<\/p>\n<p>My point?\u00a0 Just promise to consider all of this stuff when you&#8217;re out and about getting giddy home shopping.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not trying to sway you from doing it, or telling you home ownership is bad &#8211; it&#8217;s not, even though <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/10\/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house\/\">it&#8217;s not my favorite thing<\/a> in the world &#8211; but I do want you to know there&#8217;s a lot more to it than just a purchase price and low interest rate. And one way to really stay on the safe side is by buying a home WITHIN YOUR BUDGET.\u00a0 Even if you can afford more, or bigger, it&#8217;s not necessarily the best move.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So just keep it all in mind for me, that&#8217;s all.<\/strong> If you&#8217;ve been diligently saving up, and found your dream house and are all ready to roll, go for it!\u00a0 I&#8217;ll be nothing but supportive of you if you&#8217;re doing it consciously, and have a nice <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-big-should-an-emergency-fund-for-a-rental-property-be\/\">emergency fund<\/a> saved up :)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you other home owners want to add?\u00a0<\/strong><\/em> Any biggies that you wish you knew more about when buying?\u00a0 Or are all you happy little campers?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/davidlocke\/\">David Locke1<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My boy Clever Dude threw out a whopper of a post the other day, pretty much summarizing my biggest fears of home ownership ;)\u00a0 (Besides&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/stuff-new-home-owners-never-think-about\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[8],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-20429","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-home-ownership"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Stuff New Home Owners Never Think About... | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/stuff-new-home-owners-never-think-about\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Stuff New Home Owners Never Think About... | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"My boy Clever Dude threw out a whopper of a post the other day, pretty much summarizing my biggest fears of home ownership ;)\u00a0 (Besides...
