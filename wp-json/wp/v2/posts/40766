Money Anything Day,&#8221;<\/strong> and 50+ questions later my fingers fell off and we called it a day. I answered everything from blogging, to budgeting, to mortgages, retirement, money mistakes, career, and even what the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow is ;)<\/p>\n<p>It was a ton of fun, and if you find yourself bored anytime pop over there and check it out: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/ask-j-money-anything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ask J$ Anything Day<\/a>. You might even find the answer to what my 2013 taxes show I made last year!<\/p>\n<p><strong>One of the questions I get asked all the time, of course, is <em>how I make money online<\/em> from my blogs and projects.<\/strong> It seems hard to believe that you can get paid to drink coffee and goof off all day on the internet (exact words from someone once!), but there&#8217;s quite the opportunity online if you&#8217;re willing to put in the time and hustle. And also, if you&#8217;re *passionate* (I haven&#8217;t met anyone successful yet that&#8217;s &#8220;just in it for the money.&#8221; Those people usually burn out before ever making it because there&#8217;s 1,001 other ways to make $$ much faster than with a blog! Though it is fun&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>So today I thought I&#8217;d answer that question more specifically since I&#8217;ve only shared bits and pieces around before. Every year it seems to fluctuate, but you&#8217;ll get a good idea of all the different angles you can earn money from being on the web. I literally had no idea of any of this 7 years ago!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s an exact question I was recently asked:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>How do you make money? Like literally? Who pays you?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the short answer: I make money from advertising, coaching, freelancing, side projects, flipping sites, and a number of other ways. The people who literally pay me are companies and networks who advertise with me, along with bloggers and people who I partner with or coach.<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s the longer, more specific, answer:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advertising on budgetsaresexy.vercel.app<\/strong> &#8212; This comes in all forms such as those visual ads you see up there at the top and along the sidebar, as well as partnerships, giveaways, affiliate stuff (ie when I promote kick-ass companies I love and use and others sign up too, like with USAA or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/recommend\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finance books I recommend<\/a>), and other type avenues. The thing you won&#8217;t see here are crappy &#8220;sponsored posts&#8221; from random foreign companies&#8230; If something is crappy here, it&#8217;s because me ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advertising on RockstarFinance.com<\/strong> &#8212; Same general setup as above, just with less money since the traffic is comparatively smaller<\/li>\n<li><strong>Freelance writing<\/strong> &#8211; $100-$1,000 per article on money<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blog Coaching<\/strong> &#8212; $50-$100 for a one hour, one-on-one session of blog help<\/li>\n<li><strong>Money Coaching<\/strong> &#8212; $50 for a one hour, one-on-one session of <a title=\"money coach\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/official-money-coach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money help<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Advertising Consulting<\/strong> &#8212; I help place ads for some people and take a % of those placed<\/li>\n<li><strong>Site Buying\/Selling\/Flipping<\/strong> &#8212; I help bloggers buy and sell sites for a small &#8220;broker&#8221; commission (last week I helped sell 10 of them &#8211; yay!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Random one-off projects<\/strong> &#8212; This could be anywhere from building my own side projects to helping companies collaborate with finance bloggers. And the income can be as low as $0.00 (or worse, in the negatives! Like when my projects bomb!) or if I&#8217;m lucky in the $20,000+ range. Like when I got paid to help a large financial company place dozens of ads across the blogosphere. That project netted me $22,000 for about 28 hours of work &#8211; all over a weekend! But of course that rarely happens or else I&#8217;d be a millionaire by now&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>So my income pretty much comes from a hodgepodge of side hustles :)<\/strong> Remember that I treat my projects as <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/12-month-goals-workaholism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50% business and 50% pleasure<\/a> though. If it was all business all the time I&#8217;d be making 500% more! Haha&#8230; But since that&#8217;s boring and I like to have equal parts fun, I&#8217;m always dabbling around in order to make a &#8220;full&#8221; salary. Gone are the days of having my side hustles as *extra* money since I took <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/12\/i-just-got-fired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the plunge into self-employment<\/a> 3 years back. At the same time, gone is blogging out of pure hobby too now that I support a family of 4 myself.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40879\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/not-player-blog-a-lot.jpg\" alt=\"I'm not a player I just blog a lot\" width=\"400\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/not-player-blog-a-lot.jpg 400w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/not-player-blog-a-lot-300x261.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Something else to keep in mind is that the interests and skills of us blogging\/building stuff behind the scenes change as time goes on as well. For the better, or the worse. For example, if I answered this same question about my revenue streams a few years ago it would look entirely different.<\/p>\n<h2>How I made money a few years ago:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertising on budgetsaresexy.vercel.app<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on Finance Site #2<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #3<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #4<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #5<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #6<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #7<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #8<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #9<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #10<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on\u00a0Finance Site #11<\/li>\n<li>Advertising on Giveaway Website<\/li>\n<li>Commission from our Advertising Network<\/li>\n<li>Random one-off projects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>[Names of websites withheld due to privacy and signed contracts, sorry!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>You don&#8217;t see any coaching, freelancing, site flipping, etc<\/strong>. I was all about my financial empire and soaking in that advertising money (while learning a $hit ton about business at the same time). At the peak of this I think I was making $150k a year, but then I started not having fun. I became a &#8220;business, man&#8221; as Jay-Z likes to say, and strayed far away from the &#8220;hobby&#8221; part like I&#8217;m back to now.<\/p>\n<p>So what did I do with all those sites? I sold them. Yet another perk (and income stream!) of owning websites &#8211; you can flip them if they&#8217;re decent and producing revenue! And there&#8217;s a good shot that some of the blogs you read today have been bought and sold over their lifetime :) Bet you never knew that, huh? (I should note,\u00a0 however, that not all sites succeed financially online. In fact, *most* of them do not. And I&#8217;ve had my fair share of losers too &#8211; some of which you&#8217;ll see below&#8230;)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of those projects I&#8217;ve since sold:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40774\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/projects-sold.jpg\" alt=\"projects sold\" width=\"326\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/projects-sold.jpg 326w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/projects-sold-300x252.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The last one I sold was the $8k one (breaking even), and fortunately I&#8217;ve had way more winners in there than losers :)<\/strong> But as you can see, there&#8217;s a healthy market for online real estate just as there is for physical real estate. And although I haven&#8217;t completed my dream of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/08\/trade-website-for-real-estate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trading an online property with a real one<\/a> one day, haha, overall I&#8217;m pretty happy with the way its turned out.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind these numbers are only profit from *flipping* the sites\/projects too &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t account for all the revenue you (hopefully) made while the sites were in your possession. I&#8217;ve made $5,000 a month on some of those bad boys in their heyday, while other times\u00a0 -$500.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some previous posts I&#8217;ve written while in the process of selling some of these&#8230;<\/strong> They&#8217;ll give you an interesting look on the different partnerships that can come out of it too &#8211; like how I sold these, and then got hired back to continue running them. So even if a site you read <em>has<\/em> been sold, it doesn&#8217;t mean the original blogger isn&#8217;t still there sharing all their sexy thoughts :) (Think of J.D. from Get Rich Slowly. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getrichslowly.org\/blog\/2012\/01\/31\/how-and-why-i-sold-get-rich-slowly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">He sold years ago for over a million dollars<\/a>, but continued to write for it for years &#8211; without anyone the wiser)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/50000-richer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We&#8217;re $50,000 Richer.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/what-doing-with-50k-business-profit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What We\u2019ll be Doing With This New $50,000<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And here&#8217;s an interview I just did with Kathleen from ForProfitBlogging.com too if it helps: <a href=\"http:\/\/forprofitblogging.com\/success-stories\/pour-your-heart-into-the-content-and-focus-on-what-you-like\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pour Your Heart Into the Content And Focus on What You Like<\/a>. As well as two other great sites to follow for making money online: <a href=\"http:\/\/microblogger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MicroBlogger.com<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/SmartPassiveIncome.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmartPassiveIncome.com<\/a>. Jeff Rose from GoodFinancialCents also has an epic guide on ways to make money, including a ton of beginner tips to you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodfinancialcents.com\/how-to-make-money\/#online\">on your way to making your\u00a0first online dollar<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Speaking of Smart Passive Income&#8230; <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You think people like me are killing it online? Not even close. That guy (Pat Flynn) literally makes <em>over $80,000 every single month<\/em>. EVERY. SINGLE. MONTH. And how do I know this? Because he&#8217;s such a brilliant teacher that he shares his monthly income reports with everyone so they can all learn too. Similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our net worth updates<\/a>, only on crack :) Last month he made $83,903.53 which is more than I have made all year! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You can see all of these income reports\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.smartpassiveincome.com\/my-income-reports\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And if you&#8217;ve ever wondered what&#8217;s in his wallet, here you go:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/smartpassiveincome.com\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/pat-flynn-wallet.jpg\" alt=\"pat flynn wallet\" width=\"600\" height=\"376\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>He was kind enough to snap this for me back when we were doing our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/wallet-crashing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wallet Crashing Series<\/a> (remember that?) but I ended up putting it on pause until apparently today ;) So enjoy the sneak peek into Pat Flynn&#8217;s wallet! Seen for the first time ever here! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Anyways, that&#8217;s how I make money online.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Pretty much through advertising and a bunch of random hustling. The beauty of the online world is that the possibilities to turn something into a business is HUGE if you put in the effort and energy. It&#8217;s not always fun or easy (most of us work 10, 12, 16 hour days &#8211; even over the weekend!) but if you&#8217;re dedicated and *passionate* the odds are greatly in your favor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And btw, we didn&#8217;t even cover any of the <em>OTHER<\/em> ways to make money online either.<\/strong> I don&#8217;t do 75% of the stuff that REALLY pays you well! Like making your own products, eBooks, real books, courses, public speaking, and tons of other smart business plays. I know some who have made $1 million+ on a single course (*ahem* <a href=\"http:\/\/iwillteachyoutoberich.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ramit<\/a>), while others have gone on to become New York Times best sellers or structure their site with so many income streams it sells for over $3+ Million! (*Ahem* <a href=\"http:\/\/microblogger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jim Wang<\/a>) Again, nothing without hard work or dedication, but the opportunity is def. out there.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a list of the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/08\/most-expensive-domain-names-in-world\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50 most expensive domains in the world<\/a> to really be impressed. If you scroll to the end you&#8217;ll see some sexy finance blogs I&#8217;ve included in there for fun too&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Back to hustling we go!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> You can get a lot of <em>other<\/em> stuff besides money too through blogging and online ventures. Non physical stuff like friendships, networks, business partners, and all that jazz, but also interesting things such as: free laptops, beds, gift cards, toys, hotel rooms, flights, lingerie (no joke!), safes, skateboards, and a ton of other stuff I can&#8217;t recall at the moment. It really is amazing the stuff that can come out of blogging&#8230; Both in personal growth, and in personal wealth :)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week we ran our (tri) annual &#8220;Ask J.
