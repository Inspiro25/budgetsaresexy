I like coffee as much as the next person (in fact, I&#8217;m literally sitting inside Starbucks right now drinking a cup as I type this), but man does that sound bad when compared like that. If I guestimate my own coffee expenses here real quick I&#8217;d say I spend about $40\/mo between take out and brewing at home,\u00a0which comes out to what, almost $500\/year? I&#8217;d never retire at that rate :(<\/p>\n<p>(Though to give fair credit to the younger gen &#8211; I probably would have answered the same thing depending on when I was asked. So there&#8217;s always hope for a great turn around!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Most [millennials] are willing to give up the chance to meet their favorite celebrity to pay off debt.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Umm yeah, I would hope so!!!
