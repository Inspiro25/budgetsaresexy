Money caught my eye:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BudgetsAreSexy\/status\/1018872058032386048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57150\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/get-what-you-get-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"get what you get\" width=\"506\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/get-what-you-get-tweet.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/get-what-you-get-tweet-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It got me thinking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m a parent, a teacher <em>and<\/em> an assistant principal. I spend A LOT of my days talking with kids and \u201cencouraging\u201d them to make \u201cgood choices\u201d (read: telling them what to do and how to do it).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As I let J. Money\u2019s words marinate in my head, I started to feel a knot begin to form in my stomach.<\/p>\n<p>You know that feeling you get when you have to eat your own words and chow down on humble pie? I had used those exact words with my own kids on a daily basis, but knew I hadn\u2019t always practiced what I\u2019d preached. It\u2019s an experience I get more than I care to admit.<\/p>\n<p>My mind started spinning like an out of control merry-go-round run by a spaced-out carnie.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What other pieces of advice do us adults give that we should take ourselves?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>They say that what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t really get what geese have to do with anything, but I know that if we\u2019re going to give advice to kids and actually <em>expect<\/em> them to take it, we should be living that advice out ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>After all, more is CAUGHT than is TAUGHT!<\/p>\n<p>So without further ado, here are 15 pieces of advice that adults give kids that we would do well to follow ourselves.<\/p>\n<h2>#1. &#8220;Stop complaining&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a parent, you\u2019ve heard these words come out of your mouth multiple times. I know I\u2019m often telling my kids that we shouldn\u2019t be complaining.<\/p>\n<p>I want them to focus on the positive, to be optimists, glass half full type of people. To not get bogged down by the negativity around them. But how often am I doing the exact opposite in my own mind?<\/p>\n<p>I lose my marbles thinking about the INSANITY of Costco and how much time I waste there. And when traffic is snarled anywhere all of a sudden, I become a certified driving instructor giving all sorts of free driving tips to other motorists!<\/p>\n<p>I also find myself complaining about the weather all the time, especially on vacations. But when I focus on the rain falling I miss out on everything that&#8217;s important &#8211; my beautiful and healthy wife and kids, getting to spend quality time with them, having the means to actually GO away on a vacation in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than let my complaining blind me to the many things I have to be grateful for, I need to be better about <a href=\"https:\/\/methodtoyourmoney.com\/how-to-stop-worrying-about-money\/#.W1qdqtJKjZs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">practicing gratitude as a discipline in my life<\/a>. Not only will it change my outlook, but people will like hanging out with me a lot more too.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. &#8220;If you want to act like a child, I&#8217;ll treat you like one!&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve all been there&#8230; your kid asks for something in the supermarket and you say no, setting off a display that makes Shock and Awe look more like Bert and Ernie.<\/p>\n<p>Not getting what you want is hard. It sucks, but we all know that kids need to learn this lesson otherwise they\u2019ll be in trouble as they get older.<\/p>\n<p>Let me ask you this though. When\u2019s the last time you said no to an impulse purchase? Were you surprised when you took J. Money&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/tracking-what-you-spend-on-wants\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;want&#8221; tracker<\/a> challenge?<\/p>\n<p>Kids do what feels good. Adults do what IS good.<\/p>\n<p>Be an adult.<\/p>\n<h2>#3. &#8220;I\u2019m going to count to 3\u2026&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Parents say this all the time to kids.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I\u2019m going to count to 3, and if you haven\u2019t INSERT WHATEVER YOU WANT YOUR KID TO DO , there\u2019s gonna be INSERT EMPTY, RIDICULOUS THREAT.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why do parents do this?<\/p>\n<p>Not only does it limit the child\u2019s ability to stall, but it also gives them an opportunity to stop and think about their options. (EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Especially if you start counting in partial steps as I have lately, haha&#8230; &#8220;2&#8230;.. 2 and 1\/2!&#8230; better hurry up!&#8230;. 2 and 3\/4&#8230;&#8230; Whew &#8211; you *just* made it!&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Counting to three can come in much more handy for adults. Going back to the impulse purchases would be a great place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Next time you\u2019re out window shopping and you see a thing you can\u2019t live without, try stopping, counting to three and then asking yourself:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is this a need or a want?<\/li>\n<li>Is this something I had planned on buying already?<\/li>\n<li>What would Warren Buffett do?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>After you\u2019ve pondered these questions, impose a 24 hour waiting period. If tomorrow comes and you still want the item as badly as you do right now, go for it! You&#8217;re allowed to spend money! Just not on every last thing out there.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. &#8220;One day you&#8217;ll thank me for this&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Saving money is hard for most people. This is because when you save money for your future self, your present-self feels like they\u2019ve just <em>lost<\/em> the money.<\/p>\n<p>And humans HATE losing.<\/p>\n<p>This is called &#8220;loss aversion,&#8221; and it\u2019s why we have such a hard time with delayed gratification.<\/p>\n<p>But trust me, saving now is a REALLY good thing, even though your present-self will hate you for it. As the ancient proverb goes, &#8220;The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>#5. &#8220;If all of your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>A legitimate, and logically penetrating, question that has caused the heads of kids worldwide to spin uncontrollably. In fact, it\u2019s become almost a clich\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>People have been doing dumb things for thousands of years, and then the people watching those people have continued to do those same dumb things for thousands of years even more.<\/p>\n<p>God &#8211; \u201cAdam, if you saw someone eat the apple, would you &#8211; ahhhh, idiot!! \u00a0I can\u2019t believe you ate the apple!!<\/p>\n<p>Most recently we saw this happen with Bitcoin. How many of the millions of people who invested in it really knew anything about it besides the fact it was &#8220;the future of money&#8221;? <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-update-801k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Even J. Money fell for it<\/a>! ;)<\/p>\n<p>As adults, we need to take the advice we\u2019re giving to our kids. Don\u2019t invest in something just because everyone around you is. And don&#8217;t copy any of the other dumb moves for that matter like playing the &#8220;who can have the bigger house&#8221; game!<\/p>\n<p>In middle school you had to work hard to fit in. It&#8217;s OK to stand out now that you&#8217;re an adult.<\/p>\n<h2>#6. &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford it&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>This is a lie parents like to tell their kids to get out of buying something for them. But the fact is most people <em>can<\/em> afford to buy what they want, but they <em>choose<\/em> not to.<\/p>\n<p>Life is all about choices and you can choose to afford pretty much everything within reason. If you think I\u2019m off my rocker, ask yourself how others who are making the same income as you can pull it off?<\/p>\n<p>Now, you may not like the choices they\u2019ve made and they may be <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/financial-things-ive-never-been-hardcore-enough-to-try\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">too extreme<\/a>, but don\u2019t lie to yourself and say you can\u2019t afford it. Instead, tell yourself you CHOOSE not to afford it.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a much more empowering way of thinking of it.<\/p>\n<h2>#7. &#8220;If it seems to good to be true, it probably is&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Even though adults LOVE to spread this little nugget of wisdom around, we don\u2019t often like to take it.<\/p>\n<p>When we hear the latest story of something that seems too good to be true, we still get caught up in believing that maybe THIS TIME it\u2019ll be different.<\/p>\n<p>I know I\u2019ve been burned by this. I had a colleague who had a \u201chot tip\u201d once on an investment, and being the savvy investor I was, I listened with interest (no pun intended).<\/p>\n<p>It was early 2008, and he was advocating the buying of Iraqi Dinar. At the time the Dinar was so undervalued that the thinking was, when the country stabilized, it\u2019d be exactly like Germany after WWII when it\u2019s currency skyrocketed.<\/p>\n<p>I had to admit, the returns being tossed around were AMAZING, and although it sounded too good to be true, if it had worked in Germany, why not the Middle East? Maybe this time would be different?<\/p>\n<p>Nope. It wouldn&#8217;t be.<\/p>\n<p>I bought a few hundred dollars worth, and now have a brick of worthless paper jammed in a drawer somewhere. I\u2019m still waiting for it it to pay off!<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This time&#8221; is NEVER different.<\/p>\n<p>If you ever hear a friend, or a friend of a friend, or especially a friend of a friend who\u2019s a money guy, GIVING INVESTING TIPS, run\u2026 Run like Forrest Gump and don\u2019t look back!<\/p>\n<h2>#8. &#8220;Eat your vegetables!&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>At its heart, this classic line to chide your kids into consuming more produce is really about doing things that are difficult or unpleasant in the short term, in order to reap the rewards in the long term.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why people exercise, wake up early to establish <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/anniversary-waking-up-early-like-benjamin-franklin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">powerful morning routines<\/a>, and don\u2019t pound Ben and Jerry\u2019s 7 days a week.<\/p>\n<p>As adults, we constantly need to be reminded to \u201ceat our vegetables\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Does budgeting suck? Ya, at times, but in the end, it&#8217;s worth it. Is it fun saving 15% or more of your income, which is essentially like taking a 15% reduction in present-day purchasing power? Nope. How about paying off loads of debt? HARD NO.<\/p>\n<p>So why do people do these things?<\/p>\n<p>Because they\u2019re eating the adult equivalent of their vegetables. They\u2019re doing the hard things NOW, so that they can reap a big payday LATER.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the ultimate exercise in delayed gratification.<\/p>\n<p>So eat up!!<\/p>\n<h2>#9. &#8220;Be polite and kind&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Kids the world over are instructed to do this from the moment they start playing with their little friends. If you were to ask parents why they give their kids this advice, they might say, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And they\u2019d be right.<\/p>\n<p>The world badly needs more kind people!<\/p>\n<p>But let\u2019s be a bit more strategic here. We all know that <em>building relationships<\/em> is one of the best ways to grow your career, business, and ultimately your income. And that doesn\u2019t happen if you\u2019re a jerk.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, you can still get things done and probably get them done quicker, but people don\u2019t like working with, or helping out, chumps. As the African proverb says, \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go with others.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#10. &#8220;There are starving people in Africa who would gladly eat your supper&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of Africa&#8230; This one has been around for A LONG time. And while I\u2019m not in the business of promoting guilt as a way to change behavior, the advice surely rings true.<\/p>\n<p>At its heart, this comment is about being grateful for what we have because there are so many people in the world who would die to be in our position. And many do as they make their way from war torn poverty to places that offer them the promise and hope of a new life.<\/p>\n<p>We shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for what we have. But we should 100% be grateful for it.<\/p>\n<p>Gratitude doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s a discipline that needs to be developed.<\/p>\n<p>Try starting your day with the following gratitude pump up session: write down 3 things you\u2019re grateful for currently: One should be simple, like the sun on your back or the wind in your face. The second should be a person in your life, and the third should be something you\u2019re looking forward to.<\/p>\n<p>As you build your gratitude muscles, your thankfulness will spill over into other parts of your life, and before long you\u2019ll find yourself not only finishing up all your supper, but devouring the vegetables!<\/p>\n<h2>#11. &#8220;Have you done your homework?&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Parents have been asking this question for millennia, and even more so in this present age of helicopter and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.todaysparent.com\/blogs\/snowplow-parenting-the-latest-controversial-technique\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">snowplow parents<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As adults though, when it comes to your money, have you done your own homework?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you know how much you\u2019re paying in interest on your debt?<\/strong> What\u2019s the interest on your credit cards? Do you know the terms? This info can be found on your credit card statements, online, or by calling the customer service number on the back of your cards.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How much are your investment fees?<\/strong> Are their other good options that would be less expensive? If you have an advisor and you don\u2019t know the answer to these questions, you probably need a new one (or switch to doing it yourself).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do you know <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how much you\u2019ll need<\/a> to retire?<\/strong> Do you know how much you need to be saving each month to get there? Or are you just kind of wingin\u2019 it? If you\u2019re flying by the seat of your pants, you\u2019d do well to either educate yourself with some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dinkytown.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">awesome online resources<\/a> or get in touch with a fee-only financial planner (you pay a flat fee and they give you financial advice. They don\u2019t sell any products so there\u2019s no conflict of interest).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have solid answers to these questions, you can\u2019t go outside and play with your friends :-)<\/p>\n<h2>#12. &#8220;You get what you get and you don&#8217;t get upset&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Oh how I love this phrase. The way it rolls off the tongue and it\u2019s ironclad logic has stymied my children more than a few times.<\/p>\n<p>But what if I took this same advice I so love to give to everyone else?<\/p>\n<p>What if we rolled with punches, had a go with the flow attitude, and didn\u2019t get so bent out of shape when things didn\u2019t go the way we wanted?<\/p>\n<p>Well, I can tell you we\u2019d all be a lot happier. I heard author Charles Swindoll once say that, \u201cLife is 10% what happens to you, and 90% how you react to it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Life isn\u2019t what happens when things go perfectly. Life is when things go <em>sideways<\/em> and get messed up. The sooner we learn to read and react to what life throws at us without getting our shorts in a knot, the happier we\u2019ll end up being.<\/p>\n<h2>#13. &#8220;You know, when I was your age\u2026&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cOh geez, here we go again\u2026\u201d said every eye-rolling young person as they hear this for the 45th time.<\/p>\n<p>Every generation feels like the one before them had it better, and each preceding generation feels like young people are spoiled, entitled whiners.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time we millennials changed things.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, housing was WAY cheaper. And wages, yes, compared to the cost of living, they were better. It\u2019s true, you didn\u2019t have to sell a kidney on the black market to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-pay-for-college-without-loans\/\">pay for college<\/a>! And yes, there wasn\u2019t reality TV (Ahhh, the good old days)<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no point in waxing poetic about yesteryear. The challenges are real and present, and in some cases, systemic. But they don\u2019t have to be excuses.<\/p>\n<p>We all face challenges. The generation before us had 18% interest rates, fuel shortages, mullets and Cyndi Lauper for crying out loud!! It wasn\u2019t exactly a cake walk!!<\/p>\n<p>It boils down to this: You can either get caught up making excuses for why you\u2019re not getting ahead with your money, or you can go out, get after it and make things happen for yourself. Excuses are a MASSIVE waste of time. Look at any successful person and what you\u2019ll find is an extreme level of accountability for their situation.<\/p>\n<p>As Ben Franklin once said, \u201cHe that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#14. &#8220;Money doesn&#8217;t grow on trees!&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s true. I have yet to find a tree that produces actual dollar bills. But it sure as heck feels like some people have an easier time getting cash than others!<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s their secret?<\/p>\n<p>For most, the secret to finding their very own money tree is by growing their main income, as well as developing multiple streams of income.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve got a job where there\u2019s even the slightest possibility of upwards mobility, you should be working as hard as you can to make that happen. Even if you don\u2019t love your job, do your best and go above and beyond so you&#8217;ll stand out and get noticed. And when you do, you\u2019ll cash in on your hard work!<\/p>\n<p>Second, most people who seem to be swimming in money continually practice the art of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growing side incomes<\/a>. Whether it\u2019s through rental properties, investments, freelancing, a blog, or some other gig, they hustle hard when everyone\u2019s sleeping, and then set their money up to compound while they go to sleep themselves.<\/p>\n<p>People don&#8217;t get rich with only their 9-5 or by winning the lottery. They get rich by grinding and putting their money to work.<\/p>\n<h2>#15. &#8220;Clean up, clean up &#8211; everybody everywhere. Clean up, clean up &#8211; everybody do your share&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Do you know who Derek Fisher is?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a basketball fan, you probably do.<\/p>\n<p>Fisher was an 18 year veteran of the NBA. He played for a bunch of teams, journeying all over the league, but his most successful years were in his two stints with the LA Lakers.<\/p>\n<p>Why am I talking about Derek Fisher?<\/p>\n<p>Well, Fisher joined the Lakers in 1996. They sucked pretty bad at that time. But in 1996, the Lakers acquired a talented and cocky high school phenom by the name Kobe Bryant as well as the original Big Diesel, Shaq.<\/p>\n<p>After a few years of growing pains as a team, the Lakers became a force to be reckoned with, taking home 3 straight NBA titles in 2000, 2001 and 2002 with Shaq and Kobe getting all the glory and press.<\/p>\n<p>But then the Lakers stopped winning championships for a few years. In fact, they didn\u2019t win again until taking home back to back titles in 2009 and 2010.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What happened to cause this dry spell for the Lake Show?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, in 2004, Shaq got traded. You\u2019d be tempted to think that\u2019s why the Lakers couldn\u2019t bring home the hardware they had before, but you\u2019d be wrong.<\/p>\n<p>It was in 2004 that Derek Fisher left the team and signed a multi-million dollar deal with the Golden State Warriors that did them in.<\/p>\n<p>Three years later Fisher rejoined the Lakers, and they went right back to making the finals again, losing their first one, but going on to win back to back championships with Fisher at point guard and Shaq still gone.<\/p>\n<p>Now Fisher wasn\u2019t the best player on any of those teams to be sure. Kobe and Shaq were the dominant forces. What made Fisher so important was that he played his role <em>incredibly well<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Because Kobe and Shaq were such beasts, teams would often send two players to double-team one of them, leaving a player with no defender on him. Often, that happened to be Fisher. And because he developed a reputation for being able to hit clutch shots, his teammates would seek him out time and time again in those situations.<\/p>\n<p>All Fisher did was deliver. Time and time again.<\/p>\n<p>The point: the quicker you realize that you\u2019re part of a team and everyone has an important role to play, the further you&#8217;ll go together.<\/p>\n<p>This is true in your family, at work, and in all your other relationships.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bringing It All Together&#8230;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>So there you have it, 15 slices of humble pie for adults everywhere to keep in mind as they continue the tradition of spreading these sayings to their own kids.<\/p>\n<p>My goal with writing this list isn\u2019t to make you feel bad about yourself, but to get you to keep in mind the following two things:<\/p>\n<p><strong>First, to remember to be CONSCIOUS about what you are saying to your kids, and not just giving them the \u2018ol jump off a bridge routine because that\u2019s what your parents said to you!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have a thoughtful conversation with them, a talk about how hard it is to not follow the crowd, or to be grateful, or to delay instant gratification. Not only will your kids appreciate the skipping of a lecture whenever they do dumb things, but they\u2019ll love you for your honesty and it&#8217;ll help develop a much closer relationship together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Second, to remember to <em>pause <\/em>and<em> reflect<\/em> on whether you\u2019re living like you&#8217;re wanting to be.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Are you actually practicing what you preach, or are you just saying one thing and doing another &#8211; drifting along aimlessly through life?
