I&#8217;m off galavanting at <a href=\"https:\/\/finconexpo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FinCon<\/a> for the next handful of days, so please enjoy this fun little guest post while I&#8217;m away by <strong>Jess Chua<\/strong> over at the <a href=\"http:\/\/oldpodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optimal Living Daily<\/a> podcast. I bet many of you can relate to this &#8211; I know I can at least!! ;)]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<p><strong>I managed to sail through my teenage years without much trouble regarding the skin on my face.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This all changed in my early twenties when a sudden onset of acne overtook my once smooth and blemish-free complexion. <i>Oy vey!<\/i><\/p>\n<p>It was a definite hit to my self-esteem initially, and the stress and frustration became a vicious negative cycle that fed itself.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout this harrowing but enlightening experience, I learned several lessons about frugality and minimalism. I had always been a somewhat thrifty person (most of the time), but dealing with acne made me more conscious of my approach to money, consumerism, and budgeting.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what my acne battle taught me:<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Sometimes, You <i>Don\u2019t <\/i>Get What You Pay For<\/h2>\n<p>At the prompting of several concerned friends and family members, I bought a month\u2019s subscription to a well-known acne treatment system.<\/p>\n<p>Something didn\u2019t feel right early on as my face increasingly dried out and got irritated the longer I stuck with the products.<\/p>\n<p><i>Why is this happening? <\/i>I\u2019d think to myself several times throughout the day as I scrutinized the label and claims they made.<\/p>\n<p>I stopped using the products when I noticed it was leaving <em><strong>WHITE STREAKS<\/strong><\/em> on my face towel.<\/p>\n<p>What was that white substance? A quick Google search told me that <em>Benzoyl Peroxide<\/em> was one of the best \u201canti acne ingredients\u201d available, and that it was a powerful bleaching agent like most peroxides.<\/p>\n<p>Part of me felt like I was kicking up a fuss and just needed to continue using the system to get the results. But part of me also just wanted to seek out other options. If the ingredients could leave white streaks on a towel, what was it doing to my skin and body?<\/p>\n<p>I decided to listen to my gut and explore simpler options which could be effective AND friendly to my wallet.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. Keep Things Simple<\/h2>\n<p><em>[EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Yet another example of the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-beauty-of-simplicity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beauty of simplicity<\/a> from yesterday! Which I didn&#8217;t plan at all I promise! ;)]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This led me to read up about basic skincare and how the Number One Thing irritated and aggravated skin needs is&#8230; less irritation and aggravation.<\/p>\n<p>It sounds like common sense &#8212; and it is &#8212; though it was hard to accept when nothing seemed to be working at the time to clear up the acne.<\/p>\n<p>I spent lots of time reading up about various approaches to skincare. In particular, I enjoyed the Japanese approach to it, which tends to emphasize <em>fewer<\/em> but <em>higher quality<\/em> ingredients in the products.<\/p>\n<p>Trendy (and pricey!) items like \u201csnail-mucin essence\u201d face masks sounded tempting to try on an adventurous day. But I gravitated towards gentle and effective items like fragrance-free oatmeal bar soap to keep my face clean without irritating it.<\/p>\n<p>Reading up on sensitive skin and the ingredients to avoid helped me really narrow down my choices when it came to the endless amount of skincare products out there. Through my research and obsessive studying of ingredient labels, I realized that more expensive products didn\u2019t necessarily mean that they were free from harmful or low-quality substances.<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Be A More Conscious Consumer<\/h2>\n<p>The acne treatment system I had tried had a media budget that was upwards of $200 million, on top of several millions per year that was allocated to celebrity endorsements.<\/p>\n<p>I sat still for several moments to let the information sink in. I wanted my subconscious to remember it so that I would be more discerning when it comes to marketing and advertising. There was always that glimmer of hope that the next miracle product could be the Holy Grail item that I just couldn\u2019t live without when it came to beauty and skincare.<\/p>\n<p>It was a reality check for me to realize that all the scientific studies, stamps of approval, and glossy endorsements <em>meant nothing<\/em> if the product wasn\u2019t working for me.<\/p>\n<p>Was I an outlier? It didn\u2019t matter. I was happy that I felt more empowered now to make more discerning purchases.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. Minimalism &#8212; And What I Could Do Without<\/h2>\n<p>As I got down to the basics, I got more disciplined when it came to my approach towards food and health.<\/p>\n<p>I drastically cut down on sugary and processed foods, and mostly drank water while keeping up my usual light-to-moderate exercise routines.<\/p>\n<p>I realized I was happy working out by myself at home, and that I felt more comfortable there than paying for a fancy gym membership.<\/p>\n<p>My low-fuss and minimal skincare routine made me think about what other things I could do without.<\/p>\n<p>When it came to potential purchases, I would keep asking myself: \u201cIs this something I <i>really<\/i> need?\u201d Which not only helped me justify the expense, but was a solid question to ask in general in order to keep reaping the benefits of a frugal lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As Ashley from The Frugal Model once wrote in a guest post here, <\/strong><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/bing-cheap-vs-frugal-aka-smart\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">being frugal doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re being cheap<\/a>.<\/strong> <\/em><\/p>\n<p>The concept of \u201cless is more\u201d frees you up to focus on the things that matter even more.<\/p>\n<p>For example, no longer paying for the acne treatment system subscription meant that I now had about thirty bucks per month to save or spend on other things instead (like art supplies or books!!!). Keeping to a minimal skincare routine meant that I could spend 5 minutes or less on my face, versus a complicated 10-step routine requiring multiple products and a bigger investment of time and money.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, the minimalistic approach helped to clear up my skin<strong>,<\/strong> and serves as a visual reminder and reward now of the frugal lifestyle choices I make.<\/p>\n<p>******<br \/>\n<em><strong>Jess Chua<\/strong> writes and edits content for the <a href=\"http:\/\/oldpodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optimal Living Daily<\/a> podcast, a show that narrates some of the best lifestyle content online, including some of J$&#8217;s very own <a href=\"https:\/\/oldpodcast.com\/?s=budgets%2Bare%2Bsexy\">personal finance<\/a> articles on its sister podcast, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/podcast\/optimal-living-daily-the-best-of-personal-development-productivity\/optimal-finance-daily-the-best-of-personal-finance-money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optimal Finance Daily<\/a><\/em><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[Hey guys!!
