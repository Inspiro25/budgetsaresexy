It&#8217;s not that well regulated, meaning anyone can do it if you can convince someone to hire you (which I wouldn&#8217;t ever advise, of course &#8211; either hiring someone you don&#8217;t trust <em>or<\/em> trying to manage someone else&#8217;s money if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing!), but regardless this exists in case you were ever wondering.<\/p>\n<p>I talked with a handful of DMMs when I was first considering this, as well as those readers who wanted me to jump into their finances, but at the end of the day I decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/08\/official-money-coach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">become a Money Coach<\/a> instead and help people *learn* how to deal w\/ their money vs actually doing it for them. Since usually that&#8217;s more helpful, at least to the audience I&#8217;d be catering too (ie. not the elderly, wealthy\/busy, etc).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, I share this with you today for two reasons:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s pretty fascinating stuff, right?? :)<\/li>\n<li>Someone recently left a comment <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/08\/daily-money-managers-pay-your-bills-budget-for-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on my original findings<\/a> and it re-sparked my brain, as well as a slew of other ideas for anyone who&#8217;s having a hard time saving\/spending money.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I sat down to type a quick response to our new friend here, but twenty minutes later a dissertation was born and I thought I&#8217;d turn it into a blog post in case it could help someone else as well :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Below is the comment that was left, along with some alternatives to hiring a manager:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This is needed for the following reason. We over spend. If there\u2019s money in the account waiting for bills to be paid, it gets spent before the bills get paid. We don\u2019t trust each other at this point because one or the other of us will do this \u2013 so we need a neutral third party to manage it where we give them the money but we have NO ACCESS after that to the money and the bills get paid.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Some ideas for you:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Give each of yourself an allowance! <\/strong>Literally xfer like $200\/mo or something into a separate account under each of your names, and then do whatever you please w\/ that $$ &#8211; no questions asked. You can blow it, save it, burn it in a fire &#8211; anything. But doing this will not only wipe away some of that stress\/trust issue, but also *put a cap* on how much you both can spend without effecting the rest of your financial lives! Because I take it y&#8217;all have one or two main accounts set up for all your house and living expenses, yeah? The other idea of course is to go back to separate finances altogether and each put in agreed upon amounts to pay for stuff, but that could have other effects too&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Open up a bank account 100 miles away,<\/strong> set up automatic xfers into it for savings, and then refuse to set up online banking or get a debit card so the only way to get it is to drive the 100 miles :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Schedule all your bills to hit on the same day every month<\/strong> (annoying to set up cuz you have to call or do it online, but it&#8217;s usually possible) and then pay ALL the bills the second they come in so regardless of whatever happens to the leftover $$$ everything&#8217;s been already taken care of. Then hopefully you&#8217;ve implemented one of the two above options so it&#8217;s not ALL spent.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Sign up to apps that automatically saves\/invests money for you on a daily basis so you can&#8217;t even spend everything even if any of you wanted.<\/strong> I use <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digit<\/a> for savings (they analyze your spending\/income and xfers over $$ into a *separate* account for you every couple of days that it knows you won&#8217;t miss) and then <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/acorns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acorns<\/a> &#8211; which rounds up all your transactions to the nearest $1.00 and then drops the difference of the $$ into an investment portfolio you&#8217;ve set up with them. I&#8217;ve saved $3,800 w\/ Digit over the past year, and $400 with Acorns so far&#8230; they work! So long as you don&#8217;t touch it :)<\/p>\n<p>And of course, most important of all, you will have to deal with <strong><em>the underlying problem<\/em><\/strong> of things. These fixes will only last so long so you&#8217;ll need to address the trust issues going on at some point.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All I know is that it&#8217;s GREAT you&#8217;ve both realized this is a problem finally worth addressing, and you&#8217;re now reaching out for help\/ideas to make things better.<\/strong> That&#8217;s hard to do, so I tip my hat to you, sir!<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and yes &#8211; of course money managers can do all this for you guys too, but I&#8217;d recommend starting with a money <em>coach<\/em> first just to get a better grasp of everything and see if there&#8217;s a way to avoid passing it all off or not. You can always go back and try out a daily money manager if you need to.<\/p>\n<p>Hope this helps&#8230; bet you didn&#8217;t see this long a$$ response coming :)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What other ideas could we tell our friend here?
