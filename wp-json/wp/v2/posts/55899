The reason is that every permanent drop in your spending has a double effect: it increases the amount of money you have left over to save each month, and it permanently decreases the amount you\u2019ll need every month for the rest of your life.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Think about that for a moment&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every time you cut one of your permanent\/recurring expenses, it *increases* the amount of money you have let over to save each month.<\/p>\n<p>But even more powerful, it then *permanently* decreases the amount you\u2019ll need every month for the rest of your life! (Provided you don&#8217;t go back to it, of course ;))<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s one of the most simplest concepts in the world, yet so many of us still haven&#8217;t fully understood it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And I was one of them, up until three years ago when I stumbled across this again. And then do you know what happened??? I started the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Challenge Everything<\/a> mission where I went on to shave off roughly $223\/mo from my recurring expenses, and banked a whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything-total-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$5,484.07<\/a> by the time the project was wrapped up 12 months later! Amazing!<\/p>\n<p>And really, it&#8217;s only &#8220;wrapped up&#8221; in terms of being a blog series, as the savings are still very much hitting my account month in and month out! Further motivating me to do even more, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/thoughts-after-cutting-cable\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finally cutting cable TV from my life<\/a>, as well as hawking more stuff on Craigslist and stepping up my minimalism game.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything-total-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> a breakdown<\/a> of the savings after the first full year in effect:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything-total-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-45618\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/challenge-savings-chart.gif\" alt=\"challenge everything savings chart\" width=\"570\" height=\"743\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(Similar to our current <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/spavings-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spavings Challenge<\/a>, I threw all extra money I came across into the Challenge Everything fund as well for extra motivation)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>But here&#8217;s the even crazier thing &#8211; it didn&#8217;t affect my lifestyle a single bit!<\/strong> In fact, it actually improved it. Not only did cutting stuff out help me appreciate all that I had more, but it also gave me a better sense of pride and confidence, knowing that I was (finally) optimizing my expenses once and for all as a 30-something adult. (And as a financial blogger, at that!).<\/p>\n<p>If you think about the last time you switched phone carriers or called to lower your cable\/insurance bills, you might be surprised how much you&#8217;re leaving on the table as well. Especially those you&#8217;ve just got into the habit of paying every month without even giving them a second thought.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For me, one of the biggest shocks was how much we were paying for our two iPhones year in and year out&#8230;<\/strong> We were hovering between $150-$180\/mo, and because there was no way I could &#8220;live without my iPhone&#8221; (words many of us have spoken!), I never even <em>considered<\/em> cutting it from my life. It was just &#8220;one of those things&#8221; I paid for and couldn&#8217;t do anything about!<\/p>\n<p>And then after reading that same passage from Mr. Money Mustache, I thought to myself, &#8220;<em>Is<\/em> there another way? Is there a different phone\/carrier that does the exact same stuff so I don&#8217;t hate my life, only costs me gobs less?? &#8216;Cuz that would be awesome!&#8221; And sure enough, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">there was<\/a>. Republic Wireless. And these days there&#8217;s even MORE options out there for people as the competition &#8211; and &#8220;wireless over wifi&#8221; technology &#8211; has only exploded in recent years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But the point is &#8211; what we <em>think<\/em> we can&#8217;t live without is seldom not true, and even when it is there are usually alternatives that can do the same thing, but for much less.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not always the easiest or most fun making it happen (switching phone carriers is a bitch no matter where you transfer to!), but if you&#8217;re committed enough it&#8217;s well worth sucking it up for a hot minute.<\/p>\n<p>That initial <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$223\/mo<\/a> of savings three years ago have now blossomed to a total of $8,028.00 (more than enough to max out an entire Roth IRA, and halfway towards a second!), and doesn&#8217;t even factor in all the other benefits the shavings have had on my financial and mental life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And the best part? Most of these savings were from ONE-TIME actions! Just like with investing, only for your expenses! Put in the money (time), and then watch the dividends (savings) roll in!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful thing :) And I owe MMM approximately 13 six packs now for finally beating it into my head. (Thank you, sir!)<\/p>\n<p>I was reminded of this recently when someone told me she couldn&#8217;t believe how obvious it was and that it&#8217;s taken her so long to realize it, and so I share it all with you guys again today in hopes it gets YOU closer to that epiphany as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cutting out expenses from your life goes on to do TWO very powerful things:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Frees up more money for savings every month forward!<\/li>\n<li>Allows you to *need less* to survive every month forward.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Those who live off $2,000\/mo can retire a lot earlier than those who need $10,000\/mo to survive. We&#8217;re all in different phases with this stuff, but let today be the time you kick it into overdrive if you know you can be doing better.<\/p>\n<p>And then make sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email me<\/a> with how much you&#8217;re saving, so I can be the first to congratulate you :) I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of emails over the years from people challenging their expenses, and I have yet to hear anyone now say they hate their lives because of it! <em><strong>Ain&#8217;t no one enjoys wasting away their money!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*******<\/p>\n<p><em>Full article again from MMM can be found here &#8211; highly recommend it: <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2012\/01\/13\/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>And then here&#8217;s the recap of our 12 month challenge experiment as well, if you weren&#8217;t around back then and want more of the backstory behind it (or to see some of the notes people have written in after trying it themselves &#8211; some people absolutely killed it!): <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/challenge-everything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Challenge Everything Mission<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Three years ago I stumbled across a passage from Mr. Money Mustache that completely changed how I view my expenses.
