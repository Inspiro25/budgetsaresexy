Unfortunately I was dead wrong this time around&#8230; I nailed the first 10 w\/out any problem whatsoever, then slowly got out the next 20, but by the time we hit 30, and then 35, I thought my arms were gonna explode and it would be the ultimate end of my blogging career :(\u00a0 What the hell happened to me??\u00a0 And why did it take me another 1\/2 day just to eek out 5 more in the end?<\/p>\n<p><strong>I was in shock.\u00a0 And pretty embarrassed, if you want the truth.<\/strong>\u00a0 I decided to give it a rest for the remaining day and try again in the next morning.\u00a0 But that was even worse. I think I made it to 11 or 12 until my body just gave in and I hit the floor&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Why share all this with you today, and let everyone know I\u2019m a big wussie?\u00a0 Cuz it\u2019s a PERFECT example of how *not* to take on a goal. And you better believe it relates to handling your finances too.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Don&#8217;t Go &#8220;All In&#8221; With Your Goals From The Start<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, you get super excited about stuff and just want to kill it and start feeling all proud of your self and what not &#8211; but don\u2019t fall for it! Take things slow and build up to your goal while your body\/wallet gets used to things.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the one major area I failed at myself when handling my money after college. I kept trying to save $100 every paycheck, and would xfer it over into my savings every 2 weeks, but at the end of the month I\u2019d always end up xfering it all back and feeling like a failure!\u00a0 It took me forever to realize that I was biting off more than I could chew, and as soon as I dropped it to $50\/mo, I was *winning* every single month.\u00a0 It was awesome. And more importantly, I felt like I was accomplishing something.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Small Steps Add Up!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When I was relaying this push up debacle w\/ my brother, he told me I should start as tiny as I could, and then slowly do more every day incrementally.\u00a0 Initially I hated the idea cuz I could do more than 1 pushup a day for sure! (it\u2019s like telling someone to start saving just $1.00!), but the idea of starting from ground up and slowly letting my body get used to it did seem nice.\u00a0 And after 5 days in a row now, I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve met every day\u2019s goal so far ;)\u00a0 I do the previous day\u2019s # of pushups, and then add 1 more on top of it.\u00a0 So today I\u2019ll do 6, and then tomorrow I\u2019ll do 7, and then 8, 9, etc. It\u2019s definitely not something to start bragging about anytime soon, but I must admit I\u2019m feeling a helluva lot better then when I was doing 35 and dying.\u00a0 And I guarantee at day #35 I\u2019ll be doing them even easier!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Make Sure To Look Forward to Your Goals!\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Not all goals will be crazy exciting, but the more you can get jazzed about something and really be proud of your accomplishments, the more odds you\u2019ll succeed in the end.\u00a0 I would much rather be sitting here telling you I&#8217;m nailing a hundred push ups a day, but after that first shot at it all the remaining joy I had was sucked out. I really wanted to give up.\u00a0 Doing a handful a day, though, and slowly getting better and better is a completely different feeling :) Not only is it more exciting, but it&#8217;s also DO-ABLE! And the same goes for saving money or cutting out debt every month too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I know we always talk about how <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/do-one-small-thing-then-do-another\/\">small things add up<\/a> over time and what not, but it\u2019s totally true.\u00a0<\/strong> And I think it\u2019s important to remind ourselves of it so we can be proud of our accomplishments and keep striving to get better.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>My 401(k) Lesson<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I can\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve ever blogged about this or not, but back when I was like 21 or 22 my dad kept trying to get me to sign up to my company\u2019s 401(k) plan but I kept \u201cforgetting\u201d to do it because I never thought it would amount to anything.\u00a0 And <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/wanna-know-the-cheapest-way-to-travel-the-world\/\">working at Continental Airlines<\/a> at the time, the only thing I could think of was \u201cEvery $25 saved could be a round trip ticket anywhere in the country instead!\u201d\u00a0 I had no concept of long-term savings or retirement, but I eventually gave in and did it and to this day it\u2019s been one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done.<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, I totally forgot about it once it was set up, so it took no effort on my side whatsoever to keep \u201cbeing good\u201d about it all.\u00a0 It evaded my thoughts for a good 6-8 months until my dad asked me \u2013 yet again \u2013 if I had done what he had advised of a handful of months earlier.\u00a0 I proudly told him that I had, and when I went to see what was in there I had a good $700-$800 saved up!\u00a0 It was incredible!!\u00a0 And it totally changed my perspective as well.\u00a0 The fact that you could not only KEEP money for so long like that, but that it could also GROW and grow too was a beautiful new concept for me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I continued this practice of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/maxing-out-your-401k-and-ira-really-is\/\">401(k) investing<\/a> for the next 8 or 9 years<\/strong>, slowly upping the % when I could, and especially when my employers would match a good chunk, and by the time I went to xfer the money out into IRAs instead (when I went solo), I had <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-401k-ira-test\/\">over $179,000<\/a> in it.\u00a0 WOW.\u00a0 All from incrementally adding in more, and taking advantage of both an excellent investing vehicle and TIME.\u00a0 If there\u2019s anything that can really work in your favor (and even against you, actually) it\u2019s TIME.\u00a0 You set up all those processes and work towards your goals slowly over the years though, and another 10, 20 years from now you\u2019ll be thanking yourself like crazy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So whatever it is you\u2019re working on these days, remember to be excited about it and keep taking things slowly cuz it def. all adds up.<\/strong> We\u2019ll see how much better I get with my crazy push up goals over here, but regardless you can bet your sweet ass I\u2019ll continue to save! Better to work on it sooner than later too, cuz Lord knows we&#8217;re not getting any younger ;) <em>Who&#8217;s with me?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/greggoconnell\/\">greggoconnell<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As you\u2019ve probably realized by now, I get super pumped up about taking on new goals ;)\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter if I have ten already&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/100-push-ups-day-challenge-fail\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[166,12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-24572","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-get-motivated","category-saving"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>My 100x Day Push Up Failure | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/100-push-ups-day-challenge-fail\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"My 100x Day Push Up Failure | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"As you\u2019ve probably realized by now, I get super pumped up about taking on new goals ;)\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter if I have ten already...
