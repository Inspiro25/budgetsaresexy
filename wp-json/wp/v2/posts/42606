It would take you approximately 2.3 seconds to come up with?<\/p>\n<p>Well, apparently for me it takes about 23 <em>minutes<\/em>. I was recently asked this question on an upcoming podcast* that&#8217;ll be dropping soon, and I literally had NO answer for it at first! I racked and racked and racked my brain literally for over 20 minutes &#8211; no joke &#8211; and finally I landed on a suitable answer that didn&#8217;t make me look like a complete ass hat. At least on that question ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>At first I felt pretty lame not being able to answer one of the easiest questions IN THE WORLD,<\/strong> and consequently wondered if I was just leading a pretty boring life, haha., but the more I thought on it the more I realized it was probably a <em>good<\/em> problem to have. If I&#8217;m not pouring my money into something that I shouldn&#8217;t, it means it&#8217;s going to a more financially prudent cause, right? And I&#8217;m awesome for controlling my &#8220;wants?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well, the truth is yes and no in my case. Yes I&#8217;m not spending as freely as I used to, but no it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m better at controlling my &#8220;wants&#8221; (at least initially). It&#8217;s because we have a lower income than usual and I&#8217;m watching all my little money soldiers better ;) I still very much believe in having padding in your budget for &#8220;blow money&#8221; not only to enjoy your life more, but to keep your sanity and away from burn out. I find it perfectly fine &#8211; and smart! &#8211; to let loose a little within reason! No shame in that at all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The interesting thing I&#8217;m noticing, however, is that I&#8217;m slowly moving farther and farther away from these things I used to love splurging on.<\/strong> I still want the ability to buy them anytime I should choose, but amazingly enough I don&#8217;t really miss them much and life continues to go on. In fact, I haven&#8217;t been this free from <em>want<\/em> in a while! I believe people call this <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/having-enough\/\" target=\"_blank\">having enough<\/a> ;)<\/p>\n<p>Back to the original question though. Here it is again:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My biggest guilty pleasure that I spend a lot on is ____.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the 20 minutes I scoured my brain, here were the usual culprits that have since been shut down:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Lottery tickets &#8212;<\/strong> For as long as I can remember I&#8217;ve been enamored by scratch off lottery tickets. I used to get them from my parents, and then from my grandparents, and even nowadays in my stockings from my not-so-secret Santas. I used to love them so much, in fact, someone once <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/j-money-comic-lottery.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">turned me into a comic book<\/a>! Now I still have love for them even though they&#8217;re bad for you and for society, blah blah blah, but now I get free entertainment from my kids. They dream better than I do anyways.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Domain names &#8212;<\/strong> This is the bane of all online entrepreneurs, haha&#8230; We think we&#8217;re so clever with ideas and companies and all kinds of random names we just *know* will be a blockbuster so long as we build them out one day. With &#8220;one day&#8221; being the operative phrase there. As my man Derek Sivers once said, &#8220;Ideas are worth nothing unless executed.&#8221; And a good one at that <a href=\"http:\/\/sivers.org\/multiply\" target=\"_blank\">is only worth $20<\/a>, compared to $10,000,000 brilliantly executed. Gone are the days of snatching up 4-5 urls a month and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/07\/12-ways-i-dont-set-an-example\/\" target=\"_blank\">dropping over $1,600 a year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Clothes &#8211;<\/strong>&#8211; I used to go shopping every time I was bored. Then one day I tried a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/lent-time-to-give-something-up\/\" target=\"_blank\">no spending month<\/a>&#8221; and realized I was spending over $200\/mo by doing this (!!) and it really didn&#8217;t make me all that happy one way or the other. So I quit making the mall a destination, and decided to spend time blogging instead :) It&#8217;ll be 7 years come February since this challenge, and it was one of the best things I could have ever done for my money. My friend Cait&#8217;s doing it <a href=\"http:\/\/blondeonabudget.ca\/2015\/01\/26\/why-im-upping-the-ante-on-my-yearlong-shopping-ban\/\" target=\"_blank\">for a year<\/a> right now btw.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Vending machine snacks<\/strong> &#8212; Similar to the mall situation above, it helps when you just DON&#8217;T GO NEAR THESE!!! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Starbucks\/fancy coffees<\/strong> &#8212; I&#8217;ll still pick these up when out and about or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/overheard-coffee-shop\/\" target=\"_blank\">working from a cafe<\/a> like I did over the Summer, but by and large I stick to my homemade coffee at home. Mainly out of convenience more than anything. I&#8217;ll be the last person to shun you for splurging on caffeinated gold! It&#8217;s on the top list of necessities right after a roof over your head ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Eating out &#8212;<\/strong> We&#8217;ll pick up take out every few weeks or go out to dinner\/dessert on a date, but 99% of our meals are made or cooked at home. And 50% of those involve <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/01\/how-save-money-pictures\/\" target=\"_blank\">peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwiches<\/a> as my work lunch (hah).<\/p>\n<p><strong>7.\u00a0Uni-Ball EYE Rollerball Pens &#8212;<\/strong> I used to be OBSESSED <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00KM5R6VO\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00KM5R6VO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&amp;linkId=BDWTOQTULJPAYHXL\" target=\"_blank\">with these<\/a> and refused to write with anything besides them. It was an expensive habit at $3\/pop (and when you had a budget of -$5.00 in college, haha&#8230;) but thankfully I outgrew this. I still have a few that I use and love, but now I&#8217;ll take any decent ink pen as long as it&#8217;s not Bic :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Yard sale splurges &#8212;<\/strong> You show me a good deal at a yard sale and I&#8217;ll show you someone who will bite &#8211; regardless of whether he needs it or not ;) Or, at least I <em>used to<\/em> be able to show you this person. This recent <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/craigslist-selling-rule\/\" target=\"_blank\">Craigslist Habit<\/a> of mine has gotten me all kinds of conscious of what I&#8217;m bringing into our house! If there&#8217;s a slight chance I&#8217;ll just be turning around to sell it in a few weeks\/months\/years, then it ain&#8217;t coming in anymore. Unless I strategically pick something up to sell for a profit &#8211; the one main reason to continue hitting up these yard sales outside of looking for hidden coin treasures!<\/p>\n<h2>And that leads us to the one thing I&#8217;ll still splurge on, and the answer I gave on the podcast:<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Old coins from the 1800&#8217;s :)<\/strong> I cannot, and shall not, deny adding to <a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">my collection<\/a> regardless of financial revenues, haha&#8230; Now I won&#8217;t spend $100 like a dummy if I can only afford $10, but it&#8217;s the last remaining thing I enjoy that actually costs money. And in a funny way, I&#8217;m kinda just re-investing it into money anyways! Unlike with most hobbies that just suck it up&#8230; In fact, you could even make the argument it belongs in our net worth since it&#8217;s an asset that will most likely<em> appreciate<\/em> over time. A pretty nice side effect to the hobby! At least with the types of coins I happen to enjoy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/1806-draped-bust-half-cent\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42619\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1806-half-cent.jpg\" alt=\"1806 half cent\" width=\"400\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1806-half-cent.jpg 400w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1806-half-cent-300x192.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a>[My 1806 &#8220;Draped Bust&#8221; half cent &#8211; Ow ow!]<\/p>\n<p>(Also important to note &#8211; I always try and trade away coins from my stash that I could care less about in order to score those I want to add to my collection. So 75% of the time I don&#8217;t actually ever drop any modern currency on them, and if I do, I tap my can of cash that came from selling some of those coins in <a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/how-i-store-track-coins\/\" target=\"_blank\">my trading binder<\/a>. It takes a while to tap that off so in reality my podcast answer is half-false ;))<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, interesting how your lifestyle changes over the years, isn&#8217;t it?<\/strong> And fortunately for us money lovers, they change for the better :) Of which I attribute to the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking on a &#8220;no spend&#8221; month<\/li>\n<li>Sticking with the Craigslist Habit<\/li>\n<li>Having kids (harder to spend money you don&#8217;t have! ;))<\/li>\n<li>Tracking my net worth (you questions your spending more when you know it&#8217;ll affect the numbers!)<\/li>\n<li>And most importantly, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/retiring-early-means-being-financially-free\/\" target=\"_blank\">realizing what money truly gives you<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Again, no shame in splurging on the things you love,<\/strong> but definitely something to consider if you happen to be a Spendy McSpenderton&#8230; The nice thing about saving your money is that you can always <em>dream of the possibilities of what to do with it later<\/em>! Which is often more gratifying than the actual items you want!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What are some of the guilty pleasures you have since crushed?

In fact, tons of more awesomer, bigger, folks on there than me! I was honored to be asked. And glad I looked at some of the questions before the show which I typically don&#8217;t.
