It&#8217;s so freakin&#8217; comfortable!) I <em>am<\/em> starting to regret getting it from a dealer vs. private party and having to rush through it all. Especially after running the #&#8217;s and realizing just how big of a difference it&#8217;s made! In fact, I&#8217;ve been reminded of a few things throughout the past week and I&#8217;ll share them real quick before we get to the numbers here&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Maybe they&#8217;ll help you avoid paying more than you need to in the future yourself?<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. Not being in a rush matters A LOT when buying a car.<\/strong> This was the first time I ever bought a car on a time crunch (we needed one within weeks before <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/from-single-income-kids-to-dual-income-kids\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">packing up and moving<\/a>), so we not only had to find the <em>right car<\/em> for our family, but also the <em>best deal<\/em> all in the limited time we had. And unfortunately without watching the market for a long time you&#8217;re left with what&#8217;s currently up for sale at the moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. Convenience costs! <\/strong>Because of the time crunch (and lack of the vehicles for sale by private party, or at least the vehicle *we wanted*) we focused our search at dealerships so we can get in and get out and accomplish the mission. We chose Carmax because of how easy and enjoyable it was, but because of this we also paid a premium over what the same car would have cost in private hands :(<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. When calculating the value of your car &#8211; especially for net worth purposes &#8211; make sure you&#8217;re looking at the right value!<\/strong> This has been the biggest shock so far for us, and mainly because I totally missed it the first time around! We knew going into it we&#8217;d owe more for our car than what it&#8217;s worth per the above two reasons (and was okay with it), but the part I overlooked was checking the &#8220;private party&#8221; value of the car <em>in addition to<\/em> the &#8220;dealer&#8221; value which of course will always be more, but what we were using to see if Carmax had a fair deal or not. The dealer value was only $1,000 off which <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/bye-bye-frankencaddy-hello-car-payments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as posted about<\/a> was expected with places like Carmax, but of course when running your net worth reports you don&#8217;t calculate <em>dealer<\/em> values and instead use <em>private party<\/em>, or even trade-in values, depending on how you&#8217;d sell it if\/when that time comes.<\/p>\n<p>We plan on keeping it for life, but were quite surprised when we searched the &#8220;private party&#8221; value this week and saw it was actually $2,000 less than expected! Which is a huge difference! And <del>probably<\/del> definitely would have changed things, ugh&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. Buying even a used car costs a lot more than just the sticker price.<\/strong> Our Lexus itself was $18,000, but once you tack on the dealer fees ($299), taxes\/titling ($900) and a warranty if you go that route (we did @ $1,859), you&#8217;re looking at a lot more over the price tag. And that&#8217;s not counting any insurance hikes you may get depending on the car you choose too ($30 for us) or even the financing fees if you go that route as well (we&#8217;re paying 3.45% currently). All things we knew were a part of the deal, but still stings watching it reflected in your net worth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And lastly, this is further proof that I&#8217;m no &#8220;expert&#8221; at everything money&#8230; <\/strong>The media\/other bloggers are quick to label us so, but the reality is most of us (or at least me) are just regular people trying to talk openly about our finances in hopes it helps people as well as ourselves. Sometimes we get REALLY GOOD at it and everyone wins!, and other times we suck just as hard as the next person and do our best to learn from it. The key is to take a little here and there and then use it to make the best decisions in your own life as possible and hopefully come out better for it :)<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, all this to say that while we&#8217;re still very much enjoying our car and did our best under the circumstances, our best could have been a lot better and we&#8217;ll now be paying for it &#8211; quite literally. Though I guess it could have been worse and we picked up a car that we hated and\/or couldn&#8217;t afford?\u00a0 That would have been pretty horrible!<\/p>\n<p>Alright, let&#8217;s get down to the numbers now&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&#8217;s How June&#8217;s Net Worth Breaks Down:<\/h2>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CASH SAVINGS<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(-$5,136.90)<\/span><\/strong>: Not *as* bad as it looks, but definitely not optimal. $2,000 of this was for a down payment on the car, but the other $2,300 was for the deposit on our new home. Which thankfully will be getting returned to us once we move out, as well as the $1,700 we put down on our old home three years ago. In general though we just need to be better about bringing home more income and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/06\/from-single-income-kids-to-dual-income-kids\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Mrs&#8217; new job<\/a> will certainly help with that.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">DIGIT &amp; &#8220;CHALLENGE EVERYTHING&#8221; ACCOUNTS<\/span><\/strong>: I decided to simplify stuff more and just condense all our savings stashes into one main place for these updates going forward.
