Your money needs you!&#8221; Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Some of these are pretty lame, but the majority of them are right on the money and should def. get you to think.\u00a0 I had to take a few seconds and research at least 3 of them to see if I needed a makeover or not ;) And that&#8217;s really why I&#8217;m posting them up here today &#8211; not just because it&#8217;s a catchy headline.<\/p>\n<p>Here are all 20 signs below.\u00a0 Billshrink is in bold, and J. Money is in plain. How many do you need to correct?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You charge group dinners on your card and keep your friends\u2019 cash to spend.<\/strong> I actually don&#8217;t mind doing this myself as it saves me a trip to the ATM if I need the cash, but if you&#8217;re just being stupid and thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;free money&#8221; to go and blow anytime then yeah &#8211; you need a financial makeover.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You spend more than 40% of your total income on rent.<\/strong> The last time I <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/01\/where-oh-where-does-our-exy-money-go\/\">calculated this<\/a> we were spending 37% of our total (net) income on mortgages.\u00a0 And I&#8217;ll admit it&#8217;s not very savvy.\u00a0 But I&#8217;ll also point out that we got ourselves into this BEFORE Mr. J. Money came about ;) So I agree with this one here &#8211; ya gotta keep your rent\/mortgages way below that 40% line.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re constantly transferring your balance to get 0% interest on your credit card debt.<\/strong> Bad if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing, but good if you&#8217;re Jonathan from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mymoneyblog.com\/how-to-make-money-from-0-apr-balance-transfers\">My Money Blog<\/a> (the expert in xfering $20,000+ and milking the extra hundreds of dollars in interest every year;))<\/li>\n<li><strong>You pay off one credit card with another.<\/strong> Yes, BAD!!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Less than 10% of your income goes to your retirement savings.\u00a0 (Or worse, zero percent!)<\/strong> I wouldn&#8217;t say you need a total makeover if you were saving 10% really, even though everyone would love to see you saving 15% or even 25%, but definitely saving 0% is a troubling sign.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You have a credit card that doesn\u2019t give you anything in return, like cash back or airline miles.<\/strong> Haha&#8230;well this isn&#8217;t the worst thing in the world, but it is a good idea to check and makes sure you&#8217;re getting *something* in return for doing nothing ;) You don&#8217;t have to do anything different than you&#8217;re doing now!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t know what IRA means outside of Ireland.<\/strong> (is that supposed to be a joke?)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You pay the minimum balance on your credit card each month.<\/strong>Not the best habit to get into, that&#8217;s for sure.\u00a0\u00a0 If at all possible you should be adding in at least $25-$50 more every month to help knock it away as fast as you can.\u00a0 I once paid $2,000 for a $1,200 computer back in the day because I kept just telling myself\u00a0 &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it tomorrow.&#8221; Make tomorrow, today!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t open your credit card statement because you can\u2019t bear to see how high the balance is.<\/strong> Oh yeah, definitely not a good sign.\u00a0 You HAVE TO KNOW what you&#8217;re dealing with so that you can fix it and get right back on track!\u00a0 And this goes for savings and investments too.\u00a0 If you don&#8217;t KNOW what&#8217;s going on you&#8217;ll just keep sinking and sinking until it takes something tragic to snap you out of it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t keep receipts because they remind you of what you\u2019ve spent. <\/strong>Haha&#8230;that&#8217;s actually pretty clever ;)\u00a0 STUPID, but clever.\u00a0 Maybe these people should switch to debit cards instead? (I&#8217;m assuming they&#8217;re using credit cards which allow them to spend way more than they have due to credit limits and such. With debit cards though, you have a breaking point!\u00a0 Once you hit $0.00 you can&#8217;t pick up anything else.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You know your company has a 401k plan, but you have no idea what that is.<\/strong> My favorite tool ever!\u00a0 Just call up HR real quick (right now, actually, stop reading this!!) and ask how much your company matches.\u00a0 Then, tell your sweet old HR lady (or man) that you&#8217;d like to contribute that exact same # and make sure to fill out whatever forms you need to do ASAP.\u00a0 Even if you never look at it again, that one move you just made will hook you up years and years to come.\u00a0 So do it!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You withdraw cash frequently from ATM&#8217;s that aren&#8217;t affiliated with your bank.<\/strong> I don&#8217;t know if this one applies as much as maybe it used to.\u00a0 Many banks now reimburse you for your fees so it doesn&#8217;t matter where you go (at least online banks do &#8211; like my fave <a href=\"http:\/\/usaa.com\">USAA<\/a>, baby!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>The\u00a0number of credit cards in your wallet is higher than the number of dates you\u2019ve had this year.<\/strong> Hahahhahaa&#8230;..didn&#8217;t see that one coming :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You buy so much on eBay that they\u2019ve awarded you VIP status.<\/strong> Wha wha wha&#8230;.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You want to start a savings account, but then sale season starts again! <\/strong>Is it me or are these going down hill?<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t have an emergency fund to pay bills should you lose your job. <\/strong>Back in action!\u00a0 YES, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/12\/be-proud-of-your-emergency-fund\/\">emergency funds are KEY <\/a>to any financial game plan. Whether it&#8217;s $100, or $1,000, be sure to be stashing some aside for when you least expect it!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your monthly extra cell phone minute charges are bigger than your monthly electric bill.<\/strong> (I had to go look up my own electric bill to see if this is a good gauge or not, and indeed I think it may.\u00a0 Although if we&#8217;re talking about overall cell phone bills and not just &#8220;minute charges&#8221; then the iPhone kills us!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You overdraw on your checking account more than once a year. <\/strong>Hmmm&#8230; once is kinda strict.\u00a0 I&#8217;d say not more than 3 times a year cuz sometimes weird things just happen.\u00a0 Although if you were really on top of it you&#8217;d sign up for overdraft protection (the kinds that don&#8217;t cost you any money!) so that you&#8217;d be safe just in case you got a little crazy here and there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You live paycheck to paycheck.<\/strong> This should be the #1 sign you need a makeover, hands down.\u00a0 Living paycheck to paycheck is a recipe for disaster, and I know 80% of you reading this right now are in this boat :(\u00a0 I was too!!!\u00a0 For 25 years of my life!\u00a0 If you haven&#8217;t been serious about making a change, please start today.\u00a0 There are plenty of ways you can get yourself in better position, you just have to get on it and really commit.\u00a0 Start tracking your money and finding where all your <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/08\/find-out-where-your-spending-leaks-are\/\">spending leaks<\/a> are! Picking up <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/03\/hustling-for-better-lifestyle\/\">a hustle<\/a> on the side will help too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You spend more on new shoes annually than you save.<\/strong> Oh wow, that would not be good.\u00a0 I think I&#8217;ve spent around $200 so far on shoes this year &#8211; and 2 of those were on new cleats that needed replacing. I would punch myself in the face if I was saving less than that every year :(<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Were any of you surprised with your answers to some of these?\u00a0 Did it get you to double check and see if you&#8217;re truly on track or not?\u00a0 Again, some of these were pretty crazy and more entertaining than anything, but hopefully it moved a few marbles upstairs and will prompt you to start researching any areas that may need improvement. It&#8217;s always a work in progress :)<\/p>\n<p>(This also reminded me of how much I wanna see a reality tv show come out on this!\u00a0 Especially since The Bank of Mom and Dad is over :( Pass this along to any Hollywood producers you know of! )<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I got this email from BillShrink.com the other day and couldn&#8217;t help but pass it along :) There&#8217;s something about it that just says &#8220;Hey&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/20-signs-you-need-a-financial-makeover\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":16313,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[98,105],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-3371","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-debt","category-money-management"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>20 Signs You Need a Financial Makeover | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/20-signs-you-need-a-financial-makeover\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"20 Signs You Need a Financial Makeover | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I got this email from BillShrink.com the other day and couldn&#8217;t help but pass it along :) There&#8217;s something about it that just says &#8220;Hey...
