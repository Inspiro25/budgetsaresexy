Which is of course to be FIRE, but to have enough time to be able to enjoy the things in my life, my family, my future family and to be financially stable that I can be able to enjoy these things without a thought in my mind.<\/p>\n<p>I have spent some time in the US, and things are a lot different over in Australia when it comes to youth and finance. It seems like a lot over in the US even in mid to late twenties have almost nothing to their name, but here in Australia I would say most young people are really switched on financially. We are taught in school about saving money, and most people here don&#8217;t need university or college etc., and start working at 18 like I did straight from school. It&#8217;s quite easy to earn a decent modest income with no qualifications or degrees.<\/p>\n<p>So we start working and saving earlier. Real Estate and cost of living over here is quite expensive so I think a lot people naturally are concerned about finances earlier. Of course this doesn&#8217;t apply to everyone but I would say a good majority. I think that would be music to your ears that a lot of young ones are thinking about finances earlier.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Evie<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Music to my ears indeed! I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the &#8220;not needing college&#8221; part, but she&#8217;s def. on point about the state of our younger generation not having much to their name, ugh&#8230; Getting more financial education in our schools would def. be a great start!<\/p>\n<p><strong>ADDENDUM:<\/strong> Here&#8217;s what another Australian had to add too (&#8220;Jo&#8221; down in the comments): &#8220;The one thing I would add about Australia is that we have compulsory employer Superannuation Guarantee; employers currently pay 9.5% of employees wages into a superannuation fund. There is quite a bit of contention around superannuation with the fees charged and the age that it is accessible, but it does mean Australians have a bit of \u2018forced retirement savings\u2019.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Guaranteed Returns in India<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57013\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/india-flag.jpg\" alt=\"india flag\" width=\"489\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/india-flag.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/india-flag-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In India, there is a Public Provident Fund in which you can invest up to Rs. 150,000 per year (roughly $2,180 U.S.). The guaranteed rate of return is around 8% right now (used to be 12% in the nineties, so its slowing reducing). And this interest is tax free.<\/p>\n<p>The best deal is for Indians living abroad (NRI \u2013 Non Resident Indian). They can open deposits in Indian banks for any amount and get tax free 8% return! Doesn\u2019t get any better than this.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Francesca, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frompenniestopounds.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FromPenniestoPounds.com<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>WOWWWW had no idea on this! A *guaranteed* return, can you imagine? And tax free?? It still wouldn&#8217;t stop people from blowing their money on stuff here in the States, but it would sure come in handy the moment you finally have your epiphany and are ready to rock :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>ADDENDUM:<\/strong> Here&#8217;s more insight on these guaranteed returns from Aparma who runs an Indian personal finance blog (in English), <a href=\"https:\/\/elementummoney.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ElementumMoney.com<\/a>: &#8220;While PPF and Cash Deposits (mostly referred to as FD, short for Fixed Deposits) are risk free with 7.5%, inflation in India is also that much higher at over 6%. You can see a comparison in the home loan interest rates itself where the home loan interest rate in India is at 8-8.5% and in the US it is a mere 1 or 2%. The real story in India though is the growth story which is seen better in the equity markets. Actively managed funds still perform better and index funds are yet to make a dent. In the last 5 years, a LOT of the actively managed funds have delivered a 15%+ return so the invested money could easily have doubled.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Not Messing With Debt in Dubai (UAE)<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57014\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dubai-flag.jpg\" alt=\"dubai flag\" width=\"504\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dubai-flag.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/dubai-flag-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our friends moved from the UK to Dubai (where it is tax free) and it\u2019s a criminal offense to leave the country whilst in debt.

Basically, it enables exchange of currency through mobile phone secure SMS and internet. For areas where banks don\u2019t exist (and therefore cash is difficult to obtain) it has made getting paid and spending money much easier (80% of Kenyans have a mobile phone).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s sort of like Android Pay on steroids, as while Android Pay requires a bank account attached, M-Pesa is the actual bank. It seems to have done great things for unbanked areas in Kenya and the low income population as a whole. You should look up the segment if you\u2019re interested. :)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Tara<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I still find it so incredible how pervasive cell phones and laptops are now, and just how LIFE CHANGING they have become for certain things.
