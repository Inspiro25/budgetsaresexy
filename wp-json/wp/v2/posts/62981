He was born with a few extra toes on his back feet, and they\u2019ve never really been a problem until now. Not sure how he got hurt, I just noticed him limping and bleeding when we got home :( Poor little bugger!<\/p>\n<p>After two hours at the vet, Cooper came home with a bandaged leg, and my wife handed me a $186 vet bill. Yay.<\/p>\n<p>I know $186 might seem a bit excessive for a simple bandage and some antibiotics, but honestly I\u2019d probably pay 10x that amount to take the pain away.

From memory, we got quoted somewhere around $300 a year for a basic coverage plan. (Just did a quick search &#8212;\u00a0 looks like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuepenguin.com\/pet-insurance\/average-cost-of-pet-insurance#dogs\">national average<\/a> for the German Shepherd breed is $34.32 per month).<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, we decided against getting pet insurance for a few reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have enough money to cover an emergency if something comes up.<\/li>\n<li>We didn\u2019t really feel like insurance would help us sleep any better at night.<\/li>\n<li><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\">Since Cooper is a mix-<\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span class=\"getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic\">breed<\/span><\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\">, we weren&#8217;t too worried about <\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span class=\"getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic\">hip dysplasia<\/span><\/span><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\" data-slate-fragment=\"JTVCJTdCJTIyY2hpbGRyZW4lMjIlM0ElNUIlN0IlMjJjaGlsZHJlbiUyMiUzQSU1QiU3QiUyMnRleHQlMjIlM0ElMjJTaW5jZSUyMENvb3BlciUyMGlzJTIwYSUyMG1peC1icmVlZCUyQyUyMHdlJTIwd2VyZW4ndCUyMHRvbyUyMHdvcnJpZWQlMjBhYm91dCUyMGhpcCUyMGR5c3BsYXNpYSUyMHRoYXQlMjBpcyUyMGElMjBnZW5ldGljJTIwdHJhaXQlMjBvZiUyMHB1cmVicmVkJTIwR1NEcy4lMjIlN0QlNUQlMkMlMjJ0eXBlJTIyJTNBJTIybGlzdC1pdGVtJTIyJTdEJTVEJTJDJTIydHlwZSUyMiUzQSUyMmJ1bGxldGVkLWxpc3QlMjIlN0QlNUQ=\"> that is a genetic trait of purebred GSDs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Honestly, the cost alone was a big factor. We were willing to risk that having no insurance would end up being cheaper in the long run (it has been so far).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we did purchase insurance, we could have saved maybe the $859 for his random vet visits &#8230; But it would have cost us an extra <b>$3,068<\/b> ($34 monthly x 90 months) in insurance premiums.<\/p>\n<p>Looks like no pet insurance has worked out better financially so far for us. And knock on wood it stays this way for the rest of his life!<\/p>\n<h2>Is Dog Ownership Worth the Cost? :)<\/h2>\n<p>I must say that I am 100% OK with how expensive Cooper is. It\u2019s a shocking figure when it\u2019s all totaled up &#8212; there\u2019s soooo much I could do with an extra $14,000 right now!<\/p>\n<p>But, here\u2019s why I\u2019m OK with how expensive pet ownership is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I like spending money on things that make me happy in life. Cooper provides unlimited happiness to our house and extended friends and family.<\/li>\n<li>Just like the reports say, dogs improve your fitness and your social life. My wife and I have connected with most of our neighbors because our dogs like to play together.<\/li>\n<li>Coops is an excellent guard dog (well, most of the time \u2026 He was snoozing when my car got broken into the other day). I pity the person who tries to actually break into our house with Cooper on guard.<\/li>\n<li>Since my wife and I don\u2019t have kids yet, a dog gives us something to care for together. And to give us companionship when the other person is away (Cooper is an excellent drinking buddy when my wife is not home).<\/li>\n<li>Just look at his face!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-62984 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coop_face-246x300.png\" alt=\"joel's dog cooper looks at the camera\" width=\"246\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coop_face-246x300.png 246w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/coop_face.png 527w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><i>Do you keep track of your pet expenses?
