He probably never thought it would inspire an entire blog post out of it, but I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my head as I found it somewhat intriguing :)<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what he said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Baller. Nice to have $50K in hidden wealth. I totally subscribe to stealth wealth so nobody knows how big the iceberg really is haha.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>The nice &#8220;baller&#8221; compliment aside (though I won&#8217;t disagree with him ;)), it was that term of &#8220;stealth wealth&#8221; that really caused me to pause for a few to marinate.<\/strong> Stealth wealth&#8230; Was I hiding money this whole time from myself? Was I hiding it from you? Should it have been in my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/net-worth\/\">Net Worth<\/a> all these years? If so, what *else* am I hiding from everyone right now?? Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Now obviously I&#8217;d never intentionally hide any money on this site considering it&#8217;s the entire purpose &#8211; and soul &#8211; of this blog and why we&#8217;re all here, BUT the fact is there *are* indeed lots of things currently not being included in our net worth statements right now. And probably yours too! Does that really mean that they *should* be, though?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of everything I could think of that&#8217;s currently being omitted from our net worth:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>My blogs<\/b> &#8212; Budgets Are Sexy and <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rockstar Finance<\/a>, and all others present and in the future<\/li>\n<li><b>All house stuff<\/b> &#8212; Our TVs, furniture, artwork, lights, decorations, pots, pans, food, rugs, drugs (legal ones), stereos, computers, cups, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/12\/new-art-collector\/\">santa paintings<\/a>, etc ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Our jewelry<\/strong> &#8211; $7,000+ engagement ring, My $800 diamond earings (ballin&#8217;!), my Bulova watch&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><b>All garage stuff<\/b> &#8212; Tools, lawn mower, chain saws, shovels, rakes&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><del><b>Our cars<\/b> <\/del>&#8212; Oops, those we&#8217;re tracking ;)<\/li>\n<li><b>My coin collection!<\/b> Which includes not only hundreds of years old valuable coins, but ALSO those made of silver and gold bullion that could easily be turned into cash on any given day&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><b>My baseball\/basketball card collection<\/b> &#8212; Which includes some Mickey Mantles, O.J. Simpsons (hah!), and old Michael Jordans. Along with a plethora of other somewhat-valuable cards from back in the day (you might remember me <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/08\/what-i-learned-from-collecting-basketball-cards\/\">blogging about these<\/a> before)<\/li>\n<li><b>All our clothes (and makeup, says the wife)<\/b> &#8212; All of which would net us a pretty penny if we ended up hawking one day. Or at least the wife&#8217;s stuff since I&#8217;m <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/minimalism-wrecking-my-wardrobe\/\">down to only a handful of stuff<\/a> right now (though you&#8217;d be happy to hear I went on a TJ Maxx run last weekend and picked up 3 new shirts and 1 new hoodie! Woohoo!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And probably a lot more that I can&#8217;t think of at the moment&#8230; But as you can see, there&#8217;s a LOT that is currently not being included in our net worths. And probably rightfully so. I don&#8217;t like putting &#8220;things&#8221; on there because it&#8217;s mostly stuff we need to survive on a regular basis and won&#8217;t ever sell anyways, and most other stuff is either too hard to reasonably value\/sell too, or it just doesn&#8217;t feel &#8220;right.&#8221; Like a blog or makeup collection. And if you do happen to sell any of it, well, then it filters nicely right into your next month&#8217;s worth update anyways! Which is exactly how I like it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><b>So yes, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/50000-richer\/\">selling those sites<\/a> of mine WAS technically &#8220;stealth&#8221;, as Sam so smartly pointed out, however its all stuff that I don&#8217;t feel belongs in a net worth valuation anyways.<\/b> At least my own. You can certainly make the case that a &#8220;business&#8221; has assets and thus value so it SHOULD be included, just like our cars or even homes for that matter (which some people also <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/08\/calculating-net-worth-does-home-value\/\">don&#8217;t believe should go in there<\/a> since you need one to live in), but for me it&#8217;s just too unstable to be accounted for on an ongoing basis. I prefer the nice surprise of an influx of cash when beautiful days like that happen anyways ;) Better to be more conservative than not when it comes to money in my mind&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>As for <em>purposely<\/em> hiding wealth from people? Yes &#8211; I definitely do that outside of this blog :) As much as I love talking about money and helping others, when it comes to the &#8220;real world&#8221; I often find it&#8217;s smarter to lay low and live your lives more modestly than spout out your good fortunes all over. No pun intended. The second someone perceives you as <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/02\/frugality-rant-you-are-so-lucky-must-be-rich\/\">being rich<\/a> (or poor) or anything else that will affect how they act around you, it all turns into a big pile of mess and it&#8217;s *very* hard to undue.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, there are some people probably reading this blog right now that I wish I hadn&#8217;t let slip years ago that I now can&#8217;t ever take back&#8230; My guess\/hope is that they&#8217;ve long forgotten about it altogether &#8211; or better yet, got BORED with it! Haha&#8230; cuz Lord knows &#8220;normal&#8221; people don&#8217;t enjoy reading about money :) &#8211; but the fact is I just don&#8217;t know and now it bugs me whenever I stop and think about it.<\/p>\n<h2>The point to all this today?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Not everything needs to be included in your net worth<\/b> except for stuff you WANT, or FEEL, needs to be in there. There&#8217;s technically an answer to what &#8220;net worth&#8221; is: assets minus liabilities, but really what matters is how YOU want to use it in order to stay on track or motivated. It doesn&#8217;t help anyone else but you, so track all the stuff that you feel makes sense in your given situation.<\/li>\n<li><b>Be conscious of whom you share stuff with.<\/b> Not everything needs to be on display 24\/7 like we&#8217;re so used to these days with Facebook and Twitter and Pinterest (read this post by Donna Freedman if you ever get a chance: <a href=\"http:\/\/donnafreedman.com\/2013\/10\/05\/living-in-the-quieter-spots-of-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Living in the quieter spots of life<\/a>), because once stuff is out there it&#8217;s hard to take back. It&#8217;s possible, but hard.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So thanks again Sam for sparking my juices today (why does that sound so dirty???)!\u00a0 And hopefully the rest of you got some good takeaways from this brain dump too :) Feel free to leave your own thoughts on what you feel does &#8211; or does not &#8211; belong in your net worth down below. And if you monitor your transparency around others in the &#8220;real world&#8221; too?<\/p>\n<p><b>Thanks for reading :)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>Photo cred: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/12me\/\">12me<\/a> \/\/ Tweaked by J$<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The other week Sam from Financial Samurai stopped by my blog and left a comment in response to me selling those sites for $50k last&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/stealth-wealth-hiding-net-worth\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[18],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-36382","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-net-worth"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What &quot;Stealth Wealth&quot; Are You Hiding? | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/stealth-wealth-hiding-net-worth\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"What &quot;Stealth Wealth&quot; Are You Hiding? | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The other week Sam from Financial Samurai stopped by my blog and left a comment in response to me selling those sites for $50k last...
