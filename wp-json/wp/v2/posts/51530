I think she&#8217;s since seen the light though, after seeing the projections Wealthsimple showed her if she keeps it up ;)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51535\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-auto-contributions.png\" alt=\"wealthsimple auto contributions\" width=\"501\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-auto-contributions.png 1360w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-auto-contributions-300x292.png 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-auto-contributions-768x747.png 768w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-auto-contributions-1024x995.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, enough of an intro&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;re about, and why they&#8217;re worth a look in my opinion.<\/p>\n<h2>What Wealthsimple Does<\/h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/wealthsimple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wealthsimple<\/a> is a financial company that helps you build a portfolio of low-fee funds (ETFs), without charging you an exorbitant amount to do so. Then they&#8217;ll manage it all for you, help you grow it, and offer advice along the way.<\/p>\n<p>So pretty much a &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221;, just without any minimum balance requirements and set up to be as simple as possible. They won&#8217;t charge you for trades or rebalances or account transfers (in fact, they will PAY any of the fees you might incur from moving over your money elsewhere!), and their main mission is to get people of any age and net worth to feel comfortable investing.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s more of the corporate speak off their website if you prefer that version :)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We provide world-class, long-term investment management without the high fees and account minimums associated with traditional investment managers. We invest your money in a globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds modeled after the same Nobel Prize-winning research used by the world\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2-big-differences-between-successful-and-unsuccessful-investors\/\" >savviest investors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Our cutting-edge technology helps you earn the best possible return on your money, while also lowering your tax bill. This means we do things like automatic rebalancing, dividend reinvesting, and tax loss harvesting\u2014services that most people couldn\u2019t afford until now or found too time-consuming and tedious to do on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Our financial advisers are always available when you need them. They can help plan your financial milestones and answer questions you might have about potential risks or what sort of investment accounts you should have.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>And looking at some of their stats and recent awards, I think they&#8217;re accomplishing their mission:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have over 20,000 clients now<\/li>\n<li>Managing over $750,000,000 of their money<\/li>\n<li>Was just named 2016&#8217;s &#8220;Best Financial Website&#8221; in the Webby Awards, as well as one of the Top 100 Most Innovative Financial Companies.<\/li>\n<li>And have $50 million in backing from one of the world\u2019s largest financial companies (Power Financial)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>A Look at The Portfolios They Offer<\/h2>\n<p>So how and where do they invest everyone&#8217;s money?? They use a similar approach that other robo-advisors use, which is basing portfolios on &#8220;Modern Portfolio Theory&#8221; introduced by the Nobel Prize-winning economist Harry Markowitz. Who basically proved that you can minimize volatility (risk) and maximize reward (money!) by <em>diversifying<\/em> your investments.<\/p>\n<p>And as a refresher, typically the younger you are the more aggressive you want to go for better shot of growing your pot (and having enough time to recoup losses from major crashes), and the older\/more conservative you are the more you&#8217;ll want to skew towards investments set up to *preserve* your money more than grow it.<\/p>\n<p>Though of course you also have to factor in a number of other variables like how comfortable you are with risk, what strategies you believe in, if you care about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/what-is-socially-responsible-investing-and-how-to-start\/\">socially responsible funds<\/a> or not, etc etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a look at the options they offer:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51537\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-conservative-funds.jpg\" alt=\"wealthsimple conservative funds\" width=\"601\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-conservative-funds.jpg 859w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-conservative-funds-300x176.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-conservative-funds-768x450.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Conservative Portfolio<\/strong> &#8212; You&#8217;ll see with this one *bonds* make up a bulk of the investments at over 70% because they&#8217;re the safest. But they also have the least returns, so those interested in growing their $$ over long periods of time probably want to shy away from this route (vs those getting closer to retirement and will soon be tapping their investments to live off).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51538\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-balanced-fund.jpg\" alt=\"wealthsimple balanced fund\" width=\"603\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-balanced-fund.jpg 858w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-balanced-fund-300x159.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-balanced-fund-768x406.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Balanced Portfolio<\/strong> &#8212; This one&#8217;s more even across the board, and probably the one most people start with when first dipping their toes into investing. You&#8217;ll get 50% stocks and 50%&#8217;ish bonds. Still wayyyyyy too conservative for my blood, but it is balancing more risk\/reward than the previous option.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51539\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-growth-funds.jpg\" alt=\"wealthsimple growth funds\" width=\"600\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-growth-funds.jpg 860w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-growth-funds-300x183.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-growth-funds-768x470.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Growth Portfolio<\/strong> &#8212; Then we have the one I&#8217;d personally put my money into if I weren&#8217;t all in VTSAX with Vanguard (which is even MORE aggressive as it&#8217;s 100% stocks ;)). With this portfolio of only 20% bonds and 80% stocks, your money is set up to grow much faster while at the same time lose money faster during all the downturns &#8211; which is a matter of *when* they&#8217;ll happen, not *if*. So again it&#8217;s EXTREMELY important to know what your comfort levels are and what you&#8217;re willing to risk or not.<\/p>\n<p>Though keep in mind being &#8220;risky&#8221; with ETFs (which are GROUPS of funds &#8211; not just a single stock) already waters down the risk pretty heavily. So while you are still investing in stocks overall, it&#8217;s like investing in 100 different stocks vs just 1 main one like, say, Apple or Facebook. Which rise and fall much more sharply on any given day.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51540\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-social-funds.jpg\" alt=\"wealthsimpl socially aware funds\" width=\"604\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-social-funds.jpg 800w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-social-funds-300x162.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-social-funds-768x415.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, we have the Socially Responsible Funds<\/strong> &#8212; these are the funds set up that prioritize the impact companies make on the world around us. For example, you won&#8217;t find cigarette or alcohol companies in here, nor maker of hairspray bottles :) Though I&#8217;m not totally versed in these, so good to check out what exactly these hold to make sure they align with your own overall goals. Pretty cool to see though how investing companies are catering to all types of preferences out there!<\/p>\n<h2>Okay, So Does Wealthsimple Cost?<\/h2>\n<p>Smart question &#8211; good job asking :) For the first year they will charge NO fees managing your money, as long as your portfolio is under $5,000. After that, they do start charging, but much less than you will see at other places (at least for *actively managed* funds &#8211; not doing it yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Here are the two options they offer:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/wealthsimple\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51534\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-fees.jpg\" alt=\"wealthsimple fees\" width=\"501\" height=\"470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-fees.jpg 877w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-fees-300x282.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealthsimple-fees-768x721.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;ll cost more if you have less invested, and will cost less if you have more invested &#8211; pretty typical. If you&#8217;re already investing, check this with your own funds\/firm and see how it compares?<\/p>\n<p>As a reference, before I started managing my own investments I was paying anywhere from 1% to 3% in fees losing THOUSANDS over the years. And I&#8217;m a financial blogger!! (Albeit a pretty dumb one up until recently&#8230;). So wherever you put your money, just PROMISE ME you&#8217;re paying attention to all the fees you&#8217;re paying &#8211; they&#8217;re important.<\/p>\n<h2>Who Wealthsimple is For, and Who They&#8217;re <em>Not<\/em> For<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so all that being said, here&#8217;s my personal opinion on who I think they&#8217;re for and who they&#8217;re not for. Since obviously not all Fintech is good for all situations (or people).<\/p>\n<p>Who Wealthsimple IS for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone new to investing and just wanting to get started<\/li>\n<li>Anyone who doesn&#8217;t want to spend the time researching on their own<\/li>\n<li>Anyone who doesn&#8217;t want to spend time managing any of their funds<\/li>\n<li>Anyone who&#8217;s spending exorbitant fees having other people\/companies managing their portfolio<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Who Wealthsimple is NOT for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone who wants to manage their own money<\/li>\n<li>Anyone who wants the bare minimum fees due to managing their own money<\/li>\n<li>Anyone who prefers picking individual stocks or other investing strategies like dividend investing (Wealthsimple only gives options for ETFs)<\/li>\n<li>Anyone who isn&#8217;t comfortable managing their money online or via apps<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Basically, you need to know yourself and your goals way before giving Wealthsimple, or any company for that matter, your business. My goal on this site is to show you a variety of avenues to help you pick the one that best fits :)<\/p>\n<h2>Other FAQs<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is money insured with them?<\/strong> Yup.
