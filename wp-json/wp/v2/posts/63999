Nothing fancy, I just created it in Google Docs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, here are my annual and monthly activities broken down:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Set an Annual Budget (Your Year in Preview)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of each year, I try to set an annual budget number. This is a forecast of approximately how much my wife and I plan to spend in the upcoming year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have about 20 spending categories, and each one gets its own assigned budget. My basic template looks like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64377 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/1-sample-blank-budget-e1640572900860.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"230\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I forecast all our <\/span><b>fixed expenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These are the things I already know the exact cost of\u2026 Like rent, insurance, car registration, internet and phone, etc.\u00a0 Since I already know how much they&#8217;ll cost, I just stick those numbers straight into the budget. Easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, I look at all my <\/span><b>variable expenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These are things that can be high or low depending on the month. The best way I\u2019ve found to forecast variable expenses is to look at how much I spent in total <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the prior year<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Then, I adjust a bit for inflation, or upcoming life changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, in 2021, I spent $7,015 on groceries. Some months were low (in March we spent $331) and some were really high (July we spent $1,027). Since I can\u2019t predict which will be the high and low months next year, I really only care about the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average and total<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>As for inflation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, if I were to buy the exact same groceries next year as I did last year, they might cost me ~5%+ more. So Instead of forecasting $7k for next year, maybe I want to make it $7,500 to be more realistic.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>As for life changes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, my wife and I might <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/our-foster-to-adoption-journey\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have a kiddo or two<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> next year&#8230; so maybe I want to add another $1k to cover them for food, too?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, you get the point\u2026 after thinking ahead a little bit, I assign an annual budget number for each category, and divide that by 12 for the monthly number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lasty, I try to plan for <\/span><b>large, isolated expenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the upcoming year. I assign numbers to these based on how much I think they might cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, here are some isolated events that I need to budget for in 2022\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weddings: I\u2019m invited to 3 weddings next year, and in one I\u2019ll be a groomsman. So, I\u2019m going to add a $2,000 budget line item for \u201cweddings\u201d to cover gifts and travel. Since I won\u2019t have this expense every year, I keep it separate from my regular annual travel\/gifts categories.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New (used) car: My wife and I might buy a minivan next year. Maybe I\u2019ll add $20,000 as a budget placeholder. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Or maybe we\u2019ll just make our kids suffer in the Prius \u2013 haven\u2019t decided yet. &#x1f923;)<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone\u2019s numbers are different. Everybody\u2019s life goals are different. It behooves you to make your budget as custom as possible to YOUR life, income level, and desires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A successful budget is<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more about<\/span><b> knowing yourself <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">than it is about the actual numbers.

(We are not on a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tight<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> budget.) What does concern me, however, is a <\/span><b>trend of overspending.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why I like having all of my numbers side by side in a budget spreadsheet. At a glance, I can quickly tell if we are slipping into bad spending habits that need correction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Adjust Your Budget (Mid-Year Course Corrections)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s unrealistic to think that we\u2019ll spend exactly what we budgeted for every month and year. Budgets aren\u2019t exact. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/budget-unplanned-expenses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They need wiggle room<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few adjustments and things my wife and I do mid-year\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, if we <\/span><b>under<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spend consistently, this is AWESOME! It means we accidentally budgeted too much. Underspending in one category can sometimes cancel out overspending in another category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we notice consistent <\/span><b>overspending<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a category, before trying to correct it, we ask ourselves these 2 questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Is this spending in line with our values in life?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (My wife and I are trying our best to do <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/value-based-budgeting-more-happiness-for-your-dollars\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">values based budgeting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>If overspending continues, will it majorly derail our life goals or financial plans?<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we are overspending on stupid crap that doesn\u2019t add value to our life, we try to cut it out ASAP. This requires being more mindful during the following months, checking in with each other more regularly, and perhaps even starting a savings challenge of some sort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if we are overspending on things that DO provide us a lot of value (and it\u2019s not majorly derailing our wealth-building journey) we allow it to continue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, I mentioned we spent ~$7k in groceries this year (but we only budgeted for $6k). I realized we were going to blow this budget a few months ago, so my wife and I sat down to discuss it&#8230; We agreed that groceries and food is what we LOVE spending our money on. (We host a lot and enjoy buying premium ingredients for special occasions). In this case, we agreed overspending was OK to continue, instead of switching to beans and rice for the rest of the year to cut costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>To compensate for overspending,<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we try these types of things:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce spending in a different category. For example, we might cut back on mid-week drinking for a month or two. This could save us a few hundred dollars, and we could put that toward the overspend on groceries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick up a temporary <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustles-couples\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">side hustle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cover some costs. This year when Cooper had ~$400 in vet bills, I was able to cover those unexpected costs with additional contract hours at work.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a last resort, we break into our emergency fund or pull from investments. We really haven\u2019t ever had to do this, but it could happen if we hit large unplanned expenses (like our car completely dying or a medical emergency).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Automation, Saving Time, and Keeping Budgeting FUN<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main objections I hear about budgeting is, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI just don\u2019t have the time!\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe some of these things will help:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automate your expense tracking!

For example, I used to track hotels,flights, airport food, and Ubers all in separate categories&#8230; But that took too much time, so now I stuff all that type of spending into a single \u201ctravel\u201d category.
