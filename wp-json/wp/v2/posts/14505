For me, it&#8217;s how I afford an extra trip a year, a comfy new reading chair or a big night out with my friends. Having a side gig gives me the extra income boost that I reserve for fun (and perhaps unnecessary things).<\/p>\n<h2>My side hustle is dog walking.<\/h2>\n<p>For most of the day, I&#8217;m stuck in front of my computer making my living as a freelance writer. I also spend a lot of time on my computer writing for my blog, perusing the Internet and social media sites, and talking to my friends. After a few months of being a slave to my computer, I realized that I also needed to make NON-computer time a priority in my day. I started going for walks, taking longer to grocery shop and reading more books and magazines. This was fine for a little while, but I&#8217;m the type of person that HAS to work, that LIKES to work, so I started dreaming up an ideal part-time job for myself. When browsing Craigslist for odd job ideas, I came across an ad for dog walking and knew that this was my side hustle calling.<\/p>\n<p>Dog walking is a great side hustle because the clients are adorable, you get exercise, you&#8217;re helping out a caring pet owner (having a dog of my own, I know what it&#8217;s like to want the best for your pup), the hours are short and you can make around $16-$24\/hour depending on your rates. You also get to be the person who walks in the door and is greeted by an excited dog who can&#8217;t wait to go for a walk a couple times a day. Instant happiness booster.<\/p>\n<h2>How To Get Started<\/h2>\n<p>You can either set out on your own by posting ads and flyers in highly trafficked areas like pet stores or joining a service like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sittercity.com\/pet-sitting.html\">Sittercity.com<\/a>. You can also find an already established pet sitting business in your town to work for. Trust is a huge deal in dog walking because a pet owner is essentially giving you a key to their home and trusting you with their pet, so having a completed background check and doing an in-person meet and greet with an owner is almost a must.<\/p>\n<p>You basically need no supplies to get started, unless you want to spruce things up a bit by offering to supply your own doggy bags for walks, getting an organizer for any paperwork, a carabiner to keep keys on or a notepad to write daily &#8220;status reports&#8221; for owners to come home to. Dog and cat owners LOVE to see what you and their pet did that day, where you walked, and if Fido did a #2 or just a #1.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you are setting out on your own and finding dogs to walk without joining up with an existing pet sitting company, you&#8217;ll still probably want to research the competition in your area to figure out things like your rate (typical in my area of Philadelphia is somewhere around $12-$15 for a 30-minute walk and $20-$25 for a 60-minute walk) and your service area. When picking up clients, a word to the wise is to keep your service area limited so that you aren&#8217;t wasting time driving more than a few miles between clients. More walking equals more money.<\/p>\n<h2>What Kind of People Make Ideal Dog Walkers?<\/h2>\n<p>The best dog walkers are people who, of course, love dogs and don&#8217;t mind walking them when it&#8217;s hot, cold or anything in between. You also can&#8217;t be squeamish about picking up their poop, it&#8217;s just a part of the job. An ideal dog walker is someone who can handle all types of dogs, and also knows their limits. For example, I weigh about 115 lbs. and know that if an extremely rambunctious 125 lb. German Shepherd came about as a prospective client, I might need to decline the job in order to avoid being pulled all over the neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>Another important aspect of dog walking is the ability to have a flexible schedule. Most owners want their dogs walked between the hours of 11am-2pm because this is &#8220;mid day&#8221; for dogs who have owners that work a 9-5. While this schedule works perfectly for me and my freelancing lifestyle, it may not be an option for many. If you aren&#8217;t able to do lunch hour walks, you can still get into dog walking by either finding clients with different schedules (i.e. a nurse with a nighttime shift), or offering pet sitting and dog walking services on the weekends or while owners are on vacation. After all, if you are walking a dog outside of &#8220;normal walking hours,&#8221; you can charge more!<\/p>\n<h2>How Much Money You&#8217;ll Make<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on how much you (or the company you start working with) charges for 30-minute walks, 60-minute walks and pet sitting (overnight), you can expect to make around $16-$24 an hour. I currently walk 3 dogs on most days at $20\/hour, making my daily earnings about $30 on average (on Fridays I normally only walk two dogs). If you multiply that out, I can make an average of $600 a month by walking 2 or 3 dogs a day for about an hour and a half total each day.<\/p>\n<p>As a dog lover and freelancer who needs some time away from the house each day, dog walking as a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/side-hustles-couples\/\" >side hustle<\/a> could not be a more perfect pairing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Jen Fromal<\/strong> is a writer and traveler who blogs at The Smashed Planet about traveling, working, relationships and puppies.
