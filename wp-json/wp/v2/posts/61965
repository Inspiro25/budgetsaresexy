Here&#8217;s a financial snapshot of one of our readers of the blog, Corrine &#8211; who also fancies herself a good spreadsheet (or four) like any good finance nerd out there ;) What a beautiful thing to have your epiphany *early on* in life! Congrats Corrine!!]<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p>Hi J. Money!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I really enjoy seeing <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/other-peoples-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these financial snapshots<\/a>&#8230; they are super inspiring!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to share a financial snapshot of my own. It&#8217;s my experience tracking money as a young person who is just obsessed with all things finance. I&#8217;m 24, and I graduated college somewhat recently (May 2017), but I did work part-time through most of college. I am extremely lucky that I graduated debt-free thanks to my scholarships combined with my part-time work and the generosity\/financial planning of my wonderful parents.<\/p>\n<p>I started officially working full time in May 2017 and have been tracking my net worth diligently since December 2017. I currently make $50,000 (up from $38,000 this time last year!) after a recent raise in August and this is the most I have ever made.<\/p>\n<p>I am at a post-tax savings rate of about 27%, with 13% of my post-tax income currently going to my ROTH IRA and the rest going to my other savings goals (future house, travel fund, emergency fund). I also contribute 10% pretax to my company&#8217;s SIMPLE IRA with an additional 3% employer match, and I contribute $50 per month to my HSA.<\/p>\n<p>Before tracking my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-10-boriss-den\/\">net worth<\/a>, I had been working part time for 4 years and had only ~$4,000 to show for it (I also had very few expenses in college &#8212; I have no idea where all my money went, lol). <strong>Once I started really looking at what I was doing with my money, I doubled my net worth in ~6 months<\/strong>. My current net worth is $35,000.<\/p>\n<p>I currently live with my boyfriend of 3 years, and we share expenses such as groceries and rent 50-50. We are planning to rent until we get married and figure out exactly where we want to live long term (we plan to buy a house and settle into a permanent location within the next 2-3 years).<\/p>\n<h2>Financial Snapshot Spreadsheet<\/h2>\n<p>I am a huge fan of spreadsheets and wanted to provide a little explanation of the trackers I use:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-summary-corrine.gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62000\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/financial-summary-corrine.gif\" alt=\"financial snapshot spreadsheet\" width=\"608\" height=\"487\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(click to blow up bigger)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>My &#8220;Financial Summary&#8221; is essentially where I track my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-4-knock-at-the-door\/\">net worth<\/a> at any given time.<\/strong> It&#8217;s a true financial snapshot. Anything is green is an asset, and anything in red is a liability&#8230; and anything that is black is an account that fluctuates frequently (such as my primary checking) so I don&#8217;t include it in my overall calculations.<\/p>\n<p>I keep a balance in my checking (&#8220;Spending&#8221;) that is always higher than my cumulative credit card balance, since I pay for everything on credit cards to collect rewards. I have never paid interest on any of my credit cards since I have all bills set to auto pay from my spending account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62001\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/net-worth-over-time-corinne.gif\" alt=\"net worth graph\" width=\"486\" height=\"304\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My &#8220;Net Worth Over Time&#8221; tracker is really just so I can ensure that I am consistently moving up!<\/strong> I really enjoy looking back at it to see how far I&#8217;ve come. I received an inheritance of sorts ($10,000) in October 2018 which accounts for the big jump there which I threw into a 2 year CD for my future down payment on a house. I also got a bonus at work that month which accounts for the rest of the jump, and needless to say, that was a wonderful month!<\/p>\n<p>The only dip in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-8-garden-gate\/\">net worth<\/a> I have had in my entire duration of tracking was when I bought Hamilton tickets for my boyfriend and I in June 2018&#8230; it was a pretty big splurge that I dipped into my travel account for, but I have absolutely no regrets since that is what it is there for. Why earn money if you can&#8217;t treat yourself sometimes? The other one was when I bought my new-to-me car in April 2019 (and subsequently forgot to add the car\u2019s value to my net worth, lol \u2013 I fixed it the next month).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62002\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wealth-ratio-spreadsheet-corrine.gif\" alt=\"wealth ratio\" width=\"610\" height=\"507\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The &#8220;Wealth Ratio&#8221; came from you!<\/strong> I saw you do it in a blog post quite some time ago and loved the idea. I&#8217;ve been tracking it since and I find that it really helps hold me accountable.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Editor&#8217;s Note: The <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/total-lifetime-earnings-wealth-ratio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lifetime Wealth Ratio<\/a> tells you how much money you&#8217;ve saved over your lifetime compared to how much you&#8217;ve *earned* ;) You can get a quick estimate of this by dividing your Net Worth by your Total Income found on your Social Security Statements.
