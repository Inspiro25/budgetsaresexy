Now Has a Net Worth!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Awww yeahhhhhh! Go Baby $ Go Baby $ Go! Or is he Baby J. now? I dunno&#8230; Either way, he&#8217;s a baby with over $3,000 to his name now! ;) He just opened up his first two financial accounts and I can tell by the way he&#8217;s looking at me now that he&#8217;s feeling pretty good about it, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>1st Account: Savings &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$605.01<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We had been collecting a few checks that people have sent over when he was born, and it only recently occurred to me that we couldn&#8217;t cash them! We have no accounts with the baby&#8217;s name on it, haha&#8230; Oops. It never crossed my mind until I sat down to deposit them (which is kinda weird, really). But we cleared that up real fast with a quick call to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa\">USAA<\/a>, naturally, and 3 minutes later he had his first official account &#8211; Woohoo!<\/p>\n<p>$350 of it came from my winnings of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/05\/won-ramit-social-experiment-cash-giveaway\/\">Ramit&#8217;s $1,000 Giveaway<\/a> the other month (I was going to put it into Baby J&#8217;s college account, but decided to *match* it instead. Something I&#8217;m thinking of doing in the future when he&#8217;s old enough to start being taught about money :)), and the rest from friends and family. Not too bad for a 4-month old! That&#8217;s more than a lot of people keep in savings unfortunately :(<\/p>\n<h2>2nd Account: A College Savings 529 Plan &#8211; <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$2,500.00<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>I finally decided to make a decision one way or the other with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/09\/pros-cons-529-college-savings-account\/\">saving for his college<\/a>, and we went with our state&#8217;s 529 plan because they allow you to deduct up to $2,500 a year of what you put in! Which is FREE money right off the bat &#8211; making our decision much easier in the end :)<\/p>\n<p>I had originally thought we&#8217;d just open one up with USAA so I could have everything in one spot which I thoroughly enjoy, but it turns out you have to do it with whatever financial institution the State has set it up with. Which unfortunately is not USAA&#8230; But that&#8217;s fine, the money saved with taxes totally makes up for it. At least for as long as we live here (once\/if we move, I&#8217;ll then see what *that* state offers and if it&#8217;s equally good I&#8217;ll just roll it all over into a new one with them. And if it sucks, I&#8217;ll then go with USAA until\/if w move again&#8230; No point in throwing away free and EASY money, right?)<\/p>\n<p>And then once we decided on opening the account, it was hard of course to *only* put in the $350 I\u00a0 had initially set aside for it (that same one from Ramit&#8217;s Giveaway I won), so we just said &#8220;F it&#8221; and poured the full $2,500 into it so that we can max out those tax benefits for the 2012 year. It&#8217;s just SO HARD to pass up deals like that! Especially since we have the money sitting there in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/net-worth-update-331530-72-increase-of-30k\/\">our Savings<\/a> just doing nothing&#8230; It would be a different story if we didn&#8217;t have those reserves and another great reminder of how cash gives you OPTIONS later! It may sit there waiting for opportunities for a little time, but then when you&#8217;re ready to move you can just jump right in and work it :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So Baby Money starts his life out with a few grand to his name! <\/strong>We&#8217;ll probably end up doing automatic deposits of $200\/mo starting in 2013 to hit our $2,500 goal going forward as well. It&#8217;s not the $400\/mo or so that &#8220;professionals&#8221; recommend (ya know, cuz college will be like $3 Billion dollars for everyone then), but it&#8217;s a good enough start for now&#8230; Maybe we&#8217;ll get lucky and our investments will return 15%+ a year to make up for it ;)<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and speaking of which, I just chose one of those Target Date funds for now where all the money will be going&#8230; I thought of picking one of the more aggressive stocks-only plans, but I know the wife would worry about it too much so we&#8217;re going the more safer route instead ;) Only time will tell if it worked! (And we can change it once a year if we decide to too, which is nice)<\/p>\n<h2>Now a question for you: Should we include this in *our* <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/net-worth\/\">Net Worth updates<\/a> going forward? Or no?<\/h2>\n<p>I know this post is all about the baby having his own net worth and all that, haha, but I&#8217;m wondering if it makes sense to still keep it in ours instead? Since really it&#8217;s <em>our money<\/em> that&#8217;s allocated to him for later use? (Except for gifts that were directly for him, of course)<\/p>\n<p>I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be the end of the world to start tacking <em>two<\/em> net worths going forward, but I just can&#8217;t tell which side makes the most sense anymore&#8230; I mean, if\u00a0 he never uses the college money for whatever reason, wouldn&#8217;t it still be OURS? To either give to someone else or cash in and take the penalty hits? My brain hurts from thinking about it&#8230; Curious to see what YOU would do.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Thanks guys!<\/strong><\/em> All uncharted territory for us.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em><strong>In other news:<\/strong> I still need to update our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/ultimate-baby-child-costs-tracker\/\">baby&#8217;s money tracker<\/a> for the last couple of months. Sorry to all those asking me about it! Turns out it&#8217;s a lot harder to stay on top of than I thought :( At least right now while I&#8217;m a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/becoming-a-stay-at-home-dad-blogger\/\">stay-at-home dad<\/a> two days a week, but I&#8217;ll try and be better about it!
