Isn&#8217;t that insane?\u00a0 To access HER OWN money??\u00a0 She switched to pushing &#8220;credit&#8221; at gas stations, and saying &#8220;Debit&#8221; whenever asked for that or credit, and using her EXACT SAME CARD the fees magically disappeared.\u00a0 Just for saying a different word, ridiculous.\u00a0 Double check that YOUR bank isn&#8217;t charging you for this too!!\u00a0 At least Bank of America TOLD their customers about their <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2011\/11\/01\/pf\/bank_of_america_debit_fee\/index.htm\">$5.00 debacle<\/a>, unfortunately not all banks do (or I should say, their representatives.

Though the wife once got a $250 hit cuz she didn&#8217;t want to walk home late at\u00a0 night and all our spots were taken outside our house&#8230; she ended parking on a yellow line at 3 a.m., and when she came back at 6 a.m. to move it she&#8217;d already been ticketed!\u00a0 Don&#8217;t think she remembered that cop that lived around the corner from us ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tolls<\/strong> &#8212; I don&#8217;t mind these *as* much as all the others, but the only time it really gets you is when you either end up in the WRONG lane and you can&#8217;t get to the cash one in time, OR it&#8217;s 100% electronic and no coins or dollars are accepted at all!\u00a0 If you&#8217;re\u00a0 not paying attention, or you&#8217;re not from around there, it&#8217;s super easy to get caught before you can do anything about it, and next thing you know you have a nice fat bill at your home 3 weeks later.\u00a0 Who can ever like that?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Coat checks that cost money<\/strong>\u00a0 &#8212; I feel like if you&#8217;re running a restaurant\/bar\/club\/whatever in the middle of the winter, then you should be able to provide this simple service charge free if we just shlepped through it all to get there.
