Later it was a guy who had earned &#8211; and lost! &#8211; millions of dollars over his lifetime from not managing his money all too well (he&#8217;s since back on track). And then this weekend I run into a wonderful woman who not only loves my hair (yipee!), but also sneaks in a pitch for prepaid legal subscriptions, haha&#8230; A pretty smooth feat when you can transition from hairspray chat to warding off identity theft in a matter of seconds ;) But I&#8217;ll admit it caught my attention! And she was a pretty cool chick too &#8211; we had some good convos&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;d never heard of *any* type of prepaid legal advice before, and certainly not anything on a monthly subscription plan.<\/strong> It&#8217;s actually a pretty cool idea, really. Even if more so for the company raking it in ;)\u00a0 You have protection when you need it, and when you don&#8217;t you just keep low and stress-free, continuing to pay your premium for whenever you happen to need it next.\u00a0 Kinda like health insurance and car\/home\/property insurance as well. It saves your ass in an emergency, but all the rest of the time you wonder why you&#8217;re paying for so much every month, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I can honestly see a market for that, though :) Considering the wife and I STILL &#8211; to this day &#8211; have not written up our wills even though we say we&#8217;re gonna do it almost every other weekend!\u00a0 Maybe a subscription like this would get us to DO IT?\u00a0 And then review\/edit it all the years forward too? Regardless we gotta figure it out SOON, especially now that we have a new member of our family to watch over going forward&#8230; We gotta get that stuff on lock.<\/p>\n<p>So naturally my first question to my new friend here was, &#8220;Will this get us to do our wills faster? And is it included?&#8221;\u00a0 And the answer back was, &#8220;Yup!&#8221;\u00a0 Off to a great start so far!<\/p>\n<p><strong>This company she was talking about (we&#8217;ll call her <em>Donna<\/em> going forward) was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legalshield.com\">Legal Shield<\/a>. <\/strong>Not to be confused with <a href=\"http:\/\/legalzoom.com\"><em>Legal Zoom<\/em><\/a>, with whom I&#8217;m much more familiar with and think they offer some pretty good stuff even if it costs you a pretty penny. When asked if that was her competition, she said something to the affect that they&#8217;re not even in the same ballpark, which is kinda true, though I do see what Legal Zoom <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legalzoom.com\/attorneys-lawyers\/legal-plans\/personal.html\">now offers<\/a> direct access to attorneys too &#8211; other than just legal *documents* like they&#8217;re usually known for.<\/p>\n<p>At any rate though, here&#8217;s Legal Shield&#8217;s main pitch off their homepage:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For less than $20 a month you can talk to a top quality law firm in your state about whatever you want, whenever you want.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Enticing, right?<\/strong> And if you look further you&#8217;ll see they already have over 1.4 million people signed up making you feel better, as well as an impressively large headquarters to boot.\u00a0 A pretty legit-looking operation. And upon further investigation you&#8217;ll find they help everyone from individuals, to families, to businesses and, of course, those associates looking to help sell Legal Shield too :)\u00a0 Which is what my pal Donna is happily involved with. And also the part of the site that made my cringe because no matter how hard I try, I just keep thinking &#8220;Pyramid scheme!&#8221; :( Which sucks because from what I&#8217;ve gathered so far they def. don&#8217;t seem to be one.<\/p>\n<p>And really there&#8217;s nothing wrong with promoting a company you love, anyways! Even if you get paid for it. We do it all the time as personal finance bloggers when we come across <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/recommend\/\">products we love<\/a> (insert shameless plug), but the only difference is that most times it&#8217;s not all up in your face like it is on Legal Shield&#8217;s website.\u00a0And people don&#8217;t randomly bring it up at yard sales either ;) Usually you have to scour a site to find their partnerships\/affiliates page, but with them it&#8217;s right next to their main bread and butter: the services they offer their customers. It just makes me wonder how many others are getting turned off by it and walking away before even giving it a chance?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regardless, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean their services suck, so I poked around further and saw they offer a ton of different help<\/strong> out there &#8211; all depending on how much you&#8217;re willing to spend, and the state you currently live in.\u00a0 Here is a snapshot of some of their services:<\/p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http:\/\/www.legalshield.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 0px 0px 0pt; float: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/legal-shield-logo.gif\" alt=\"legal shield logo\" width=\"213\" height=\"82\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/center><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advice on unlimited topics, personal or business even on pre-existing conditions<\/li>\n<li>Legal Document Review (up to 10 pages each)<\/li>\n<li>Standard will preparation<\/li>\n<li>IRS audit legal services<\/li>\n<li>Up to date credit report access<\/li>\n<li>Personal credit score with analysis and continuous monitoring<\/li>\n<li>Identity Restoration Services<\/li>\n<li>After-hours legal consultation for covered legal emergencies such as: if you&#8217;re arrested or detained, if you&#8217;re seriously injured, if you&#8217;re served with a warrant, or if the state tries to take your child(ren).<\/li>\n<li>Letters and phone calls on your behalf (At the discretion of the lawyer provided)<\/li>\n<li>Motor vehicle services: Accidents, traffic violations, help with defense for charges of manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, negligent homicide, or vehicular homicide<\/li>\n<li>Trial defense assistance if you or your spouse is named defendant or respondent in a covered civil or job-related criminal action filed in court.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>All stuff that&#8217;s GREAT if\/when you need &#8217;em.<\/strong> And according to Donna they have one of the BEST credit restoration services too &#8211; something both her and her husband is subscribed to (among others) and they swear by. But why hadn&#8217;t I ever heard of all this before? Am I the only one missing out on this new idea, or have others been taking advantage of it the entire time and forgot to send me the memo? :) I thought I&#8217;d poke around a little more, and hit up my good friends and fans on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lilmsmoneybags\/status\/240923082099941378\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151002501321560&amp;id=68302201559\">Facebook<\/a> to learn more and gauge the temperature a bit better&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what they said (thanks guys!):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;I use it and they have work our great me.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Sounds like prepaid legal, which I had a REALLY bad experience with a long time ago.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Great service from the company in FL. I&#8217;m always happy with the outcome I used them &#8230;and I&#8217;ve had them for 10 years now&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t think it is worth the money unless you plan on going to court and wanting an attorney at a discounted rate or you want to write out some contracts and want an attorney at a discounted rate&#8230; You are only allowed to do business with the firms that are in the legal shield program, so depending on where you are, I would make sure you have at least a few firms to deal with and they are decent firms.\u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t need it, but the discounts might be good for you.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Legal Shield is the old Prepaid Legal&#8230; I used to sell their products. They are a great service if you NEED an attorney. Do not get wrapped up into selling the service&#8230;Call me and I will let you know more details.&#8221; (Haha&#8230; I bet that would be interesting ;))<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Some rants and some raves, but overall pretty good info to take in.<\/strong>\u00a0 It shows they&#8217;re indeed doing *something* right, but obviously it&#8217;s not for everyone. And really I&#8217;m leaning towards me being part of that &#8220;not everyone&#8221; crowd too.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a fantastic concept no doubt about it, and not surprising so many people have already signed up to them (they&#8217;ve been in business for over 40 years!), but realistically how often would I, personally, use them?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I need to make or update a will &#8211; check.<\/li>\n<li>When I need a quick question on a legal matter, perhaps with my business &#8211; check.<\/li>\n<li>When my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/taking-ex-employer-to-court\/\">ex-employer goes bonkers<\/a> and I need to take them to court&#8211; check check!<\/li>\n<li>Or, perhaps, when the FBI shows up at my house a la Enron style and scares the bejesus out of\u00a0 me! Check, check, check, check, check, please! (Long story for a longer day)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>I could have used this service plenty of times over the years,<\/strong> but at the same time these one-offs could have been plenty less expensive too when all was said and done.\u00a0 Even if you had to deal with a little extra stress of not having that subscription plan backing you up the entire time.\u00a0 As sexy as that does sound&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>My mind isn&#8217;t made up quite yet, though, so if any of you L.S. lovers wanna stand up and convince me something bad will happen if we don&#8217;t sign up<\/strong> (maybe my left testicle will fall off?) I&#8217;m totally all <del>balls<\/del> ears.\u00a0 I wanna be wooed and told my life will get a ton better if I shell out $20\/$50\/mo, and that it&#8217;s completely and utterly worth it. And if you&#8217;re a broker for them, I wanna hear about that too!\u00a0 On top of being your average consumer here, I&#8217;m also a business man fascinated with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">people&#8217;s hustles<\/a>. And anything that generates tons of money will always have my attention ;)<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m gonna go back to researching those wills and trying <em>for real<\/em> to make those bad boys finally happen&#8230; I bet you some peanuts it&#8217;ll cost a lot less than a handful of months of Legal Shield ;) What do you think?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/proimos\/\">Alex E.
