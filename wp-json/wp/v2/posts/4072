Especially when you have no idea about whatever it is that&#8217;s broken.<\/p>\n<p>And when it comes to car stuff, I&#8217;ll be the first to admit I SUCK at it.\u00a0 I&#8217;m pretty much like the opposite of a guy in this department.\u00a0 Things start squeaking and I freak out.\u00a0 Not because I think it&#8217;ll explode or anything like that (it can&#8217;t explode, right?), but I&#8217;m just always afraid something huge is broken and it&#8217;ll cost me like $5,000 to fix :( So what usually happens is I keep on driving and ignoring the problems until I&#8217;m physically unable to do so any more &#8211; AKA the car STOPS. Haha&#8230; Or in this case I fail emissions, and am forced to rectify it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But anyways, after being told that it was gonna cost me $3,000 at one shop to fix 100% (there was like 3 things wrong according to them), I finally owned up and decided to call around just to be sure. <\/strong> It was super annoying and I honestly *hate* doing it with a passion, but there was no way I was going to shell out more money than the car was worth just to pass a stupid test.\u00a0 ESPECIALLY since MD has this waiver you can get once you cross over the $450 payment mark (so you don&#8217;t do exactly that &#8211; spend more on the car than it&#8217;s worth).\u00a0 Of course, it should have been a clear warning sign when body shop #1 didn&#8217;t even bring it to my attention!<\/p>\n<p>So I hit up two other places &#8211; the shop my family uses a few hours away, and the shop my wife&#8217;s family uses 45 mins away.\u00a0 But instead of taking in the car to both places &#8211; wasting lots more hours and money to inspect it all over again &#8211; I just faxed over the paperwork from body shop #1 (sneaky sneaky!) and had them take a look and get back to me with pricing ;)\u00a0 And here&#8217;s what they said:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanic #2:<\/strong> <span style=\"color: #800000;\">$1,300 to fix everything<\/span>. That already cut down the price in half!\u00a0 Wtf?\u00a0 But even more impressively, they recommended just fixing 1 of the things first (an oxygen sensor) and some other tiny things like an air filter and something else I can&#8217;t recall, so that I can make it over that $450 total cost in hopes I&#8217;d qualify for the Emissions Waiver :)\u00a0 And then if I didn&#8217;t, of course, I&#8217;d have to take it back and fix the other stuff.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mechanic #3:<\/strong> <span style=\"color: #800000;\">$1,000ish to fix everything<\/span>, and also brought up waiver information.\u00a0 Only problem with this one was that they were hours away and would be a pain to get fixed there.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what did I do? I used mechanic #2 and spent the additional $200 more to cross the waiver limit, and then took the ol&#8217; Caddy out for another inspection!\u00a0 And you know what happened?\u00a0 I freakin&#8217; passed!!!!\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t even have to go for the waiver! haha&#8230; man, talk about being in shock. I honestly thought I&#8217;d have to fight w\/ the waiver people to make sure I was in the clear.\u00a0 But that measly oxygen sensor did the trick!\u00a0 And I didn&#8217;t have to shell out $3,000 either.\u00a0 Freakin&#8217; rip-offs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So please, if you find yourself in a similar situation &#8211; either with car troubles or hospital stuff or dentist stuff, etc (basically anything big &amp; expensive) &#8211; get a 2nd and\/or 3rd opinion!<\/strong> It may take a little more time to do the research but it can literally save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. in the end.\u00a0 Just because we&#8217;re not experts in the field, doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t be experts at saving money ;)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember the other month when I thought I was gonna have to retire my Caddy?
