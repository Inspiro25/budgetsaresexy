I read through it, and I read through all of your comments. Thank you for the positive feedback and advice. Many of you share my thoughts\/have similar ideas of how to take care of this situation. It is comforting to see these thoughts because I am a bit ignorant when it comes to financial things (I\u2019m an elementary teacher). I know the basics, and I\u2019m pretty good with my money but don\u2019t know much about tracking and keeping solid financial records like some of you were mentioning. Luckily I have no debt of my own, so we will be able to just focus on solving the situation at hand.<\/p>\n<p>My husband has made significant lifestyle changes, and now it makes sense as to why he was so insistent about it. I know that he and I will come out of this situation stronger and DEBT FREE.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again for all of your advice and encouragement. Sometimes it just takes enough people saying it to give you the courage to make the jump.<\/p>\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n<p>The Wife (:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>See, it always pays to tell your wife everything :)<\/strong> That line here was pretty interesting to see too &#8211; &#8220;now it makes sense as to why he was so insistent about it.&#8221; And now they can work TOGETHER to supercharge it even more as well!
