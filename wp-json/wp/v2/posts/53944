Build a starter emergency fund of $1,000. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check!<\/span><\/strong> The first step to getting things stabilized, and probably one of the hardest when you&#8217;re first starting out. Especially when you&#8217;re making minimum wage and stuck in the checking and savings shuffle game&#8230; I was king of that! ($50 into savings today, $50 back into my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/hm-bradley-a-3-interest-checking-account-based-on-your-savings-rate\/\">checking account<\/a> at the end of the month when I&#8217;ve run out of money!) And the worst is that your brain only remembers the &#8220;saving&#8221; part, making you feel like you&#8217;ve saved when you haven&#8217;t ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. Organize your important financial information in a binder or eFile. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check!<\/span><\/strong> I still wanna do that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/great-idea-legacy-binders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Legacy Binder<\/a> idea because it&#8217;s nerdily bad ass, but for now we keep our important $$$ and Life info into a centralized Google Doc, as well as partially printed out and stored in our safe. I do need to be better about keeping everything updated though as info changes all the time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. Develop a monthly budget habit. <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Fail.<\/span><\/strong> What??? On a site called Budgets Are Sexy??? How is that possible?? Well, it&#8217;s possible because I spent 5+ years watching every penny and eventually got good at predicting my expenses without needing to look at it anymore :) I still think budgeting is one of the most important things to do when starting out, if not THE most important, but the good news is that once you&#8217;ve got a handle on everything you&#8217;re allowed to do whatever the F you want, haha&#8230; Even if you end up spending a little more had you continued to track it all :) So yeah &#8211; definitely still a huge fan of budgets and you gotta know where it&#8217;s all going, but my &#8220;budgets or die!&#8221; mantra has since eased up over time, and now I tend to focus more on the overall snapshot and trends (i.e. <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Net Worth<\/a>) than I do tracking every transaction. If you&#8217;re a budgeting beast though and it&#8217;s working for you no matter what stage you&#8217;re in, more power to you!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. Pay off all of your debts. <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Fail.<\/span><\/strong> No budgeting and DEBTS?? What the hell kind of $$ blogger are you? Haha&#8230; An enigma? Wrapped in a conundrum? :) I don&#8217;t really know, but I have been known to go years without any debts whatsoever, so I guess this checklist caught me on a debt-year. Though does it make it better if I can pay it off at any time if I wanted to?\u00a0 (It&#8217;s our car loan &#8211; no credit card debt or anything)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. Build a mid-level emergency fund of $10,000. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check.<\/span><\/strong> You probably do need to be out of your teens and early 20s to hit this level, but fortunately as the years &#8211; and job skipping\/promotions &#8211; continue, it gets easier and easier to start padding this boy. Though watch for kids and first homes and that bitch of a creeper, lifestyle inflation!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#6. Cut your expenses. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check.<\/span><\/strong> We could definitely be better, especially with the big three: home, car, food, but I&#8217;m giving us a pass here because we&#8217;ve come a far way over the years and planning on changing at least the home one significantly when we move next year. We&#8217;ve also been <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/thoughts-after-cutting-cable\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cable-free for over two years now<\/a> &#8211; woo! (And <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iPhone free<\/a> for over three!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#7. Be aware of your credit score. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check.<\/span><\/strong> I use a combination of grabbing my free Experian score from USAA (currently 829), and then also my TransUnion and Equifax scores which uses the VantageScore 3.0 rating from <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/credit-karma-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Credit Karma<\/a> (currently 835 and 833). There&#8217;s a ton of different scoring systems out there, but really as long as you&#8217;re monitoring one of them consistently over time you should be fine. If it moves sharply in any direction you know something&#8217;s up!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/credit-karma-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53954\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/credit-karma-scores-11-17.jpg\" alt=\"credit karma scores\" width=\"551\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/credit-karma-scores-11-17.jpg 800w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/credit-karma-scores-11-17-300x139.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/credit-karma-scores-11-17-768x356.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>(Don&#8217;t forget &#8211; you can always get your free credit *report* every year too through Credit Karma as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.annualcreditreport.com\/index.action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AnnualCreditReport.com<\/a>! (I know that last one sounds sketchy, but I swear it&#8217;s legit :))<\/p>\n<p><strong>#8. Earn extra income. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check.<\/span><\/strong> My &#8220;day&#8221; job and my &#8220;hustle&#8221; jobs are pretty much mixed these days, but I have recently taken on more consulting jobs so I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and count that as extra since I had stopped for a handful of months. Big thanks to FinCon for letting me <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-new-fintech-companies-fincon-competition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">judge the FinTech Competition<\/a> which brought in a wave of new business!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#9. Read the top personal finance books. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check.<\/span><\/strong> Although I&#8217;m much better about reading the <a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\/best-money-blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top personal finance blogs<\/a> since they tend to be more fun and relatable :) You&#8217;ll have to check out our books directory though over at Rockstar Finance as we recently polled <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/best-financial-books-ranked-by-personal-finance-bloggers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 100 financial bloggers<\/a> on their favorites and then built a place to feature them all. Let me know what you think: <a href=\"http:\/\/directory.rockstarfinance.com\/personal-finance-books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PF Book Directory<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>#10. Automate your savings. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check\/<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Fail.<\/span><\/strong> I automate a little of it, like when using <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/digit-review-save-money-fast-easy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digit<\/a>, but I tend to do most things manually these days just to have more control over it and appreciate it more. Like for example our new <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/spavings-savings-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spavings Experiment<\/a> we&#8217;ve just started. Automation can be great, but don&#8217;t discount the power of consciously moving things over yourself too!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#11. Automate your bills. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check\/<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Fail.<\/span><\/strong> I automate the bills that never change, but for everything else I just go in once a month and knock &#8217;em out in one sitting to make sure all is kosher and the accounts have the funds needed when anything unusual is going on. Similar to the automation of savings and other areas, it makes me feel better manually handling stuff and forcing myself to check in at least once a month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#12. Automate investing. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check\/<\/span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Fail.<\/span><\/strong> (Are you sensing a pattern here? :)). I automate some stuff, like our kids&#8217; 529 investments and when I was experimenting with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/acorns-app-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Acorns<\/a>, but by and large I manually push money into my SEP or Roth IRA when it&#8217;s time again for all the reasons listed above. Although for my wife&#8217;s TSP plan (the gov&#8217;ts version of the 401(k)) we automate that fully, and I highly advise everyone else doing the same who has access to it, if not just to grab all that free $$$$ most employers give you!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#13. Write a 5 year financial plan. <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Major Fail. <\/span><\/strong>Haha&#8230; If there&#8217;s one thing I just cannot do no matter how hard I try, it&#8217;s to forecast my future. It&#8217;s amazing I&#8217;ve made it <em>this far<\/em> in the career\/money world to be honest with you, as I can barely plan 5 weeks out no less 5 years! So anyone who can answer this question with a resounding &#8220;Yes&#8221;, or even a half-assed yes for that matter, gets major street cred in my books&#8230; I admire you greatly for being able to do that!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#14. Start maxing out your retirement account every year. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">MAJOR CHECK!!<\/span><\/strong> Whew &#8211; ending on a good note here! My only rule with $$$ is to max out both of my retirement accounts every year ($20,000&#8217;ish total), and I&#8217;m proud to say that I&#8217;m now on year #7 or #8 so far and still going strong :) It&#8217;s pretty much the entire backbone of my net worth, and so long as you can do that you get a free pass at sucking at everything else, haha&#8230; it&#8217;s just a matter of time <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/05\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">until you become a millionaire<\/a> even if you do nothing else!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#15. Complete your emergency fund so you have at least 6 months\u2019 expenses saved. <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Check.<\/span><\/strong> I dip above and beyond this number depending on what month\/year you catch me, but as it stands we do have enough to last us if another penny didn&#8217;t come in over the next 6+ months&#8230; This is a tough one to pull off for sure though, especially if you&#8217;re doing #14 above. At least once you hit it though you don&#8217;t have to touch it until an emergency comes up!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>So there it is! 15 financial goals to hit by 40 (or whenever)!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Looks like I scored a <strong>10.5<\/strong> out of a total possible <strong>15<\/strong>, woops, haha&#8230; Someone take away my blog card! But it&#8217;s true &#8211; I could certainly improve in a number of areas, not gonna lie. Always something to work on, right? Life would be boring being perfect, or something like that? :)<\/p>\n<p>A good exercise to check in on yourself though, whether you feel like sharing your results with others or not. All that counts is that you&#8217;re aware of what&#8217;s going on and striving to get better! And I&#8217;m rooting you on over here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>For those who do want to share though, let us know in the comments below what you scored, and how old you are if you dare :) Can be as easy as this, &#8220;I&#8217;m 37 years old and I scored 10.5 points out of 15.
