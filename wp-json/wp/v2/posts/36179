Especially with a baby! (And much easier to do btw when you&#8217;re GOING SOMEWHERE COOL than on the return trip, ugh.. We broke that one into two days and I&#8217;m still recovering)<\/p>\n<p>Overall the trip was super successful though, and <a href=\"http:\/\/financialbloggerconference.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">our financial blogger conference<\/a> was most definitely a success. I got to see all my nerd friends in person instead of on Twitter\/Facebook\/Blog\/Skype\/etc, and I met a handful of new ones as well. If your business or hobby ever has conference, I highly suggest checking &#8217;em out!\u00a0 It&#8217;s always nice to be face-to-face with people instead of a computer :) Especially when wooing\/partnering up on business&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In fact, here are some other tips with conferences too if you&#8217;re interested:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Network network NETWORK!<\/strong> They usually only last a day or two, so no matter how tired you are push through and meet as many people as you possibly can. You never know what sorts of relationships\/deals may come from it all.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Always stand near the food and\/or doors.<\/strong> This is the prime area where everyone goes and you&#8217;re bound to run into everyone at some point :) Whether they&#8217;re popular or not. I&#8217;ll sometimes stand there for hours just moving from one conversation to another and letting the time flow.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Let your time flow (or, don&#8217;t make any appointments!).<\/strong> The best way to network and meet people is to naturally let the time flow and make conversation as it&#8217;s presented to you. Nothing&#8217;s worse than getting into a great discussion, only to have to hit &#8220;time out&#8221; and run to a meeting to talk to someone else (or worse &#8211; flake out on them altogether). Yeah sometimes you can&#8217;t help it and there are advantages to having definite meetings in place, but overall I find it&#8217;s MUCH more helpful chatting with people as you run into them as it&#8217;s much more natural and, quite frankly, fun. This may only work with social butterflies though?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Smile and be nice.<\/strong> That sounds obvious, but believe me &#8211; people don&#8217;t do it. You only have one shot at a first impression, and better to come off as friendly to your peers than the opposite!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask a lot of questions.<\/strong> We tend to get caught up talking about ourselves all the time, but it&#8217;s much better to be engaged and learn about your new friend standing in front of you than spilling your blog stats. And this goes for dates too :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follow up with all your new friends!<\/strong> Once you&#8217;re back in town and sober, shoot &#8217;em all a note to let them know how nice it was to meet them. People love getting emails\/tweets like that as it makes us feel better! And more importantly it leaves the door open for future talks\/partnerships cuz now you&#8217;re officially &#8220;connected.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Bored yet? ;) Sorry, had to spill my brain while it&#8217;s hot and fresh! Maybe you&#8217;ll be hitting up your own conference soon and these will help?? No?? You hate conferences? Well $hit. Here, how about a joke to make up for the last 10 seconds of your life:<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Why is money called dough? Because we knead it!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Better? :) Here were the (more interesting) tidbits from our trip when it came to money&#8230; Mainly, how we ended up spending it:<\/p>\n<p><strong>RENTAL CAR:<\/strong> Came out to almost exactly <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$350<\/strong><\/span>. I *almost* got convinced to pick up extra insurance from them as they always try to do, but I said no and quickly walked away. At $19\/day it would have added an extra 50% to the bill! But I still wanted insurance, so I pinged <a href=\"https:\/\/www295.americanexpress.com\/premium\/car-rental-insurance-coverage\/home.do?intlink=US:Amex:NewSiteSearch:RecomLink1\" target=\"_blank\">Amex<\/a> to ask about what they provide as everyone told me credit cards can help with it, and for $25 they cover *entire trips*! Whether one day, or 20 days, $25 covers you if you get in a wreck and you don&#8217;t have to worry about hitting your own insurance if you don&#8217;t want to.<\/p>\n<p>Only problem was that I signed up for this AFTER I had rented the car, so it didn&#8217;t apply and thus we went un-extra-insured for the whole trip. We&#8217;ll be covered for the future which is nice, and according to Amex it&#8217;ll automatically activate when you use the card to pick up the car in the future which I kinda like&#8230; No more thinking about it! Is that what you all do??<\/p>\n<p><strong>GAS:<\/strong> Gas ended up being around <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$275<\/strong><\/span>. About $125 more than I originally guessed, oops. I don&#8217;t know what I was smoking though &#8211; how could gas only cost $150 for driving halfway across country and back?? Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>HOTEL:<\/strong> Came out to about <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>$210<\/strong><\/span> for my portion. Somehow $70 lower than I expected?? :)<\/p>\n<p>So a <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>total of $835<\/strong><\/span> not including food and snacks &#8211; that&#8217;s not so bad? For being on &#8220;vacation&#8221; for almost 6 straight days? Especially since we can write it all off as a business expense? ;) Much cheaper than flying all three of us out there to St. Louis and back too, so that was good&#8230; OH! And we got to watch part of the St. Louis play off game from a penthouse level suite! It was dope! Made me like baseball just an *ounce* more, haha&#8230; Now if only they could speed up the game a bit ;)<\/p>\n<p>Other random nuggets from FINCON:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I got mistaken for <a href=\"http:\/\/mrmoneymustache.com\">Mr. Money Mustache<\/a>. *Twice*.<\/strong> Probably because I exude bad-assity to the max and had nothing to do with my ridiculous &#8216;stache I wore all week ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I drank lots of free beer!<\/strong> Another helpful conference tip: Hang around people who don&#8217;t drink ;) That way you&#8217;re first in line to get their free drink tickets! haha&#8230; Or become wonderful blogging friends like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1500days.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">1500 Days<\/a> who literally drove 850+ miles to bring me some local beer from their Denver residence &#8211; so sweet of you all! Thanks so much!<\/li>\n<li><strong>I toured the St. Louis Federal Reserve! <\/strong>Had nothing to do with Fincon actually (my cousin works there), but I got to walk around and meet a whole bunch of important-looking people doing lots of important stuff :) And then of course drooled over the stacks and stacks of cold hard cash in the basement! I even had to dress appropriately as to &#8220;fit in&#8221; the best I could, which really didn&#8217;t work well, haha&#8230; Hopefully I didn&#8217;t get my cousin fired ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I met a popular card counter!<\/strong> As random as it gets, but one of the co-founders of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackjackapprenticeship.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BlackJackApprenticeship.com<\/a> was there and struck up a conversation with me about getting into the personal finance game (they&#8217;ll be doing some financial literacy videos which aims to be pretty hip). Apparently he and his friends took $2,000 and built it into a 7-figure business as well as a documentary you can nab on Netflix. You don&#8217;t come across that every day :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I learned that *MARKETING* can often times be more important than the *PRODUCT* itself.<\/strong> I.E. if no one knows about it, you won&#8217;t ever sell anything. So Derek Halpern from <a href=\"http:\/\/socialtriggers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Triggers<\/a> shared some results when he changed from 20% time focused on content, and 80% on marketing the content (rather than vice versa). Grabbing 100,000+ subscribers in less than two years!<\/li>\n<li><strong>I found a penny on the ground while walking my baby to the car<\/strong> &#8211; that should go onto the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/ultimate-baby-child-costs-tracker\/\">Total Money Tracker<\/a>, right? :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>I wore 60% of my clothes to the conference!<\/strong> Haha&#8230; okay, not *that* much, but def. a lot of them ;) So thank for all the tips y&#8217;all left on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/10\/minimalism-wrecking-my-wardrobe\/\" target=\"_blank\">my minimalism post<\/a> earlier this week! I&#8217;m taking them all to heart!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lastly, people in Kentucky are SUPER nice,<\/strong> and I&#8217;m also half-way tempted to move to Charleston West Virginia too. One of the most beautiful places we saw all road trip!! Who knew??<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s enough brain dumping for now&#8230; What did you all get into this week\/end? Anything juicy or exciting? Anyone make some good money or start any businesses?? Anyone want to leave work right now and start the weekend early? ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whatever the case, I hope y&#8217;all are good and are ready to have some more fun over the next couple days&#8230;<\/strong> If I can ever help you with anything, just shout! I&#8217;ll be around all weekend catching up and responding to all your lovely emails\/comments\/etc. Hope you didn&#8217;t miss me too much ;)<\/p>\n<p>See ya on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> That&#8217;s fellow blogger <em>Steve Stewart<\/em> up there from <a href=\"http:\/\/moneyplansos.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Money Plan SOS<\/a> rockin&#8217; my shirt from back in the day &#8211; remember those?
