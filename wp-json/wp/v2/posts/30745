Feel free to comment anonymously if you&#8217;re afraid to answer question #2, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here we go&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was the best gift you got for Christmas this year?<\/li>\n<li>What was the worst gift?<\/li>\n<li>What was the best gift you GAVE someone this Christmas?<\/li>\n<li>Did you re-gift any of your old gifts?<\/li>\n<li>Outside of presents, what was your favorite part of the holiday?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;ll answer first, and then it&#8217;s your turn:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Best Gift:<\/strong> Hmm&#8230; this one&#8217;s close because I got a TON of awesome gifts this year, especially in the coin department which I was thrilled about!, but if I had to choose one I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a tie between two, haha&#8230; A bracelet my dad gave\u00a0 me which is usually unlike him (making it even MORE special), and a picture my wife gave me of the baby and I sleeping next to each other head-to-head. I freakin&#8217; love that little nugget!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Worst Gift:<\/strong> The worst gift I got this week was a book that I had already owned. So bad in that department, but spot on with what I obviously like ;) And now I get to return it and pick up something else which in a way makes it one of the best gifts! Haha&#8230; so did I cheat w\/ this one?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Gift I gave:<\/strong> I&#8217;m gonna venture to say it was this old antique tea cart I picked up for my mom 5 months ago when she had spotted it at my consignment shop but didn&#8217;t want to spend the money&#8230; She had talked about it for DAYS afterward, always wondering if she should have just sucked it up and bought it (she lives out of town), and when I went back to the shop for something unrelated I saw that not only was it still t here, but it was on sale at 30% off! So I quickly snatched it up and had been holding onto it since ;) The best part was that after a few weeks of initially seeing it, my mom had called and asked me if I thought it was still there and I told her that it wasn&#8217;t, so someone must have bought it, hehe&#8230;. Which is the truth! I did! You should have seen the look on her face when she opened it up :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Re-Gift?<\/strong> We actually didn&#8217;t re-gift any of our old gifts this year, probably for the first time in a while, haha, but we DID receive a re-gift!! And do you want to know how we *knew* it had been re-gifted? Because we had given the exact same gift to THEM last year!! They re-gifted to the original gifter &#8211; the ultimate sin! Haha&#8230; It was pretty hilarious&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Favorite Part:<\/strong> My favorite part hands down was celebrating the holidays with our baby for the first time, and realizing that WE are now <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/merry-christmas-10-original-santa-jokes-for-you-%f0%9f%98%b1-%f0%9f%8e%85%f0%9f%8e%84%f0%9f%a4%b6\/\">Santa<\/a> from now on! It&#8217;s so strange and so wonderful at the same time :) And watching my family (especially my mom!) play with him and take care of him throughout the week was equally as exciting to watch. We have a new family member to celebrate with going forward! :)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Lots of joy and excitement this year for sure. And I can only hope that 2013 will bring more of the same. <em><strong>Now your turn to play the game!<\/strong> <\/em>How did your gifting turn out in the end?
