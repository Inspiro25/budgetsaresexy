I told him my answer would be pretty boring, so better that I share with everyone here too for a well-rounded perspective. I already have my goals set up, so personally it would all go into <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\">VTSAX<\/a> &#8211; a Vanguard index fund &#8211; and that would be that :) Save for maybe a grand or two to &#8220;enjoy life&#8221; and make my dad happy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But I&#8217;m not him, and he&#8217;s not me.<\/strong> Nor are you, and him, or him and you\/he\/she\/them\/theirs &#8211; what the hell were we talking about again?<\/p>\n<p>Oh yes, the email.<\/p>\n<p>Here it is below, along with my own <a href=\"http:\/\/cointhrill.com\/my-2-cents-coin\/\" target=\"_blank\">two cents<\/a> (a real coin at one point, btw, they&#8217;re pretty cool!)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s up JMoney,<\/p>\n<p>About a month and a half ago, my dad passed away, which has been a terrible thing, but I&#8217;m now left with a silver lining. He left me (and my brothers) about 200k each through non-retirement brokerage accounts, inherited IRAs, 401k, and life insurance settlement. My question is, what would you do with this type of windfall? Granted, it&#8217;s not the most, but it&#8217;s certainly the most I&#8217;ve ever come in contact with.<\/p>\n<p>My first instinct is to simply use the financial advisor services at Vanguard (where I have a brokerage account and where most of these assets are located), and basically ask them to grow it as much as possible. But I have some other options, should I consolidate into one account? Should I buy a house\/property with a portion of the assets (I currently don&#8217;t own anything, essentially throwing money away renting, so this seems like an easy win)? Should I buy more than one property and potentially rent one as side income? Maybe I should bring in an accountant to help with tax implications of all this before making additional moves? I guess I could pay off my student loans, but it seems like the money I could generate off interest with the accounts greatly outweighs the benefit of paying off that student loan debt&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Some background on me: I don&#8217;t have to make any decision immediately and I&#8217;m fortunate enough to live a fairly comfortable ($70\/year salary) life as Content Marketing Manager in Denver, CO. I&#8217;m 31 with no kids. I have a car loan of about 7k, and student loans approaching 90k (yikes, I know), but that&#8217;s it. No credit card debt. I currently contribute 6% of my paycheck to 401k and get matched up to 4% from my company.<\/p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>My Thoughts&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever blogged about this actually, but the first thing I ALWAYS do when coming across large sums of money is to just stare at it and soak it all in. As American author Mignon McLaughlin once said, <em><strong>&#8220;Money is much more exciting than anything it buys.&#8221;<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that often you come across so much in your life (especially $200 grand!) so I like to relish in it as long as possible before doing something <del>stupid<\/del> awesome. Plus you need to have a good game plan in the works and plenty of time to figure out how exactly to put it to good use. Which leads us to the next step in the process:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason those lottery winners end up losing it all and becoming worse off than they were before: they didn&#8217;t know what they wanted. They *thought* they knew what they wanted (big homes\/ cars\/sexy lifestyles and sometimes sexy new women\/men to match), but as we have all come to realize, the &#8220;things&#8221; aren&#8217;t what drives us in life &#8211; our passions do. Except for maybe the cars (bah-dum-ching).<\/p>\n<p><strong>What we REALLY want in our lives are things like safety and love and stability, freedom, travel, families, starting a business, pursuing passions\/hobbies\/philanthropy, and on and on.<\/strong> All much easier to attain with gobs of money, and thus why we work so hard <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/retiring-early-means-being-financially-free\/\" target=\"_blank\">towards financial freedom<\/a>. To be able to do all those things we never seem to have the time &#8211; or money &#8211; to work on!<\/p>\n<p>Remember: money is only a tool to get us these things, it&#8217;s not the end goal.<\/p>\n<p>So dreams come first, and then everything else comes after. Like messing around a little splurging, or taking some (hopefully) calculated risks to grow your money even more. Which is also what lottery winners continue to do after winning\/losing it all &#8211; it seems to be the only way they know how to find more! (And some incredibly succeed at it!!)<\/p>\n<p>Back to our dear reader here, though. Let&#8217;s break down each of the lines\/questions and see if we can help him out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;What would you do with this type of windfall?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My goal, as already alluded to above, is <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/02\/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet\/\" target=\"_blank\">to reach financial freedom<\/a>, so all my extra money goes right to index funds until I have enough to be able to retire on (25x yearly expenses, per &#8220;the rules&#8221; of early retirement). There are plenty of other ways to reach financial freedom too, but my personality and tastes mix best with passively investing in the stock market. For others it may be real estate or investing\/starting businesses, or even <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/01\/motif-investing-review-dividend-portfolio\/\" target=\"_blank\">sniffing out the best dividend funds<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Granted, it&#8217;s not the most, but it&#8217;s certainly the most I&#8217;ve ever come in contact with.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hell yeah that&#8217;s &#8220;the most!&#8221; $200,000 is a $hit ton of money!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;My first instinct is to simply use the financial advisor services at Vanguard (where I have a brokerage account and where most of these assets are located), and basically ask them to grow it as much as possible&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a most excellent idea, indeed. You already have the system set up and have done your homework w\/ Vanguard (something that took me <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/say-hello-to-vanguards-newest-member\/\" target=\"_blank\">34 years to figure out<\/a>, btw), so it would be like adding fuel to the fire and growing for however many years you have until it&#8217;s time to start pulling it out. And being 31 means there&#8217;s quite a lot of time for it to do so! (Unless you&#8217;re aiming for ER too &#8211; but having the $$ grow there would still do the trick)<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;But I have some other options, should I consolidate into one account?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I personally LOVE the more <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/09\/all-my-bank-accounts\/\" target=\"_blank\">minimalism approach to life and finances<\/a>, so I&#8217;d certainly entertain that option for sure. Provided it doesn&#8217;t screw up any tax stuff with all those accounts of yours and your dad&#8217;s. I&#8217;d make that my first question to Vanguard when\/if you call them (as well as the person handling your dad&#8217;s affairs, whom I presume to be an estate person? It would be good to get the tax info from as many legitimate people as possible to make sure nothing funky triggers. I personally suck with tax stuff).<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Should I buy a house\/property with a portion of the assets (I currently don&#8217;t own anything, essentially throwing money away renting, so this seems like an easy win)?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>NO!!!!! At least not until figuring out if the home ownership\/investment\/real estate game is something you really want to focus on. There&#8217;s nothing wrong AT ALL with renting (or owning, for that matter) if it fits with your personality and goals, and it&#8217;s certainly not &#8220;throwing away money&#8221; if you&#8217;re perfectly content living there. People like to forget about all the ways a home can tie you down &#8211; both <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/stuff-new-home-owners-never-think-about\/\" target=\"_blank\">financially<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/10\/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house\/\" target=\"_blank\">mentally<\/a> &#8211; so be sure you <em>really<\/em> want to go down that path before being a dummy like me and scooping one up just because it was &#8220;The American Dream.&#8221; It could be for many, but it&#8217;s the opposite for some.<\/p>\n<p><strong> &#8220;Should I buy more than one property and potentially rent one as side income?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>See above.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Maybe I should bring in an accountant to help with tax implications of all this before making additional moves?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Smartest thing you&#8217;ve said yet :) At least if this is the route you&#8217;re considering going down (and why not explore all options before pulling the trigger?)<\/p>\n<p><strong> &#8220;I guess I could pay off my student loans, but it seems like the money I could generate off interest with the accounts greatly outweighs the benefit of paying off that student loan debt&#8230;&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, we&#8217;re sensing a pattern here. TONS of great ideas for the money, but no mention of goals and dreams. Is paying off all your debts a good thing? Hell yeah it is! Is growing your money larger and larger, either through the stock market or interest or real estate a good thing? Of course! They&#8217;re all fine options.<\/p>\n<p>The way you determine which to do, however, is again &#8211; broken record here &#8211; figuring out the ones that align best with your long-term strategy. I would also throw in that some routes &#8211; whether financially smarter or not &#8211; just make you HAPPIER to do, and thus are equally as fine options to take as well. Paying off debt or mortgages falling high on the list &#8211; regardless of the returns. (I call this the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/03\/answer-financial-debates\/\" target=\"_blank\">do what excites you more<\/a>&#8221; decision maker. Though usually best for smaller decisions than $200k ones ;))<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some background on me: I don&#8217;t have to make any decision immediately and I&#8217;m fortunate enough to live a fairly comfortable ($70\/year salary) life as Content Marketing Manager in Denver, CO. I&#8217;m 31 with no kids. I have a car loan of about 7k, and student loans approaching 90k (yikes, I know), but that&#8217;s it. No credit card debt. I currently contribute 6% of my paycheck to 401k and get matched up to 4% from my company.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All this tells me our friend here has his head screwed on right, and was perfectly content before any mention of money whatsoever. Yeah he has some nasty debt and should be saving\/investing a lot more than 6% of his income if he wants a shot at retiring at a decent age later, but by and large life is good and now he has a chance to make it even better.<\/p>\n<p>So what do you do? Do you go the invest-it-all route? The pick up real estate option? the pay-off-all-debt and be totally free from handcuffs way? Either adds to your financial stability and amps up your net worth (and of course you can always do a mixture of all three), so it all comes back to those sexy goals again.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s my take on it anyways.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What would you do with $200k?
