We were living in Los Angeles at the time and couldn\u2019t afford to buy anything locally, which prompted us to start looking at out-of-state investments. We ended up making a real estate investment in Texas!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a lot to share about our decision to buy a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-im-transitioning-away-from-rental-properties\/\">rental property<\/a> &#8212; I\u2019ll start with numbers and then get into our backstory about how and why we got our place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick note: I don&#8217;t want to come off as some nonchalant real estate investor talking about \u201cout of-state investing,\u201d as if it\u2019s some effortless hobby that people pick up easily. I can&#8217;t understate this &#8230; <\/span><b>real estate investing is hard bloody work<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And it\u2019s scary! And it <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-failed-buying-rental-property\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doesn&#8217;t always work out<\/a>! Back when we bought this rental property, I was absolutely shitting my pants about the decision. It took a ton of research and courage to pull the trigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The numbers: Purchase price, down payment, mortgage, etc &#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After evaluating about 50 properties and putting bids on about five, we settled on a brick-finish duplex built in 2003.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Purchase price:<\/strong> $188,900<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Original loan:<\/strong> $136,500 (This is a 30-year fixed mortgage with 4.125% interest)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Down payment:<\/strong> $52,400<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Total cash outlay<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>:<\/strong> $55,213 This is the total cash that we paid out of pocket including down payment, closing costs, appraisals, option fees, seller concessions, pro-rata taxes, and a million other tiny little charges the bank adds when you close on a loan. We also set aside a $5k \u201creserve fund\u201d dedicated to this investment property, so the total project cost is about $60k all in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over our five years of ownership, our investment has <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grown<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by an additional $60k! Here\u2019s a breakdown of how <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-vs-stocks-a-real-life-look-at-returns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this rental property has made us money<\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cash flow:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $16,468 &#8211; After all our rental income minus all our expenses, this is the total amount of positive cash flow we&#8217;ve accumulated since we bought the place. An average of about $265\/month!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Loan paydown:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $12,792 &#8211; This is the difference between what we owed the bank at the beginning of our mortgage, and the current loan balance today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Appreciation:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $31,110 &#8211; Simply looking at property value, this is what it\u2019s worth now vs. what we paid at time of purchase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Total gains:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $60,360<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple notes about these numbers:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the interest portion of our mortgage payment is tax deductible, this property has saved us a little bit in income taxes over the years. I\u2019m purposely excluding these savings to simplify the overview.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another advantage of owning rental real estate is depreciation. We claim a small loss each year as the property gets older and older. But I\u2019m not including this in our figures, either. Depreciation needs to be repaid as gains when the property is eventually sold.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We started with a $5k emergency fund and float account. This has increased over the years due to the positive cash flow, and along the way we\u2019ve taken some money out to help buy other investments. Gains\/losses on this cash aren&#8217;t included in our ROI.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, I can safely say that we\u2019ve doubled our money in 5 years. ($60k in gains on top of the $60k in start-up costs that we\u2019ll eventually get back when we sell.) Pretty cool to think about! But real estate investing isn&#8217;t all roses &#8212; here\u2019s some backstory to complete the picture:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Saving up for a $55k down payment + $5k reserve fund<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me about seven years to save up the down payment money for this property. I did it the old-fashioned way &#8212; spending less than I earned. Keeping most of my savings in a checking account, I just watched my cash pile grow and grow over the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, this was a poor move. I should have been putting my savings directly into the stock market, or at least in a high-yield savings account. This way it would have risen much quicker! A HUGE opportunity missed on my part as the stock market kicked ass from 2008 to 2015. Big lesson learned for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve always been a good saver, but here are the main ways I was able to squirrel away money:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House-hacking: Before moving in with my wife, I rented out part of my 525-square-foot apartment to roommates, dropping my rent by $700 per month.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving in with wife: As soon as we moved in together, a lot of our living expenses were halved. More home cooking and packed lunches also allowed us to save money.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheap car and travel costs: When we lived in Hawaii, we were within walking distance from my work, and later in Los Angeles the companies I worked for all paid me a mileage fee for any driving. Low car costs helped me save up for real estate investments.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason I mention this is that it\u2019s kind of narrow-minded to look at this property and say that our investment has doubled in just 5 years. The true project cost started 12 years ago, when I began saving cash for the down payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why buy a rental property in another area?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We moved to Los Angeles in 2012 (to live closer to family) and quickly realized the housing market was very expensive and not ideal for positive cash flow investments. This got me thinking about buying property out of state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to Google the \u201cbest states and cities to buy rental properties\u201d and Texas kept coming up as one of the top choices for rental property investing. Here\u2019s why I felt good about Texas:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The barrier to entry was low in most small Texas towns. Good-quality houses can be bought for less than $200k. The rental market was also quite strong, with many properties meeting the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-1-percent-rule-explained\/\">1% rule<\/a>. (Basically, that&#8217;s making sure the monthly income on your rental covers the monthly mortgage payment.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time I was searching (2014 and 2015), Texas had four of the top 10 fastest-growing cities in the US: Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. Population, job growth, and economic development were exploding, so it was an attractive real estate market.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rent contracts tend to favor landlords.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no state income tax in Texas. This sounded like a much bigger selling point at the time than it actually is. Because I don\u2019t make much income from the property, the tax burden would be pretty low anyway.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I\u2019m being completely honest, I mostly felt good about Texas because that\u2019s where everyone else seemed to be buying. Pretty bad advice for an investor &#8212; to just follow the crowds &#8212; but this dumb luck worked out for me at the time.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas has a bunch of downsides and learning curves, too &#8230; massive property taxes (<\/span><b>more than $5k per year<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for this small property!), a slower appreciation rate, and a much different local culture that took me some getting used to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Property management and stuff going wrong<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right from the get-go I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a hands-on landlord dealing with renters, leases, managing repairs, etc.\u00a0 We hire a property management company to take care of all of this for us. I know many real estate investors who buy rental property close to home and manage everything personally &#8212; it takes a special set of skills that I just don\u2019t have!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although my property manager looks after the day-to day operations, this doesn\u2019t mean that it&#8217;s all passive income and that I can take my eye off the ball. I stay involved with what\u2019s going on and am constantly in touch with the manager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for nightmare tenant stories, this particular rental has remained pretty easy since I\u2019ve owned it, and I&#8217;ve had good tenants there. I do have other properties with horror stories I can share later &#8230; domestic disputes, trashed units, evictions &#8230; and there was that one time when I found out a renter was running questionable<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/5amjoel.com\/prostitute-rental-property\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cmassage services\u201d in my place<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. :(<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Future options for this rental property investment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Past performance is great. But it doesn\u2019t mean future returns will be just as good. It\u2019s important to constantly evaluate the return on current equity and see if better returns can be achieved by making changes. As illiquid as real estate may seem, it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/can-you-retire-with-a-mortgage-how-about-15-mortgages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actually quite flexible<\/a> with exit strategies and refinance options as equity builds over time. Selling, refinancing, 1031-exchanging, or even using the property as a primary residence are all possibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Selling a rental property<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of today, if I wanted to sell this property I would face several hurdles:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, the transaction costs and commissions would probably cost me $15k to $20k.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d have to pay tax on the $30k capital gain that the property has increased in value, as well as regular income tax on the depreciation we\u2019ve claimed in the past five years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My biggest problem: We\u2019d have to figure out where to invest the proceeds (do I buy another property? Invest in the stock market? Pay down other mortgages and debt we have?)\u00a0 Because none of these can guarantee a better return, we\u2019re choosing to hold onto the property for now.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Refinance options? Pull cash out or reduce my interest rate?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of how much equity has built up, I could <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/should-i-refinance-my-rental-property\/\">refinance the property<\/a> and possibly borrow $30k from the bank. Also, with interest rates so low, I could reduce my mortgage payments and start a new 30-year term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I&#8217;d have some hurdles to jump there, too. Because my income is quite low this year, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d qualify for a refinance. Also, we&#8217;d still have the issue of where to put the $30k that we could pull out. It\u2019s not quite enough money to buy a new property, and re-investing in renovations doesn\u2019t make sense at this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refinancing is something I\u2019ll research soon. You never know what you qualify for until you ask!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>TLDR; all things considered<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total cash outlay for this project was $60k.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s grown by an additional $60k over the last five years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saving for the down payment took about seven years, in which I missed out on excellent returns I&#8217;d have earned if the money had been invested instead.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate is flexible in terms of finance and exit strategies, but it&#8217;s illiquid in terms of selling it quickly.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like stocks, you can\u2019t predict future returns on property investments based on past performance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future plan is to hold this rental and make no changes in the short term.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More to come on this as we track and discuss over time!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Anybody own a rental property in a city or state where they don&#8217;t live &#8212; maybe like a vacation home?
