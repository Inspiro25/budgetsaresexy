Not that we&#8217;re *that* lazy that it&#8217;s necessary, haha, but still. Shows you how future-thinking they are at least :)<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s how Acorns works in a nut shell (no pun intended):<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>You download <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/acorns\">the app<\/a> (<strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Update:<\/span><\/strong> You can now sign up through their site directly as well)<\/li>\n<li>You create an account<\/li>\n<li>You link up a funding account (like your checking)<\/li>\n<li>You answer some questions about yourself (which helps them recommend a pre-made portfolio)<\/li>\n<li>You sit back and do nothing :)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>So, pretty similar to my beloved Digit, only it *invests* your money instead of *saving* it.<\/strong> Which of course has pros and cons on either side (it has a chance to grow which history shows it will, but you can&#8217;t easily just &#8220;take it out&#8221; like with savings as it&#8217;ll trigger tax stuff and what not).<\/p>\n<p>I gotta tell you though, it&#8217;s quite awesome to watch my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Digit savings<\/a> go out and then have <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/acorns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Acorns<\/a>\u00a0investing come in and round up the difference to invest! Haha&#8230; A match made in nerd heaven.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43347\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-digit-round-up.jpg\" alt=\"acorns digit round up\" width=\"300\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-digit-round-up.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-digit-round-up-125x125.jpg 125w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-digit-round-up-297x300.jpg 297w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-digit-round-up-144x144.jpg 144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>You can also tweak the settings to round up to other numbers as well and not just a dollar.<\/strong> And if you&#8217;re feeling aggressive, you can always dump in more money in one-time chunks or just attach more financial accounts to your Acorns one too. I have both our &#8220;house&#8221; checking and our &#8220;house&#8221; credit card attached so it&#8217;ll round up from two areas and not just one like with checking only.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and in case you&#8217;re wondering, they don&#8217;t actually invest $0.38 here and $0.05 there &#8211; what they do is wait until you&#8217;ve hit <em><strong>$5.00<\/strong><\/em> in rounded up amounts and THEN they invest your money. Which makes sense &#8211; this cuts down the amount of transactions being sent all over the place! And all this money comes directly out of your main &#8220;funding&#8221; account you&#8217;ve attached to your account (for me, it&#8217;s our &#8220;house&#8221; checking), and not the others if you&#8217;ve attached a handful of them &#8211; if that makes sense?<\/p>\n<p>(For example, if they&#8217;re rounding up your credit card transactions they&#8217;re not gonna pull the $$ to invest off there &#8211; they&#8217;ll pull it from your linked <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/hm-bradley-a-3-interest-checking-account-based-on-your-savings-rate\/\">checking account<\/a> so you never have to worry about anything funky happening. You just have to make sure you have the $5.00 in your checking account &#8216;cuz unlike Digit, they won&#8217;t reimburse you if you overdraft!)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, no Acorns review would be complete without covering the possible downsides of using the app.<\/p>\n<h2>The cons to using Acorns:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t do a lot of transactions, or set up automatic roundups, you&#8217;re not going to invest much. That&#8217;s probably good over all (less transactions = less money going out! ;)) but in this scenario you&#8217;ll invest less too. Unless you increase the threshold or attach additional accounts to track transactions from.<\/li>\n<li>Their customer service isn&#8217;t the best. I had to tweet them to get a response faster (I lost patience after 3 days of sending them a question via email), but once we were interacting they were super fast and helpful &#8211; for what that&#8217;s worth&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>As of <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>5\/28\/22<\/strong><\/span>, they offer two pricing options: A <strong>&#8220;Personal&#8221; plan @ $3\/mo<\/strong> which gives you all-in-one investment, retirement, and checking perks, plus a metal debit card, bonus investments and money advice, and then a <strong>&#8220;Family&#8221; plan @ $5\/mo<\/strong> which gets you investment accounts for kids, plus personal investment, retirement, and checking accounts, and exclusive offers and content.<\/li>\n<li>You <del>need<\/del> an Android or iPhone to use Acorns. (<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong><\/span> You can now sign up through their site directly or through their app on your smart phone)<\/li>\n<li>You also need to be in the U.S. (they&#8217;re not international yet)<\/li>\n<li>And of course, you can lose your money. Your account is insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) for up to $500,000, but there&#8217;s no promise your investments will go up. However, this is with *any investing* you do,\u00a0 not Acorns specifically. If you don&#8217;t believe in the stock market or ETFs\/indexes, then I&#8217;d advise against this.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong><\/span> Acorns doesn&#8217;t work with *all* financial institutions, particularly the smaller ones, but most of the larger banks will connect just fine. If yours doesn&#8217;t connect with them it might be worth trying again at another point as I&#8217;m sure they continually add new banks to partner with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Luke from ConsumerismCommentary.com also did <a href=\"http:\/\/www.consumerismcommentary.com\/is-acorns-the-next-best-app-for-investing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a good review<\/a> of Acorns that I liked, though his recommendation in the end was <em>not<\/em> to use them (he didn&#8217;t like the fees, though they&#8217;ve since changed). I obviously don&#8217;t agree since I&#8217;m having a blast investing through them, but it&#8217;s a good read nonetheless :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think the main thing to keep in mind is whether you use Acorns on the side, like I am, or if you want them to be your main source of investing<\/strong> &#8211; which could change things. In theory you can just invest all your money directly with Vanguard or the other funds for no monthly\/yearly commission (outside of the funds themselves), but the question is &#8211; will you do it? Most people won&#8217;t&#8230; It&#8217;s the same beef people have with Digit since they don&#8217;t pay interest on the savings.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/acorns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43349\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-screenshots.jpg\" alt=\"acorns screenshots\" width=\"590\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-screenshots.jpg 590w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/acorns-screenshots-300x264.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[More screenshots form my personal account&#8230; You&#8217;ll notice my portfolio is &#8220;aggressive&#8221; (they recommended one notch lower for me, but I like more risk) and that I&#8217;ve invested more than what my account is currently worth ($128.50 vs $123.12).

But again keep in mind the tax rules\/etc since these are investments and not just savings.<\/li>\n<li>Can you change your investment allocations? Yup! They offer half a dozen choices to go with&#8230; but they&#8217;re indexes and not individual stocks like Apple or GE, etc. So if you like that sorta thing Acorns won&#8217;t be for you.<\/li>\n<li>Does Acorns rebalance your portfolio for you?

I&#8217;m all about new ways to be rewarded for being lazy, and even more so when we&#8217;re talking about money. How&#8217;d you come up with such a bad ass idea?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While I was in college, I was surprised at how many of my peers had an interest in investing but couldn\u2019t overcome the barriers in their way like high minimum balance requirements and fees. From that point on, my father and I sought to simplify investing and create a more realistic approach for young people to get started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As a recent Boglehead convert, I was THRILLED that 4 out of your 6 investment options are with Vanguard indexes. What made you guys go that route?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The portfolios were developed with guidance from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/nobel_prizes\/economic-sciences\/laureates\/1990\/markowitz-bio.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Harry Markowitz<\/a> &#8211; the Nobel Laureate commonly referred to as the &#8220;Father of Modern Portfolio Theory&#8221; and a team of economists, mathematicians, and engineers. Each of the six indexes was chosen to optimize the diversification of our portfolios across asset classes for where they fall along the efficient frontier where returns are optimized for a given level of risk. Four of the six are Vanguard indexes as they best represent the asset classes to accomplish optimal allocation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In about a month and a half I&#8217;ve banked\u00a0$123.12 in automatic investments because of y&#8217;all. It&#8217;s not a ton, but it&#8217;s a lot more than $0.00. How much have YOU been able to invest using your own app so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>$958.97<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43342\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/jeff-cruttenden-investments.jpg\" alt=\"jeff cruttenden acorns investments\" width=\"340\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/jeff-cruttenden-investments.jpg 340w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/jeff-cruttenden-investments-195x300.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" \/><strong>I have a dumb tax question &#8211; at the end of the year, how will all these purchases look in terms of transactions? Will I have to report\/document 1,000+ purchase dates and ticket amounts for all these micro-investments going on? Or will it all be nice and simple somehow just like everything else with Acorns?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Acorns provides each investor a Form-1099 at the beginning of each new year for the past year of investing with Acorns. This can be found at statements.acorns.com. While you need to pay taxes on all realized capital gains, you can also deduct any realized capital losses. Acorns does not provide tax advice but recommend consulting with a tax preparer or CPA.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve been obsessed with another product that recently hit the streets as well &#8211; Digit. And every time I mention them to other finance lovers I often get back, &#8220;kinda like Acorns?&#8221; Would you say they&#8217;re your closest competition? What do you all do, in your opinion, that&#8217;s so much better than them? (In full disclosure, I&#8217;m an adviser to Digit. But don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t hold it against you ;))<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Acorns is the first true micro investing company, allowing people to round up purchases and automatically invest the change. The Acorns app and financial engine were built to help people micro invest commission-free into a diversified portfolio of index funds. Thus, the main difference between Acorns and Digit is that Acorns invests the money you add into your account whether it be from your spare change, recurring investment, or lump sum. Digit is a great way to help you put away money into savings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Any cool features coming down the pipeline?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We will be launching our web app in the next few weeks.
