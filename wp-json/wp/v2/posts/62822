She is a single mom (2 year old daughter) and hasn\u2019t been able to work much since this whole quarantine started. To top it all off she contracted Covid and has been sick. I helped her pay rent last month and some of her other bills but I\u2019m not sure what she is going to do for May. Her rent is $600 and her other bills run like $400 plus food and what not.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>#2. Desperate families in Guatemala (<\/b><strong>$200<\/strong><b>)<\/b> &#8212; &#8220;Things are pretty dire in Guatemala. Most people live day to day so the five week ongoing lock down has been brutal. Families are putting white flags on their windows when they are unable to buy food which takes a lot for them because all your neighbors will see, but comes a point where you have to swallow your pride. It\u2019s not like you can go to a food bank a few miles away like in the U.S. $25 helps a family get a care package with basic supplies like oil, beans, corn flour, soap etc.&#8221; &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/reachfinancialindependence.com\/coronado-island-quarantine-day-40-white-flags\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pauline Paquin<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/reachfinancialindependence.com\/coronado-island-quarantine-day-40-white-flags\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62829\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/white-flags-guatemala.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/white-flags-guatemala.jpg 886w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/white-flags-guatemala-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/white-flags-guatemala-768x495.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>#3.

Family who lost home in a freak flood ($50)<\/b> &#8212; &#8220;As soon as I saw your tweet, I thought of the Willard family! They are a family of five here in WA state and have a rougher go of it but always manage to keep an upbeat &#8220;when life gives you lemons&#8221; attitude. Brian is a disabled vet and their youngest child has special needs (a genetic issue that has only 3 diagnosed cases in the world!). They were able to buy their wheelchair accessible dream home last year but, in February, a local dam was released, flooding their home and a dozen others in the (non-flood) area. The house literally has to be gutted and insurance will not cover it, so they are currently attempting to transition into a trailer on the property while they figure out how to rebuild and still pay a mortgage. As you can imagine, Covid-19 has made this even more challenging. Here are some links to the local news coverage and their story!&#8221;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/q13fox.com\/2020\/02\/08\/families-return-home-after-nisqually-river-flooding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Families return home after Nisqually River flooding<\/a><\/li>\n<li>GoFundMe page: Disabled Army Vet and Family Need Help After Flood<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">******<\/p>\n<p>Again, if any of these stories move you please consider matching or donating what you can!
