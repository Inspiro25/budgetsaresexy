But what about all our *freedom* we have right now?? And not having to worry about all that plumbing and flooding and everything else that happens when you own a home? And don&#8217;t you just <em>love<\/em> being completely 100% DEBT-FREE like we are?? How beautiful is that?&#8221;<\/strong> I try retorting back&#8230; While throwing in a &#8220;and what are the odds we&#8217;re going to have another baby again anyways?&#8221; for good measure :)<\/p>\n<p>*Knocks on wood*<\/p>\n<p>But no matter what I throw back to her recently, she just smiles and nods as if humoring me, and then ultimately responds with something along the lines of, &#8220;All of those things are nice too, but I&#8217;m ready to have a home again. I think it&#8217;s finally time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And seeing how this will now make our <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BudgetsAreSexy\/status\/1090631493284696064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6th different home in 7 years<\/a>, perhaps there&#8217;s some merit to this. Especially as she&#8217;s used to growing up in one consistent house her whole life, unlike me who comes from a military household.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So now, after 6 years of blissfully renting and being its #1 fanboy, I have to reconsider my <del>marriage<\/del> views on things and come to terms with the idea of possibly &#8211; just possibly &#8211; being a homeowner again. As much as it kills me to say that&#8230;<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But after a multitude of walks trying to wrap my head around it so far and heavy contemplating, I&#8217;ve come to a few realizations that&#8217;s helped me keep some sort of inner peace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. It&#8217;s no longer just about *me* and what *I* want anymore.<\/strong> Yes owning is not my preference, but if it&#8217;s in my family&#8217;s best interest and truly makes my wife happy, can I really stand in its way? (And <em>would<\/em> I really stand in its way?!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. I&#8217;m a much different person than I was 10+ years ago when we first bought a house.<\/strong> I now know very much what I like, and what I don&#8217;t, and even more importantly than that &#8211; my overall view on life has expanded too. I&#8217;d have to think I&#8217;d be much wiser about making decisions when it comes to owning again than I was a decade ago, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. Our finances are a lot different nowadays than it was back then too!<\/strong> We couldn&#8217;t even afford a down payment the last round, and now we could probably put down 50% if we had to. On top of that, our careers are much more stable and generates more income than they were back then too.<\/p>\n<p>(Fun Fact: when we bought in 2007 we put 0% down and bought a house at the max of what we were approved for!! We didn&#8217;t even have a budget!!)<\/p>\n<p>(Fun Fact #2: not having a budget was what actually got me stumbling onto the blogging world when I googled, &#8220;how to budget&#8221;, haha&#8230; And now here we are 11 years later!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. There really are a lot of pros to owning a home if done right.<\/strong> Maybe instead of focusing on all the negatives as I do, I&#8217;ll find just as many &#8211; if not more &#8211; positives to owning a home? There&#8217;s no way it&#8217;s <em>that<\/em> bad if people have been doing it for centuries after centuries, right?!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. It sure would be nice not having to make rent\/mortgage payments ever again! <\/strong>Since of course we&#8217;d have to try and pay it down as fast as possible similar to our first go at it ;) Any one here remember the days of the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/mortgage-payoff-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$2,000 a month Mortgage Killer Plan<\/a>??<\/p>\n<p>(And note that I said &#8220;rent\/mortgage payments&#8221; vs &#8220;no payments at all&#8221;, since you&#8217;ll ALWAYS have <em>some<\/em> costs to cover whether it&#8217;s maintenance, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-appealed-my-ridiculous-property-taxes\/\">property tax<\/a>, HOAs, etc. Something people like to forget when doing rent vs buy comparisons.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#6. I haven&#8217;t had a good mission in quite some time now&#8230;<\/strong> And I&#8217;ll admit I do much better shooting for something than when I don&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#7. It would probably be smart to diversify a little more. <\/strong>VS having a majority of our assets all tied to the markets like we do now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#8. And lastly, when I put things in more perspective &#8211; owning a home isn&#8217;t the complete end of the world&#8230; <\/strong>I know I like to get dramatic up in here and say my piece, but if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned in my 39 years it&#8217;s that you can ALWAYS find a way to be content no matter what&#8217;s going on in life. So long as you&#8217;re *open* to it and give it some valiant effort.<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve promised my wife here at the end of all this &#8211; to remain open and *positive* throughout the next few months of hunting &#8211; and if it turns out we don&#8217;t find the right house at the right price at the right time, well, at least it won&#8217;t be ME who stood in our way, and we can go back to renting for a while longer until we <em>do<\/em> find that place.<\/p>\n<p>Something my wife has also agreed to on, and she even pinky swore on it so you know it&#8217;s legit ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ll see how it goes, but for now wish us luck and that I don&#8217;t have a Freak Out Fest any time soon!! It&#8217;s only the most expensive decision you can ever make in your lifetime!! Haha&#8230;<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted as we go along, and in the meantime I&#8217;ll gladly welcome any advice you may have :)<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, I just emailed ownership advice to someone here recently, and after reviewing it again I can&#8217;t say it made me feel any better:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you really REALLY want to buy a home!
