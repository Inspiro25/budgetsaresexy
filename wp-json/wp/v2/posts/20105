I don\u2019t know why, but I said \u201clet\u2019s go in and get a treat.\u201d I let each boy look at all the chocolates and choose \u201cjust one.\u201d After much deliberation, they each chose and off we went. Good thing I said just one because they\u2019re pricey!<\/p>\n<p><strong>As we were exiting the mall later, we passed one of those giant gumball machines.<\/strong> Predictably, the begging went into overdrive,\u201cPULLLLLEEEEZE Mom, can we have a quarter?\u201d I was already into the retail machine big bucks for the chocolate, so what was another couple of quarters?<\/p>\n<p>On the way home, I asked my boys, \u201cIf you could have one Godiva chocolate or a pile of gumballs, which would you choose?\u201d My oldest immediately said \u201cthe chocolate\u201d and the youngest chimed in \u201cgumballs!\u201d I\u2019m sure I used that as a springboard to a wonderful teaching moment about choices and values, but I don\u2019t remember. (Who am I kidding? I probably just muttered something about both of them causing cavities. Young parents aren\u2019t always known for their wisdom; we\u2019re just trying not to screw up so badly we turn our offspring into serial killers.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>I remembered that incident this summer, when my now 6-foot young men went shopping for clothes.<\/strong> My youngest hit several sales and scored multiple pairs of pants and a pile of shirts for about a hundred dollars. Of course I was impressed\u2014this kid\u2019s a millionaire in the making and can squeeze the last bit of life out of a dollar and a sale. My oldest settled on a single pair of raw denim jeans for over $150. He wouldn\u2019t tell me the actual price. We\u2019re definitely not $150 jeans folk, and he probably thought I\u2019d be harsh and judgmental about the extravagance of that purchase. Of course I wasn\u2019t! I expressed fascination with the whole concept of raw denim and gave him sincere affirmation for the maturity of this major purchase.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow fascinating! You say you wear them for months before you wash them? Think how much water you\u2019ll save; they\u2019re both hip and eco-friendly!\u201d (And inside I\u2019m saying, \u201cStay cool. It\u2019s his money and he can spend it any way he wants. You\u2019re not the shopping police. At least he\u2019s not a serial killer!\u201d)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seeing their choices that day reminded me that it might be time for that teaching moment. For myself. <\/strong>When you\u2019re trying to be a responsible adult with your finances, it might seem like your choices are all Godiva or gumballs. Do I spend now on the Godiva life or live on gumballs and have the good life in the future? Or maybe cash is tight all the time and your choices are a few gumballs or one gumball. How are we supposed to know what choices to make?<\/p>\n<p>Well, as a responsible adult, I should start by telling you to <strong>\u201crun the numbers.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">3 pc of Godiva chocolate<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">One pound of gumballs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cost:<\/strong><\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">$6<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">$4.14<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calories:<\/strong><\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">220<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">650<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total fat calories:<\/strong><\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">117<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"180\">0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><em>(These are real numbers by the way; I\u2019ve apparently got too much time on my hands.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But the numbers don\u2019t really tell the story.\u00a0 How about <strong>intangibles<\/strong> like probability of tooth decay, likelihood your friends will be impressed\/disappointed with your choice, and the affect of chocolate or rubber (yep, that\u2019s what gum is made of) on your well-being? And of course, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t remind you to take a look at your financial plan and determine which of these is a better fit for your <strong>long-range financial goals<\/strong>.\u00a0 Have you factored in the lifetime cost of toothpaste and appropriate dental insurance for each choice?<\/p>\n<p>So, to review:\u00a0 evaluate the numbers, weigh the intangibles, and consider this choice in the context of your financial plan.\u00a0 Which one would you choose?
