And sometimes you need a little release to keep you on track too &#8211; you can&#8217;t go &#8220;all out&#8221; 100% of the time.<\/p>\n<p>But maybe you disagree?\u00a0 Here&#8217;s the full list from <em><a href=\"http:\/\/money.ca.msn.com\/savings-debt\/gallery\/15-overpriced-things-we-hate-paying-for-1\">MSN Money<\/a><\/em> below &#8211; along with my own personal habits.\u00a0 Run through them and see how many apply to you!<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Theater Popcorn<\/strong> &#8211; While I do get tempted every now and then, this one I usually never have a problem with.\u00a0 I always <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/09\/so-what-if-people-make-fun-of-our\/\">sneak in my snacks<\/a> from the outside anyways, and all that dang popcorn just gets stuck in my teeth and drives me crazy the entire movie :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Event parking<\/strong> &#8211; Hmm&#8230; I used to refuse to pay for any of this, and just drive around in circles until I found something that was free, but lately I&#8217;ve been more up to paying for the convenience.\u00a0 My time is starting to become more important to me, than a little extra cash.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Printer ink<\/strong> &#8211; I HATE THIS ONE!!!\u00a0 And there&#8217;s hardly anything you can do about it :(\u00a0 I def. blow through money via all this ink, it sucks.\u00a0 And the ink usually costs more than the damn printers! Haha&#8230; so crazy&#8230;.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Restaurant drinks<\/strong> &#8211; Haha, yeah &#8211; I always fall for these ;)\u00a0 But it&#8217;s all cuz of the awesome atmosphere!\u00a0 And what other choice do you have really, unless you sneak in a flask?\u00a0 The $5 or $10 I pay for a drink is def. worth it after a hard day&#8217;s work when all you wanna do is relax with your friends and have some fun.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t do it every weekend, but when I do, I try to not worry about it and just enjoy the time out with friends and family.\u00a0 The same goes with sodas and other non-alcohol drinks too (why does my first thought of &#8220;drink&#8221; always equate to alcohol?? Haha&#8230;). It all goes under the &#8220;entertainment&#8221; budget.\u00a0 Or &#8220;food&#8221; one, depending on the occasion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bottled water<\/strong> &#8211; I think you know <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/im-a-bottled-water-drinker-im-not-afraid-to-admit-it\/\">the answer<\/a> to this one ;) Though I HAVE been better about it lately, and been drinking more out of our Brita filter. Especially since I&#8217;ve been working from home all year long so far (and it&#8217;s been too cold to go on walks, where I usually always need them for). But yeah, overall this takes a lot more money out of your pocket and just adds more mess to the environment out there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Gourmet&#8221; coffee<\/strong> &#8211; I rarely drink anything outside of my home coffee pot much &#8211; though only out of convenience &#8211; but when I am out and about I have no problem hitting up Starbucks or Caribou coffee when I need one. I&#8217;m not gonna wait &#8217;till I get home to brew a cup, you always want it right then and there, right? All just goes under the &#8220;miscellaneous&#8221; budget category&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Restaurant holiday specials<\/strong> &#8211; Oh I never do these.\u00a0 But I&#8217;m also not a big restaurant kinda guy much either, only every now and then.\u00a0 Although oddly enough we literally JUST did one of these now that I think about it for Mother&#8217;s Day! Haha&#8230; but not on purpose, it just happened to be a &#8220;special&#8221; but we were going there anyways ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Movie tickets<\/strong> &#8211; I looooooove me some movies!!!\u00a0 Even though I don&#8217;t get out as much as I&#8217;d like to, I&#8217;m a-okay with splurging on those $100 or so tickets these days ;)\u00a0 Yeah you can watch them at home, or stream &#8217;em through your laptop, but it doesn&#8217;t beat that awesome theater experience!\u00a0 That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re really paying for &#8211; and I&#8217;ll do it time and time again, even as the prices rise every year&#8230; and if I were flat broke, I&#8217;d just go there less instead of cutting out altogether &#8211; it&#8217;s one of the cheapest forms of entertainment in my opinion all considering, so I&#8217;m a bit fan of them. And then going on a (free) walk afterwards to soak in what I just saw &#8211; love it! :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Oil changes<\/strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not gonna lie, I ALWAYS pay someone to do this for me.\u00a0 A) out of saving time, and B) cuz I&#8217;d probably do something stupid and then cause even more problems down the line.\u00a0 I remember as a kid my dad showing me how to do it, and us always doing all our cars growing up, but even he has stopped and now pays someone to do it&#8230; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world if you can afford it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Airport food<\/strong> &#8211; Haha&#8230; this is probably the only area I splurge in which I DO want to change :)\u00a0 But only in the snacks department.\u00a0 One of my favorite things in the world to do is to have breakfast or a nice dinner in one of their fanciest restaurants, all by myself.\u00a0 There&#8217;s something so exciting and rewarding about doing that.\u00a0 Feeling like &#8220;you&#8217;ve made it&#8221; or something, especially when you&#8217;re flying somewhere cool.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ticketmaster fees<\/strong> &#8211; Oh man, I haven&#8217;t been to a concert in yearrrrrrs, so def. don&#8217;t know anything about these guys&#8230; I think you can pretty easily get tickets from Craigslist and other sites now, yeah?<\/li>\n<li><strong>ATM fees<\/strong> &#8211; Same here!\u00a0 Haven&#8217;t paid an ATM fee for 10+ years &#8211; Yeah, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa\">USAA<\/a>! (They pay them for you up to like $15 a month or something like that, awesome perk!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fund management fees<\/strong> &#8211; Hmm&#8230; I&#8217;ve only recently been paying for this since my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/07\/the-401k-ira-test\/\">IRA Test<\/a>, but so far I don&#8217;t mind them as long as the managers are doing their jobs.\u00a0 If my managed funds keep losing to my un-managed ones though (I put in $60k into each to see which one does better in the long run!), I&#8217;m totally gonna just switch routes and put &#8217;em all back into un-managed funds. Prove it in &#8220;real life,&#8221;\u00a0 ya know?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Airline baggage fees<\/strong> &#8211; I go back and forth on this one.\u00a0 On one hand I LOVE being able to check in bags and just roam the airports hands free without lugging stuff around, but on the other hand it DOES suck having to spend like $50 total just to have that freedom.\u00a0 So I guess the answer to this one, for me, is that yes &#8211; I do pay for it most times, but no &#8211; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s smart.\u00a0 And going forward it is something I&#8217;m trying to curtail more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hot dogs at sporting events<\/strong> &#8211; YUM!!! Those are the best kinds ;)\u00a0 And just like with beers and drinks\/etc, I have no problem spending more for these either as long as you don&#8217;t overdo it and buy like 5 dogs every single weekend.\u00a0 Every now and then is fine in my books, though.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Lots of stuff you can probably relate to, eh?\u00a0 It looks like I do about <em><strong>11 of these 15<\/strong><\/em>, with a couple of them needing to be changed.\u00a0 Probably not the best answer for a finance blogger, but it&#8217;s the truth ;)\u00a0 And as I said, as long as your money is going where YOU WANT IT TO GO, then I don&#8217;t see where the problem is. There&#8217;s a lot to be said for convenience and soaking in &#8220;the experience,&#8221; and as long as it won&#8217;t disrupt your ultimate goals at the end, I think it&#8217;s perfectly fine to splurge on every now and then.\u00a0 That&#8217;s what money&#8217;s for!\u00a0 You can&#8217;t *always* be Mr. or Mrs. perfect with it &#8211; you&#8217;ll burn out.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Those are my thoughts anyways, how about you?\u00a0<\/strong><\/em> How many of those do YOU spend money on out of the 15?\u00a0 And which are the most annoying of them all? Haha&#8230; for me it&#8217;s ink cartridges all the way.
