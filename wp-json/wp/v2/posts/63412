I finally did my first <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-4-knock-at-the-door\/\">net worth report<\/a>.\u00a0 After all that time hearing JMoney telling us readers to track our net worth I just never got around to it.\u00a0 Seeing your first <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-6-half-a-dozen\/\">net worth report<\/a> motivated me to do my first report.\u00a0 Thanks for the push.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you tell JMoney I finally got started tracking my net worth so he can stop all that nagging about it now.\u00a0 jk :)\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/j-money-is-alive-and-he-launched-a-new-curation-site-all-star-money\/\">J Money<\/a> may have transformed the financial lives of millions of people out there, it\u2019s nice to know that I at least motivated 1 person he didn\u2019t reach! Haha.\u00a0 Jokes aside, the reason I\u2019m sharing Max\u2019s note is because maybe it\u2019ll encourage any other net worth virgins out there to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">track for the very first time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. &#x1f3b5;&#x1f483;&#x1f3b5;.\u00a0 It truly only takes a few minutes to do and it\u2019s one of the best tools along your journey to FI!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing worth mentioning is getting an \u201caccountabilibuddy.\u201d If you are finding it hard to stay on track each month, I recommend finding a buddy or a partner you know and trust to help! You don\u2019t have to share every specific detail, it\u2019s more to make sure each other is doing their <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/fire-lessons-from-the-jamaican-bobsled-team\/\" >FIRE<\/a> homework regularly!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Net Worth Update November 1, 2020:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the account summary for me and my wife, as well as growth shown in dollars and percentages for each asset:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63439 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Net_Worth_Nov_1_2020_jpeg_QBCjFCMI-e1604548923537.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"503\" height=\"307\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, shit. &#x1f629;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our net worth went down a few grand.

The stock market does weird stuff leading up to a presidential election (and will continue to do weird stuff afterwards!) &#8211; more on that below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first ~23 days of October we had some pretty killer growth. In fact, all our assets listed above topped the $500k mark for a little while! Woohoo! But then, things started to tank pretty quickly. The worst day was October 28th where our beloved VTI fund <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/etfs\/vanguard-total-stkmkt-historical-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dropped a full 3.31%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. :(<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the saying goes, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cthe market giveth, and the market taketh away.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t bother me all too much, though. The larger an investment portfolio, the less overall control we have on performance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Asset Growth (and Shrinkage):<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Checking &amp; Savings Accounts: $39,894 <\/b><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>(+$1,026)<\/b><\/span><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A little increase here, but we have about $1k in new debt added to our credit cards that is due in November. Our goal with this cash balance is to reduce it slowly over time and siphon some pre-tax income into my new 401k plan. This balance acts as our emergency fund, and includes the random <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/churning-bank-accounts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">churning bank accounts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we currently have open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Rental Property, and Reserve Account: $236,950 <\/b><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>(+$1,019)<\/b><\/span><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This past month we collected $1975 in total rent, and had -$956 in expenses ($294 prop mgmt &amp; maintenance + $662 mortgage pmt). Keep in mind taxes\/insurance are *not* included in my mtg payment, I pay them annually in a lump sum. So although it seems like this rental might make $1000 in cash flow each month, it takes a massive drop when my ridiculous taxes are due in January. This year <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-appealed-my-ridiculous-property-taxes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the tax bill is $5,185, even after my appeal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>IRA &#8211; Rollover: $117,010 <\/b><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>(-$1,623)<\/b><\/span><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Kind of sucks when things are in the red, but that\u2019s just the way it is sometimes. Back in July I pegged <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/real-estate-vs-stocks-a-real-life-look-at-returns\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this IRA against the rental property<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to track which one will grow at a faster rate (they were both worth $109k at the time).

VTI mostly!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>HSA: $1,654 <\/b><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>(-$23)<\/b><\/span><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My plan *was* to increase this account immediately with $3,550 (the max contribution for 2020), but, I just learned that my employer will likely be changing my benefits, again! (and not in a good way &#x1f614; ). Since I\u2019m only enrolled in a HDHP for 3 months this year (Oct-Dec 2020), a max contribution would require me to stay in a HDHP for the entirety of next year also. To play it safe I may just prorate my contribution for 2020, and there\u2019s still a few months to figure this out before year end. If prorated, I think I can put in $887 safely ($3,550 \/ 12 x 3), right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>New 401(k) at work: $1,957 <\/b><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>(+$1,957)<\/b><\/span><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Woohoo, this is the first month adding to my new 401k plan! But, there are 2 sucky things to mention:\u00a0 1) My contributions to this account in October were actually $2,044, so I lost about $87 having this money invested. Not horrible though, because I saved more than that probably on income tax. And 2) I mentioned above that my company benefits will likely change, or be taken away &#8211; and this 401k plan is part of what will be killed. Oh well, anything contributed here can always be rolled over to an IRA, converted to Roth, or put into another plan down the line if one is offered to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Breakdown of Liabilities:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Rental Property Mortgage: -$122,758 <\/b><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>(+$239)<\/b><\/span><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There\u2019s nothing sweeter than watching tenants pay down your property loan each month.
