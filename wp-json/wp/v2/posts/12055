Well, now whenever I hear that phrase I think of Tim who once left this comment down below on my blog.<\/p>\n<p>Every now and then one of you says something that really sticks with me (and pops up in random times, like today!) and I always try my best to re-share it in hopes it&#8217;ll affect you in the same way. Or at least give you something to think about for a few minutes :)<\/p>\n<p>This guy, Tim, was a brave soul for telling us about it originally, and every time I re-read it <strong>I get inspired again to really appreciate what I have and not take everything for granted.<\/strong>\u00a0 At one point he was living off of 50 cents a day (to eat, drink, everything!!) and was even forced to HUNT for his food eventually.\u00a0 That&#8217;s crazy.\u00a0 I can&#8217;t even fathom that&#8230; I literally spent $130 at the grocery store today, and it&#8217;ll last us 7 days max! It just goes to show how drastically different our stages in life can be sometimes&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s Tim&#8217;s story (which he thankfully overcame!). It was in response to a guest post on the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/04\/the-poorest-time-of-my-life\/\">poorest times of our lives<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My worst time was in college. I came from a working poor family. Both my parents were teachers so they made just enough that I didn\u2019t qualify for financial aid, but didn&#8217;t make enough to actually help out any with school. I had to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-pay-for-college-without-loans\/\">pay for college out of pocket<\/a>. I would work through the summer and one semester, and go to school the next semester. I could only afford to take classes one semester a year. I was managing ok this way until my car died at the beginning of a semester and it cost every cent I had to get it fixed, including cashing out my tiny IRA. Living without motorized transportation in the South West is just not an option with the huge distances involved. I could not work and be a full time student at one of the toughest engineering schools, as I was already spending 10-12 hrs a day on course work.<\/p>\n<p>At first I swallowed my pride and tried getting food stamps which sent the ladies there into a tirade. &#8220;See here you are trying to better yourself and they won&#8217;t even help you out while any (expletive! *shouting at everyone else in line*) can sit on the couch and don&#8217;t even have to show they are trying to find a job!\u201d Wow sorry I asked. Turns out any full time student needs to be working 20 hrs a week minimum first before they qualify for food stamps. If I was working that much I wouldn&#8217;t need money&#8230;\u00a0 I tried finding a food bank, but there was none in the area.<\/p>\n<p>After being without food for a week I broke down and pawned some very old sentimental tools that had been passed down 3 generations, and after bills I had $50 to buy groceries to last for the next 3 months\u2026 I bought 50 lbs of pinto beans and 40 lbs of rice and some soy sauce. I already had a well stocked cupboard with spices, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have lasted near as long as I did. I ate rice and beans for the next 90+ days and lived off of less than 50 cents a day. When the loose change I would find would be enough to buy a packet of Ramen it was a day of pure heaven. One day I found a dollar and was able to get a pack of hot dogs to cut up and cook with my rice and beans. OMG! When you are starving, even a small piece of hot dog tastes like the best T Bone you\u2019ve ever had.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever I would get low on gas I would have to drive 180 miles round trip into the city to donate plasma for gas money, which would not get me that much after the 1\/3 a tank it cost to drive there.<\/p>\n<p>About a month and a half in I couldn\u2019t take it any more and was dying for just a taste of anything. My kingdom for a soda! I kept my Grandfathers old 30.30 Winchester in the toolbox of my truck, and scrounged up anything left of value I could find to pawn. I bought one box of ammo &#8211; 20 shots only to put some food on the table. I know exactly how you felt with the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/04\/the-poorest-time-of-my-life\/\">the donuts<\/a>. Everyone around me seemed to happy without a care in the world while I was secretly depressed any time they ate around me. Here I was a student at a prestigious engineering school having to sneak out and hunt my own dinner to survive. In five hunts I only got 3 rabbits which yielded very little meat &#8211; a 30.30 is not good for rabbits. I later decided that the energy spent was not worth it. After the trip for plasma\/gas money, and the effort to find them and dress and cook them after, I was probably spending more calories than I was getting.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout all of this nobody knew. Nobody knew how horribly malnourished I was. I was a long distance runner and pretty thin to begin with, but ended up growing a pot belly like you see in those African charity commercials and I guess they thought I was drinking a lot of beer or junk food.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re still reading this blog, Tim, thank you so much for sharing this with us when you did!<\/strong>\u00a0 It took balls laying it all out there like that, and it still inspires me to this day :) I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone stretching their money to that extreme before!
