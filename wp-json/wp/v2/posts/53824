It&#8217;s always so interesting to see how people use technology to solve our problems out there, and just like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/new-financial-fintech-companies-to-watch-for\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last year&#8217;s competition<\/a> this one did not disappoint.<\/p>\n<p>But first, gotta give it up to <a href=\"http:\/\/ptmoney.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PT Money<\/a> for organizing this amazing event each and every year (it was my 7th one attending!), as well as to all the other bloggers who volunteered their time to make it happen. If you&#8217;re a $$$ blogger or podcaster or just plain obsessed with personal finance, you NEED to come out to it one year and experience what it&#8217;s all about! I promise you will leave incredibly motivated or I will shut down this blog forever ;) (Or at least buy you a beer to cry into &#8211; hah)<\/p>\n<h2>So what happened at FinCon 2017?<\/h2>\n<p>Here are a few of the more exciting highlights&#8230; Because good luck telling social media people that what happens at FinCon stays at FinCon! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rapper Dee-1<\/strong> crowd surfed while rapping his hit song, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JqbXQa05Z6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sally Mae Back<\/a> (Crowd surfed! At a financial blogging conference!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best selling author David Bach<\/strong> (of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/i-want-to-be-automatic-millionaire\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Automatic Millionaire<\/a> fame) popped in to share his wild story on getting on Oprah for the first time, and how the Latte Factor is &#8220;not about the damn lattes!&#8221; Haha&#8230; Rebuking the hate he so often gets when people say they will never give up their coffees no matter how sexy compound interest is ;) He may or may not have also dropped a few F bombs on stage showing that he is definitely not one of the more stuffier financial &#8220;experts&#8221; out there. Super cool to run into him around 1 am on the last night too to talk shop! (Interesting fact: he&#8217;s fairly short)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Darren Rowse<\/strong> shared his story of how he became one of the world&#8217;s first professional bloggers when one of his camera reviews went viral over night. He&#8217;d later go on to start two majorly successful blogs, including the one most bloggers are familiar with and learn from: <a href=\"https:\/\/problogger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ProBlogger.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Chris Guillebeau<\/strong> of The $100 Startup and <a href=\"https:\/\/chrisguillebeau.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Art of Non-Comformity<\/a> talked about how it&#8217;s perfectly okay to let a side hustle be just that &#8211; a side hustle! There&#8217;s no rule that you need to turn it into a full-time job if you&#8217;re perfectly happy with your current one. Just let it be your creative outlet while you bring home some extra side money! (I agree with this 100%!! Not all of us are born to run companies!!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cait Flanders<\/strong> held a presentation on writing Rockstar content that was packed solid which we think\/hope went over pretty well! Interweaving the back story of <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rockstar Finance<\/a> and how it&#8217;s evolved over the years as well. (Cait curates it with me, and is one of my <a href=\"http:\/\/caitflanders.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">favorite bloggers<\/a> on the scene)<\/p>\n<p><strong>A bunch of people from our community<\/strong> created a parody of The Office called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MU8n9zrXK2c&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Floor<\/a> which was shown at our annual blogger award ceremony and was downright HILARIOUS. Then ended with a surprise live musical performance by American Idol contestant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.daltonrapattoni.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dalton Rapattoni<\/a>! (It was all about the music this year, haha&#8230; Thx for putting it together, <a href=\"https:\/\/scottalanturner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scott Alan Turner<\/a>!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And lastly &#8211;<\/strong> we had one pretty damn fun Halloween party to wrap up the conference! Erik from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themastermindwithin.com\/current-events\/why-im-going-to-fincon-2018-orlando\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Mastermind Within<\/a> said it best: &#8220;it was hilarious to see people with $1 million+ net worth\u2019s singing Sir Mix-a-lot\u2019s &#8220;Baby Got Back&#8221;.&#8221; Haha&#8230; That&#8217;s how we roll!

We awarded two prizes for the night &#8211; $1,000 for first and $500 for 2nd &#8211; and below are my honest opinions of each, along with what they do. I&#8217;m not getting compensated by anyone listed here, and there are no affiliate links included at all.<\/p>\n<p>Follow along and see if you can guess who won! :) In no particular order:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53836\" style=\"border-color: #ffffff;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/agreeable-app.png\" alt=\"agreeable app\" width=\"401\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/agreeable-app.png 548w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/agreeable-app-300x151.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Agreeable<\/strong> (AgreeableApp.com) &#8212; Agreeable was one of my favorite apps who presented, and was built to help solve the problem of no shows whenever you go to meet someone off Craigslist or Facebook. Whereas currently you&#8217;re just $hit out of both luck and time when the buyer\/seller doesn&#8217;t show up, with this app you&#8217;d actually get *paid* an agreed upon amount if anyone bails, ensuring that it&#8217;s in both parties&#8217; interests to make the scheduled time. There were some privacy concerns I first had with this as it tracks both of your locations to confirm that the two sides made it to the meet-up okay, but after talking w\/ one of the founders at a party afterwards I was impressed with their patent-pending solution to this. We&#8217;ll see if this puppy takes off, but I&#8217;m personally rooting for it to! (Also can be used for soooo many other areas in life too &#8211; imagine if Comcast or other services were forced to pay you if they never show up when they&#8217;re supposed to?? We&#8217;d all be rich! ;))<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/birchfinance.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53837\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/birch-finance.png\" alt=\"birch finance\" width=\"402\" height=\"100\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/birch-finance.png 450w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/birch-finance-300x75.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Birch Finance<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/birchfinance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BirchFinance.com<\/a>) &#8212; This app was another killer idea, which I SWORE already existed but I guess not (a good sign that they&#8217;re onto something!). Basically, you tell Birch what credit cards you have and use, and then it&#8217;ll analyze them as you&#8217;re out shopping and tell you which ones to use to reap the *best* rewards, as well as *how much* you&#8217;ll get back by them, rather than you having to guess all the time. It&#8217;ll then show you other cards out in the market, and compare what would have happened had you used *those* cards instead of the ones you currently have. And since it&#8217;s all based on your specific transactions and spending patterns, you can see first hand exactly what your cards &#8211; or future cards &#8211; are worth to you. A pretty epic tool for any card hackers\/lovers. (I&#8217;ll never use it since I&#8217;m a minimalist with just my one USAA card, but I&#8217;d be allll on it if I were in the rewards game!)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/budgitapp.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53838\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/budgit-app-logo.jpg\" alt=\"budgit app logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"84\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Budgit<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/BudgitApp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BudgitApp.com<\/a>) &#8212; Budgit is an automated budgeting and savings service that organizes your bills and spending so you can save for your goals. I tried real hard to figure out how these guys were different from all the other budgeting apps out there &#8211; and even posed the question during Q&amp;A time &#8211; but even after doing so I was honestly still just as confused. They actually have this question posed word for word at the bottom of their website (&#8220;How is Budgit different?&#8221;) but the 3 answers given were &#8220;No ads ever&#8221;, &#8220;Hassle-free&#8221;, and &#8220;Secure and private.&#8221; Which I&#8217;m pretty sure most apps are?? All that said, as a budget guy I don&#8217;t think you can have *too many* apps out there spreading the good word, so I very much wish them all the luck and success as they can get.

There&#8217;s not many apps I can think of that focuses mainly on couples (actually, I can&#8217;t think of one?), so I&#8217;m really hoping this one takes off as I think they&#8217;re onto something good here&#8230; Budgets are even sexier when TWO people are involved!! ;)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gokinfo.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53842\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kinfo-social-investing-app.jpg\" alt=\"kinfo social investing app\" width=\"403\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kinfo-social-investing-app.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/kinfo-social-investing-app-300x99.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>KINFO<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/gokinfo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoKINFO.com<\/a>) &#8212; KINFO is an app for DIY investors that brings together information from hedge funds, insiders, analysts, bloggers and other private investors so you can see what everyone else is doing along side you.

It sounded a lot like the others in the field so I had a hard time putting them into their own special bucket, but needless to say you can&#8217;t have too many coupons in this hyper consumer world of ours&#8230; And as for branding, they absolutely NAILED it.

In a nutshell, Take Command helps you easily find the best option for health coverage by using big data to help source the best, and cheapest, health care options for you both on and off the exchange. They also shared the release of their small business feature which helps companies offer better and cheaper plans to their employees as well &#8211; something that many places are struggling hard with right now. So while the topic of health insurance typically doesn&#8217;t turn heads (at least for good reasons!), these guys had our immediate attention and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised a bit if they hit a home run with this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/qoins.io\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53845\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/qoins-logo.jpg\" alt=\"qoins logo\" width=\"299\" height=\"86\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/qoins-logo.jpg 396w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/qoins-logo-300x86.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Qoins<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/qoins.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Qoins.io<\/a>) &#8212; Do these guys look familiar?? They should! I featured them here last year the second I came across them because they&#8217;re the FIRST to finally apply &#8220;rounding up&#8221; technology to debt!!! Which is something severely lacking in our industry&#8230; And while I had to recuse myself from voting on this one since I was definitely biased (<a href=\"https:\/\/communityfund.lovedrop.us\/giving-cards\/qoins-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">they donated $$$ to our Community Fund<\/a> over at Rockstar Finance), I was beyond pleased to see them here and thought they gave a great presentation. You can find <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/qoins-app-pays-off-debt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my review of them here<\/a> (I was the first ever blogger to share them!) but in a nutshell they round up all your transactions to the nearest dollar, and then uses the spare change to help pay off your debt every month. It won&#8217;t clear all of it, but every $30 or $40\/mo helps!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wizefi.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53846\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/wizefi-logo.png\" alt=\"wizefi logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"110\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>WizeFi<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wizefi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wizefi.com<\/a>) &#8212; WizeFi is a paid app ($8\/mo) that helps organize your finances, analyzing everything from your assets and liabilities to your insurance and spending habits.

It comes with a super slick interface and the focus on net worth of course turned me on, but at the end of the day not too sure that alone is worth the $8. Especially since it doesn&#8217;t physically *move* the money for you like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/digit-app-saved-us-millions-of-dollars\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digit<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/acorns-app-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Acorns<\/a> does and still requires you to take action (which most people won&#8217;t). I was also turned off by the mentions of an affiliate program for customers to make more money, both in the presentation as well as on their website (it&#8217;s prominently listed as the #3 reason to sign up?!), even though I&#8217;m sure the founder meant well.
