I\u2019ll tell you&#8230; It\u2019s hearing them afterwards try to convince you why their purchases were actually good choices!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My buddy recently bought a brand new Audi A4. Very sleek and sexy car. And while I\u2019m really stoked for him and want him to enjoy the finer things in life, his reasons for the purchase didn\u2019t quite make sense to me&#8230; His logic was:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>\u201cTax advantages\u201d <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, his tax guy told him that buying more expensive things could lower his taxable income. Since he can deduct car expenses against his income because of his work situation, he was advised that a more expensive car made better sense than buying a cheaper car. &#x1f631;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>\u201cHigher resale value\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My friend bought the $10k upgrade package (leather seats, fancy interior stuff) because he says the car will have a higher resale value later when he wants to sell it. &#x1f914;Huh??!!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s worth it because I drive a lot\u201d<\/b> He spends a lot of time in the car, commuting for work. And since he doesn\u2019t like driving, he thinks having a nicer car will make it a little less miserable vs. a modest car. &#x1f644;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t mean to judge &#8230; People can spend their money on whatever they want to in life. But justifying a luxury or impulse purchase with \u201cit is a good investment\u201d makes me cringe a little. Especially if it\u2019s the complete opposite of common financial sense!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Other Money Excuses We Tell Ourselves to Justify Purchases<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We probably all do it in some way or form. We mix up our <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wants<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">needs<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and rationalize the poor decisions we make. Here\u2019s a list of things I see pretty often (and admittedly, sometimes I think these myself!)<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>\u201cIt\u2019s a tax deduction!\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While a tax deduction could be a great <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefit<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of buying something, it should never be the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">primary reason<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make a purchase. Paying a lot, just to save a little, doesn\u2019t make financial sense.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cI just got a tax refund check! So it\u2019s basically free anyway!\u201d <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a tax refund just means you overpaid taxes throughout the year.l It\u2019s not free money from the government! Thankfully, I\u2019m hearing this reason for impulse purchases less and less. Glad to know people are educating themselves more about taxes! :)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cI bought it because I\u2019ve always wanted one\u201d <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend-of-a-friend of mine just bought a brand new $700 surfboard&#8230; He\u2019s never been surfing before in his life, and never really even talked about it. His reason for buying the new board was <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve always wanted to try surfing!\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230; And while that\u2019s a great attitude (and I love seeing people try new hobbies!), he could probably rent a board for $10\/hr to see if he enjoys it first. Heck, he could have even borrowed one of my boards for FREE and I\u2019ll take him out for a few lessons, too. There\u2019s no great reason to spend large amounts of cash on new hobbies that you might not end up liking.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cGotta experience this while I\u2019m young. YOLO!\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I hear this excuse a lot when people buy spontaneous and expensive vacations. Don\u2019t get me wrong, traveling while young is good &#8212; you can\u2019t wait until you\u2019re an 80y\/o to go backpacking across Papua New Guinea &#8212; but there\u2019s a TON of travel you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enjoy at any age! And less expensive travel can be just as enjoyable as expensive trips! It&#8217;s the experience that counts, and that can&#8217;t just be bought.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cEveryone else has one.

Suze Orman?)<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cMy old one was dirty, and they\u2019re so cheap to replace &#8230; so I just bought a new one\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019ll admit, I used to have a mindset like this. If my coffee maker was looking old and dirty, I\u2019d just buy a new one and ditch the old one. It wasn\u2019t until I met my wife that I really learned to reduce waste and save money! <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>My \u201crich friend\u201d said it was a good investment: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hear this money excuse a lot when investors make sudden large purchases of risky stocks, cryptocurrency, or get-rich-quick opportunities. For me, I\u2019m very cautious of who I take investing advice from &#8212; no matter how good their financial situation is. Whenever I hear this I\u2019m reminded of a quote from my fav personal finance book,<\/span><\/b>\u00a0<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/book-review-millionaire-next-door\/\">The Millionaire Next Door<\/a>:<br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWould a business, especially a very productive one, ever hire a key employee without doing a serious background check and an in-depth interview? No! Yet most people, even those with high incomes, hire financial advisors after obtaining little or no background information about these \u201cemployment candidates.\u201d<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Operate your household like a productive business. The best businesses hire the best people. They also patronize the best suppliers. Utilizing the best human resources and top suppliers are two major reasons the most productive organizations succeed while others fail.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>\u201cThere were only a few left &#8211; so I had to buy it quickly!\u201d <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The power of internet marketing continues to amaze me. If it\u2019s a fast selling and good product, they will probably make more of them. Well-thought-out purchases usually trump speedy ones, regardless of how many items are left in stock.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cI\u2019m saving money in X category, so I can afford to waste a bit more on Y\u201d<\/b> I love it when people celebrate good budgeting and reward themselves for good habits!&#8230; But, it becomes a slippery slope when they start overspending extra money in discretionary categories. Excess spending can creep up and become bad spending habits!<\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cThe stock market is roaring so I can loosen my spending belt a bit\u201d<\/b>\u00a0 I know a lot of people who live this way. They spend a lot in the good times, then when the money stops rolling in they have a miserable time adjusting back downwards. Also, most stock market gains are <i>unrealized<\/i>. Beware of false profits $$!<\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cThis gadget will help me be more productive at work. Saving time = saving money!\u201d<\/b>\u00a0 While there are definitely <i>some<\/i> tools to help make your time more efficient, in my experience, more productivity happens when you have <i>less<\/i> stuff &#8211; not more\u00a0 &#x1f642;<\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cI\u2019m getting a big bonus next month, so I can spend the money now\u201d<\/b> I heard this excuse a lot in my old sales career. Some of my colleagues would go out and blow their commission checks on fancy watches, electronics and stuff before the money was even paid to them! Sometimes sales would fall through, checks never came and they were stuck in credit card debt debt. :(\u00a0 If money is not in your bank account, don\u2019t spend it yet!<\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cI\u2019ve already blown my budget, so who cares anyway. I\u2019ll try harder next month\/year.\u201d<\/b> This budgeting excuse is a funny one, because it\u2019s like giving yourself a reward for bad behavior. Admittedly, I fall into this trap a lot &#8230; For example, around September of this year my wife and I exhausted our entire alcohol budget for 2020. Instead of stopping spending for the rest of the year, we just continued, knowing that our budget was blown anyway. In hindsight, we should have had a different attitude!<\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cI can always return it if I don\u2019t like it &#8211; so it\u2019s like a free trial!\u201d<\/b> The whole point of return policies is to get products you love into your hands. But the likelihood of returning those things that you love is very small. \u201cFree trials\u201d are not a great reason to purchase things you don\u2019t need.<\/li>\n<li><b>It was on sale!<\/b> Stumbling across a killer deal is always exciting. But buying something you don\u2019t need puts you further away from your financial goal, no matter how good the discount is.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending money in itself<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0is not a bad thing\u2026 We are all free to budget for whatever we want in life.
