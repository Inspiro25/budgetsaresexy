Turns out both are pretty addicting, and even more so when combined :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who&#8217;d ya meet? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Over 400 of you who joined these forums! Which is why I didn\u2019t even feel like I was \u201cgone\u201d \u2013 I just changed the place where I was hanging. And it\u2019s been a blast so far getting to know y\u2019all in a more personal way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;d ya know?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve come to realize a handful of things over these weeks:<\/p>\n<p><strong>First, that it\u2019s always better to be at the bottom of a ladder you want to climb, than half way up one you don\u2019t.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I stumbled across that line earlier in the year, and it\u2019s amazing just how helpful it\u2019s become over these past few months. Never has a quote affected me as much before, and I literally think about it anytime I\u2019m trying to make a major decision now! As well as my second favorite quote lately by <a href=\"https:\/\/sivers.org\/hellyeah\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Sivers<\/a> \u2013 <em>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a HELL YEAH, it\u2019s a no<\/em>.\u201d (Helps prevent you from spending energy on all the so-so stuff instead of all the REALLY GOOD stuff that drives you!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Second, it\u2019s amazing how stuck we are in our routines.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I hadn\u2019t stopped blogging cold turkey like this \u2013 something I\u2019ve been doing almost every single day for 9 years straight (!!) \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d still be at it. Stuck in auto-pilot and too afraid to break out.<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing I learned the most <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/11\/million-dollar-blog-deal\/\" target=\"_blank\">during this sabbatical<\/a>, it was that life shouldn\u2019t be run on auto-pilot. It\u2019s much better to put yourself out there and FAIL HARD if you have to, than stay stuck doing stuff just \u2018cuz it was \u201cthe right way\u201d at one point in your life. Despite all your goals and dreams having changed. At least when you fail it means you\u2019re fighting for something important!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Third, when you\u2019re working on something you care about, all other stuff disappears into the background :)<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As crazy as it\u2019ll sound coming from a money blogger, do you know the one thing I did NOT pay attention to at all during this break? My money.<\/p>\n<p>I was so consumed with my projects and having fun and learning\/trying to figure everything out, that the last thing on my mind was my personal finances. Of course I had to check in eventually when the new month arrived to update <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">our net worth<\/a> (coming back again to the site, woo!), but if I can set my life up like THAT going forward, I\u2019d be one happy man.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all pretty ironic if you think about it: needing to pay attention to our money for so long, only to finally be able NOT TO one day. Guess that\u2019s life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And finally, at the end of all this, I realized I\u2019m just not cut out for early retirement. At least in the standard way of thinking.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now do I want <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/10\/retiring-early-means-being-financially-free\/\" target=\"_blank\">to be financially free<\/a>? Oh yeah! But work-wise I had an entire *full month* off to relax and do whatever the hell I wanted, and all I wanted (and all I did!) was to keep hustling towards those projects. Perhaps a month isn\u2019t quite long enough to forecast the future, but I doubt I&#8217;m going to become one of those TV binge watchers once I hit my millions :) It&#8217;s so addicting to see how the world interacts with your ideas once they&#8217;re pushed out into the open!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m always going to be around building stuff, and I\u2019d imagine that once I stop thinking about money for the long term I\u2019ll only start making even more of it. Not unlike other early retirees who still bring home gobs of money even though they\u2019re not setting out to do so (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2016\/02\/29\/mr-money-mustache-the-frugal-guru\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Money Mustache<\/a> being a perfect example \u2013 he\u2019s making multiples of his old salary every year and his blog was only meant to be a passion project!)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>So that\u2019s the story of <em>my life<\/em> this past month :) As for those projects I was committed to getting out the door?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50130\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/tools.jpg\" alt=\"tools\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/tools.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/tools-300x212.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Well, I did work on all three of them (plus about 4 others), but technically only one of them is officially live. Here\u2019s the quick updates:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Money forums<\/strong> \u2013 The only one that\u2019s live! I already went over this one a couple times already so no need to go into more here, other than to say that if you still haven\u2019t checked it out yet, and are looking for a good \u2013 safe \u2013 place to chat about money openly, you\u2019ll probably get a lot out of it: <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.rockstarfinance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">forums.rockstarfinance.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Blogger Directory<\/strong> \u2013 The good news is we now have data on *over 400* bloggers so far \u2013 without me adding to it myself at all! \u2013 but the bad news is it\u2019s taking a lot longer to get out the door than expected. To my credit though, I\u2019ve decided I wanted to build this out the *right* way vs the *fast* way (like I tend to do), so while there is a delay, in theory it should be much more robust and helpful than my original plan :) And considering we\u2019ve gone without this for about 20+ years now (how long has the internet been around by this point?), I\u2019m pretty sure another month or two isn\u2019t going to kill anyone :) Estimated new launch date of Phase I: late January. (<a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/submit-blog\" target=\"_blank\">Add your blog here if you haven&#8217;t already!<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The &#8220;Community Fund&#8221;<\/strong> \u2013 This has been the most frustrating project of them. It turns out it\u2019s not so easy to directly give money to people who need it, at least if you want to run it through a 501(c)3 for the write-off benefit &#8211; <em>and<\/em> &#8211; if you want complete freedom in doing so. Still, last week we had a major break through, and pending any new curve balls in the near future we&#8217;ll have something to show on Jan 1!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you\u2019re as antsy to start DOING GOOD as I am, <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.rockstarfinance.com\/t\/take-one-of-these-20-visa-cards-and-give-an-unexpected-gift-to-someone-in-your-community\/1037\" target=\"_blank\">head over to this forum thread here<\/a> where we&#8217;ve taken a chunk of our own money to empower the community to give back in a fun &#8211; and meaningful &#8211; way this holiday season.

What now happens to budgetsaresexy.vercel.app and all the fun we have here going forward? Will it all be the same? Different? Is J. Money going to burn out again and eventually disappear off the side of the internet Earth?<\/p>\n<p>No, and Yes, and No :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>First off, I\u2019m INCREDIBLY excited to get back to blogging again, and I\u2019m most certainly in it for \u201cthe long haul.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going anywhere, even if you tried to kick me out.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, I also can\u2019t continue writing here exactly how I used to or else I *will* be a hot mess again. So in that regard there will be some changes around here, but hopefully it won\u2019t be too terribly noticeable, especially now that we have so many new areas to hang out online on top of this blog.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49124\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/typing-gif.gif\" alt=\"typing gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the plan:<\/p>\n<p><strong>For the rest of December<\/strong> \u2013 To ease myself back into it again, as well as take advantage of family time around the holidays, I\u2019ll be back to blogging every *Monday* for the rest of the month, and then we\u2019ll publish one of our awesome guest posts I\u2019ve been holding onto for *Thursdays*. This way we still get a healthy dosage of $$$ stuff to discuss, but it also doesn\u2019t kill me. And I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to like these posts even more than my own as I\u2019m pretty picky and they\u2019re incredibly fascinating!!<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s the temporary schedule for December.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For 2017 <\/strong>\u2013 For the new year we\u2019ll be back to publishing articles every Monday, Wednesday, Friday again \u2013 only I\u2019m going to scale back to writing on Mondays and Wednesdays only, and then leaving that Friday spot open to more juicy guest posts provided y\u2019all are actually enjoying them.<\/p>\n<p>If that works out, we\u2019ll leave it be and get right back to normal again :) If I find I\u2019m starting to get burned out again, then I might switch back to writing on Mondays only, but we\u2019ll play it by ear and see how it goes. Regardless, I\u2019m back for good and you\u2019ll always have something fresh from me to marinate on each week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now these changes solve my *time* issue, but as I mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/11\/million-dollar-blog-deal\/\" target=\"_blank\">my sabbatical post<\/a>, I still very much do NOT enjoy all the background work that comes from maintaining a blog.<\/strong> Like dealing with the tech stuff, SEO, growth, monetization, fixing everything that breaks (you\u2019d be amazed how often that is!), and pretty much anything else not relating to writing and talking to you guys ;)<\/p>\n<p>It all comes with the territory of course as no job is \u201cperfect,\u201d but in the same spirit of wanting to come back BIGGER and BETTER than before, as well as to selfishly craft my ideal lifestyle, I\u2019ve decided to make a bold move by partnering up with two of my blog friends in the game to do what they\u2019re best at (all the maintaining\/building\/boring stuff), while I focus on what I\u2019m best at \u2013 or at least have the most fun with, hah! \u2013 the writing and the community part.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These two friends?<\/strong> Nate and Han from <a href=\"http:\/\/investmentzen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">InvestmentZen.com<\/a> \u2013 a blog all about getting people to financial independence faster. And as part of this new partnership, I\u2019ve sold them each a minority stake in the blog totaling $160k over the next year which gives us all skin in the game. And also pads my savings account again so I can continue on not thinking about money so much (see how it all ties together?? ;))<\/p>\n<p>The other nice perk? Han is a killer developer which means I can finally get some of the upgrades and tools built here that I&#8217;ve never had the time (or knowledge) to do over the years. So while they&#8217;ll mostly be behind the scenes while I&#8217;m focusing on all the articles here as normal (I still call all the shots as it&#8217;s my baby, and again, they only own <em>minority<\/em> stakes as I&#8217;ve officially crossed off &#8220;selling out&#8221; once and for all!) hopefully some of the new features we want to start rolling out hit the stands sooner than later.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, I feel like we finally have a great middle ground here, and having all this pressure off my shoulders now allows me to get back to the heart of what I truly love again: starting discussions around money and helping each other without a distracted mind! Just like it was those 9 fateful years ago when I published my very first (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/interview-me-on-me_12\/\" target=\"_blank\">pretty silly<\/a>) post :)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Needless to say, I&#8217;m damn excited for the future of this blog :)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Time will tell whether it all pans out, but going back to that one main takeaway last month \u2013 better to fail going after my dreams than be stuck on auto-pilot! At the end of the day there\u2019s nothing much you can\u2019t really fix or figure out either&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I honestly just can\u2019t wait to get right back to it again and hit publish on this dang post.
