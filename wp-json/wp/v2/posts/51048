Finance<\/a>, and what makes it REALLY scary isn&#8217;t that people don&#8217;t have it in their savings (which we already know), but that they can&#8217;t even *access* it through credit! Can you imagine not being able to even throw it on a credit card if an emergency came up? Sad sad stuff&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Yahoo went on to say:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm\" data-reactid=\"9\"><strong>&#8220;One-third of Americans would not be able to handle a $100 medical bill without going into debt.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm\" data-reactid=\"9\">Double frowny face :( :( Just $100, man&#8230; makes you feel SO FORTUNATE doesn&#8217;t it?? I&#8217;m pretty sure most of us reading this right now can come up with $100 without going into debt&#8230; $hit &#8211; I just spent $110 on two old bills for my currency collection yesterday &#8211; and that&#8217;s not even money you can use!

This one&#8217;s based on data from credit bureau Experian tracking over 220 million consumers, where apparently a whopping 73% had outstanding debt when they were reported dead. 68% with credit card balances, 37% with mortgage debt, 25% auto loans, 12% personal loans and 6% student loans. And even taking out the home loans &#8211; &#8220;good debt&#8221; as they say &#8211; the average was still $12,875 per deceased person.<\/p>\n<p class=\"canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm\" data-reactid=\"9\">Of course, we all die at different times and it&#8217;s an average across the country, but still &#8211; pretty freaky stuff&#8230; And even worse for those you leave behind (the article was actually interesting with the parts on what debt can be transferred over to others and which can&#8217;t. Spoiler alert: when you leave zero debt, zero can be left :))<\/p>\n<p>Now in more fun\/less morbid news&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;Women view men as unattractive if they have a lot of debt. For men, physical appearance carries more weight <em>and debt doesn&#8217;t play a role.<\/em> &#8220;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Hah &#8211; not very surprising ;) This stat comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lendingtree.com\/info\/love-and-money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LendingTree.com<\/a>, and I&#8217;ll fully admit I put looks (and humor!) first when out on the prowl back in the day myself&#8230; I just happened to get lucky and end up with a lady who cherished frugality more than me! Now I wish she were as passionate about entrepreneurship and minimalism, but hey &#8211; what are you gonna do ;)<\/p>\n<p>Lending Tree also found that:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;40% of people who self-identify as very attractive wouldn&#8217;t date someone with bad credit; more than 60% wouldn&#8217;t walk down the aisle with them.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if bad credit alone would ruin the relationship for me (I&#8217;m more interested in knowing if they&#8217;re open to changing and\/or if I&#8217;M IN LOVE WITH THEM!) but it would def. be a concern for sure. At least in my current awareness of money.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;4 in 5 women think it&#8217;s very important to check your partner&#8217;s finances before marriage &#8212; only 3 in 5 men do.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Okay, now THAT is important. You don&#8217;t need to see every last statement or transaction, but you gotta have an overall understanding of what the other person&#8217;s bringing to the relationship! Debts, assets, hopes, dreams, kids &#8211; can&#8217;t be hiding any of that stuff! I feel like it&#8217;s just a part of the entire picture, right? Always freaks me out when you hear those stories of people hiding stuff&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/11\/hiding-debt-from-my-husband\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Financial infidelity<\/a> can be as hurtful to a marriage as physical infidelity!<\/p>\n<p>And, finally&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;Having more school debt doesn&#8217;t hurt the attractiveness of the person as much as having greater car or credit card debt.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Yup yup, smarts are always &gt; stuff :) Debt is debt, but at least you&#8217;re getting a degree and opportunity out of it vs other things people go into it for!
