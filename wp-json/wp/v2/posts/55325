Our parents would be so proud seeing us talk about them today ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>In fact, why don&#8217;t you *email them* this and get some good bonding in? I&#8217;ll wait&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55338\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/flying-email-gif.gif\" alt=\"flying email gif\" width=\"354\" height=\"354\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Alright, so here are my favorites from the batch&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you feel like frugality has been lost in your lives, hopefully this will bring it back for good. And then you can pass it along to <em>your<\/em> future generations in another 60 years too ;)<\/p>\n<p>If we don\u2019t save frugality, who will??<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">My Favorite Frugality Tips:<\/h2>\n<p>#1. To remove water marks from furniture, use several drops of spirits of camphor on damp cloth and rub over mark.<\/p>\n<p>#6. An emergency ice bag can be made by folding a wet towel and freezing in an ice cube tray. Put frozen towel in a plastic bag and tie end shut.<\/p>\n<p>#11. Keep your shower cap pinned to the inside of your shower curtain with a small plastic clothes pin. It will drip in the tub and always be there to use again.<\/p>\n<p>#17. Run hard candy through a food chopper and sprinkle it on ice cream or frosted cakes. A joy to see and eat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#21. If you are remodeling your basement, don&#8217;t throw away left over moldings. Some shapes make very attractive picture frames.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#29. Cut the bristles of an old toothbrush down to 3\/8&#8243; and you have a good fingernail brush.<\/p>\n<p>#33. Fresh vegetable salads of all kinds are greatly improved by adding a little lemon juice.<\/p>\n<p>#47. Squeaky floor boards can usually be stopped by pouring hot melted soap in the crack.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#66. Peanut butter mixed with honey and raisins make an ideal sandwich.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#68. Removing rust spots from metal tools can be done safely and easily with a typewriter eraser.<\/p>\n<p>#70. Temporary counter space in a kitchen can be provided if you pull a drawer out part way and put a cookie sheet on it.<\/p>\n<p>#71. A belt to match any dress can be easily made by folding material over an old belt and fastening the center on the underneath side with iron-on tape.<\/p>\n<p>#79. Don&#8217;t throw away that old large hand bag. It makes a good first aid, sewing or what-not kit to carry in your car trunk for emergencies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#83. If you have trouble threading a needle, push it through a piece of white paper; the white background will help you see the eye better.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#89. A periodic wiping with a cloth dipped in turpentine, of the tile and shower stall in the bathroom, will renew its look.<\/p>\n<p>#94. Too many shoes on the floor, fasten a curtain rod to the inside of your closet door and hang them by their heels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#100. Dental floss is ideal for sewing on buttons. It&#8217;s stronger and will last longer than thread.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#108. Green leaves on the outside of lettuce contain more vitamins than the inside ones, so don&#8217;t throw away more than necessary.<\/p>\n<p>#113. When reading and mixing from an open recipe book, place a piece of clear glass or plastic over it to keep it clean.<\/p>\n<p>#119. Left over scraps of floor tile or linoleum can easily be made into very nice coasters for beverage glasses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#125. If the canary refuses to use his bath bowl, put a little sand in the bottom of the bowl. He may be afraid of the slippery bottom.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#127. Iodine will cover a scratch in mahogany furniture just fine.<\/p>\n<p>#137. If the wire in your cheese cutter breaks, you can replace it with a wire violin or music string.<\/p>\n<p>#144. If you need a bed tray, some ironing boards make a good substitute.<\/p>\n<p>#149. Melted marshmallows make ideal toppings for cup cakes. Ten minutes before the cup cakes are finished baking, pace a marshmallow on top of each cake. When finished baking, they are covered with a delicious topping.<\/p>\n<p>#156. Seldom used luggage is a good place to store blankets, if short on storage space.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#161. You can mend small tears in many curtains, by merely applying colorless nail polish.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#162. To keep plants fresh when you are away, stand them on bricks covered with water in your bath tub. The bricks will absorb enough water to keep the plants moist.<\/p>\n<p>#180. A mason jar of ice cubes, if packed with your picnic lunch, will keep it cool and tasty. When ice cubes melt, you have a jar of good drinking water.<\/p>\n<p>#185. Grapefruit seeds if planted thickly in rich earth about half inch deep and kept well watered, will sprout into a beautiful green center piece in about two weeks.<\/p>\n<p>#193. Bake potatoes in a muffin pan. The potatoes will not move around and will be easy to remove from oven.<\/p>\n<p>#195. Shoe or boot laces that lose their metal tips can be prevented from fraying at the tips with several light coats of fingernail polish. (Editor&#8217;s Note: I personally just burn the tips with a lighter to fix any frayed cords, but nail polish definitely sounds like a better &#8211; and safer &#8211; option :))<\/p>\n<p><strong>#201. Those small clear glass jars with screw tops are invaluable for holding nails, tacks, screws, bolts, herbs, spices or what-have-you. If you nail the lids to the underside of shelves, they are out of the way, easy to reach and easy to see.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#221. Your house key will be easy to locate in your handbag if you tie it to a cord and the other end of the cord to the top of your handbag. Just fish it out.<\/p>\n<p>#223. A finger cut from an old rubber glove and slipped over the top of your broom or mop handle will keep it from falling when leaned against the wall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#236. For a special occasion cake, stick short pieces of macaroni into icing as vases to hold tiny flowers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#252. A small amount of vinegar in your dishwasher will protect hands and make dishes sparkle.<\/p>\n<p>#260. Envelopes attached to the inside of drawers with thumb tacks or scotch tape will hold many small items and keep the items easy to locate.<\/p>\n<p>#278. Pieces of maraschino cherries, oranges, grapefruit, etc. frozen in your ice cubes will add color to your iced drinks.<\/p>\n<p>#281: Store your folding summer chairs in the garment bags you get from your cleaner. It will keep them clean and dust free.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#284. When hanging a picture, mark the spot for the nail with a moistened finger; the spot will stay until you drive in the nail.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#286. You can keep neckties unwrinkled when traveling if you pack them between the pages of a magazine.<\/p>\n<p>#291. To use the last bit of ketchup from a bottle, why not pour in a quantity of oil and vinegar and make a delicious salad dressing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#293. If your medicine cabinet or shower has sliding that stick, just rub a little soap on the slides.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>#299. Put a cup hook near your sink to hold your rings when washing dishes. This habit may save a precious stone from coming loose and going down the drain.<\/p>\n<p>#303. Ivy leaves make unusual and attractive place setting cards for your dinner table. Write names on leaves with white ink.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">************<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Not too bad, right?? Anyone already doing any of these? Anyone find some good ones they think they&#8217;ll try out?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I was LOVING the marshmallow one and the little macaroni vases, haha&#8230; How do you even come up with that?

The concept is that bank customers deposit a set amount of money each week into a special savings account, and receive the money back at the end of the year for Christmas shopping.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And you&#8217;ll see similar ones up there too like &#8220;Vacation Club&#8221; and &#8220;Tax Club&#8221;&#8230; Though sadly no &#8220;Early Retirement Club&#8221; &#8211; yet ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So there you have it &#8211; a bunch of tips that would make your mother proud.<\/strong> Or even <a href=\"http:\/\/frugalwoods.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Frugalwoods<\/a>, for that matter!
