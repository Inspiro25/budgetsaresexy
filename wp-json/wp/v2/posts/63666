Woohoo!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a life goal many of us strive for, so you\u2019d think everyone would be helping her celebrate. But instead, she\u2019s been receiving some interesting and discouraging feedback! Here\u2019s her story &#8230;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My husband and I just paid off our mortgage, 13 years ahead of schedule! Pretty awesome, right? I thought so, too, except that one my subscribers disagreed with me. He replied to my celebration email by saying:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cNot a time to celebrate! You made a big mistake! A house is not how you build wealth, and have full control and liquidity.\u201d<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, I have no idea who this person is or his level of financial expertise. He could be a garbage man, a middle manager, or a financial advisor! Second, this man knows nothing about my personal finances other than the fact that I just paid off my mortgage early. Third and finally, many financial experts agree that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mortgage300.com\/blog\/08\/the-path-to-financial-freedom-how-homeownership-builds-wealth\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">homeownership is still one of the best ways to build wealth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for American families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hate to admit it, but I really wanted to send him a scathing reply for raining on my celebration parade. But I decided to do something better. I turned it into a social media post that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/financiallifeguard_investments-socialmedia-linkedin-activity-6763089798753267712-0pVP\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">went viral on LinkedIn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! I\u2019m still getting comments a week later, and it\u2019s racked up over 20k views!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63726 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/LinkedIn_Post_Snip_jpeg__R0pfOBu-e1613680626425.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"396\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026 But it got me thinking, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are there times when you shouldn\u2019t pay off your house early<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>When it Might be a Mistake to Pay Off Your Mortgage Early<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>You Have No Savings:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your saving account has tumbleweeds blowing through it, then it might be a mistake to pay off your mortgage early. Why? If you have an emergency like a job layoff, major car repair, or big medical bill, you won\u2019t have cash on hand to cover it. And that usually means you\u2019ll be charging it on a credit card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to see my coaching clients accumulate at least six months of their monthly living expenses in liquid savings before paying extra on their home. Plus, your savings will help cover large home maintenance items like a new roof or AC unit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>When You Have High Interest Debt:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mortgage interest rate racked in at 4.125%. Thankfully, when my hubby and I use credit cards, we pay them off in full every month. What if you\u2019re carrying balances on credit cards with 14% or higher interest rates? Then it would be a mistake to pay off your mortgage before concentrating on your credit card debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I typically advise my coaching clients to pay off debts in this order: credit cards, personal loans, student loans, car loans, home equity loans, then mortgages. It just makes sense mathematically to knock out the higher interest debts first because you\u2019re saving more money. Sometimes we\u2019ll do things out of order if it makes sense for cash flow purposes, but 99% of the time, I recommend paying off credit card debt FIRST before paying extra on the mortgage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>When You\u2019re Behind on Retirement:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your financial planner has cautioned that you\u2019re behind on retirement, you\u2019re going to want to think twice about paying extra on your mortgage, at least for now. One of your biggest assets in saving for retirement is time. The sooner you get started, the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/penny-compounding-interest\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compounding effect<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of interest and reinvested dividends was dubbed by Einstein as the 8th wonder of the world. Basically, your money is making more money for you, multiplying like frisky little rabbits. Additionally, your retirement accounts are tax-favored, whether you\u2019re investing your money pre-tax (traditional plan) or growing tax free (Roth plan). Tax-favored accounts are a bonus on top of the investment growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re behind on saving for your retirement, do that first before paying extra on the mortgage. But I will say this: It\u2019s my goal for all of my clients to be mortgage-free by retirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Paying off our mortgage early made sense for us!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our situation, my husband and I have more than six months of our household expenses in savings, have no other debt, and are ahead of schedule with our retirement investments. So, my \u201chater\u201d was wrong! This is a time to celebrate, and paying off our mortgage was the right move for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think? Is there another scenario where it might be a mistake to pay off your mortgage early?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J Money wrote a post many years ago that has always stuck with me\u2026 <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/answer-financial-debates\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Answer To All Financial Debates<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, he explains while there will always be a financially \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to money decisions, sometimes we get a way bigger feeling of accomplishment doing something different.
