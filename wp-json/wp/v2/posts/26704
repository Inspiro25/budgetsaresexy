This would include computers, servers, printers, phone systems, cell phones and other hand held devices. This would also include web servers, email servers or other applications that run on these devices.]<\/p>\n<h2>My Background<\/h2>\n<p>Throughout my childhood I did really well in school\u2026 At least until about the 7<sup>th<\/sup> grade. I really loved learning new things but a classroom setting wasn\u2019t very appealing to me. This eventually led to failing grades and dropping out of high school at the end of 10<sup>th<\/sup> grade. Of course this choice lead to low paying warehouse and manufacturing jobs for years. I eventually worked my way into a livable salary\u2026 but it took forever.<\/p>\n<p>Not that I knew it at the time but, the turning point in my life came when my wife started going to college. She needed a computer for school so we bought her one. I had never touched a computer before at this point, so I was very excited to see what it could do. The first few nights I just clicked around and played with the installed programs and this got boring fast. Then I decided it would be a good idea to start deleting various things and see if I could fix the resulting problems. To make a long story short I would break the computer every night then try to fix it before my wife found out.Eventually I got caught and was told to stop it\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>How I Got Started Freelancing<\/h2>\n<p>So, with my new found knowledge and no longer having a computer to test my new ideas on I turned my focus towards friends and coworkers.\u00a0 I would offer to fix anybody\u2019s computer for free just to see if I could.\u00a0 Even though I wasn\u2019t charging people anything at this time sometimes people were so surprised that I fixed the problem they would give me things.\u00a0 Some of the things I got were house plants, candles and tickets to events\u2026 I didn\u2019t really care all I wanted to do was fix the computers. This went on for a few years and eventually led to fixing computers around the office where I was working at the time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My first paying gig came when I decided to get a part time job.<\/strong>\u00a0 I found an evening job working for Learning Tree University.\u00a0 The experience I gained from my short stay at Learning Tree University led to the job I currently have working for one of the largest Intellectual Property law firms on the West Coast.\u00a0 My first 4 years there I worked as a System Support Technician then I took over as the firms Web Developer and have been doing that job for almost 7 years now.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after starting my current job a coworker approached me and asked if I could help him set up 2 of his clients that were moving into a new building.\u00a0 Of course I said yes!\u00a0 At this time I had been experimenting with Linux servers and jumped at the chance to build Linux servers that a whole office would use. His 2 clients were sharing a building so that was convenient.\u00a0 But, I had to build 2 servers for each client and only had a week to complete them and test them.\u00a0 To my surprise things worked out really well for my first real world setup. Eventually my coworker got tired of having both clients and asked me to take one of them\u2026 So I did.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I found out very soon why he gave me this client<\/strong>.\u00a0 They were very needy and I spent almost every night working there.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say\u2026 The whole office was on a mission to install everything the internet had to offer and this created a lot of problems.\u00a0 I only lasted about 6 months with this client before I gave up and fired them.<\/p>\n<p>My next client was a non profit company that my sister in law worked for.\u00a0 This client was really great to work for and only had a few employees that caused problems.\u00a0 I worked for them for about 6 years until they outgrew my ability to help them.\u00a0 This was also an odd situation because they were located 2 hours away from me by car.\u00a0 I tried several times over the years to get them to find a local technician to help them\u2026 but, they always declined.<\/p>\n<h2>How Much You Can Make<\/h2>\n<p>For my first client I was billing $50.00 per hour.\u00a0 For my second client I started out billing them $100.00 per hour and eventually settled on an $800.00 retainer every month.\u00a0 The retainer method works really well for non profits because they have very strict budgets and they don\u2019t like surprise expenses. <em>[<strong>Never offer to work for a fixed amount<\/strong> each month unless you really know the company and their needs. You could end up making a few bucks an hour if you do this for the wrong client.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The decision for how much to charge is derived from how much others charge in your area versus the skills you are offering.\u00a0 Companies can\u2019t afford to be down for long periods of time so you need to be sure you can fix almost any problem within a few hours.\u00a0 If you are confident that your skills justify it then set your price near the higher end of the scale.<\/p>\n<h2>The Pros, Cons and Everything In Between<\/h2>\n<p>The pros to freelancing:<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A great way to make some side income and learn at the same time<\/li>\n<li>You learn a lot about running a business without committing to doing it full time<\/li>\n<li>You learn to really listen to what people want and then figure out how to provide it for them<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The cons:<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may have to work late into the night to fix a problem caused by an employee<\/li>\n<li>Billing disputes<\/li>\n<li>Personality clashes with clients<\/li>\n<li>A bigger tax bill at year end<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Other things to be aware of:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Know your limitations<\/em> \u2013 If you are doing this part time make sure the client only has a few employees.\u00a0 10 or less employees would be safe but any more than that could get crazy.<\/li>\n<li><em>Contacting you<\/em> \u2013 If you have a day job then you need to make it clear that you clients can only contact you via email.\u00a0 Some people will call you all day if they have your phone number.<\/li>\n<li><em>Remote connection software<\/em> \u2013 Everyone in the tech industry uses remote connection to access a client\u2019s computer.\u00a0 This enables you to fix software related problems from anywhere that has an internet connection. VNC and Remote Desktop are the most common for Windows machines.<\/li>\n<li><em>Location<\/em> \u2013 99% of the time I could work from my home office\u2026 But, be ready to drive to the client\u2019s office in the middle of the night if something goes wrong and you can\u2019t connect to one of the computers.\u00a0 Or in case of hardware failure.<\/li>\n<li><em>Everyone needs these <\/em>\u2013 Two things people can\u2019t live without are mail and an internet connection.\u00a0 Really know how to fix problems related to these 2 items. This accounted for 80% of my work load.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How To Get Started<\/h2>\n<p>The best way to get started in this is still the old fashioned way: break things and fix things over and over again.\u00a0 Read as many magazines and books as possible related to computers. If possible, use an old computer that nobody is relying on &#8211; that way you can do whatever you want to it.<\/p>\n<p>Once everyone around you knows what you do,\u00a0 the marketing kind of takes care of itself.\u00a0 I never had to look for any of my freelance jobs\u2026 They just seem to find me to the point that I had to turn away jobs.\u00a0 If I wanted to freelance full time I would avoid any of the freelance websites and go with low tech advertising. I would either tell everyone I know that I\u2019m looking for work or I would make up flyers and target every business complex near me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You may also want to target specific businesses such as Accounting Firms, Medical or Dental offices.<\/strong>\u00a0 The reason for this is because each type of business works with a specific group of software that you will need to become familiar with.\u00a0 For example Medical offices will use software that is completely different than an Accounting firm.\u00a0 By sticking to a specific business type you drastically reduce the types of software you have to support or troubleshoot.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Ron Dawson<\/strong> currently runs a blog dedicated to the topic of Exploring Simplified Living.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>**Have an interesting Side Hustle of your own? <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\/\">Let us know!<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/theyoungthousands\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">youngthousands<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Today&#8217;s article by Ron Dawson, as part of our Side Hustle Series) [What is Information Technology (IT)?
