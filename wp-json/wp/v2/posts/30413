She&#8217;ll be talking a little about &#8216;pensions&#8217; here in a bit,\u00a0<em>but keep in mind she\u2019s a resident of the UK where these types of \u2018pensions\u2019 she refers to are more like our Social Security\u2026<\/em> At least from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pensions_in_the_United_Kingdom\">what I can gather<\/a>. Regardless, the takeaway here is what&#8217;s important :))<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Some say that with age come experience and wisdom.<\/strong> This may be so, but I feel much more excited to be visited by acceptance and reflexivity: these are\/have been instrumental in replacing regret with optimism, and worry with a specific plan for action. But let me tell you a bit more about what this is about.<\/p>\n<p>Most of us have heard about generations; some of us have heard about different generations like &#8216;the lost generation&#8217;, &#8216;the baby boomer generation&#8217;, &#8216;the Beatles generation&#8217; or &#8216;Generation Y&#8217;. But have you heard about &#8216;<em>the missing out generation<\/em>&#8216;? I hadn&#8217;t either until I started reflecting on my life (very mid-life crisis, I know) and realised that I belong to it. This is a group of people who were born in the early to late 1960s (at the cusp between the Baby Boomers and Generation X &#8216;proper&#8217;) and who share a collective regret about &#8216;missing out&#8217; on things.<\/p>\n<h2>What have we missed out on?<\/h2>\n<p>We missed out on the 1960s for start. You know, I am yet to meet someone my age who doesn&#8217;t harbour <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/top-5-regrets-of-the-dying-and-adjusting-life-accordingly\/\">regrets<\/a> for missing out on the 1960s; and I am yet to meet anyone who was old enough to enjoy life in the 60s and really did so (most suspected everybody else was having a ball). Still, there is the small matter of music, flower-power and free love: and my generation missed out on all that.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, there was Tina Turner, but there were also Bonnie M. Yes, we did have sex but it was a bit like a pleasurable way to keep fit rather than the political statement it used to be. As to flower-power\u2026well, it completely lost to greed and \u2018life in the fast lane\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now it looks like that my generation is going to miss out on pensions as well.<\/strong> (J$: Remember, &#8216;pensions&#8217; in the UK are diff. than here in the States) To cut a long story short, different \u2018properties of pensions\u2019 have been going the wrong way. I wouldn\u2019t be concerned if the retirement age was going down and the size of pensions was going up. Regretfully we are told that we will be retiring later and later and the pensions that we can realistically expect, after accounting for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/inflation-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-this-topic\/\">inflation<\/a>, will hardly be enough for hot dogs and mushy peas dinner. Pension funds have been performing badly across the board and people are already feeling the pinch.<\/p>\n<p>To add insult to injury, recently a\u00a0former benefits chief&#8217; in the UK suggested that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-20044862\">retired people should be made to<\/a> work for their pensions. Wait a minute, now! <em>Isn\u2019t the whole point of retirement that people don\u2019t have to\/can\u2019t work any longer?<\/em> Or have I been labouring under the misguided belief that I am building a pension fund so that my dotage is peaceful and without the need to undertake paid work?<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is what did it for me; here is where I draw the line! <\/strong>I can\u2019t bring the 60s back \u2013 this is something on which my generation missed out and that is that. But you know what? Missing out on the 60s music made us \u2018musical nomads\u2019. I am equally happy listening to Faure or Dr Dre: it all depends on what I feel like at the moment (and what I am doing; running while listening to rap is great). The \u2018sex as sport\u2019 thing also turned out fine: once AIDS made the headlines we had to be safe, not make statements. Yes, my generation didn\u2019t have jobs when we were starting out; but this only means that this time around we know what we are dealing with.<\/p>\n<p>All it takes to turn a situation of loss to our advantage \u2013 and my generation has ample experience with this \u2013 is <em><strong>to<\/strong> <strong>change our thinking and, after that, our actions.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see what this means for our retirement \u2013 our last chance to make a stand against a string of misses. I believe that if we are to come out top trumps here, we need to move away from thinking about employment, pensions and retirement. Ironically, this is the one way that will allow us to have retirement.<\/p>\n<h2>From \u2018employment\u2019 to \u2018work\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>Most of us focus on \u2018employment\u2019, or jobs, most of the time and structure our lives accordingly. Even when we dream about \u2018getting out of the rat race\u2019 and \u2018being our own boss\u2019 we still think about employment \u2013 we only put \u2018self\u2019 in front of it. This is problematic, however, because \u2018employment\u2019 is our way to refer to the conditions under which we do specific work. Employment is about a contract between you and an employer (this can be a contract between you and yourself) and your job is what is in your job description \u2013 the things you do to complete specific tasks (specific work).<\/p>\n<p>In other words, work is at the core of all this; work is the true measure of the value we contribute to organisations, society at large and people\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focusing on work, instead of employment, has two important implications:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li>One doesn\u2019t need to be employed to contribute value; and<\/li>\n<li>One can get much further in both employment and \u2018working for oneself\u2019 when one focuses on work and generating value.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Focusing on work and contributing immense value makes it likelier that you will be able to amass the wealth (and develop the income streams) you need so you won\u2019t have to sell your labour, e.g. you won\u2019t have to be employed.<\/p>\n<h2>From \u2018pension\u2019 to \u2018income streams\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>Most of us habitually focus on \u2018having a pension\u2019. Guess what? You actually don\u2019t need a pension, you need <em>income.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What I am saying here is that we have come to associate retirement with a pension (or annuity) so closely that when thinking of retirement we tend to think about only one possible financial instrument to ensure that we have income. Probably not the best one for that either!<\/p>\n<p>Instead of focusing on pensions it may be better to start focusing on income early on. This opens a whole host of opportunities for generating this income.<\/p>\n<h2>From \u2018retirement\u2019 to \u2018life-style design\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>I know, I know. I have read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0307465357\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307465357&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20\">Tim Ferriss<\/a> and he is a great champion for, and example of, life-style design. But somehow, my generation is missing out again; or shall I say, we appear to be missing a trick or two here. Life-style design is still somehow seen mainly as something <em>young<\/em> people do. Well, young people and people without other responsibilities like children at school and in college, and elderly parents and aching joints.<\/p>\n<p>I figure that my generation will do well to forget about retirement, doggy cardigans, twisted stockings and worn out slippers. We may as well forget about group tourism for senior citizens &#8211; at least this is what I am going to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I am determined to live the life I really want during the first part of my later years.<\/strong> I\u2019ll walk a pilgrimage; I\u2019ll chase marathons and take flamenco classes with the gypsies of Granada. I\u2019ll live in interesting places and absorb the language, and the culture. I\u2019ll write, educate and entertain. I\u2019ll wear purple only if it is Prada!<\/p>\n<p>And when the time to slow down comes, as it inevitably will, I\u2019ll set up a commune for my surviving friends; no care homes for me. I\u2019ll start my own place for \u2018the elderly and the beautiful\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is how my retirement will be!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before anybody mutters anything about &#8216;a mid-life crisis&#8217; let me tell you: I am not missing out on this one either \u2013 I am embracing it and celebrating it. My friends in the US, just watch out for a lovely middle aged woman on a motorbike riding through your town in 2018 \u2013 it may be me. Oh, and I\u2019ll be wearing leather! :)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<em><strong>Maria<\/strong> has the heart of a thinker, the head of a researcher and the soul of a writer.
