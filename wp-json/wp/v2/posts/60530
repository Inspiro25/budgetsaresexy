A *real* thing that&#8217;s apparently wide spread and pretty hard to break!]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>J. Money,<\/p>\n<p>My financial journey started approximately four years ago when I was an interior designer and negative $200 every month (without even paying myself first). I remember sitting at my desk and having this moment realizing I was yet again in the negatives and I got turned down for a raise.<\/p>\n<p>Something just clicked in me, I decided to choose not to live as if this life and situation is uncontrollable. I needed change and I wanted to be in control of how my life was\/is turning out, and what better way than to deep-dive into my finances! My parents did not instill good financial knowledge in me, so I had to teach myself and start from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>My situation was a tricky one &#8211; I inherited a house from my mother in 2010 when I was 22, who then didn&#8217;t have a Last Will &amp; Testament which meant I had to get an estate lawyer, STAT. Because I had no direction in life when she passed I hadn&#8217;t finished college, but still I couldn&#8217;t seem to let the house go emotionally.<\/p>\n<p>It was the last material thing I have of her (and at the lowest of my low I had to sell her beloved silverware that had been brought down from generations in order to pay a property tax one year) and I couldn&#8217;t give it up. I had multiple years of education left in which I didn&#8217;t have the money for, the estate lawyer was going to be costly, and I needed to make my part-time job into full-time. I decided to turn the house into a rental property which meant taking all of my cash (and one racked up a credit card &#8211; EEK!) to make the house ready to rent out.<\/p>\n<p>I then pushed my ego aside and asked for help for myself &#8211; my best friend&#8217;s parents were able to house me for TWO YEARS without rent, and for that I&#8217;m forever grateful. I eventually worked my way up (no longer a designer but still in the design field, just in sales) and am now able to eat more than just beans, rice, and oatmeal for every meal (seriously though&#8230; gotta do what you gotta do).<\/p>\n<p>Just an idea of what I&#8217;ve spent:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; $12,500-ish on lawyer fees because my mother didn&#8217;t have a Last Will &amp; Testament<br \/>\n&#8212; $35,000 in educational loans<br \/>\n&#8212; $20,000 in credit card debt &#8211; making my house tenant-ready, fixing plumbing, roof, and window issues, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-i-appealed-my-ridiculous-property-taxes\/\">property taxes<\/a>, and other house-related expenses that it needed because it was so old and desperately in need of repairs (talk about great decision to keep the house, no?! HA!)<br \/>\n&#8212; $5,500 in medical fees for the anxiety that associated with all of these levels of trauma I was experiencing (I worked 12-hour days at my design job, had multiple family members pass away, and was living off the &#8220;fight-or-flight&#8221; instincts which left me riddled with panic and anxiety attacks)<\/p>\n<p>Actions I did to make this financial change four years ago:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; I eliminated all unnecessary items from my budget including but not limited to: gym membership, cable, Netflix or Hulu, clothes, food, cell phone bill (went to the cheapest version)<br \/>\n&#8212; Sold clothes\/furniture\/items not necessary to my living situation<br \/>\n&#8212; Minimized my diet (rice, beans, oatmeal, local fruits and vegetable on sale ONLY, water only from a water bottle I carried around religiously, chicken, etc.)<br \/>\n&#8212; Told all my friends and family I&#8217;m unable to go out to eat or drink and unfortunately missing out on social events\/trips so they are aware of this lifestyle change, etc. (this was absolutely brutal for a 20-something!)<\/p>\n<p>In result, this is (so far) what I&#8217;ve paid off:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Credit card<br \/>\n&#8212; My lawyer fees<br \/>\n&#8212; All medical fees<br \/>\n&#8212; A small portion (but still a portion!) of my educational loans &#8211; full disclosure $3,400<br \/>\n&#8212; Built an emergency savings of 3 months<\/p>\n<p>Looking back, I cannot believe I kept the house for this long. It&#8217;s been 8 years since my mom died, and I&#8217;m now married and about to have children of my own (plot twist: we live in the house because it&#8217;s cheaper than living elsewhere AND we are able to live on 55% of our salary!)<\/p>\n<p>Here are the main takeaways from my journey:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Recognize when you&#8217;re being mistreated at work in regards to what you&#8217;re being paid and what you&#8217;re truly worth<br \/>\n&#8212; It&#8217;s always possible to remove unnecessary expenses from your budget &#8211; gym membership, cable, Netflix or Hulu, clothes, food, cell phone bill, etc.<br \/>\n&#8212; Pay yourself first<br \/>\n&#8212; Maintaining mental health is so crucial to living a life worthwhile<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if this means anything, but I wanted to let you know your blog has kept a fire lit for me on not only continuing paying off debt, but also doing some self-care (paying myself first and building an emergency fund) and focusing on building wealth (10% to retirement every check).
