I know, I could have got a slightly better deal by checking out comparison sites for currency conversion, but I wanted it done fast and didn\u2019t think the difference would be so great as to be worth the while.<\/p>\n<p>So, I got to the teller at my local bank, brandished my $200 and announced that I\u2019d like to change it to Sterling. Now, maybe it was her last day on the job. Maybe she\u2019d just had a nasty fight with her boss, or perhaps she was simply a savvy soul out to save her customers a few pennies. Whatever it was, this lady was all about the honesty. She winked \u2013 actually winked \u2013 at me, checked around to see no-one was listening, then leant forward towards the glass and said:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You\u2019d be better changing that at the post office. Our rate\u2019s rubbish.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; I was pretty taken aback and immediately curious. &#8220;Why are you telling me this?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She shrugged. &#8220;It\u2019s the truth.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Was that it? Was she simply into telling the truth, even if it meant turning customers away?<\/p>\n<p><strong>It <a href=\"http:\/\/skintinthecity.com\/washing-dry-clean-only-clothes\/\">isn\u2019t the first time<\/a> I\u2019ve come across such honesty when trying to give someone my business.<\/strong> A while back the woman at the dry cleaners told me to go home and put my jacket in the washing machine rather than get it dry cleaned again. After I picked my jaw up off the floor I went home, tried it and discovered she was spot on.<\/p>\n<p>Was she right to be so honest though? It benefited me, but what would her boss say? I&#8217;d imagine if you owned the dry cleaning firm you\u2019d be more than a little mad at her sending customers home to do their own washing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is that kind of honesty a good business tactic?<\/strong> A couple of years back, on a Scottish island, I tried to check into a hotel with Mr Skint. There was a jazz festival on and hardly a room to be had. Finally, we came across a guest house that still had vacancies, but as the owner led us to see the rooms he was more candid than one might expect from someone wanting our custom.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The only rooms we\u2019ve got left are what we call our <em>crappy little rooms<\/em>,&#8221; he announced with a smile. He was right. Half-charmed by his honesty, we took one anyway and spent a gloomy weekend on a lumpy bed hiking to the bathroom downstairs in the middle of the night. We can\u2019t say we weren\u2019t warned.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, does brutal honesty always benefit the customer?<\/strong> In the case of the bank lady and the dry cleaning assistant, I\u2019m glad they were so straight with me. On both occasions they saved me money. Especially the dry cleaner \u2013 thanks to her I learned to gaily throw dry clean only clothes in the wash on a regular basis. As soon as I see a dry clean label now my fingers start twitching for the detergent. It\u2019s saved me a fortune over the years!<\/p>\n<p>And I suppose the hotel guy did let us know what we were in for. In fact, we were a little blindsided by his honesty and sort of ended up taking the room for that reason, so maybe it worked in his favour?<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Have you ever been just that bit too honest in your business dealings?<\/strong><\/em> Or do you believe that when it comes to dealing with customers it\u2019s better to be a little bit Pinnochio? Ever come across sales people who were just too candid for comfort? Go on, let it all out!<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br \/>\n<em>Guest Post by <a href=\"http:\/\/skintinthecity.com\/\">skintinthecity.com<\/a> &#8211; showing you how to live the high life on a shoestring budget.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>{Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mpclemens\/\">mpclemens<\/a>}<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Article by Skint in The City) I got to wondering this a couple of weeks back, when I tried to change $200 into sterling pounds&#8230;. <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/is-being-honest-to-customers-bad-for-business\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[12],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-33133","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-saving"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Is Being Too Honest Bad For Business?  | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/is-being-honest-to-customers-bad-for-business\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Is Being Too Honest Bad For Business?  | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"(Article by Skint in The City) I got to wondering this a couple of weeks back, when I tried to change $200 into sterling pounds....
