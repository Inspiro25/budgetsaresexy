I woke up yesterday and saw him out my window, apparently opening the back yard gate (wtf?) and I literally have no idea where he came from.<\/p>\n<p>Here are my ideas so far:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A friend is pranking me<\/li>\n<li>I have an internet stalker and this is just the beginning of what he\/she\/it has planned for me<\/li>\n<li>Someone didn&#8217;t want him and threw him in our yard, accidentally hitting our gate open and miraculously landing on his feet<\/li>\n<li>I bought him when I was drunk and I have absolutely no recollection<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>My imagination tends to get the best of me with these things<\/strong> (remember <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/09\/biggest-idiot-in-the-world\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the car accident?<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/06\/mysterious-lost-wallet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the mysterious wallet<\/a>??), so I thought I&#8217;d stay optimistic and take it as a good luck sign. Perhaps Mr. Gnome is merely a symbol of great wealth, and by positioning himself next to an open gate like that foreshadows more of it coming our way? A *gateway* of wealth, if I may? :)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you know what comes of it (if this is the last time you hear from me you&#8217;ll know the answer!), but I&#8217;m quite puzzled to say the least. I mean, WHO LEAVES A GNOME AT SOMEONE&#8217;S HOUSE??<\/p>\n<p><em>[<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong> <\/span>It was a friend of mine playing a joke on me :) Apparently she had gotten it as a gag gift yeas ago at work, and instead of donating it to the Salvation Army decided to have some fun with it&#8230; Little did she know we&#8217;d make him famous on the internetz!! ZOMG!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>In other random news, I woke up to a swarm of ants falling out of our smoke detector last night.<\/strong> The alarm went off at 2 am, and when I went to unplug the thing (there was no fire, don&#8217;t worry), they literally fell out in clumps onto my head. To say it was disgusting is an understatement. Though I&#8217;m more concerned with what the hell is going on with our house lately?? Haha&#8230; Another reason to be happy about renting again though, I&#8217;ll say that ;)<\/p>\n<p>And before you ask, no. They weren&#8217;t <em>fire<\/em> ants &#8211; you witty devils, you.<\/p>\n<h2>Shall we talk about money yet? ;)<\/h2>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/r0HX4a5P8eE?rel=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center>{Best 36 seconds of your week, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r0HX4a5P8eE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video<\/a>. I promise you.}<\/center><br \/>\nHere&#8217;s a bunch of things that happened this week:<\/p>\n<p><strong>I bought a gallon of milk for $4.00 and thought I was being ripped off.<\/strong> When did milk cost over four freakin&#8217; dollars??? I&#8217;m obviously not the grocery shopper in our household, but my jaw just about hit the floor when the cashier gave me back $15.00 and change from my $20 bill. I literally asked where the rest of it was and she fired back &#8220;Oh honey, it&#8217;s been this way for a while.&#8221; Next thing you&#8217;re gonna tell me is that gas doesn&#8217;t cost $1.00 anymore? ;)<\/p>\n<p>(On a side note, when I tweeted about this I learned from my Canadian friends that it costs $8.00&#8217;ish in some (all?) parts!! EIGHT DOLLARS! They said it&#8217;s so bad that they literally drive over the boarder into the U.S. and then come back with a stockpile&#8230; Here&#8217;s a crazy video <a href=\"http:\/\/moneyramblings.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Money Ramblings<\/a> sent me about what it&#8217;s like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QyCZTVapOnM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dealing with this at Costco<\/a>. #1stWorldProblems)<\/p>\n<p><strong>I bought a liter of Baileys and <em>knew<\/em> I was getting ripped off.<\/strong> But you know, alcohol.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I gave<\/strong> <b>freelance writing a shot.<\/b> And made $1,000, off just ONE article! I <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/03\/coining-hiding-tickling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hinted that this was a possibility<\/a> a few weeks ago, and it turned out to be correct :) Just because I ASKED. I literally said &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I have the time to devote to this, but what&#8217;s your budget?&#8221; and they said &#8220;We can <em>only<\/em> do $1,000, is that okay?&#8221; Umm&#8230; I then asked the next few offers that came my way the same thing (I get pitched at least twice a month and usually just say no cuz I had no idea how much money was involved!) and those came in at $50 and $25 respectfully. I turned them both down, and the one at $50 asked what I would need to make it happen. I said $200, and they said OK (!!!!). Man&#8230; that old cliche works! We&#8217;ll see if these have just been flukes or not, but regardless it&#8217;s completely opened up my eyes. Something for you all to keep in mind too!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I learned that you can share your Amazon Prime account with others in your household!<\/strong> I found this out through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.debtroundup.com\/share-amazon-prime-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DebtRoundup.com<\/a>, and it&#8217;s awesome because I&#8217;m the guy with all the Amazon *credit* in my account, but my wife is the one with Prime! So we either have to use my account to buy stuff for free but then wait for shipping (again, #1stWorldProblems!), or we have to use her account and then pay for it since you can&#8217;t xfer credit :( So this solves that!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I started blogging M,W,F now that I&#8217;m back, and so far so good?<\/strong> I&#8217;m anxious as hell on every day nothing goes up, but on the flip side I&#8217;m having the time of my life building and growing the site and thinking about better content for you all :) Like, for example these two pages that I would have never had time to compile beforehand: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Net Worth Tracker<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ultimate Side Hustle page<\/a>. Interestingly enough my traffic is through the roof as well here? Puts things into perspective just how important you think you are, haha&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if this will remain constant or not, but for now we&#8217;re testing it out :)<\/p>\n<h2>I&#8217;m thinking of becoming a money coach!<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38975\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/neon-george-washington.jpg\" alt=\"neon george washington\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/neon-george-washington.jpg 500w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/neon-george-washington-300x191.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>I love helping people one-on-one in general,<\/strong> and lately with all my blog consulting, and the idea to do so with people&#8217;s money somehow never really entered my brain.

I mean, if people are asking and ready to get their $hit together, why not give it a shot and help some people out?<\/p>\n<p>I have a bunch of chats set up with people in the field doing this already, so we&#8217;ll see what comes of it. There are a ton of different options you can go (&#8220;Financial Planner&#8221;, &#8220;Daily Money Manager&#8221;, &#8220;Coach&#8221;) but considering I have no certifications whatsoever and really just love MOTIVATING people to take action and guiding them along, the coach route is def. the way to go.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If any of this sounds interesting to you, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drop me a note<\/a> :)<\/strong> Perhaps you can be one of my first <del>guinea pigs<\/del> clients?
