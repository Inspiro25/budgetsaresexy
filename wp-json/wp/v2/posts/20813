Haha&#8230; and got a half dozen trash bags worth of donating to do now too ;)\u00a0 Yeah tax write offs!<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s clips of the interview &#8211; I hope it helps!\u00a0 If you&#8217;d like to read it all in Spanish, go over to <a href=\"http:\/\/finanzaspersonalesparatodos.com\/aprendiendo-de-los-grandes-una-entrevista-con-j-money\/\">Finanzas Personales Para Todos<\/a> where my boy translates it for his audience, haha&#8230; awesome. (Actually, I think he broke it down into two parts, but still &#8211; pretty cool to read it in another language :))<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Give us your 30 second story about Budgets are Sexy. How and why did you start? Why did you keep on going? Where is the blog now and where is it going?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I actually started the blog off a fluke &#8211; I was searching around for ways to budget better since I had just bought a house (Another fluke &#8212; I went apartment shopping for rentals, only to come away BUYING a place 3 days later &#8211; yikes!) and kept stumbling across all these personal stories about managing money.\u00a0 I had no idea what a blog was, or any interest in even jumping into one myself, but the more I read, the more I got engaged and really kept learning day in and day out.\u00a0 Then one day while bored at work I decided to just start one, figuring I had a bunch of crazy stories I could tell too.\u00a0 And as someone w\/ massive A.D.D., and no experience writing whatsoever, I figured it would either crash and burn or take off and give me something fun to do every day.\u00a0 I had no idea it would become my life 4 years later or that I&#8217;d meet thousands and thousands of new online friends :) And that&#8217;s really what keeps me going, to be honest with you. The community we&#8217;ve all helped build over time.\u00a0 Our audience in the PF niche is just incredible, and every blog out there helped to form it. I love it!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What have you learned about the way you handle your own finances? What significant changes have you brought to your own money management as a result of this experience?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I learned that I get really hardcore about stuff, really fast, and to just run with it for however long I&#8217;m in the mood :)\u00a0 Which I know isn&#8217;t the right way to do things, but I&#8217;ve come to terms with it and I&#8217;ve managed to apply it to many different aspects of my life &#8211; esp. money.\u00a0 When I save, I save a LOT and I do everything in my power to make it happen like it was some sort of challenge.\u00a0 And then it fades away, and maybe I switch to <a href=\"..\/2011\/09\/mortgage-payoff-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\">paying off debt<\/a>, or to earning MORE money, or whatever the case may be.\u00a0 But as long as I&#8217;m taking advantage of the times I&#8217;m super focused and eager to get something done, it&#8217;s worked out for me pretty well.\u00a0 And I highly recommend it.\u00a0 Not being so extreme one way or the other (that&#8217;s never really good), but noticing the way your brain works, and tweaking our habits to move along with it accordingly.\u00a0 The same can be said about doing your laundry, or writing that paper you&#8217;ve been putting off, or whatever.\u00a0 The second you&#8217;re in the mood to do it, jump on it and ride it through!\u00a0 You&#8217;ll get a TON more accomplished, and in a shorter amount of time.\u00a0 It really is efficient.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What can you conclude &#8211; from your interaction with readers and followers &#8211; is the biggest problem people experience with money?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I think there&#8217;s two answers to that: 1)\u00a0 People usually want the FAST way of doing things, and tune out when you don&#8217;t give them any sexy way to do that (because let&#8217;s face it, there isn&#8217;t one).\u00a0 So the biggest hurdle I find is keeping people MOTIVATED to continue to want to do better, and get them into the habit of applying the &#8220;money concept&#8221; in small ways every single day.\u00a0 Even if they realize they&#8217;re doing it or not.\u00a0 Which brings us to #2)\u00a0 People are lazy.\u00a0 Everyone wants a lot of money and the perfect job or vacation\/etc, but it takes ACTION to get to that point.\u00a0 There&#8217;s a lot of talkers in this world, and unfortunately not as many do-ers. So if you can get in the habit of walking the walk, I think you&#8217;ll get a lot more out of your life both financially, and mentally. You just have to START.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>If you could reset people&#8217;s minds with regards to ONE financial matter, which would it be and why?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>That managing your finances is hard.\u00a0 <a href=\"..\/2009\/08\/finance-is-really-not-that-complicated\/\" target=\"_blank\">It really isn&#8217;t<\/a>, it just takes motivation and some time to get a good game plan down.\u00a0 It&#8217;s funny because it all boils down to a pretty simple rule &#8211; spend less than you make &#8211; but society gives us SOOOOO many chances to screw it up, or go around it somehow, and no one seems to notice until it&#8217;s &#8220;too late&#8221; (and I put that in quotations because I think it&#8217;s never too late to turn your ship around).\u00a0 That&#8217;s the problem to this whole thing &#8211; everyone is doing it!\u00a0 Everyone is buying homes and cars and big fancy electronics when it&#8217;s truly not a good fit in their budget.\u00a0 I&#8217;m all for a lot of those things, but it has to make financial sense and land pretty high on the priority list.\u00a0 There&#8217;s no problem splurging on the stuff that makes you happy, but if you&#8217;re gonna do it, you better cut the things out that land lower on that list of yours or you&#8217;re heavily skewed.\u00a0 The second you overindulge, that entire &#8220;spend less thank you make&#8221; mantra goes out of the window.\u00a0 And credit cards and loans don&#8217;t help w\/ that either (even though I&#8217;m a huge fan of them when used correctly).<\/p>\n<p>So really, I just urge people to PAY ATTENTION more to their finances, and learn what works, and doesn&#8217;t, so you can get back to your life and enjoy the stuff that&#8217;s important without being weighed down so much with the stress.\u00a0 Everyone has a chance of financial freedom, but you gotta take that first step in changing your habits.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What has given you the most satisfaction during your personal finance blogging experience?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I think the overall change in mindset it gave me. That you can really build something from scratch, all by yourself, and turn it into something that literally changes your life in all different kinds of direction.\u00a0 The blogging part itself is pretty fun, but ALLLLLL the stuff that comes out of it is even more so.\u00a0 Like the friendships you make over time, the connections to your readers or other blog friends, and even career-speaking all the new *opportunities* that come up on a regular basis.\u00a0 The blog is kinda that first foot in the door to be able to do a number of other things that may, or may not, interest you down the road.\u00a0 And I think if you&#8217;re open to accepting new opportunities like that here and there, it really opens up the world to you and what&#8217;s possible. I never knew I had that entrepreneurial spirit, and I attribute 100% of that directly to starting the blog :)\u00a0 I don&#8217;t think I could ever go back to a 9-5 anymore knowing what I do now.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>If you had to motivate a person with troubled finances and had only 1 sentence to do it, what would you say?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Take action.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s saving 1 penny a day or working around the clock to cut down your debt, just take that first step to progress and do your best to continue pushing forward.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/evelynishere\/\">EvelynGiggles<\/a> &#8211; haha, GREAT name!)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just wrapped up a pretty cool blogging interview that you&#8217;ll see below, but I wanted to highlight that second Q&amp;A there because I REALLY&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/do-things-when-in-the-mood\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[74,3,166,105],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-20813","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-advice","category-blogging","category-get-motivated","category-money-management"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Do Things When You&#039;re In The Mood! | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/do-things-when-in-the-mood\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Do Things When You&#039;re In The Mood! | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"I just wrapped up a pretty cool blogging interview that you&#8217;ll see below, but I wanted to highlight that second Q&amp;A there because I REALLY...
