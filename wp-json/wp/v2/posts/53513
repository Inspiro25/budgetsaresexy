I have SUCH a great post for you today, and one that I am beyond honored to be able to feature as our friend &#8220;comes out&#8221; here to share his incredible journey with us. If you only read one article today, I hope this one is it. Please pass it on afterwards!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********<\/p>\n<p><strong>My goal is to save one reader\u2019s life out there with this story about drugs, death, and the ten-year prison sentence I survived.<\/strong> My name is Billy B. from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthwelldone.com\/how-to-create-wealth-master-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wealth Well Done<\/a>, and this is how I survived prison and accidentally found my path to wealth.<\/p>\n<p>My nightmare began on a summer-school morning in 2002. \u00a0I was a normal 21-year-old college student who stumbled to class with a drug hangover.<\/p>\n<p>As I walked home, I called a friend who had partied with me the night before. His roommate answered the phone.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead! \u00a0He\u2019s dead!\u201d \u00a0He yelled, \u201cYou have to get out of there now!\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I dropped the phone. I heard his voice yelling at me. \u201cThe police are here and they\u2019re looking for you!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I ran out of my apartment not knowing what to do. The police were already in the hallway looking for me. They stopped me as I tried to walk past them.<\/p>\n<p>I felt their handcuffs slide on my wrists. \u00a0I said in shock, \u201cBut my friend was OK when he left?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a lot of trouble kid,\u201d they said, as they walked me to their squad car. I remember staring out the window as they drove me to jail. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen to good kids like us, but it was happening to me. \u00a0As I walked into my first jail cell, I broke down and cried into my pillow so the other inmates wouldn\u2019t hear me crying.<\/p>\n<h2>Reckless Homicide By Delivery of a Controlled Substance<\/h2>\n<p>My friend walked home and died in his sleep that night. \u00a0The following day I was arrested and charged with, <em>\u201cReckless Homicide By Delivery of a Controlled Substance\u201d<\/em> for the death of my friend.<\/p>\n<p>I sat in jail for a year going through the trial. The police only had to prove that I had provided some of the drugs we used that night, and I had done that. I never meant to harm anyone. We never thought we could die. It was a harsh awakening to what can happen when you choose to make risky, dangerous decisions with your life.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, for my first time in serious trouble, I was sentenced to ten years in prison for what I thought was just \u201cinnocent and fun\u201d partying.<\/p>\n<p><em>[<a href=\"https:\/\/purposepages.com\/2428-2\/going-to-prison-purpose-of-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can read the entire story of that night here, as well as my court case and the entire 10 year journey of getting through prison. Bookmark it for later &#8211; I think you&#8217;ll get something out of it.<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>10 Years of Prison<\/h2>\n<p>The hardest part about being sentenced to prison was figuring out what I was supposed to do next. Was I supposed to wallow in shame and depression for the rest of my life? Or was it OK for me to forgive myself and fight for a second chance?<\/p>\n<p>I struggled with these questions during my first year of incarceration. I eventually decided that it was OK to forgive myself for the mistakes I\u2019d made. It was an accident; I wasn\u2019t a bad person. I decided to take my future into my own hands, and even though I was going to be in prison for the next ten years, I chose to make fighting for my second chance my next mission and purpose in life.<\/p>\n<p>I stayed sane in a prison by falling in love with writing. Writing daily journals allowed me to mentally escape the concrete-blocks and razor-wire-fences surrounding me. Writing set me free to explore the landscapes in my imagination, and the spiritual forces creating my reality. Rather than being defined by the prison I was in, I let my new self-exploration and self-education define who I was becoming.<\/p>\n<p>I started to dream about becoming a great writer. That dream gave me a challenge to work at every day. I kept very detailed notes about the adventures I experienced in prison. My prison journals now total over 3,000 pages. I publish these journals at my other blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/purposepages.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PurposePages.com<b><\/b><\/a>.<b> <\/b>The Purpose Pages tells the story of how I built my character to become the person I am today.<\/p>\n<h2>Recapturing My Freedom<\/h2>\n<p>On August 21st, 2012, I was finally released from the prison that had held me captive for 3,650 days. (There was no good-time or parole offered in the state of Wisconsin so I had to do every day of the ten years) My loving and supportive friends and family picked me up at the front gates and drove me home to Minnesota where I started my new life.<\/p>\n<p>This is a picture of me the morning I was released:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53520\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/billy-b-out-of-jail.jpg\" alt=\"billy b out of jail\" width=\"602\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/billy-b-out-of-jail.jpg 800w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/billy-b-out-of-jail-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/billy-b-out-of-jail-768x474.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My transition back into the free-world felt incredible. But it was scary and challenging at the same time. It felt amazing to do anything I wanted, at any time. Even the simple things like cooking my own meal, at a time I decided, were stunningly beautiful. But I also felt like an alien as I adjusted to a new society I hadn\u2019t interacted with in ten years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I went to prison when I was a 21 year old kid. I was now a 31-year-old man who had forgotten how to do normal things like drive a car, and create an email address. \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The technological advances I encountered were stunning. I hadn\u2019t seen the internet in a decade. \u00a0I had never touched a smart phone. I had no concept of what social media was. I had only heard about these things from new inmates arriving to prison to begin their 5, 10, 30 year, or life, sentences. They\u2019d try to explain what had happened in the free world since I\u2019d left, but the concepts were so foreign that I could never fully understand them.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Back On My Feet<\/h2>\n<p>As I re-entered the free world, I was faced with the challenge of starting my life over as an adult with no job skills, work-history, or network of people to ask for help.<\/p>\n<p>But rather than being discouraged by the skills I didn\u2019t have, I tried to focus on the skills I did have. While in prison, I had learned to communicate and be friends with every race, economic-class, and personality-type you will find in America.<\/p>\n<p>I had grown up in the white, educated suburbs, so I felt comfortable in these privileged environments. But in prison, I had learned to make the street-smart decisions that determined life or death among minority groups. Another one of my strengths: I didn\u2019t have any fear. After all, what\u2019s left to be afraid of once you\u2019ve survived 10 years in prison? Nothing! I was ready to live!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Six days after being released from prison, I returned to college to finish my senior year. <\/strong>I graduated with a 4.0 GPA. But I knew proving my \u201cclassroom intelligence\u201d was the easy part. The hard part was going to prove that I was \u201cstreet smart\u201d enough to will my dreams into existence once I encountered the challenges in the real world.<\/p>\n<p>I got my first job stacking magazines on shelves at big-box retail stores and I made $9.25 an hour. It wasn\u2019t a lot of money, but I was proud that I had just gotten a job. I continued interviewing for better jobs. At one of these interviews, a business-owner offered me some advice that would change my life:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI can give you a job.\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can see you have natural people and sales skills. You also have the ambition and fearlessness to be an entrepreneur. If you\u2019d like, I can teach you how to start your own business. You can work from home and sell my products, and anything else, you\u2019d like.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In prison, I spent my time training my mind to spot opportunities. I instantly saw a cool one. So in 2014, I started my first business. I went door-to-door introducing myself to businesses, and I asked them if they could use my company for their branded apparel needs (t-shirts, jackets, hats, etc). I heard a lot of \u201cNo\u2019s,\u201d but I started to get some, \u201cYes\u2019s\u201d too. By the end of my first year, I was amazed that I\u2019d sold $180,000 worth of product. I was now profitable enough that I could start saving money.<\/p>\n<h2>Accidentally Building Wealth<\/h2>\n<p>I saved every dollar I made in my first two years. I had learned in prison that <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/id-scoop-up-poop-if-it-made-me-happy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">happiness is not dependent on needing a lot of money<\/a>. Happiness is found when you have the time to explore the dreams of your soul, and then executing plans to turn those dreams into your reality.<\/p>\n<p>Money didn\u2019t exist in prison, and I loved not having to worry, or think, about it. But I found very quickly that money mattered in the free world. You needed money to live, or you\u2019d quickly be heading back to prison.<\/p>\n<p>That realization motivated me to save $40,000 in my first two years of freedom. In 2013, I met my wife and we had a wedding in my parent\u2019s living room for under $1K. We bought our first house with the remaining $39K we had so we could start our own life together. We continued to save aggressively because I one day dreamed of returning to a life where money didn\u2019t matter. I wanted to spend my life thinking, studying, writing, and developing my own philosophies on what the meaning and purpose of a great life is just like I had done in prison.<\/p>\n<p>My journey to wealth really happened on accident. I was so focused on building my new life, that I didn\u2019t realize that my saving and investing habits were making me rich along the way. I am still amazed that I have only been out of prison for 5 years and I am worth around a quarter-million dollars with holdings in cash, stocks, and real-estate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The truth is: If I can still fight for my dreams with a smile on my face, after all the crap I\u2019ve been through in life, then anyone can do it if they try hard enough!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is the day we bought our first investment property:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53521\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bill-and-amanda-house.jpg\" alt=\"bill &amp; amanda investment property\" width=\"601\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bill-and-amanda-house.jpg 800w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bill-and-amanda-house-300x194.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/bill-and-amanda-house-768x496.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The Drug Epidemic Is Real<\/h2>\n<p>I recently read a New York Times article stating that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2017\/06\/05\/upshot\/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html?mcubz=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drug-overdose deaths are the highest they\u2019ve ever been<\/a> in America. 1-in-3 American\u2019s have a criminal record. All families have felt the nightmare of drug-abuse and incarceration in some way. I realize I can do something about this. I can help fight against this problem.<\/p>\n<p>The first step I am taking to achieve this goal is to publish my first novel, \u201cSpark\u201d at, Wealth Well Done, and give it away for free for a limited time. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthwelldone.com\/spark-table-contents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can get it here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I wrote \u201cSpark\u201d with the famous young-adult novelist, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gary_Paulsen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gary Paulsen<\/a>. \u00a0(Author of 180+ books, including, \u201cHatchet\u201d which sold millions of copies.) Gary heard about me when I was in prison, and once he read my writing he asked to be my friend and writing mentor. I wrote the novel \u201cSpark\u201d as a practice story for him to teach me how to write better. You can imagine how ecstatic I was the day I got a letter from a famous author in my prison cell, asking me to call him at his home to talk about writing! Even though I was in prison, it was one of the best days of my life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSpark\u201d is the story of a kid in serious trouble. \u00a0He meets a successful businessman who survived his own troubled life in prison. It is a mentoring story about what I would say to my troubled teenage-self if I could meet him today. My dream is to become a great novelist who can inspire people to live more awesome lives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion, please share this story. Together we can save at least one person\u2019s life out there. There is a drug and prison epidemic happening in America right now. We can do something about it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be responding to all comments below. Contact me with questions and ways I can help. The more we talk about overcoming the prisons we all find ourselves in &#8211; whether financial, emotional, or physical prisons &#8211; the better we can make this world.<\/p>\n<p>*******<br \/>\n<em><strong>Billy B.<\/strong> is the blogger behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthwelldone.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WealthWellDone.com<\/a>, and is on a mission to help re-define wealth.
