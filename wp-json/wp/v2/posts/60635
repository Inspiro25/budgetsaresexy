I&#8217;ve been maxing out my retirement accounts every single year for a decade!<\/strong> The backbone of our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-8-garden-gate\/\">net worth<\/a>, and really the habit that started it all for me&#8230; I knew that so long I as I just did this *<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/power-doing-one-financial-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one thing<\/a>* every year, there was no way for our $$$ <em>not<\/em> to grow over time. So I made it <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-1-financial-goal-each-year-max-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my #1 mission<\/a> that no matter what&#8217;s going on in life, I have to complete this and everything else (*IF* there&#8217;s anything else) is extra. This has continually increased our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-4-knock-at-the-door\/\">net worth<\/a> by at least $20,000-$30,000\/year + compounding, depending on whether my wife maxes out her retirement accounts as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. I took advantage of an INSANE 401(k) matching at my previous 9-5.<\/strong> At the time I started learning about finances, the company I was working for offered an unprecedented 100% match on 100% of anything you put in, up to the legal maximum limit of $16,500 at the time. Which meant that if I contributed $16,500 to my 401(k) for the year, my company would match that with *another* $16,500 right there on the spot, and fully vested! As soon as I heard this I jacked my contribution amount to 90% of my paycheck (the most it would let me) and lived off <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/my-1-financial-goal-each-year-max-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$69\/paycheck<\/a> until I reaped every last penny from that perk, haha&#8230; And then did it again the following year until our company eventually phased it out&#8230; (What&#8217;s even crazier? Only like 3 of us even participated in it!!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. I started all this major investing during the financial crisis of 2007\/2008.<\/strong> This was pure luck, and played a huge role over the next decade as we continued picking up stocks on MEGA SALE while the economy rallied throughout. I&#8217;m under no impression that my success was solely based on smarts, haha, outside of realizing I needed to keep fueling the fire!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4. I married my (frugal) wife and then eventually combined finances with her.<\/strong> This not only of course cut back on living expenses, but also added another $20,000 or so to the pot. As well as helped streamline all future management of our finances as our family &#8211; and goals &#8211; began to grow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5. I sold off a dozen or so websites\/projects I had built or purchased over the years.<\/strong> At the peak of my hustling I was running about 10 different websites and having all kinds of income streams coming in as I was trying to build my &#8220;empire.&#8221; After a while though, priorities &#8211; and kids &#8211; helped <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-triad-of-hustling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taper my obsession<\/a>, and I eventually sold off everything except for this blog here that started it all :) Over time this netted us about $250,000, though would later prove troublesome as our cash-flow never fully recovered.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#6. My wife went back to work and turned our family from SIKs to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/from-single-income-kids-to-dual-income-kids\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIKs<\/a>! :)<\/strong> (Single Income with Kids \/\/ Dual Income with Kids) After 6-7 years of being out of the work force and earning her PHD, this was a welcomed change that not only brought our cash-flow back on track, but eventually allowed me to scale back my working even more and become the stay-at-home-daddy-blogger you see today. And now <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/do-you-make-more-than-your-spouse-how-is-it-going-for-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">she&#8217;s the breadwinner<\/a> of our family &#8211; Go Mama!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#7. We&#8217;ve received $30,000 of inheritances and gifts over time.<\/strong> None of which will unfortunately replace our loved ones we&#8217;ve lost, but all gifts very much appreciated and put to use in a way <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/do-you-treat-your-money-differently-depending-on-how-you-get-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we hope honors them<\/a>. One of these amounts was for $20,000 from <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/lost-grandparents-gained-an-inheritance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my dear grandma<\/a> passing, and the other amounts came from various other people and times which we plan on paying forward in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p>And that covers a majority of it!<\/p>\n<p>A lot of other changes went down over the years as well &#8211; such as the *mental* transformations over time (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/living-minimalist-lifestyle-is-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimalism<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-my-kids-save-me-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">becoming a father<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/its-not-about-the-money-its-about-the-lifestyle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">realizing life trumps money!<\/a>) &#8211; but <em>event<\/em>-wise these items above are the biggies. And thankfully overrides <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/resume-of-failures\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all our failures<\/a> from this time period as well! ;)<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, hopefully this puts things in better perspective, and I&#8217;ll have to be better about referencing this more in the future reports we do&#8230; (which you can always find <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>, btw &#8211; all 135 of them!)<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How are you growing YOUR money over there?
