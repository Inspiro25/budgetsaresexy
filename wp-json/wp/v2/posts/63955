Probably the one I\u2019m a biggest fan of is Karsten (aka Big ERN) over at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early Retirement Now<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERN has written multiple blogs over the past 6 years about why emergency funds are crap, and why people should consider having ALL their money invested and working for them instead. I\u2019ve read all the related posts, and love that his research includes both technical simulations as well as psychological reasons to support his points.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll reference ERN\u2019s posts within this article, but here\u2019s a quick summary of reasons why it\u2019s better to hold as little cash as possible:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Opportunity cost.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For every dollar you hold in cash, that\u2019s a dollar that\u2019s not working for you earning better returns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a) In <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most cases<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s financially better to invest your emergency fund (and withdraw the money from your investments when you need it) vs. hold a large cash pile to use if\/when you have an emergency. The math doesn\u2019t work out <\/span><b><i>all<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it works out <\/span><b><i>most<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (like 75%).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b) ERN goes into extreme detail in this 2018 post about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2018\/04\/18\/emergency-fund-in-stocks\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investing your emergency fund in stocks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and again with new data, proving <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2021\/05\/26\/the-emergency-fund-is-still-useless\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the emergency fund is still useless<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> even after last year\u2019s massive recession!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c) Just FYI\u2026 The reason most people still keep emergency funds in cash &#8212; even though they might know it\u2019s mathematically better not to &#8212; is because they sleep better at night that way. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this! Sometimes people are more worried about the small chance of loss, vs. excited about the higher probability of gain. We are all humans and it\u2019s cool to feel this way. But I personally am trying not to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Holding cash leads to behavior biases.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I have definitely fallen into these <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2016\/08\/10\/beat-behavioral-bias-mental-accounting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mental accounting traps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can lead to making bad decisions\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a) Having a big cash pile makes it more tempting to spend. When I wake up every morning and see $30k in my joint checking account, there\u2019s more of a chance I\u2019ll tell my wife we can \u201cafford to\u201d go on a $3k luxury vacation vs. if we held only $1k in our checking account. Making cash less accessible reduces unplanned spending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b) Emergency funds skew our view of risk. People think their entire portfolio is divided into \u201cbuckets\u201d, and that each bucket has a different level of risk. But really we should take into account our <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entire portfolio<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when evaluating risk. For example, I could probably invest my $30k emergency cash into stocks, then with some minor asset shuffling in my brokerage account, achieve the exact same <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overall risk<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I have now, with a higher return. (Or, achieve the same return I am getting now, but with a lower amount of risk). Make sense? Very interesting *and more advanced* <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2016\/07\/27\/emergency-fund-bad-idea-one-chart\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post about that here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c) The longer you hold large amounts of cash, the more emotional attachment you have to it. Remember my <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing-what-to-do-with-a-pile-of-cash\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friend with $200k in her checking account<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? As each day goes on, she gets more and more scared to do something with it. Same with me and my ~$30k emergency fund. I\u2019ve had it in my checking account <\/span><b>for over 15 years!!!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If an emergency does happen and I truly need $30k, I will probably sell some assets to cover the expense, vs. using my emergency cash. Why? Because I can\u2019t fathom the thought of not waking up and seeing my \u201cartificial safety net\u201d there. This bleeds into the next point below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>3. If an emergency happens, and you use your fund, then what?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Following up on what I mentioned above, let\u2019s say I have an emergency and need to spend my $30k emergency cash. What happens next? How do I replenish my fund? Well, I\u2019d either need to a) scramble and save money over the following months to pay back my emergency fund or b) withdraw money from my brokerage account to replenish the $30k in cash I just spent. Both of these scenarios are the same if I held $0 in cash. If an emergency happened I\u2019d either need to a) scramble to save and pay back money to wherever I borrowed it from or b) sell assets to cover it. Same scrabble or selling whether I have cash or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>4. 10 other debunked myths <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about holding emergency cash. ERN has written a 2-part post about these \u201cemergency fund myths\u201d and responded to countless people who disagree with his point of view. These 10 points are so interesting to read!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>a) <a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2016\/09\/07\/debunking-emergency-funds-part1\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debunking emergency funds &#8211; part 1<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>b) <a href=\"https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2016\/09\/14\/debunking-emergency-funds-part2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debunking emergency funds &#8211; part 2<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Accessing money in an emergency\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, let\u2019s suppose I put all my emergency cash into investments and go down to a $0.00 emergency fund\u2026 What happens if disaster strikes? What happens if my car suddenly dies and I need $15k to buy another one? What if a medical emergency rolls around and I\u2019m stuck with a $14k out of pocket bill? What if my wife and I lose our jobs at <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exactly<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the same time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some options for us to pay for things (in no particular order):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Credit cards could cover most immediate expenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (my wife and I have a whopping $107,100 in available credit across 11 open cards). We would never spend that much, but it\u2019s the quickest way to pay for emergencies with 20-50 day interest free payment terms. There are also ways to roll credit over with longer interest free periods we could take advantage of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Borrow money from our <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-big-should-an-emergency-fund-for-a-rental-property-be\/\"><b>Rental Property Emergency Fund<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We have about 20k sitting in cash in our rental property float account. Borrowing from this doesn\u2019t cost us anything. (I\u2019ll delve into later why this account will remain in cash &#8211; I\u2019ve always kept rental property accounts completely separate from personal accounts)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>3. Liquidate stocks to pay for an emergency.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This could be done in a lump sum to pay for a large expense (like $15k for a new car) or done slowly over time to pay living expenses in the case of job loss (eg. withdraw $5k monthly for however long we need to live off it).\u00a0 Obviously this is a last resort option if we happen to experience a disaster *during* a large stock market crash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>4. Securities-based line of credit, aka \u201cmargin account\u201d.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is like a home equity line of credit, but, instead of using a house as collateral for a loan, our brokerage firm (TD Ameritrade) will lend us money using our taxable brokerage account as collateral. The available amount we can borrow is based on our account value and the positions we hold. As of today, TD will lend us up to $123k in cash, payable by WIRE or bank transfer. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tdameritrade.com\/pricing\/margin-and-interest-rates.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">current TD interest rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is 9.5%, so we could borrow $10,000, and pay about $2.60 in interest per day for each day until we pay it off. Not ideal, but certainly not horrible in an emergency situation!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>5. Cover the expense with new earned money:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For a small emergency, like covering a $5k unexpected expense, there\u2019s a chance my wife and I can cover this from our regular paychecks in the course of a month or two. We don\u2019t have a huge savings rate right now as we are just ramping back up into work, but some months we have a larger savings rate (higher than usual income + lower than usual expenses). If a disaster comes in one of those months, we may just be able to cover it without touching investments anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>6. Borrow from friends\/family. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I sound like a jack-ass admitting this, but my wife and I are incredibly blessed with close friends and family in fairly well off positions. There\u2019s potential that we could borrow large chunks of money from them (based on the fact they know we are \u201cgood for it\u201d). I\u2019ve personally lent $25,000 to a friend in the past who was in a tight cash spot, and they paid it back in 60 days. I believe some of my friends today would do the same for me, although this would be a last resort type option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>7. Combo of the above.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Depending on the emergency, we could do a blend or mix of the above methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Downsizing my emergency fund&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, here\u2019s my current situation\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I have about $35k in cash. We are kind of on the Coast FI train, and our savings rate for this year will probably be like 15% or so (some months lower, some months higher due to irregular monthly income). We are still up in the air about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-my-fire-number-keeps-changing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our exact FI number<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it\u2019s safe to say \u201cretirement\u201d will be 7+ years away at our current rate, maybe longer. We are not risk averse, mostly because of our age and lifestyle (no kids yet, don\u2019t own home yet, can happily kick into frugal overdrive to cut back spending if needed, etc)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that being said, I\u2019m 90% convinced that we can drop our $35k emergency cash fund down to ~$10k without having any major cash flow issues. The only reason I don\u2019t feel comfortable dropping down to a $0 cash position (yet) is because of some possible travel plans at the end of this year (planning Aus for Christmas if they open the borders) and also my wife is unpaid for the summer as a teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pending agreement from my wife and an analysis on where to invest the $25k cash, I might actually do this\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Am I crazy?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(ok, now you can answer!)<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For most of my life I\u2019ve had about 6 &#8211; 12 months of living expenses sitting in cash in my checking account.
