Pretty boring stuff. But the real magic is in my <em>money board<\/em>, where I track the current goal of paying something off. $1 usually represents $1k. Each time $1,000 is paid off, a dollar moves from the left side of the board to the right. When the debt is cleared, the money moves back to the left and a new goal is set.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve paid off tens of thousands of dollars this way. The last $27 is on the left because I am paying off my house and will be completely debt free next year!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I asked if it was a *physical* board or some other sort as I&#8217;d love to see a picture of it!, and I was pleasantly pleased with the answer:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, the money board is a bulletin board that hangs on the wall in the office. It\u2019s about 18\u201dx22\u201d. I\u2019ll email you a picture. It\u2019s pretty plain looking\u2026 it\u2019s literally money on a bulletin board! :-)<\/p>\n<p>My husband and I have paid off approximately $249k in debt over the past 13 years using it. Most of that has been mortgage debt&#8230; but that\u2019s still a lot of money! I\u2019ve never added it up before!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>$249,000!!!! In 13 years!!!! By using a simple money board!!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Next email:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Here is a picture of the money board. Pretty fancy, huh? It originally started as a &#8216;dream board&#8217;. Remember when The Secret was something everyone was talking about?<\/p>\n<p>My husband and I put pictures of beaches and mountains on the board because we wanted to take trips. However, we were also trying to pay down debt and I couldn&#8217;t get myself to save for a trip while we had other priorities. So the board became meaningless with all those pretty pictures.<\/p>\n<p>Since our real goal was to have our debts cleared and more financial flexibility, I took down the pictures and put up dollar bills. The rest is history!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And she wasn&#8217;t lying when she said it was simple, haha&#8230;.

It&#8217;s been working miracles for her!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Backstory:<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; My husband and I married after graduating college about 14 years ago, with student loans. We bought a town home about 1 year of being married. We financed the entire purchase (who needs a down payment when there&#8217;s 100% financing available?!?!?!) SMH. We also financed vehicles right after college &#8211; nothing fancy, but my car died right after college and my husband&#8217;s was on his last leg. Overall we were living &#8216;normally&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I&#8217;ve always enjoyed saving money and it bothered me immensely that we had so much debt. I wanted us to have more flexibility with our income. Since raises came (maybe) once a year and they weren&#8217;t all that big, the best way for us to have more money was to pay off the debt.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; When I realized I&#8217;d never go on a nice vacation (neatly captured on my &#8216;dream board&#8217; mentioned earlier) until we paid off most of the debt, I took the fun pictures off the dream board and put up $$$ to represent the debt we were currently paying off. That was about 12 years ago. The money board has been hanging in the office ever since.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;<strong> &#8220;Moving a Dollar&#8221;<\/strong> is a real thing in my house! (My husband laughs at me, but he&#8217;s smart enough to realize I&#8217;m driving this financial bus to somewhere AMAZING and he&#8217;s along for the ride!)<\/p>\n<p>Debt Paid So Far (mine and my husband&#8217;s debt)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student Loans = $48,452<\/li>\n<li>3 Vehicles = $30,152<\/li>\n<li>Braces = $5,400<\/li>\n<li>Mortgages = $165,656<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We currently have about $27k left on the house and then we&#8217;re debt free. (Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve been investing as well. I know this whole <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/debt-vs-savings-trump-card\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pay off a house vs. invest<\/a> can be a touchy subject.) It&#8217;s been a long journey, but it&#8217;s been worth it!<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">How to Make Your Own Money Board:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose a debt to pay off.<\/li>\n<li>Money on the left represents the debt owed. Each dollar represents an amount of debt (I typically had $1 represent $100 or $1,000 of debt).<\/li>\n<li>As the debt is paid, move it to the right.<\/li>\n<li>Realize you are changing your life one dollar at a time and feel a massive amount of personal satisfaction. You did it!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If I could say something to those that are paying off debt&#8230;. Keep it up! There were MANY weeks when I had $30 left in the checking account after paying a little extra on a loan. It sucked. It was tight for a long time, but then things got better. Something was paid off and that gave me more freedom. Then a raise came. Then I picked up a second job. More debt was gone. Then another raise. Then more money was added to the savings account for an emergency fund.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It takes time, but it&#8217;s worth it!<\/strong> If $50 is what you can afford to save or invest, then start there! <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-save-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Just start<\/a>. Then do it again. Again. And again. And again. Give your future self the freedom you want today!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p>BOOM.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Give your future self the freedom you want today!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So good and so true&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Money board or not, you gotta keep testing things out until you find something that clicks&#8230; And Kelly here is proof that it doesn&#8217;t have to be all that complicated!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thank you, Kelly!!<\/p>\n<p>******<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>UPDATE from Kelly on 3\/30\/2020 :)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey J.!!!
