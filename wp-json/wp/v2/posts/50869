Some years are better than others, and it has been getting better over time (for example, now at Christmas we only focus mainly on the *kids*), but I have yet to find that magic bullet that not only pleases the givers (since, after all, they get joy out of it too) but also satisfies my minimalist\/<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2017\/02\/essentialism-book-review-life-changer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">essentialist<\/a> ideals too.<\/p>\n<p>Enter Paul&#8217;s idea, which I&#8217;m beyond excited to try! (He left this in response to my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2017\/03\/net-worth-update-631k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slacking on our kids&#8217; 529 plans<\/a> without even realizing I was in desperate need of a better form of gift giving too :))<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I have relied a lot on my family to help with 529s. I basically just tell them not to ever get me a present because it will be something that I don\u2019t want and will end up sitting in my basement till I get around to donating it one day. Just tell them to give to your kids 529s instead. Strategy has worked so far. My 9 year old has close to 50K, 7 year old close to 40k, 3 year old has about 10 and my new born has less than 1k&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Some people institute a no gift policy to avoid collecting clutter, I simply took it a step further and asked for a specific gift or nothing&#8230; Family tends to be more generous in giving doing this as well.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s so brilliant, isn&#8217;t it? The givers get to give and know it&#8217;s 100% not only what you *want*, but also *need*, and at the same time their grandchildren\/nephews\/nieces\/pals\/whatever they are to you get helped too! And you can still buy them toys as well since the gift was for you technically and not for them ;) <\/p>\n<p>Totally trying this with the next holiday &#8211; will report back!<\/p>\n<h2>Idea #2. Spend something, save something!<\/h2>\n<p>This idea comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/stefanieoconnell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stefanie O&#8217;Connell<\/a> who dropped it on our post the other week about <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2017\/01\/if-you-can-afford-to-spend-it-you-can-afford-to-save-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">being able to save more if you&#8217;re spending everywhere<\/a>. Here&#8217;s her idea:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019m not totally against lifestyle inflation. I think some sensible improvements are reasonable, but it is SUCH a slippery slope. So I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how to find the balance. Somewhat similar to this reader, I\u2019ve toyed with a system of matching any new expenses with additional savings before upgrading. For example, if I\u2019m going to start getting a massage once a month. I won\u2019t consider myself able to \u2018afford it\u2019 until I can build both the cost of the massage <em>and<\/em> match that with an additional contribution to my savings, into my budget. TBD on how this method works out.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>TBD or not, I think that&#8217;s awesome. It gives you full permission to spend and enjoy yourself, while at the same time doing the responsible thing! The more you spend, the more you save, and the less you spend the more you STILL save! (I think I got that right? ;)) I&#8217;ll have to go xfer out $2.60 now which I just spent on this delicious Starbucks coffee I&#8217;m downing, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Idea #3: &#8220;Do I want to clean this thing?&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>I loooooove me some self-reflecting questions whenever you&#8217;re about to buy something. We&#8217;ve covered a lot of them here on the site (I&#8217;ll list them below) but here&#8217;s a new one that I&#8217;ve never heard as yet &#8211; by fellow blogger <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zjthorne.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZJ Thorne<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I\u2019m a big fan of asking myself if I\u2019d like to clean\/maintain the item before purchasing it. So much is not bought this way.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>YES!! And not only with &#8220;stuff&#8221;, but with pets too. Sooooo many people pick them up on a whim without even thinking or realizing the level of responsibility that comes with it &#8211; myself very much included back in the day :( I can&#8217;t even imagine how poorly I treated those poor guys looking back, ugh&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But, a great question to ask yourself for sure. Not only to save some money, but to avoid any stress and clutter down the road the item might bring too! Here are similar questions we&#8217;ve posed over the years too that might help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/06\/would-you-buy-it-again-decluttering-trick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cWould you go out and buy it again?\u201d<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/kick-ass-spending-saving-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0\u201cWould I wear this out of the dressing room right now?&#8221;<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/kick-ass-spending-saving-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;Would you rather have <em>this<\/em>, or straight up cash money?&#8221;<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Idea #4: Separate out your recurring expenses with your variable expenses<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another idea from the same Paul above (how come he doesn&#8217;t have a $$$ blog yet??), which he left on our article on how <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/08\/avoiding-debt-more-important-credit-scores\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">avoiding debt is much more important than your credit score<\/a> (true fact):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Instead of going the credit route, I have thought about opening a second checking account specifically for non recurring and variable expenses (i.e. groceries, amazon, walmart, etc\u2026). That way I could make certain I had enough for recurring bills (i.e. mortgage, phone, internet, etc\u2026). Then if my wife or I went to walmart and got declined because we weren\u2019t paying attention, it would have no effect on the mandatory bills we pay. Also, in the event our card number was stolen it wouldn\u2019t mean our mortgage went into default.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So smart! Most of your necessities would be covered with checking account #1 (recurring) making you feel pretty comfortable, and then whatever&#8217;s left over in account #2 you can do with as you please &#8211; knowing when it&#8217;s gone it&#8217;s gone. It also saves you in the event of a hacking too, as mentioned, which at some point *will* occur of course because people are complete a-holes out there&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Hiding money from yourself is one of my favorite tricks, and one of the only reasons we&#8217;re at <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over $600,000<\/a> these days.\u00a0 They go right into our retirement accounts which are completely separated out and only checked for <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-6-half-a-dozen\/\">net worth reporting<\/a> once a month! No way I&#8217;d be able to look at those #&#8217;s in our checking account and not be tempted to spend any of it, haha&#8230; I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be a personal finance blogger anymore, I can tell you that much ;)<\/p>\n<p>Now hurry up and get your own site up and running, Paul!<\/p>\n<h2>Idea #5: Share your failures at the dinner table<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so this one actually comes from Spanx founder, Sara Blakely, and not someone who reads our site (although you never know?), but it was really good and I thought you&#8217;d like it.<\/p>\n<p>Business insider ran a story on how her dad taught her a bunch of business lessons growing up, and one of the ones that really stuck with her was around failure.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a clip from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/spanx-founder-sara-blakely-redefine-failure-2016-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the article<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>From a young age, Spanx founder Sara Blakely was encouraged to take risks&#8230; Blakely said her dad used to invite her and her brother to share their failures at the dinner table. Instead of being disappointed or upset, he would celebrate their efforts.\u00a0 &#8220;What it did was reframe my definition of failure,&#8221; Blakely said of the tradition. &#8220;Failure for me became not trying, versus the outcome&#8230; I&#8217;m already having that conversation with my 7-year-old. I talk to him all about, &#8216;What have you tried to fail at this week?'&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is so good on so many levels. First, it encourages you to DO STUFF vs thinking about it all the time! Secondly, it helps you get over the fear of failing in itself. And third, it teaches you to take risks and learn before you&#8217;ve got gobs of responsibilities and money to worry about messing up ;) I mean, you&#8217;re just a kid!! And when better to fail and learn &#8211; and then fail all over again &#8211; than when you&#8217;re so young and nubile? No wonder why she&#8217;s so successful these days&#8230; She&#8217;s failed a ton!<\/p>\n<p>(Reminds me of a quote I recently read from Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald&#8217;s &#8211; <em>&#8220;I was an overnight success alright, but 30 years is a long, long night.&#8221;)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Idea #6. &#8220;How much would I pay for this?&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Lastly, here&#8217;s one more question you can ask yourself when you&#8217;re trying to decide whether or not to buy something. This time by Sarah Von Bargen over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yesandyes.org\/2013\/03\/moneyhappysimple-tip-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yes And Yes Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Think about how much you&#8217;d be willing to pay for it <em>before<\/em> you look at the price tag.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is great because it places YOUR value on the item before you actually find out the true value! Or, I guess, the price tag, but still &#8211; same thing if you&#8217;ve agreed to exchange money for it, right?<\/p>\n<p>If you guessed close and it *excites* you, great. At least you know you&#8217;re getting what you feel it&#8217;s worth. If it&#8217;s way out of the ballpark, though, you better stop for a hot second and really be sure it excites you enough. After all, you have to want it <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2014\/04\/kick-ass-spending-saving-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MORE than cash money<\/a>, and that&#8217;s one helluva tall order! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So there it is friends!
