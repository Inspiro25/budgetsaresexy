Impressive!<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;m just getting started on it all as my wife tends to take on the Gift Fairy role in our family, but wanted to chime in with some of our &#8220;rules&#8221; of gift giving over the years, as well as two *new* ones we&#8217;re trying out for the first time this season (and which I&#8217;m nerdily excited about!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how we do gifts in our immediate family:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those who get gifts: kids<\/li>\n<li>Those who don&#8217;t get gifts: spouses. They only get stocking stuffers :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>BOOM &#8211; easy. Not a Grinch enough to hold back on the kids, but the wife and I already love and appreciate everything we have so we mainly just fill each other&#8217;s stockings with niceties to help brighten each other&#8217;s day a bit&#8230; Things like chocolate or books or maybe even a new shirt or gadget, so long as it&#8217;s under $10-$15\/ea. No cheating and slipping in diamonds just because they&#8217;re small!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re onto year #3 of stocking stuffers only, and it&#8217;s been such a relief for both of us. Especially as our two birthdays are around Christmas which means double the shopping adventures! But of course we have rules around that too &#8211; specifically not being able to spend more than $50 on each other, and that the non-birthday spouse is in charge of dinner\/dessert for the family :) It doesn&#8217;t take much to make us happy!! Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now to how we tackle extended family:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those who get gifts: nieces, nephews, parents<\/li>\n<li>Those who don&#8217;t get gifts: uncles, aunts, and now &#8211; siblings! Our first attempt at trying this!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is our <em>first<\/em> new rule of the season, and the one that has the most potential of getting weird because not all us siblings have kids :( So some will be passing out presents to a family without getting any gifts in return, while others are more fairly balanced since you&#8217;re just swapping kids toys to each other. Of course, us parental siblings could enact a caveat that those without kids will then get a gift from us to even it out more out, but then you run into the problem of them feeling bad for not *returning* the favor to us adults, and, well, you might as well just have stuck to the traditional plan in that case&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, we&#8217;re still optimistic it&#8217;ll all pan out okay and everyone seems to be on board, but we&#8217;ll see what happens in practice :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then lastly, here&#8217;s what we do with distant relatives:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those who get gifts: godparents, godchildren, anyone who gives us a gift which of course then means we have to reciprocate whether we want to or not (and thus, why we always have backup gifts in our closet for last-minute exchanges!! We&#8217;re no amateurs here!)<\/li>\n<li>Those who don&#8217;t get gifts: everyone else<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I wish there was a universal button you could click that alerts everyone of your preferences, but until that&#8217;s created we just do the best we can and hope no one gets their feathers ruffled throughout ;) We&#8217;re all about our loved ones, but don&#8217;t think gift giving is the end all be all of showing love! I&#8217;d much rather get something thoughtful throughout the year than on a day when it&#8217;s more &#8220;expected&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>(Funny story on that, actually &#8211; apparently my brother had already bought my Xmas gifts months ago, so he called me up and asked how he should handle it with the new rules in place ;) Asked if he should just randomly surprise me throughout the year or if I would be mad getting them on Christmas, and I told him 100% SURPRISE ME throughout the year as that&#8217;s awesome!! haha&#8230; Who doesn&#8217;t like random gifts?!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, that&#8217;s how we do gift giving in our household&#8230;<\/strong> And just realized I don&#8217;t have &#8220;friends&#8221; listed up there actually &#8211; I guess &#8216;cuz us guys never get gifts for each other? Is that weird?! Trying to think what my wife does with her besties, and don&#8217;t think they swap many gifts either. Outside of a nice holiday card or phone call.<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, I think we&#8217;ll end up spending around $300 on gifts when all is said and done, which is ironically less than we did before even having kids :) Interesting how things change over time&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>One last note before we go here:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/morganhousel\/status\/1205127864624013315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62244\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/gift-card-exchanges-christmas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"608\" height=\"139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/gift-card-exchanges-christmas.jpg 874w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/gift-card-exchanges-christmas-300x69.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/gift-card-exchanges-christmas-768x176.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" \/><\/a>Haha&#8230; just because it&#8217;s tradition doesn&#8217;t mean you have to keep doing it!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What is your budget looking like for this holiday season?
