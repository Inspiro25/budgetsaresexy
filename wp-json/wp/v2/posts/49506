I think you&#8217;ll enjoy this one &#8216;cuz Mark says all the things we wish we could say to our neighbors but don&#8217;t, haha&#8230; And they may or may not apply to ourselves as well :) Take it away, <a href=\"http:\/\/thedeliberatelifestyle.com\/get-a-load-of-this-guy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mark<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<\/p>\n<p><strong>I own a single rental property. My tenants are a middle-aged couple with an adopted son.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before I agreed to let them live in my house, I ran a background check, which included a deep dive into their finances. This has proven to be a fascinating opportunity for me as I was given free rein to snoop into what most of us keep as private information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Upon completion of the <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">snooping<\/span> investigating,\u00a0I learned that my tenants make a $hit-ton of money and were more than qualified to live in my house. On paper.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fast forward twelve months to where we are today. My tenants have not paid rent on time <em>once<\/em> since they\u2019ve moved in. While this is annoying as hell, they currently don\u2019t owe me any money and have been maintenance-free tenants.<\/p>\n<p>This is why I keep them around. I run an operation that consists of one rental and I do all the management myself. I believe I\u2019m better off sticking with these clowns rather than going through the eviction process and rolling the dice with another tenant.<\/p>\n<p>What makes this decision possible for me is that I don\u2019t rely on the rental income to cover any of my expenses \u2013 I\u2019ve got other sources of income for that. So, as long as the payments keep coming in at some point each month, I\u2019ve accepted the tenants for who they are: one of the many Americans who makes bank but somehow still lives paycheck-to-paycheck.<\/p>\n<h2>Where does their money go?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s amusing how much you can learn about a family&#8217;s expenses without really trying. I don\u2019t spend much time at the rental these days \u2013 I occasionally stop by to pick up rent or do a project. But, in these short and infrequent visits I\u2019ve been able to pick up on a good chunk of my tenant&#8217;s regularly occurring expenses. The most glaring is the two gas-guzzling, temperature controlled behemoths sitting in the driveway. You probably refer to them as an SUV and a pick-up truck. Not me though. I\u2019m smart.<\/p>\n<p>So they\u2019ve got these two giant vehicles that have fifteen seats between them and can generate enough torque to haul a space shuttle. I\u2019ve already mentioned that this is a family of three so the fifteen seats are totally justified. But what about the towing capacity?! Surely they have jobs that require it. I\u2019m not a nurse or a hospital tech, but both of these professions require the regular hauling of machines that can travel out of the Earth\u2019s gravitational pull, right?<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the duo $35,000 vehicles that are stationary 75% of the time, I\u2019ve also observed a decorative piece that was added to the exterior of the house upon their occupancy \u2013 a DIRECTV dish. I\u2019ve since learned that the husband\/father\/driver of the pick-up is quite the football fan so it\u2019s imperative that he has DIRECTV\u2019s premium package that includes NFL Sunday Ticket.<\/p>\n<p>The final significant expense that I\u2019ve been able to pick up on is the family\u2019s frequent trips out of town. I know of these trips because they tell me about them:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Mark:<\/strong> Hey Roger. Tomorrow is the 1<sup>st<\/sup> of the month, just a reminder that rent needs to be paid by the end of the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Roger:<\/strong> Oh, shoot \u2013 is it the 1<sup>st<\/sup> already? Obama is always changing the calendar on me. In any case, we\u2019re going to be out of town for a few days so we\u2019ll just pay rent when we get back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong> Yeah, Obama is the worst.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Over the next couple weeks they pay the rent balance, usually in two or three installments because &#8220;payroll screwed up our paycheck&#8221;. So they\u2019ve made it known that money is tight and they rely on their next pay day to cover rent, yet they have no shame in telling me about all these trips that they go on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> of each month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong with this picture?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not one to blindly judge someone else based on where they spend their money. Oh, who am I kidding \u2013 yes I am! But in all seriousness, I, nor anyone else, has the ability to determine what brings someone else value. Maybe the eight-seat, 17 MPG SUV and premium cable package is an expense that was deliberately evaluated by my tenants and thereby determined to bring the necessary value to justify the cost. Maybe.<\/p>\n<p>Being the cynic that I am, my intuition tells me that this isn\u2019t the case. No reasonable person would value inefficient, earth-killing transportation over the security of his\/her family.<\/p>\n<p>This seems like an appropriate segue to my first lesson&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>LESSON #1: For the love of all holy, build and maintain an M-F\u2019ing emergency fund!<\/h2>\n<p>Believe it or not, my tenants are riding a streak of good fortune since they\u2019ve moved into my house. From what I can tell, there have been no medical emergencies in the immediate family, neither of the parents has lost their job, no natural disasters have cast ruin onto their physical possessions, and their landlord is a stand-up dude. Even amidst all this good fortune, they still manage to live on financially unstable terms.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine what would happen if the good fortune ran out? If one of them had to spend time in the hospital? If their boss sobered up and realized their incompetence? $hit would absolutely hit the fan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When times are good \u2013 that\u2019s when one should start saving money for a rainy day.<\/strong> <strong>However, it\u2019s during these good times when we feel invincible. When we feel in control.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, it doesn\u2019t take much to turn those good vibes upside down. While I would never recommend going through life expecting misfortune to greet you at every turn, I strongly recommend preparing for that misfortune. Specifically, we should all take the time to calculate what six-months of living expenses is for us, and either set that aside <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/09\/each-dollar-serves-a-purpose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in a secure but liquid location<\/a>, or halt all extraneous spending until you have that amount saved.<\/p>\n<p>Let me say that again. If you don\u2019t have six months of living expenses saved right now, you need to stop all unnecessary spending. No going out for happy hour. No cable TV. No gym membership. No lattes from Starbucks. No Netflix subscription. By choosing to pay for any of these, you\u2019re telling yourself and the world that you value luxuries more than your security. Grow up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What else is wrong with this picture?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I got to do a background check on my tenants prior to offering them a lease. A big piece of the background check included contacting their employers to determine how much money they each made. They must feel naked every time they\u2019re around me. The things that I know&#8230; :)<\/p>\n<p>Without getting into specifics, they each make good money. So as a household, they make <em>great<\/em> money. And it seems like their expenses should be relatively manageable. They rent a modest-sized home and have one kid. Kind of sounds like a personal finance junkie\u2019s dream couple. So how do they manage to spend all the money they take home?<\/p>\n<h2>LESSON #2: Please, oh please, track your expenses.<\/h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t believe in budgeting. Budgeting is for nerds and communists. Instead, I believe in spending money only on things that bring value into my life. But as the saying goes,&#8221;you can\u2019t see the forest for the trees&#8221;. This is why tracking expenses is so critical \u2013 it allows us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of our expense categories and trends. Tracking expenses doesn\u2019t replace being deliberate at the time of purchase, it simply enables us to evaluate how deliberate we\u2019ve been over long periods of time.<\/p>\n<p>Even though I don\u2019t have a budget on how much I can spend on bars and restaurants each month, when I go back to review my expenses in that category, I\u2019m able to reflect on whether the amount being allocated to that area is consistent with my values.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I make this evaluation not in terms of dollars, but in terms of hours.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s consider an example with a bigger price-tag. If I was in the market for a car, I wouldn\u2019t view the car as costing $22,000; I view it as costing me an additional four years of obligatory employment (or four less years of freedom). <a href=\"http:\/\/thedeliberatelifestyle.com\/how-ill-be-able-to-retire-before-i-turn-35\/\">I know what my annual cost of living is so I thereby know what my retire-forever nest egg goal looks like<\/a>. Thus, I&#8217;m able to determine the yearly setback a $22k purchase would have.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t evaluate what you can\u2019t measure. $22,000 is just an arbitrarily large number unless you know how it relates to the rest of your spending. Or maybe you don\u2019t even consider it a large number. Maybe it\u2019s just a number. Unless you have a baseline, you don\u2019t ever truly feel the effect of spending. And that\u2019s the world that my tenants exist in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>They don\u2019t think twice about how much they\u2019re spending on gas or TV or leisure travel because, quite frankly, they don\u2019t know how much they\u2019re spending.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>They see all expenditures as independent:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can totally afford to put $100 of gas in my driving machine every week; I make $80k a year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;$200 a month for a cable package? Let\u2019s get three! I can afford it.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I can afford it. The most misunderstood phrase in the English language. Not to mention one of the most dangerous. This phrase, specifically the mindset behind the phrase, is the reason why my tenant\u2019s finances are such a $hit-show.<\/p>\n<p>The numbers speak for themselves. Their take home pay is roughly three times what I charge for rent, yet when the first of the month comes around, they don\u2019t have the money to cover it. Still, the SUV stays filled with gas and TV spews premium channels. Do they genuinely value the cars and the cable more than the roof over their heads? I doubt it. I believe they simply don\u2019t have a firm grasp on where their money goes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One of the most frustrating parts about the late rent is the stories that come along with it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The common theme behind these stories is that <em>someone<\/em> or <em>something else<\/em> is to blame for their current lack of funds.<\/p>\n<p>I consider myself a reasonable dude. I\u2019ve already explained that I don\u2019t rely on the monthly rent check to cover my expenses (yet) so I\u2019m okay with being lenient on when I get paid. I wish that just once my tenants wouldn\u2019t cook up a story to justify why they don\u2019t have the rent. Just once I want them to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sorry, Mark. We have the financial discipline of a Kardashian. We\u2019re not totally sure where all our money has gone, but we\u2019ve definitely spent it. Like all of it. We\u2019ll take paying rent seriously for the next few weeks and we\u2019ll get you the money before the end of the month. Thanks for being so understanding. And charming.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A boy can dream.<\/p>\n<h2>LESSON #3: Take control of your F\u2019ing finances. Do it!<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s get the exceptions out of the way upfront:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical emergency<\/li>\n<li>Natural disaster<\/li>\n<li>Tyrannical government comes to power<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The above items are situations in which we lose control over where we spend our money. I\u2019m not sure if the list is comprehensive, but it\u2019s pretty damn close. So, unless you can claim one of the above situations, where you spend your money is 100% up to you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We need to take ownership of this fact. We need to embrace it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So many of us are stuck in a paradigm that suggests certain expenses are required because these expenses have become the norm. We need to get away from that ideal; it\u2019s self-crippling. We need to stop operating under the belief that we only gain true control of our finances once the &#8220;default expenses&#8221; are accounted for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mortgage\/rent<\/li>\n<li>Car payments and maintenance<\/li>\n<li>Food and drink expenses<\/li>\n<li>Gym membership<\/li>\n<li>TV package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>These things are not required. There is no such thing as &#8220;default expenses&#8221;.<\/strong> Sure, we all need shelter and food and water (and Netflix), but we ultimately get to decide how much and how often we want to pay for these things.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some excuses that I can imagine immediately coming the mind&#8217;s of readers:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I live in Manhattan. I don\u2019t have the option to spend less on a condo or apartment.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Get roommates. Or move somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I need a car to get to work.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Buy (or trade-in for) a used, fuel efficient car. And start carpooling with your co-workers. If you live in a urban area, evaluate public transportation options. Better yet, ride a bicycle.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Eating and drinking is necessary for survival.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Going out to bars and restaurants isn\u2019t necessary for $hit. Neither is Whole Foods. Your local Jewel\/HyVee\/Target\/Walmart is stocked with tons of nutritious, affordable food. And you don\u2019t need to be drinking anything other than water.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Exercising is good for me.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Agreed. But you don\u2019t need to pay a membership fee to exercise.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I\u2019ll miss a lot of Chicago Cubs games if I don\u2019t pay for cable.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Finally a reasonable excuse. :D<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We\u2019re all in different financial situations. We make different amounts of money. We value different things as consumers. It would be silly to think that we are obligated or required to spend money in a way that doesn\u2019t promote our greatest quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to challenge my tenants to take ownership over their expenses. If they truly value the place where they live over their toys, they need to modify their spending to reflect that.<\/p>\n<h2>Make your finances simple again<\/h2>\n<p>Personal finance has a bad reputation. It\u2019s caused sleepless nights, accelerated hair loss, contributed to weight gain, and ended marriages. Allegedly.<\/p>\n<p>Just as I believe there is no such thing as a bad dog, only bad dog owners; I don&#8217;t believe that personal finances deserve the bad reputation, the person behind those finances does.<\/p>\n<p>We all have the ability to take something that is portrayed as fundamentally complicated in advertisements and the media, and make it simple.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1. Build an emergency fund<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having a six-month emergency fund will provide you with a sense of security and confidence. As a wise man once told me, &#8220;$hit happens&#8221;. Your emergency fund will allow you to treat this $hit as the road-bump that it is instead of the catastrophe that it could have been.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2. Track your spending<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Review your expenses at the end of each week. If you find that a certain category is taking more money than the value its providing in return, make an adjustment. If you do this honestly, you&#8217;ll find yourself living far below your means in no time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. Take control<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Remind yourself that you are in total control of your finances. If in reviewing your finances you find a trend that you&#8217;re not happy with, explore options to correct it. Sometimes significant changes like moving, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/selling-our-car-online-are-people-even-buying-cars-right-now\/\" >selling your car<\/a>, or canceling your wine-of-the-month subscription are required.<\/p>\n<p>These lessons, while inspired by my tenants, are applicable to the vast majority of the middle class. If thoughtfully applied, you&#8217;ll find yourself enjoying a higher quality of life in which you&#8217;re able to focus on what truly matters to you.<\/p>\n<p>*******<br \/>\n<em>Mark McQuiston writes at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedeliberatelifestyle.com\/\">The Deliberate Lifestyle<\/a>, a blog that focuses on crushing social and financial norms on the way to early retirement.
