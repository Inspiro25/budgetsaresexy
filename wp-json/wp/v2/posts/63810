And they\u2019ve just announced it\u2019s happening again, and for FREE again!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63843 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Rebel_finance_banner_png_B5Uhzs_3-e1617973880193.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 10 Zoom calls over 10 weeks, starting April 26. Each week covers a different area of personal finance and FIRE.

Woohoo!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After many months on the market and a couple contracts falling through, we finally closed on the sale of a rental. This is part of our long term plans to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/why-im-transitioning-away-from-rental-properties\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce our physical real estate footprint<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and move to more passive investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The house we just sold wasn\u2019t initially part of our public net worth tracking (and we still have a few properties in partnership that we keep separate from these net worth reports), but now that it\u2019s sold, we\u2019re moving the proceeds over to index funds. So, you\u2019ll notice a much larger bump than usual in this <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-report-8-garden-gate\/\">net worth report<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our proceeds from the property sale were about $35k, which has already been dumped into index funds in our regular brokerage account. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, let\u2019s get to the net worth update&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Net Worth as of April 1, 2021: $620,147<\/b><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b> (+$55,417)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the account summary, and we\u2019ll get into the breakdowns afterwards:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63841 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/April_1_Net_Worth_Joel_png_vJh2kreI-e1617973856695.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"394\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whoa! &#x1f633;What a massive jump. Even without the $35k addition from property sale proceeds, that\u2019s still a huge $20,000 gain for the month. While much of this was investment growth, my wife and I had a bigger than usual earning month in March, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Hustles, Windfalls, and Fun Stuff in March<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some fun things that happened last month &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; A couple weeks ago I spotted a garage sale a few blocks from my house. It wasn\u2019t the greatest sale, mostly crappy old items. But on the way out I spotted a small jewelry case and in it was an Elgin pocket watch made in 1903, with a 14k gold hunter case. I bought it for $45, and stuck it on eBay that afternoon. The lucky new owner paid $132 for it, so I got about a $70 profit after fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63842 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Pocket_watch_jpeg_9Z9owdvT-scaled-e1617973869855.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She\u2019s a beauty, right!?\u00a0 I wish I could keep it, but I\u2019ve got too much crap lying around my house already haha!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; About 10 years ago my wife and I did some amateur modeling for ad campaigns. Nothing high fashion or anything &#8212; we are just a regular-looking couple!\u00a0 Anyway, an old friend called a few weeks ago with a short gig for some internal company ad campaign (photos will never be seen in public) and they paid us $400 for about 1 hour of work! Woohoo!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; My awesome employer gave me a bunch more contract work during the month of March, which I was happy to take! All extra earnings went right to my 401(k) account as I\u2019m doing 100% contributions right now, before my benefits change in April.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; We received $2,800 in stimulus checks, thanks to the United States of money printing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Lastly, I finished selling a bunch of my friend\u2019s storage locker stuff and made $419 after fees. Yeehaw, I love selling stuff for $$$$!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Big Expenses and Spending in March<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Our 10-day <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/11-20-to-fly-to-hawaii-and-other-vacation-hacks\/\">Hawaii vacation<\/a> got a little expensive but was well worth every cent! We caught up with 21 friends over 10 days, spared no expense on dinners, BBQs, and did a LOT of drinking :). Stay tuned for a longer write up on all our Hawaii trip expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Apart from travel, we had a higher than usual month of gift expenses. About $400 on some big milestone birthdays for family and friends!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Detailed Asset Breakdown<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>CASH Accounts: $27,660<\/b><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b> (+$1,722)<\/b><\/span><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After the sale of the rental and stimulus check, etc., we dumped a bunch of cash into our after-tax brokerage account.
