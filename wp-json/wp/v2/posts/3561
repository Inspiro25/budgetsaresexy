But even more so were the comments of this anonymous guy  telling me what it&#8217;s like to live in a mansion. I wanted to share it with  you because a) it shows just how expensive home ownership can be, esp as  you upgrade higher and higher! and b) it&#8217;s just kinda fascinating. At  least if you&#8217;re anything like me :)\u00a0 You&#8217;ll have to excuse the  organization of it though since I had to mash-up all the comments to  make it as coherent as possible.

It is one of 3 true old money\/old neighborhoods in our beloved state with the best schools and some famous denizens including your congressman, the owner of a pro team in the area, and other illustrious, &#8220;old money&#8221; folk. I&#8217;m definitely an abnormality who managed to make money in the stock market while in school.<\/p>\n<p>I  pay roughly $2,200 in mortgage (30 year at 4.75%) after having 500k+ in  equity ($1.2 million equity at bubble), then $1,024 per month in taxes  and $1,000+ in maintenance. I also pay in an extra $2,000 plus to keep PITI at 5k and it can hurt. (That&#8217;s a total payment of $6,200 a month)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The problem with having an expensive house in a mature\/wealthy community is that things are expensive. <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem with plumbing, gotta bust through very expensive marble that you order from Italy.<\/li>\n<li>Problem with AC, got to put something high end to match the  house for later buyers. (we&#8217;re talking $18k+)<\/li>\n<li>Need a window, well too bad it&#8217;s a custom sized  high end Anderson at $1900.<\/li>\n<li>Need a roof, well a big\/steep roof runs $25k.<\/li>\n<li>Got marble, natural stone, granite, ceramic, different grouts&#8211;well  you need different cleansers and sealants that run as high as $90 per gallon.<\/li>\n<li>Got neighbors with exquisite yards&#8211;yours needs to be too unless you want to be the douchebag in the neighborhood. And weed treatment\/overseeding\/airration isn&#8217;t cheap if you buy your 30 bags of Scotts a year at Costco.<\/li>\n<li>Have exotic plants, well good luck pruning exotics that cost $4000 each, especially since there is no book or internet information. You might need to call up the one person that specializes in pruning the at $120 an hour.<\/li>\n<li>Need anything new: can&#8217;t put the McMansion builder&#8217;s grade crap next to customized stuff.<\/li>\n<li>Oh and we have a Homeowner&#8217;s association because I live in a fancy gated community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Even though my DI (Debt to Income) ratio is roughly 20%, it&#8217;s still a stress! <\/strong> Given the overall costs of transactions, though, I don&#8217;t think it is worth it to sell as I can afford it just fine, have some money in the bank and just enjoy living here. The DCF (Discounted Cash flow Models) are becoming more difficult to justify as I contemplate spending $18k to replace an AC system, but overall they still work IMO and I actually like the house and my lawn that I tend. Or &#8220;my little box.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m not wealthy and feel outclassed by the women driving Cayanne turbos in my neighborhood.<\/strong> Income is roughly $220k per year, but increases come steadily. I might actually be taking a substantial pay cut just to ease the stress, and the added income seems to go to taxes and makes it impossible for me to contribute to an IRA anyways.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, I am not a snob. I bought a 1,000k Volvo last summer. But it failed inspection so I bought something for 8,000k in cash. I dress cheaply, and have inexpensive furniture. On the other hand, I&#8217;ve bought several $1,000 bottles of wine that I remember and appreciate, but think: &#8220;if only I bought XYZ stock when I felt they were a strong buy.&#8221; I&#8217;ve also pushed all-in several times with 3\/4 suited. Go figure. <em>(Editor&#8217;s note: I&#8217;ve done this too!\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s the whole &#8220;adventure&#8221; part of it that&#8217;s so damn appealing)<\/em> I still have student loans (small, but helps with taxes) and struggle to gain control of my budget so I find your blog inspirational and helpful, especially with a baby on the way and thoughts of starting a company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Being in control of your money is a greater boon than having a pretty good income. <\/strong>I often roll my eyes when I listen to <a href=\"http:\/\/simplyspent.files.wordpress.com\/2010\/03\/dave-ramseys-plasectomy.jpg\">D. Ramsey<\/a>, but heh, following grandmas advice is a more successful approach than 95% of the other schemes and 95% of the population. So I&#8217;m learning not to quibble over the exceptions if he&#8217;s neglecting stochastic models and various valuation methods.<\/p>\n<p>And yes, I was an actual investment banker and not an employee of an investment bank. It sucked.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/andycastro\/\">andy castro<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[Back in February I wrote about how our house cost us $24,000 in mortgage interest &amp; taxes alone last year.\u00a0 It was pretty eye-opening!
