So I&#8217;ve been trying to get y&#8217;all a personal review of <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\"><strong>Empower<\/strong><\/a> (formerly Personal Capital) for ages &#8216;cuz they&#8217;re bad ass, but after finding out one of my friends lives and breathes by them almost daily, I thought you&#8217;d get a much better picture of how awesome they are from him so I asked him to write this Empower review.<\/em> <em>And considering he recently <a href=\"http:\/\/rootofgood.com\/early-retirement-at-33-an-overview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retired early at the ripe age of 33<\/a>, he&#8217;s obviously doing something right ;) <\/em><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><em>Please welcome today, Justin <em>from RootofGood.com<\/em>!

I run big chunks of my life using spreadsheets. I have an expense tracking spreadsheet, a net worth spreadsheet, and a portfolio analyzer spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<p>They all do exactly what I want, but it takes a lot of time to keep them updated. My spreadsheets aren&#8217;t particularly attractive, either. And if there&#8217;s one thing the readers of this blog deserve, it is sexy financial management tools.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Enter Empower.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>(formerly Personal Capital)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I stumbled into this amazing tool over a year ago and I find myself using it almost every day. You see, I have a bizarre obsession with optimizing all of the financial aspects of my life from spending to asset allocation. That&#8217;s how I landed a spot near the top of J Money&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/rockstarfinance.com\/blogger-net-worths\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blogger Net Worth rankings<\/a> at Rockstar Finance. Financial nerdcraft pays well as long as you have the right tools.<\/p>\n<h2>Free Financial Management Software<\/h2>\n<p>As soon as you log into <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Empower.com<\/a>, you get an instant view of your net worth for the last 90 days and your monthly income and expenses on the Dashboard. \u00a0It&#8217;s like having a CFO for your personal finances. \u00a0Except this CFO doesn&#8217;t expect a seven figure salary with stock options &#8211; <em><strong>it&#8217;s free!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42989\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-dashboard.png\" alt=\"personal capital dashboard\" width=\"536\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-dashboard.png 536w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-dashboard-261x300.png 261w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I grabbed a few screenshots from my own Empower account to show exactly what you get. \u00a0I can see my net worth is tantalizingly close to $1.5 million and has climbed steadily the last month. \u00a0My income for the last month was around $8,000 and my spending was only $1,054. \u00a0Don&#8217;t worry, some months those figures are reversed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Dashboard keys me in to the large scale picture of where I&#8217;m at in recent history.<\/strong> \u00a0Do I have a spending problem? \u00a0Do I have an income problem? \u00a0I like this high level summary because it makes it hard to ignore wasteful spending. \u00a0The bottom line spending figure is\u00a0right there in front of you every time you log in.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like the\u00a0annoying Post-It note you leave on the fridge door reminding you to eat healthy. \u00a0The little orange and red spending circle clues you in to just how awesome (or horrible) your spending has been lately. \u00a0It&#8217;s all automated and doesn&#8217;t require any configuration or tweaking. \u00a0You simply log in and it&#8217;s there. \u00a0Staring at you like a beacon of truth.<\/p>\n<h2>Track Your Net Worth<\/h2>\n<p>The Net Worth screen shows a graph of net worth for any time period you choose.<strong> \u00a0<\/strong>All of your investment accounts, retirement accounts, savings and checking accounts, real estate and loans are automatically added together.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42991\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-net-worth.gif\" alt=\"personal capital net worth\" width=\"600\" height=\"279\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re saving and investing like you should be,\u00a0the net worth graph shows\u00a0a line that rises toward the top right of the screen over time. \u00a0It reinforces your good behavior.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, if you spend more than you make or deploy your assets in unproductive investments, you&#8217;ll see the net worth flat line or slope downward to the bottom right of the screen. \u00a0That is totally un-sexy and you need to stay motivated to rectify that mess.<\/p>\n<p>Even though I&#8217;m an early retired dude, I stay pretty busy. \u00a0But I like to keep an eye on what we are spending (so I can stay an early retired dude!).<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Expense Tracking<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42992\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-expenses.png\" alt=\"personal capital expenses\" width=\"530\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-expenses.png 530w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-expenses-300x211.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>The expense tracking screen tells the narrative of my\u00a0recent expenditures. <\/strong>\u00a0The top three expenses are groceries, travel, and gas. \u00a0Although sometimes it feels\u00a0like it should be groceries, groceries, and groceries! \u00a0Most days I&#8217;ll take\u00a0a quick look at the expense tracking screen to see how we are doing in different categories and whether our spending is abnormally high in any area.<\/p>\n<p>From my recent spending, I noticed restaurant spending doesn&#8217;t even show up in this list which is good for our waste lines and wallet. \u00a0However the grocery expenses make up for dining out over the past month. \u00a0I&#8217;m all about trading one type of expense for another type that brings us more value. \u00a0In this case, it&#8217;s\u00a0buying gourmet food at the grocery store instead of dining out.<\/p>\n<p>By using a data driven approach to direct spending to the areas that bring us the most value, we get to live a more luxurious life without paying full price. \u00a0It&#8217;s almost hard to call that frugality, but that&#8217;s exactly what it is.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Income Tracking<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-42993 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-income.jpg\" alt=\"personal capital income\" width=\"600\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-income.jpg 600w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-income-300x126.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Take a look at that income display!<\/strong> \u00a0I have the awesome problem of multiple revenue streams complicating\u00a0my monthly cash flow. \u00a0The mix of income over the last month includes my wife&#8217;s paycheck, repayment of some personal loans, some revenue from my blog, and various interest and dividend payments from the investment portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>With a quick click I can drill down to see the exact dividends paid on each investment and\u00a0the exact amount of each loan payment or paycheck. \u00a0This comes in really handy when I want to figure out how much income of a certain type I have received in the past year so I can forecast that into the next year. \u00a0Embrace the power of data!<\/p>\n<p>The cash flow tools show the income and expenses for each week on the right hand side of the screen. There&#8217;s no better way to get a quick overview of whether you&#8217;re making more than you&#8217;re spending.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Making Investment Management Cool<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of\u00a0good Mexican food, hard hitting electronica music, and proper asset allocation. \u00a0The first two make me cool while the latter makes me wealthy without taking on too much risk.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42994\"

100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>The asset allocation screen is a look under the hood of your portfolio.<\/strong> \u00a0Your investments require a tune up from time to time, and this is the tool for it. \u00a0The portfolio module in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Empower<\/a> queries all of your accounts and combines all\u00a0stock, bond, mutual fund, and ETF holdings into one clean summary.<\/p>\n<p>In my case, I&#8217;m holding roughly equal amounts of US and International stocks with smaller allocations to Alternatives, US Bonds, and Cash. \u00a0Just like it should be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For those investors that want to concentrate their money in particular stock sectors, there&#8217;s a tool for that too.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42995\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/personal-capital-sectors.jpg\" alt=\"personal capital sectors\" width=\"600\" height=\"282\"

600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>My top three sectors are Financial Services, Industrials, and Technology.<\/strong> \u00a0I don&#8217;t have any sector weightings in my own personal asset allocation, so I don&#8217;t really use this tool. \u00a0But it&#8217;s good to see what I already own if I get an urge to buy a sector fund based on an expectation that one sector will outperform another sector.<\/p>\n<p>I already have 10% of my stocks in the Healthcare sector, for example, simply by owning broad market index funds. \u00a0Unless I have a really strong crystal ball telling me the Healthcare sector is about to outperform, I can rest assured that I&#8217;ll see\u00a0decent investment returns with that 10% allocation to the healthcare sector already in\u00a0my portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, I love spreadsheets. \u00a0I actually have an asset allocation spreadsheet where I analyze what I own and what I need to buy and sell to get me back to my desired asset allocation. \u00a0I copy my aggregated portfolio holdings data from Empower and paste it into my custom spreadsheet. \u00a0This saves me ten or fifteen minutes of logging into multiple brokerage firms and retirement account administrator sites to copy\/paste current holding data into my awesome asset allocation spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<h2>Asset Allocation Tool<\/h2>\n<p>Those investors that don&#8217;t bask in their own\u00a0financial nerddom like me can get an easy asset allocation tool in <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" target=\"_blank\"

frontier from\u00a0modern portfolio theory. \u00a0In a nutshell, the target allocations are keyed to maximize expected return based on a given level of risk. \u00a0In general terms, if you can handle more risk, then your target asset allocation will have more stocks and a higher expected return.<\/p>\n<p>The chart tells me I&#8217;m in roughly the right asset classes except for US and International stocks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42998\"

\u00a0Proper asset allocation will only get you half way to the goal of proper investment management. \u00a0Focusing on investment fees is also critically important. \u00a0And there&#8217;s a (free) tool for that too.<\/p>\n<h2>Investment Fee Tool<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full

but there&#8217;s always room for improvement. \u00a0The funds with the most expensive management fees are listed first right underneath this graph. \u00a0Those funds make the best candidates for cost cutting when making your portfolio more cost-effective.<\/p>\n<p>The graph also proves how important mutual fund fees are over the long term. \u00a0Even with\u00a0modest fees of 0.17% per year, I&#8217;ll still lose <em><strong>$110,000<\/strong><\/em> over the next 20 years. \u00a0Maybe you&#8217;re much wealthier than me, but that&#8217;s a freaking ton of money.<\/p>\n<h2>Empower is Simple, Safe, and Free<\/h2>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">sign up for Empower<\/a> and link all of my accounts. We have over 20 accounts spread across eight or nine\u00a0brokerage firms, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-covid-is-changing-americans-retirement-plans\/\">retirement plans<\/a>, credit unions, and banks.<\/p>\n<p>It took about 20 minutes to link all of those accounts and add a few credit cards and other assets and liabilities like my house and some loans. \u00a0I was expecting serious compatibility issues due to the number of accounts I linked\u00a0however all the accounts synced up seamlessly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Empower logs into all my accounts so I don&#8217;t have to visit each site one at a time. <\/strong>They even link your home equity to the valuations provided by Zillow. \u00a0Or you can choose a value yourself if you don&#8217;t trust Zillow.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Editor&#8217;s Note: I am someone who doesn&#8217;t trust Zillow &#8211; those prices go all over the place! I prefer having a realtor pull comps and give me a much better estimate, though it&#8217;s harder to track over time unless you want to annoy the piss out of them ;)]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t used Mint for a long time, but\u00a0the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/personal-capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Empower tools<\/a> do roughly the same thing on the expense tracking side but outperform on the investment side.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>It&#8217;s like Mint on steroids, but with better portfolio management tools.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I still maintain a small fleet of\u00a0spreadsheets but this is a great tool to see everything in one place and enjoy the beautiful graphics showing financial changes over time. \u00a0My spreadsheets only get updated about once a quarter so I can&#8217;t rely on them for real time insights into my spending, income, net worth and investments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>To remain somewhat impartial, there are a few downsides to Empower.<\/strong> \u00a0You&#8217;ll still have to look through your spending transactions to verify that they are categorized correctly, but the system gets it mostly right except for places\u00a0like Walmart where you might buy clothing, groceries, and automotive supplies. \u00a0There also isn&#8217;t a great way to enter cash transactions\u00a0beyond categorizing ATM withdrawals.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Editor&#8217;s Note: If you have a lot of money, they&#8217;ll also have one of their financial advisers call you every now and then. If you like that sorta stuff, then ignore this comment, but if you don&#8217;t (like me) make sure to tell them on the phone that you&#8217;re all good and prefer managing your money your own way behind a computer. You can try ignoring their calls if you want, but it doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; believe me ;) Suck it up once and just let them know you&#8217;re good unless you aren&#8217;t and prefer their help (which I&#8217;m sure is helpful!)]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In spite of those minor quibbles, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investmentzen.com\/robo-advisors\/personal-capital\">Empower<\/a> is still an incredibly useful tool to add to your personal finance arsenal. \u00a0It&#8217;s all web based so you can check out your data wherever you are. \u00a0Their iPhone and android apps are sleek and beautiful too, and they&#8217;ll also shoot you a weekly email letting you know how your money is doing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Imagine having all of your expenses, income and investing data all in one place.<\/strong> \u00a0You can quickly pull up how much you spent on entertainment last month (or last year!) or figure out your top dividend paying investment. \u00a0They even have options to tag transactions to help you sort out your deductible expenses\u00a0at tax time.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a great app that can revamp how you run your financial life and doesn&#8217;t require a big time investment up front to get you going.
