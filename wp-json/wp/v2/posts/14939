And also something we&#8217;ve been blogging about a lot here on Budgets Are Sexy ;)\u00a0 As evidence on my latest obsession with <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/financial-minimalism\/\">slimming down my lifestyle<\/a>, while at the same time getting my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">side hustles<\/a> on too! But we&#8217;ve been talking a lot about that lately.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we focus on being frugal. Or &#8220;cheap&#8221; as some people prefer to call it (I&#8217;ll ask for your opinion on it in a sec, don&#8217;t worry!).\u00a0 <strong>Here are your 5 questions for Friday &#8212; remember to answer them as honestly as possible!<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 being extreme), how frugal are you?<\/li>\n<li>Do you ever get <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/09\/so-what-if-people-make-fun-of-our\/\">made fun of for it<\/a>?\u00a0 Do you care?<\/li>\n<li>Do you wish you were more or less frugal?<\/li>\n<li>When was the last time you did something considered frugal?<\/li>\n<li>What&#8217;s your opinion on being &#8220;frugal&#8221; vs. &#8220;cheap&#8221;?\u00a0 IS there a difference?<\/li>\n<li>*EXTRA CREDIT* If you could share 1 frugal tip with us today, what would it be?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You ready to take them one?\u00a0 Should be really interesting to see, I think.\u00a0 Love getting to know you all more! :)\u00a0 I&#8217;ll go first, as always:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>SCALE:<\/strong>\u00a0 Hmm&#8230; I would venture to say I&#8217;m somewhere in the 6-7 range.\u00a0 I def. have my moments where I&#8217;m constantly thinking of ways to save money (specifically when it comes to buying clothes and stuff online (Yeah <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/amazon\">Amazon<\/a>!)), but I also buy things w\/out even looking at the price tag sometimes.\u00a0 Those things that I value quality over price on &#8211; say, with food or things that are important to running my biz and stuff like that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MADE FUN OF?<\/strong>\u00a0 Sometimes :)\u00a0 But more back in the day than I do now cuz the only people I really interact with now are my close friends and family, and then of course you guys. If we time traveled back to 6th grade or any time leading up to that year, I&#8217;d say I was made fun of 99% of the time.\u00a0 Stupid bullies!<\/li>\n<li><strong>WISH:<\/strong> You know, I did wish I was better at it when starting this blog <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/02\/interview-me-on-me_12\/\">3 and 1\/2 years ago<\/a>, but now I&#8217;m totally content w\/ the way I spend my\u00a0 money and my rationalization behind it.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t want to be extreme in my frugality or saving money &#8211; I enjoy the\u00a0 mental escape of shopping when I do it.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong w\/ always being &#8220;on&#8221; all the time, but for me &#8211; I want to be good *most of the time*. Not EVERY time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>LAST TIME:<\/strong> Hmm&#8230; these are tough! Haha&#8230; I guess the last time I was frugal (for good measure!) was when I changed my last night at the Marriott this weekend to the La Quinta Inn instead.\u00a0 Our $85 rate for the conference only extended 3 nights, so when I wanted to stay one more I had to cough up $200 instead.\u00a0 NO WAY!!!\u00a0 I just Expedia&#8217;d for the next closest hotel, and best rates, and ended up catching that one for around $70 I think after tax and fees and all that.\u00a0 I knew I&#8217;d be hanging w\/ my friends till it was time for bed anyways, so I could &#8220;slum it up&#8221; for one night, haha&#8230;\u00a0 actually it was a fine place to stay, just not *as* sexy as the Marriott of course ;)\u00a0 I don&#8217;t even know if this qualifies as being frugal, over being SMART though?<\/li>\n<li><strong>FRUGAL VS. CHEAP:\u00a0<\/strong> These are always tough ones for me cuz I never really have an opinion either way.\u00a0 I feel like I just &#8220;know it when I see it&#8221; if that makes sense.\u00a0 Kinda like porn :)\u00a0 A naked body being painted with oils to reflect the 17th century or something is totally fine by me.\u00a0 But a naked girl bend over doing&#8230;. well, you know what, probably shouldn&#8217;t be painted and hung over my mantle anytime soon.\u00a0 That&#8217;s how I feel about being frugal over cheap.\u00a0 Saving money at a hotel, or on food or clothes or whatever to me is being frugal as well as smart. Not eating at all or sleeping in a car I think I&#8217;d consider being more cheap?\u00a0 In both cases though, I don&#8217;t think have a problem with it.\u00a0 Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to save money ;)\u00a0 Though you should def. keep eating, that&#8217;s kinda important.<\/li>\n<li><strong>*EXTRA*<\/strong> A frugal tip.\u00a0 Hmm&#8230;\u00a0 I usually default to my normal &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/04\/keep-your-wallet-from-a-hangover\/\">beer tip<\/a>&#8221; &#8211; which is drinking at home first before going out to the bars or clubs\/etc.\u00a0 I still always have a beer or two while out and about cuz I freakin&#8217; LOVE the atmosphere (!!!), but rarely do I START drinking there.\u00a0 When you have a good group of friends hanging with you, it&#8217;s always fun anyways doing a little pre-partying action at someone&#8217;s place or hotel.\u00a0 Along w\/ some fun card games ;) (Every time you mention &#8220;budget&#8221; take a shot!)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Your turn!\u00a0 Whatcha got for us?<\/strong>\u00a0 Regardless of your answers, just now that *ANY* of these are perfectly fine if that&#8217;s what works for YOU.\u00a0 We&#8217;re not trying to crack the secret frugality code here or anything. We just wanna hear some good ideas and reasons for acting the way we do :)\u00a0 At the end of the day, you&#8217;re the only one who cares about your money, so spend it (or don&#8217;t spend it) however it is you want!
