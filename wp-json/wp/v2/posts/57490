Wonderful things are happening this year &#8211; I just got an awesome new job with a wicked salary increase and my partner and I are talking marriage\/kids!

It&#8217;s true, I do &#8220;feel&#8221; like I&#8217;m saving when I get a deal on something &#8211; for instance I didn&#8217;t have to pay for parking last night (somehow it was free! Yay! Small wins) but I had nowhere to put, nor did I think about putting for that matter, the allotted parking money away.\u00a0 The question that I would like to pose is &#8211; where did you decide to put these &#8220;spavings&#8221;? My husband &amp; I have a three tier joint account but I don&#8217;t want the money to be that easily accessible.\u00a0 I once had an off side savings account that took three business days to transfer money anywhere.\u00a0 I liked this option because it caused us to really think about why, when, where, and how often we transferred money from that account. Any suggestions or feedback that you provide would be much appreciated.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Haha yeah &#8211; I&#8217;m a big fan of tricks that keep your hands off your money too :) What about instead of putting it into actual savings, you throw it into *investments*? Or paying off debt?<\/p>\n<p>With the latter you can&#8217;t take it back even if you wanted to since it&#8217;s already &#8220;spent&#8221;, and with the former it&#8217;s more annoying to pull it back due to taxes and\/or other penalties so you should be fine there too. Plus, your brain usually stops you from pulling out investments vs cash anyways.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what I decided to do with our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/net-worth-voyeur-time-894k\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$4,040.50<\/a> of spavings &#8211; throw it all into a Roth IRA! (I can&#8217;t do it until the end of the year in case we make too much for it, but it&#8217;s just stashed away for now in our savings until then. But in a perfect world I&#8217;d have been dropping it in there every month to start working for me already!)<\/p>\n<p>However route you go though, it&#8217;s just a fun experiment to try so I hope you do go for it :) It really opens your eyes to your habits and how much &#8220;free&#8221; money comes your way that you didn&#8217;t even realize! And as long as that money is going towards increasing some part of your net worth, you know you&#8217;re doing just fine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hey J$ \u2013 I\u2019m fairly new to the minimalist lifestyle trend and have only done some light reading in the area. We\u2019re a family of 3, living in a 3,100 sq\/ft home and most closets\/drawers are full of stuff. The more I think about all the \u201cstuff\u201d we have that we don\u2019t use, the more it makes me think \u201cwhy the hell do we still have that?\u201d I\u2019m on board with de-cluttering, but my wife is hesitant. I think she\u2019s willing to de-clutter and move towards a minimalist lifestyle, but I need to share more information with her. So, where do you recommend I go (books, blogs, etc.) to gather more information about becoming a minimalist. Not looking to become extreme minimalists, just want to feel empowered to de-clutter and live with less stuff. THANKS!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Love it! I\u2019m sure once she sees you doing it and how awesome you\u2019re feeling, she\u2019ll want to jump right in along with you :) Here are my favorite blogs on minimalism:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/becomingminimalist.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BecomingMinimalist.com<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/theminimalists.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TheMinimalists.com<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And then here are some books I really like, although the above two bloggers also now have their own books as well you might want to check out if you like their style:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Pivxvk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Power of Less<\/a>&#8221; by Leo Babauta (the first book that really opened my eyes!)<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2N1RFfU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Year of Less<\/a>&#8221; by Cait Flanders (<a href=\"https:\/\/caitflanders.com\/popular-posts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also a blogger!<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2NuQ27q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Essentialsim<\/a>&#8221; by Greg McKeown (not so much geared towards \u201cstuff\u201d, but more so on minimizing all your daily routines and focusing on what TRULY matters to you and your lifestyle\/career\/etc)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58117\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/clutter-gif.gif\" alt=\"clutter gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"344\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about your Lexus a year later? Right now I\u2019m planning to buy a car within the next week. The Lexus RX has piqued my interest. Specifically, a 2016 model straight of the lease with 25,600 miles on it&#8230; I expect out of a car to get 200k without it turning into a money pit before hand. Otherwise, I feel I made a poor purchase regarding quality&#8230; The Lexus piques my interest based off of previously owned Honda\u2019s and Toyota\u2019s&#8230;. I\u2019m hoping you can share the mileage you\u2019ve placed on your Lexus and the cost of ownership during that time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Still enjoying it! I miss my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/bye-bye-frankencaddy-hello-car-payments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">old Caddy<\/a> at times, but the Lexus definitely helps take out the sting more :) Here&#8217;s an article I wrote after the first handful of months: <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/thoughts-on-owning-lexus-luxury-car\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thoughts on Owning a Lexus After 9 Months<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To answer your questions more specifically though, I put about 25,000 miles on it since owning it and outside of a flat tire and regular maintenance (oil\/etc), haven\u2019t had to drop anything else into it so far (knock on wood). Surprisingly fits THREE car seats in the back too \u2013 or else we would have been in trouble when we found out we were expecting a third kid!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve owned Hondas and Toyotas most of my life too, and this Lexus def feels as robust \u2013 just more luxurious inside. My mechanic says he loves them too and shouldn\u2019t have any problems riding it out for years to come \u2013 so hopefully that\u2019s true!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I am trying to become a Money Coach. I love helping people and to know what I&#8217;m talking about&#8230; I have worked with a a couple of friends already with their finances and just not sure where to go from there. I had a plan laid out but I have veered away from it and going with the flow. This has gotten me NO WHERE. Any advice?<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; MAKE IT HAPPEN!! :)<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a serious need for money coaches, and not many people like jumping into it because it doesn&#8217;t pay as much as *financial advising* and other services that involve making bank off hawking funds\/etc.<\/p>\n<p>It does seem like &#8220;a lot&#8221; at first, but it really is pretty straightforward once you get going&#8230; And there are no real rules for money coaching unlike other financial services, so anyone can literally just start helping others anytime they want &#8211; for the better or the worse. The only *main* (and important) rule is that <em><strong>you can&#8217;t give any direct *investing advice* if you&#8217;re getting paid for it<\/strong>,<\/em> because then you need a bunch of certifications. But you can tell people that they need to invest in general for sure.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;d do is ask your friends\/family who you&#8217;ve helped already to give you a testimonial, and then just build a one-pager online that features them, along with your services and how you can help people\/etc, and then from there it&#8217;s really just marketing the crap out of it :)<\/p>\n<p>You can also connect up with any financial planners you know and see if they&#8217;d be willing to send you over people who they can&#8217;t\/not willing to help too! I used to get a handful of them from people who gladly passed them over since it wasn&#8217;t worth their time&#8230; As sad as that is.<\/p>\n<p>So lots of different ways to get started, but it&#8217;s definitely a hustle at first. Good luck!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I have considered starting my own personal finance blog because I enjoy the topic so much. However, I feel like personal finance blogs are a dime a dozen and I would be wasting my time. Thoughts?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>YES!! DO IT!!

The coaching\/blogging itself is one thing, but then it&#8217;s all the marketing and accounting and correspondence\/etc\/etc that goes along from being a solopreneur.

There&#8217;s gotta be more reasons behind it to keep you going, and that usually comes from having fun and purpose.
