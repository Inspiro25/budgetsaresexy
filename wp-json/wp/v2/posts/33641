Like that &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/10\/getting-creative-workplace-salaries\/\">choose your own adventure<\/a>&#8221; deal with salaries and time scales? Haha&#8230; Well he&#8217;s at it again. Only this time angling for Fridays off :)<\/p>\n<p>It all stems back to the same thing it always does with him: having more time to pursue his hustles. But this time his employer (not the same one as before btw) is playing ball. They&#8217;re okay with his idea of taking Fridays off, which is great!, but in return it&#8217;ll come with a hefty price tag: Giving up 10% of his salary. And also working 9 hour days Monday through Thursday for a total of 36 (which he pretty much does anyways).<\/p>\n<p>It took my friend approximately one hour and 30 seconds to come to his decision. Which of course was &#8220;Yes.&#8221; One hour of discussing it with me and going over all the potential pros and cons it&#8217;ll bring (he knows I love this stuff!), and then another 30 seconds to &#8220;sleep on it&#8221; ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here were all the benefits we came up with:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get 3 day weekends EVERY WEEK!<\/li>\n<li>Which cuts down on all that stress you&#8217;re having &#8211; both mentally and physically<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll probably make up that lost money anyways at your next raise!<\/li>\n<li>And maybe from the side hustles too (and then some!)<\/li>\n<li>You can also finally take vacations as needed<\/li>\n<li>Or go on road trips for soul searching<\/li>\n<li>Or even sit on your ass all day while laughing at us who DO have to work :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>But of course, what goes up can also go down:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a part of your pay check EVERY pay period<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll probably still be &#8220;on call&#8221; in case things hit the fan on Fridays<\/li>\n<li>You may not use that time as productively as you might think (see last bullet up there)<\/li>\n<li>You have to REALLY make sure you&#8217;re killing it on those other 4 days or you&#8217;re liable to get fired!<\/li>\n<li>Your office mates might not like it very much. Whether they feel gypped, or whether it makes their job even harder knowing you&#8217;re out of commission now every Friday.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I told him if I were him, I&#8217;d take it hands down too. Only I&#8217;m not him &#8211; I&#8217;m me &#8211; with a business that will halt still and pile up if I were to enact something similar ;) The major downside to working for yourself, as everyone knows (though they choose to ignore and think we all work in our pajamas sipping coffee in La La Land!). If I was at someone <em>else&#8217;s<\/em> company though? Hell yeah I&#8217;d do it! Much easier to &#8220;leave work at the office&#8221; in that case. And the 10% cut would easily be made up for and MORE on my side stuff anyways with that extra day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So. With all that in mind, if YOU were given this option presently at work &#8211; what would you choose?<\/strong> Could you survive without that 10%? And put in 9 hour work days M-Th as well? What would you do with your extra time every week?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, but I absolutely LOVE challenging the norm like this at companies. It may not work for everyone, or even with all jobs, but it&#8217;s the creativity and TESTING things out that really get you farther along with your goals &#8211; no matter what they are. Even the &#8220;no&#8221;s make you feel good for giving it a shot! Which is more than you know half your co-workers would ever do ;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> When you&#8217;re done answering this one, try out the other question we posed back in the crisis of 2009: Would you take a 10% pay cut if it meant saving an employee?<\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/herval\/\">herval<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If so, you could be reading this in your pajamas right now ;) Remember my friend who likes to push the boundaries at work and&#8230; <\/p>\n<p class=\"more\"><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/would-you-take-a-10-pay-cut-to-get-fridays-off\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":43124,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[45],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-33641","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-career"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.6 (Yoast SEO v24.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Would You Take a 10% Pay Cut to Get All Fridays Off? | Budgets Are Sexy<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/would-you-take-a-10-pay-cut-to-get-fridays-off\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Would You Take a 10% Pay Cut to Get All Fridays Off? | Budgets Are Sexy\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"If so, you could be reading this in your pajamas right now ;) Remember my friend who likes to push the boundaries at work and...
