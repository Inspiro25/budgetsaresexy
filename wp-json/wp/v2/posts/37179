Which included a) <em>Finding<\/em> one that seemed legit, b) scheduling the appointments (after making sure they accept my insurance, of course) and finally c) showing up.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that last part that&#8217;s the least fun :(<\/p>\n<p><strong>But, I sucked it up and did the deed.<\/strong> You already know the outcome of the doctor visit (the whole <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2013\/12\/new-years-resolution-act-like-adult\/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;high blood pressure&#8221; thing<\/a> &#8211; which I&#8217;m currently working on, and well I must say!), but the dentist one was a whole other story. In a nutshell I was reminded how much of an idiot I was for for skipping out on 3 years worth of biyearly cleanings. The convo with my new dentist went like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, the good news is you have no cavities. The bad is that a few of your teeth need &#8220;deep cleanings.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Woohoo! No cavities!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, but had you been doing your yearly visits your teeth would be in even better shape&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Well I thought as long as I was brushing twice a day, as well as flossing AND using anti-cavity mouthwash I&#8217;d be cool? What else could I do to prevent it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You could come in twice a year for your cleanings.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay okay, I get your point. It&#8217;s just that&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>*gets cut off*<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The cleanings are important because no matter how much you brush, and how &#8220;awesome&#8221; you are at it (she literally did the air quotes), you can&#8217;t reach all the places that need to be cleaned. Even *I* have to get my cleanings done each year &#8211; and I&#8217;m a dentist!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>BAM! It was that last line that really hit home with me. <\/strong>I mean, I know you *should* get cleanings and do all that stuff, similar to the yearly *cough* *cough* physicals all us men have to do (you guys know what I&#8217;m talking about), but at this stage of life I need to better understand how it directly affects me or it&#8217;s liable to get swept under the rug with all of life&#8217;s other creepy crawlers&#8230; Especially if I think I&#8217;ve found a way to game the system (ie *not* doing stuff, haha&#8230;). But to hear even dentists need to get check ups now rules that out completely! If they can&#8217;t get around it, how could I?<\/p>\n<p>So needless to say I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. Not only because of this epiphany I&#8217;ve now experienced, but also cuz it affected my wallet too! That &#8220;deep cleaning&#8221; I now had to do? Oh, it wasn&#8217;t covered by insurance. Shocking, huh? Apparently there was some problem with it and I had the lovely option of either waiting 18 months to get it done for free &#8211; I think cuz of a &#8220;pre-existing cause&#8221; or whatever &#8211; (it was my <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2011\/09\/love-ehealth-insurance-for-health-insurance\/\" target=\"_blank\">first time using this insurance in 3 years<\/a>), or paying now and moving on with my life. Which was the route I decided to take in the end. And counted it under the &#8220;you learned your lesson&#8221; category to better hammer home the point.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And that point has more to do with *smart maintenance* in general, than it does a dentist visit.<\/strong> Maintaining our bodies, our relationships (how much do you dread doing that &#8220;catch up call&#8221; with a friend because you&#8217;ve slacked for so long?), and of course with our MONEY. You can set things on autopilot and hope everything remains kosher over the years, but it&#8217;s better to check in every now and then and REALLY make sure stuff&#8217;s exactly where you want it to be. There&#8217;s no real short cut to it all.<\/p>\n<p>This goes for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2009\/07\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\">Budgeting<\/a> (of course)<\/li>\n<li>Paying attention to those investments<\/li>\n<li>Keeping our cars\/homes\/boats afloat (see what I did there?)<\/li>\n<li>Watching our career paths and salaries\/raises<\/li>\n<li>Updating insurance and wills when major life changes occur<\/li>\n<li>And everything else that helps drive our lives and our money&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>We tend to think we&#8217;re smarter than we really are with this stuff<\/strong> &#8211; and that bad things &#8220;won&#8217;t happen to US&#8221; &#8211; but the truth is we need to watch our backs good. Even if it&#8217;s something as small as setting up a monthly reminder to log into your bank\/investment accounts and make sure things look in order. Or reviewing your credit card statements to make sure the Target hackers haven&#8217;t shopped on your dime, or even stolen your identity and having the time of their lives (it&#8217;s a good time to get that free credit report, fyi).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Basically you don&#8217;t want to push things off or ignore &#8217;em until they become &#8220;a thing.&#8221; Things are the worst.<\/strong> And unfortunately this dentist one isn&#8217;t the only one I&#8217;ve let creep up on me :(<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been a bad boy reviewing my business income\/expenses all year because I&#8217;ve let automation and laziness get in my way throughout. That&#8217;s what happens when you use awesome services out there &#8211; you slack on your diligence! Every month I say I&#8217;m gonna spend 5 mins reviewing the numbers over at <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/outright\" target=\"_blank\">Outright.com<\/a> (the free service I use to manage my biz money), and every month I push it off until I&#8217;m staring at 12 months worth to do come tax time, ugh&#8230; Honestly, I&#8217;m an idiot &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why you read this blog. Now I&#8217;ve come quite far from 2011&#8217;s fiasco of *manually* managing it all (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2012\/01\/taxes-kicking-my-ass-better-filing-system\/\" target=\"_blank\">THAT was stressful<\/a>), but still. You&#8217;d think someone who can stay on top of their personal finances can do the same for their business ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>So today&#8217;s takeaways: Do all your <em>life<\/em> maintenance, and do all your <em>financial<\/em> maintenance as well.<\/strong> The more you stay on top of it, the less problems\/stress\/surprises you&#8217;ll have to deal with later. And the crazy part is that it really isn&#8217;t that hard at all! Most of this stuff literally takes minutes, if not tens of minutes, and you then avoid the entire set of problems whatsoever. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with us, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, it is what it is. Now I&#8217;m off to go check on my blood pressure and see if all this firing up here will affect it or not ;) Doctor says to track it at different times of the day to get a good average going (I picked up one of those <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002ZHXVWU\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002ZHXVWU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20\" target=\"_blank\">home devices<\/a>), so we&#8217;ll see if it does!
