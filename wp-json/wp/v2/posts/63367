I wrote my name on the check-in sheet and helped myself to a free cup of coffee in the waiting area.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes, a well-groomed young fellow in a suit and tie came over to greet me. As he reached to shake my hand, I noticed his eyes looking me up and down, studying my old t-shirt, dirty jeans, and worn-down Crocs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The banker led me to his cubicle while making small talk. He seemed like a cool guy, cracking jokes and calling me \u201cdude.\u201d He was very relaxed and casual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then something weird happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he took my drivers license and looked up my account information, his facial expressions started to change. His computer screen showed I had $220,000 in my checking account, 3 mortgages on rental properties, 2 business accounts, and 5 credit cards open with the bank. (I had just sold some real estate &#8212; that\u2019s the reason for the high cash balance at the time)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the flick of a switch, the banker\u2019s character completely changed. He straightened his posture, looked me in the eyes and started calling me \u201cMr. O\u2019Leary.\u201d What began as a friendly and casual interaction quickly turned into a professional and robotic business meeting. I felt really awkward being treated differently once he found out I had \u201cwealth.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the reasons I\u2019m a fan of practicing <\/span><b>stealth wealth<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I don\u2019t like being treated differently because of money or financial status.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Stealth Wealth?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s basically wealth that\u2019s hidden in plain sight, either intentionally or unintentionally. It\u2019s money, assets, or income that are kept private, revealed only when necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stealth wealth is also the art of being logical and frugal, even though your money can afford to buy more. It\u2019s the opposite of showing off wealth and success. Flaunting your financial status often comes with disadvantages, so practicing stealth wealth is a good way to avoid public or personal scrutiny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a higher than normal income, net worth, or even a wealthy family heritage, people may treat you differently compared to someone with a lower economic profile. With stealth wealth, a millionaire (or even a billionaire) would look and act the exact same as someone with no money at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Keep Your Wealth Private?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><b>Sadly, some people treat you differently when they find out how much money or wealth you have<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (or <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have)! Just like in my bank visit story, I felt like I was being treated less like a person and more like a number after the guy looked at my bank account. Keeping your wealth hidden can keep interactions more genuine when meeting new people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Sometimes wealthy people can become targets<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for harassment or unwelcomed offers. If you appear to have <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">excess<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> income or wealth, businesses or opportunistic individuals may try to take advantage of you. On the other hand, acting like you don&#8217;t have anything of value could make you less of a target.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Certain social pressures can be put on you if people think you are \u201crich.\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Your peers might influence you to buy a luxury car or expensive clothes or to donate money to charities just to fit the typical profile of a wealthy person. Keeping your money status hidden can keep social pressures away.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Spending Money for the Wrong Reasons<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conspicuous consumption (buying luxury goods for the sole purpose of public display) has never made much sense to me. I can\u2019t understand why people would sacrifice so much effort to accumulate money, only to spend it all trying to impress others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t know about you, but when I see people with an excess of fancy items on display, I usually am the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opposite<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of impressed. Being ostentatious is an indicator that someone probably has a lower net worth than they are portraying. That\u2019s what Thomas J. Stanley\u2019s research found in the book <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2IKGjge\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Millionaire Next Door<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAllocating time and money in the pursuit of looking superior often has a predictable outcome: <\/span><\/i><b><i>inferior economic achievement.<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What are three words that profile the affluent? FRUGAL FRUGAL FRUGAL\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From what I understand, the most wealthy Americans are the ones you would never suspect. They may like and buy nice things, but it\u2019s never in excess or flaunted around.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Practice Stealth Wealth<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, it helps tremendously if you <\/span><b>stop worrying about what other people think of you<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. People want to hang around you because of your attractive personality, not because of how you look or the stuff you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>As your income grows, keep your expenses the same. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifestyle inflation (spending more money just because you\u2019re earning more money) doesn\u2019t grow wealth &#8211; it actually puts you further away from financial independence and early retirement. <strong>Lifestyle inflation hurts your retirement saving.<\/strong> Investing all excess income is what the stealth wealth peeps do. :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Think and act pragmatically. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keanu Reeves catches the subway &#8211; even though he can afford to take a helicopter (or any expensive car he wanted) &#8211; because the subway is an efficient and convenient way to get around. Same reason Larry Page drives an old Toyota Prius when he can afford to buy any fancy new car he wants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Buy stuff because YOU like it.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s totally OK to like and buy fancy things! Just make sure you\u2019re doing it because you see value, not because you think others will find it cool or your close friend has one. One way you can test this is to ask yourself before you buy something, \u201cIf you were the last person left in the whole world, would you still buy and use this?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Use Family Trusts and LLC\u2019s.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Putting your larger assets into a business name or family trust is a good way to disassociate your personal name and hide your wealth. Many real estate investors use LLCs to mask their identity and protect their personal liability. Trusts can also be a great way to transfer wealth from parents to kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Financial Independence and Stealth Wealth<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the personal finance community, we do a lot of public money talk. We share our net worth, talk about our income and celebrate each other\u2019s financial success. In a way it\u2019s kind of contradictory to stealth wealth, because our assets are far from hidden!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, there\u2019s a difference between talking about money and boasting about money. People pursuing <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at\/\">financial freedom<\/a> are less concerned with looking like a rich person, and more concerned about the freedom and experiences that true wealth provides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you\u2019re a personal finance nerd, keep up the money talk! Just be mindful of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019re sharing information. Keep it classy. And keep it stealthy in real life!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*****This was supposed to be the end of the post, but I left my computer unattended and came back to find my wife had read everything and added a note! So I\u2019m including it below :)*****\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2>My wife&#8217;s take on this stealth wealth stuff ;)<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up I used to feel uncomfortable about being frugal and living a minimalist lifestyle. I\u2019m from West LA, where people promote a lot of excess and trade their souls for the appearance of lavish lifestyles in upscale neighborhoods. Especially on social media. But finding the FI community has made me become very comfortable in my frugality. I can openly share good deals, free stuff I found, or general opinions on the excess that our local community promotes. Recently what I found really interesting is that the majority of people still don\u2019t like my frugality, they see me as \u201ccheap.\u201d\u00a0 While yes, this hurts my feelings a bit, it makes me double down on this Stealth Wealth idea; sometimes shutting my mouth when talking to the average person with different mindsets works out for the better. It\u2019s a hard thing to swallow, at least for me, since I truly believe in education at all levels of life. How can I get the people around me to dump the luxury items? I\u2019ve found staying true to my own sensible lifestyle and leading by example is the best I can do sometimes. My 2 cents.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few years ago, I went into my local bank branch to do a wire transfer.
