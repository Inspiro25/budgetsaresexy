You die, and your entire family gets hooked up &#8211; what what!<\/p>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already know, today is official <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodfinancialcents.com\/life-insurance-movement\/\">Life Insurance Day<\/a> per my good friend <em>Jeff Rose<\/em>, where a whole mess of bloggers are putting out the good word.\u00a0 With some being way more detailed in their posts than others (I&#8217;ll be in those &#8220;others&#8221; fyi cuz I don&#8217;t know a ton on the subject, and the whole thing honestly bores me to death. No pun intended).<\/p>\n<p>The fact of the matter, though, is that MMLP is super important &#8211; especially if you have any loving husbands or wives or a plethora of running kids all around your house. The last thing you want to do is put them into more hurt *financially* after they lost their favorite person in the world!\u00a0 Make sure to give them financial peace of mind so they can live a long and stress-free life when you&#8217;re gone &#8211; it&#8217;s the best thing you can leave them! (Outside of love and fond memories, of course)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are 4 reasons why <del>life insurance<\/del> MMLP is important:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you die, it&#8217;s going to cost money. Who, will depend on you.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s good to give your family complete peace of mind.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s good to give YOU complete peace of mind while you&#8217;re still alive! ;)<\/li>\n<li>And more importantly, you can forever ward off any more questions from your mom or dad (or pf blogger?) on why you&#8217;re not acting like an adult and getting insurance ;) Nice, huh?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>The fact is, when you die your entire family is going to be crushed and the last thing on their mind will be money.<\/strong>\u00a0 But when it all sinks in and they&#8217;re thinking clearer, you leaving them with hundreds of thousands of dollars is going to make it a teensie bit better for them later &#8211; believe me.\u00a0 Imagine your entire household being 100% debt-free? No mortgages or loans or anything? Or that your kids had their college tuition all set up? Shoooooot&#8230; Money can&#8217;t bring you back or kiss your family on the forehead every night, but it sure can improve their lives forever and ever, no doubt about it.<\/p>\n<p>So the question you should REALLY be thinking about right now, is *how much* you need to be feeling that good. And unfortunately that&#8217;ll be up to you and your comfort levels as no pro can tell you a magic number (although they&#8217;ll always try). Personally, we came up with our own numbers by asking ourselves <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/09\/all-about-life-insurance-today-too-many\/\">what our goals were<\/a>. And now that I look back at this post, I realize it&#8217;s already been 4 years and we need to update it! Yikes&#8230; I guess today is for both me AND you, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our goals with MMLP were as follows:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We wanted to be completely debt free in the event any of us went bye bye.<\/li>\n<li>We wanted to &#8220;set it and forget it&#8221; so we didn&#8217;t have to think about death every day&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>And now we want to make sure Baby $ is all set for future and other crazy expenses that can come up over his lifetime in the event we&#8217;re gone.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>After talking with a lot of people back then, we also decided that <em>TERM Life Insurance<\/em> was the best bet for us youngins&#8217; too.<\/strong>\u00a0 And naturally <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/usaa-insurance\">we went with USAA<\/a> &#8216;cuz they&#8217;re the vault for all our financial products in life ;) Here&#8217;s a quick summary on Term from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Term_life_insurance\">Wikipedia<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Term life insurance&#8230; is life insurance which provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period of time, the relevant term&#8230; If the insured dies during the term, the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary. Term insurance is the least expensive way to purchase a substantial death benefit on a coverage amount per premium dollar basis over a specific period of time.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So basically you pay a set amount of money for coverage over a certain amount of time, and when\/if you die it pays out X amount to the person you linked it to. Nice and simple. This is how it <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/09\/all-about-life-insurance-today-too-many\/\">currently breaks down<\/a> for us (again, we need to call and adjust this):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>My MMLP plan: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$30.99<\/span><\/strong><\/span> a month, which pays out <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$350,000<\/span><\/strong><\/span> if I <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">die<\/span> within <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">30 years<\/span>.<\/li>\n<li>The Mrs&#8217; plan: <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$24.57<\/span><\/strong><\/span> a month, which pays out <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$350,000<\/span><\/strong><\/span> if she <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">dies<\/span> within <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">30 years<\/span>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We came up with that $350k figure because it would have pretty much wiped out our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/12\/sure-we-financed-our-house-100-but-ya\/\">entire mortgages<\/a> at the time. And that was the main thing we wanted to have covered since it was (and still is) our #1 sore spot financially. Looking forward we now want to make sure we have enough to cover future funeral costs and college tuition for our kid(s) too &#8211; probably upping our new number to around $450k, or maybe even topping it off at a cool half million?\u00a0 We&#8217;ll have to see how much more that costs a month though, and what are options are with updating our original agreements (maybe we need to pick up additional MMLP on top of the ones we have? I&#8217;m not too sure&#8230; it&#8217;s part of my homework)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another question is figuring out who *DOESN&#8217;T* need life insurance at all?<\/strong> Or is there no one that falls under that category? I always think that everyone DOES need it, but time after time I also get convinced that maybe there are those who don&#8217;t ;) Like maybe people who are single and\/or without any debt whatsoever? I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any 100% answers here, but I DO think it&#8217;s totally up to your own comfort levels. Some of us like being covered for everything out there, and others could care less. The only thing I&#8217;ll say is that *someone* will have to pay for your funeral at some point, and maybe other things?, so it may make sense to at least get a little.\u00a0 It really doesn&#8217;t cost that much.<\/p>\n<p>If it helps, here are a couple of resources that goes a lot more into detail. I&#8217;ll be reviewing &#8217;em too:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehappens.org\/lifeinsurance\">Life Insurance 101 Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehappens.org\/howmuch\">Life Insurance Needs Calculator<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The point of all this though, is to GIVE LIFE INSURANCE SOME THOUGHT today. <\/strong>That&#8217;s all I ask of you. If you already have it, review your situation again and see if it&#8217;s still enough. If you don&#8217;t have it, ask yourself if it&#8217;s time to change? Maybe you got married? Maybe you had kids? Maybe you want a fancy funeral with all kinds of parades and concerts in your honor? Or maybe you just want to leave some money to a special person in your life just for the hell of it?<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the case may be &#8211; think about it for a hot second and then move on to your coffee and Facebook :)\u00a0 It&#8217;ll probably be <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2008\/09\/all-about-life-insurance-today-too-many\/\">another four years <\/a>until I blog about it again, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about me checking up on you, haha&#8230; <em><strong>just promise me you&#8217;ll think about it!<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<strong>PS:<\/strong> Also check out what everyone&#8217;s saying on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodfinancialcents.com\/life-insurance-movement\/\">Jeff&#8217;s Life Insurance Movement<\/a> page! He&#8217;ll be rounding up everything and sharing his own views on this stuff too.\u00a0 And he&#8217;s a Financial Planner, so he&#8217;s a lot smarter on MMLP than I am &#8211; might be worth a read ;) Hope this helps!<\/p>\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/storyman\/\">Storyman2008<\/a>.
