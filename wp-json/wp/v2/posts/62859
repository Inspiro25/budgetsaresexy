At least until I crash!<\/p>\n<p><strong>My question is about the mechanics of setting up a blog for affiliate marketing (write helpful content and link it to resources at Amazon or other vendors). I have a registered domain, hosting account with Bluehost, and purchased Elegant Themes. I also have a list of ideas to write about in a narrow niche. I can&#8217;t figure out the mechanics of getting a blog going. I have read a ton of blogs on the subject, but the information is usually vague (start a blog and write about something). What resource would you recommend that teaches about the number of pages one should have, fonts, where to get pictures from, and anything else related to setting up a blog?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m probably the wrong person to ask for that as I prefer blogs that *aren&#8217;t* set up chiefly to make money as it tends to skew everything (language, intent, &#8220;feel&#8221;), however in either case it really does come down to writing your heart out and getting those ideas down on paper :)<\/p>\n<p>Sure there are tips on word length (at least 600 for example for SEO) and cool fonts (I like these guys: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.1001fonts.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.1001fonts.com\/<\/a>) as well as places you can grab pics safely and free from (check out <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/pixabay.com\/<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/unsplash.com\/<\/a>), but at the end of the day you need those articles pumped out for people &#8211; and Google &#8211; to start being able to find you. And perhaps even more important than that, you need to see if you actually ENJOY blogging and are good at it! Or the rest of the stuff doesn&#8217;t even matter!<\/p>\n<p>So my recommendation is the same as those vague articles you&#8217;ve come across and to JUST START while you&#8217;re interested and ready to learn&#8230; Sure you&#8217;ll get things wrong, but the writing is 80% of the game!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is one thing in your life that you wish you\u2019d done differently and\/or one regret you have that you wish you could change?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have too many regrets in life thankfully, but one I would have 100% done over would be to live a more MINIMAL life SOONER. I know we all get our epiphanies at different times so not sure how I would have *known* to do things differently, but man how much freedom &#8211; and joy! &#8211; I would have had if I had caught on sooner! All my dreams of tiny house living and getting rid of all my &#8220;stuff&#8221; would have been much easier to do before starting a family and having a million kids! Haha&#8230; Which I know technically you can still do, but we&#8217;re talking a way different story there ;) But oh well&#8230; there are worse problems to have of course!<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you had a million dollars and also had a 150,000 dollar student loan\u2026what would you do with all that money?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Is it $1,000,000 *extra* dollars? If so I&#8217;d wipe away that debt once and for all and then invest the rest into index funds :) If my *net worth* is a flat million dollars, then I&#8217;d probably still wipe away the debt just to be rid of it and then make sure the rest is applied towards index funds and cash and perhaps some real estate if that&#8217;s your thing. A challenge for me has been *diversifying* more outside of just straight up retirement accounts (which account for the major chunk of our $$!), so the one nice thing about owning a home if I have to say a nice thing, lol, is that it does help spread across our $$$ better. And I&#8217;m also trying to focus more on our non-retirement brokerage account too now that the rest is so pumped up. But all fun questions to think about!

Also, any advice on selling a blog?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HAH! Just going for the kill are we?? :)<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to see my note up above for my thoughts on starting a blog for money, but obviously it can be done and there are happy mediums of doing it like what we did here on this blog (ie did enough to survive but never made it the #1 priority). I would say your best chance of being successful with blogging is to first ENJOY IT! and then secondly be in it for the *long* haul as it&#8217;s not a fast ride ;)<\/p>\n<p>Or better yet, use the blog as a *resume* and make money off the opportunities it brings! Like speaking or freelance writing or even coming up with your own products or books! Lots of ways to make money, but again it comes down to passion and hustle.<\/p>\n<p>As for selling blogs once it&#8217;s time, I have a private email list of people interested in buying them and happy to pass along the details to gauge interest (if you wanna get on the list, sign up here &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/jmoney.biz\/brokering\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/jmoney.biz\/brokering\/<\/a>), but there are also larger brokers out there that will really market it and get a top offer but of course charge a nice commission as well :) Can&#8217;t think of their names off my head, but if you email me I can find them and email you back after this AMA is over.<\/p>\n<p>Also FWIW\u00a0 &#8211; most places look at the trailing 12 or 15 months of profit and stats, so always best to ramp it up good before you&#8217;re ready to sell for the best shot of maximizing a sales price!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regarding generating passive income, it seems like the #1 suggestion is always invest in real estate and become a <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-and-when-to-hire-a-property-manager-for-your-real-estate-rental\/\">property manager<\/a> (landlord). I know a lot of people doing this and always heard the horror stories so I\u2019ve been very leery of this. What are your thoughts?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My thoughts are that it makes me want to vomit to even think about it :)<\/p>\n<p>But then again I&#8217;m not a real estate lover and it HAS worked for people for hundreds, if not thousands of years! So there&#8217;s definitely validity to it, but thankfully there are plenty of other ways to bring passive income in too&#8230; Such as investing in the market long term &#8211; which is the route I choose to go (but has it&#8217;s own set of issues, of course). Really comes down to how comfortable you are with risk and what your personality is like.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Money, after following you for sometime now I am still asking myself, \u201cwhy haven\u2019t you started; what\u2019s holding you back from financial freedom,\u201d and being self taught and evolving monthly with stocks I continously find my brain racing to avoid the growth. So let me ask you, how did you go from lack to sack? What really drove you to become higher within yourself?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hah! I&#8217;m not sure I exactly follow the question, but I can tell you I&#8217;ve been more motivated by *lifestyle design* than I have money over the past few years.\u00a0 Since the whole point of money anyways is to craft the life we live! So perhaps focusing on the\u00a0 *daily* changes you want to see in your life might be more motivating than the larger &#8211; harder &#8211; &#8220;growth&#8221; parts of it all? How do you see yourself living in a perfect world?? What would you be doing every day? Can you start doing some of it NOW and then incrementally do more over time? Those are the bigger questions that drive me, anyways :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for someone who is extremely disorganized and hates tracking things and budgeting, but still wants to achieve FI? (I already pay myself first and max out my and my wife&#8217;s 401k and ira, so something beyond that). Thanks again for all the insight and motivation over the years!!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How about tracking your net worth? A much easier &#8211; and quicker! &#8211; exercise to do every month? Maybe that&#8217;ll keep you motivated seeing how things overall change over time? Also if you&#8217;re like me, it&#8217;s usually more fun going &#8220;all in&#8221; on a certain goal too than trying to hit 13 different smaller ones :) Maybe there&#8217;s an area of your life\/finances you can really turbocharge for a solid month or two and see what comes of it? Or maybe a hobby you can turn into a money maker, even if it&#8217;s just a little to add some fuel to the FIRE?<\/p>\n<p><strong>What I need\/or am searching for the most is a great budget tracker\/or Excel sheet example you might have, as I\u2019m looking for a new, consistent way (and to help me do a better job quite frankly;) to budget out monthly, yearly, etc&#8230;..and find that extra $$ to put back into our family operations, savings, etc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have you come across this list of budget templates from the site yet? &#8211;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/free-budget-templates-sites\/\">https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/free-budget-templates-sites\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Or these FIRE spreadsheets? &#8211;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet\/\">https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>If someone is about to give up on their FI journey, what would you say to them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ooooh good one! I don&#8217;t think I ever thought of that before? I suppose I&#8217;d want to know the *why* behind it so I could understand more and see if I could offer another perspective, but if I had a gun to my head and had to blurt something out, I guess I would say &#8220;Go do you thing and the door is always open for you to come back&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never had success trying to convince someone to do something they really don&#8217;t want to do deep down (which is why I never jump into politics online! No one is there to be convinced otherwise no matter how many facts you throw their way!), so the best hope is to just let them know you&#8217;re always there if they wanna chat about stuff, and then hopefully they have another epiphany and are ready to jump back in :) Def. gonna have to think more on this one though&#8230; good one!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m curious when you selected a lawyer for your will, how did you go about that process? What did you look for? What questions did you ask?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Great questions! It took us over a YEAR to finally find someone we liked, but then again we weren&#8217;t ever really hardcore about it either ;) It basically came down to *asking around* for recommendations from people, and then chatting with each of them to get a better sense of how easy they were to work with as well as the costs of course&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I knew I&#8217;d have approximately 837 questions so I needed someone who could hold my hand and not get annoyed with me, haha, but at the same time help guide me to the *right* answers and in a perfect world do it in *person*. Half the people we called never called us back, and a majority of the others had their *assistants* call us back so that was a no go, so when we came across this smaller mom and pop shop who offered to meet over coffee to talk about stuff I was already 80% sold :) A few more chats later and we were all signed up and rolling!<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s def. good to know how YOU work, personally, and then try your best to find someone that&#8217;ll match up nicely. But getting recommendations def. helps speed up the process and already gives you one more level of trust since a friend or loved one already used them!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What did you learn most about yourself and what is your biggest takeaway that will keep you going for your next chapter?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I learned that I&#8217;m a VERY emotional person, and if something doesn&#8217;t excite me whether it makes a ton of money or not, the odds I actually do something about it are slim to none :)<\/p>\n<p>I also learned that there really isn&#8217;t that many &#8220;rules&#8221; in life so you can basically do things on your own accord and get away with it just fine! You just have to ASK for what you want or just go for it! So long as you&#8217;re not hurting anyone in the process! (At least that&#8217;s one of my only rules I have for myself&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you invest your money, and do you still invest the same way in down turns such as this pandemic and the 2008 recession?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I invest all my money into Vanguard&#8217;s Total Stock Market Index Fund &#8211; ticker <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/investment-products\/mutual-funds\/profile\/vtsax\">VTSAX<\/a>.

I don&#8217;t even WANT to answer that question because &#8220;making money&#8221; and &#8220;quick as possible&#8221; usually never ends well in the same sentence, haha&#8230; That being said, I&#8217;ve been pretty pleased with my returns by investing in index funds over the past half a decade or so, but without knowing your risk levels &#8211; and how short &#8220;very short&#8221; actually is? &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to really advise I&#8217;m afraid.

We have all their money invested in Virginia&#8217;s 529 plan (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.virginia529.com\/\">virginia529.com<\/a>) to milk the tax rewards along with it :) See if your state offers any too as you&#8217;re searching around!<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is random, but several years ago I used to have an app for Budgets are Sexy but when I changed to a new phone and I tried to download the app it wasn\u2019t there anymore &#8211; did you take out the app?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hah &#8211; we never had an app! But if you type in &#8220;budgets are sexy&#8221; in your phone&#8217;s browser you should be easily able to just add a &#8220;bookmark&#8221; to it on your home screen once it pops up. That&#8217;s how I view it every day!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m always curious how people meet their spouses &#8211; how did you meet yours? Your wife seems like a lovely wife and you have a beautiful family! And to be fair, since I asked how you met your wife I\u2019ll tell you how I met my husband! We met in college and we started dating after we threw each other into a lake and I have pictures to prove it :P My 6 year old daughter loves it when I pull out the pictures to tell the story.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That is so cute!!! What a story!! My sons recently acted out *our* meeting in a play of theirs, haha, but it was much less fun :) She asked me where the bathroom was late one Friday night at the bar, and after I told her I asked her to dance. To which she politely declined, and then an hour later randomly showed up on the dance floor and we&#8217;ve been dancing together ever since! ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on spending money on WEDDINGS? Is it worth it to spend on the (hopefully) one wedding you&#8217;ll ever have? Is it not worth the fuss and you should just save your money?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you the same answer I give out whether it&#8217;s relating to weddings or houses or even Starbucks coffees :) If it&#8217;s something you VALUE and is important to you, by all means spend the money! It&#8217;s your life and you should be able to do what you want with it provided it&#8217;s within reason! Now if you&#8217;re also splurging on your home and cars and everything else you don&#8217;t care as much for, then you&#8217;re def. not doing it right, but on a few selected areas of life by all means convert that money into happiness!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your fondest memories from budgetsaresexy?

I haven\u2019t budgeted in years ;)<\/p>\n<p>As for the legacy and memories, it really has been all about you *readers* for me and just engaging day in and day out and feeling like one happy financial family :) I never set out to make a new career of it or for the blog \u2013 and the other projects that spawned from it \u2013 to take off as they did, as for me it was just about sharing some thoughts and having fun! And of course improving my *own* finances in the meantime.<\/p>\n<p>So personally the site far exceeded any expectations that I had from month #1, lol, but it\u2019s been a blast seeing where it\u2019s all gone from there and I guess my only real hope for it is that the articles *stay online* for many years so they hopefully continue getting people to pay attention.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nWill you leave us with the promise that when you have your first grandchild you will resurrect the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-much-babies-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baby Tracker<\/a>&#8221; idea and convert it to how much a grandparent spends?

If you had net worth $0, would you start a blog today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Totally!!<\/p>\n<p>When I started everyone was saying it was overcrowded then too! Lol&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But guess what?? There are BILLIONS of people on this planet and literally only a few thousand bloggers. So there is *plenty* of room for more to come in \u2013 and especially those with interesting stories\/ideas to tell :)<\/p>\n<p>Now is it a good *way to make money*? Well, I\u2019ve never been a fan of starting it for that reason since there are wayyy more ways to make it faster than blogging!, but if you\u2019re *passionate* about it and want a better way to hold yourself accountable, starting a blog is 100% a great way to go about it. Plus, as you\u2019ve seen here you never know where it could lead! I never thought I\u2019d be doing it 12 years later and having my entire life and friends and career change from it! It\u2019s been amazing!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coffee or tea? And favorite flavor? :) <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>COFFEE. 100%.<\/p>\n<p>Flavor? Hazelnut :) Although recently my sister turned me onto a \u201cdirty chai\u201d (you ever hear of that?) and it was pretty damn glorious, haha.. And gives you a mix of both coffee AND tea! If it weren\u2019t so expensive I\u2019d make it my daily drink :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does the \u201cJ\u201d of J. Money stand for?

And 2) I\u2019ve been trying to increase our saving rates to be able to max out our 401K but it has been hard. Do you have any tips on keeping your household monthly budget down? We probably only eat out once a month.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>RE: Emergency fund \u2013 nope, I\u2019d never put it into the market or anywhere else with similar volatility as to me the E Fund is meant to be stable and super accessible. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t maybe just cut your fund in half and throw some into the markets and keep the other into savings or a money market or something like that, but I\u2019ve never been a fan of putting it *all* somewhere other than a cash-related vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>RE: Monthly budget \u2013 if you\u2019re having a hard time cutting it further, it may very well be that you\u2019ve done the best you can \u2013 at least to keep the lifestyle you\u2019re currently enjoying. So in times like that it\u2019s better in my opinion to just let it be and shift your focus towards *earning more* where you have much more flexibility and growth potential. Whether it\u2019s at your current job or taking on <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/ways-to-make-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hustles on the side<\/a>&#8230; You can try and slash expenses even more if you\u2019re willing to not enjoy life so much, but there\u2019s only so much you can do and you certainly don\u2019t want to hate waking up every morning :)<\/p>\n<p><strong>A question I have is what strategies did you use to grow your blog? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I networked a lot! I did some guest posting. I responded to every last comment and email and tweet. I tried to share the love as often as I could (re-share other peoples great content, cheer others on, etc). And then most importantly, I did my best to put out stuff I hoped people would like :) (And I did it *consistently* too &#8211; also important!) I never messed with SEO or any real &#8220;building&#8221; strategies much &#8211; but then again that&#8217;s also why I never got to millions of views a month either ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you and your wife share the same financial mine set?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yup!

Haha\u2026 Love all the cream it creates up top as you crack it open!<\/p>\n<p><strong>For people starting out in blogging, how would you recommend they keep track of their previous posts so they know, as they\u2019re creating new posts, what topics they can hyperlink to?

But you\u2019re right it\u2019s not the most failproof system! Lol\u2026 Luckily wodpress has that little search section when you go to link to words in the article, but I don\u2019t know of any other real ways outside of just manually throwing them in a spreadsheet or something w\/ notes\u2026<\/p>\n<p>But really, it\u2019s probably fine even when you do forget things because a) you don\u2019t want to be linking to the same stuff ALL the time, and b) if you don\u2019t remember it probably wasn\u2019t anything too spectacular anyways? Plus most of this stuff just keeps being repeated in different ways only, so it allows you to recreate the thought or idea in fresher words to keep the party going\u2026<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s been multiple times I\u2019ve written the exact same post over the years without even knowing it :) And that\u2019s fine! People rarely remember it anyways, and every new day there are new people coming to your blog for the very first time. So don\u2019t let it keep you up at night too much. Just keep pumping out those articles!<\/p>\n<p><strong>It seems as though the whole concept of FIRE is about getting your priorities straight.

Something you can\u2019t do too well if you\u2019re finances aren\u2019t in order and drowning in debt.
