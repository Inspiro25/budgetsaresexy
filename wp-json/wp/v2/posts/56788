We&#8217;re both savers, and we&#8217;re pretty much in sync when it comes to spending.<\/p>\n<p>One thing we&#8217;ve never been able to do, however, is develop a budget. Budgets may be sexy, but spreadsheets are absolutely alluring. <strong>Rather than budgeting, we&#8217;ve been tracking income and expenses for years,<\/strong> initially in a shared notebook before switching to a spreadsheet starting in 2016. A few months later, we began tracking our net worth on a monthly basis. See the attached pic.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Cash&#8221; includes assets in a variety of bank checking and savings accounts<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Investment&#8221; includes assets at Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and Vanguard and our family HSA at HSA Bank and TD Ameritrade<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Roth IRA&#8221; includes my Roth IRAs at Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and Vanguard and my wife&#8217;s Roth IRA at Fidelity<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;401(k)\/403(b)&#8221; includes my traditional and Roth TSP through the federal government and my wife&#8217;s 403(b) and a rollover IRA at Fidelity<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Home&#8221; is our house value according to Zillow<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Auto&#8221; is the combined value of our two cars according to KBB<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Mortgage&#8221; is our mortgage balance<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Auto Loan&#8221; is the balance of our one auto loan<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;TTM Expenses&#8221; is the sum of our expenses for the Trailing Twelve Months<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;TTM Net Income&#8221; is the sum of our net income for the Trailing Twelve Months<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We both max out our Roth IRAs, TSP\/403(b), and HSA.

We make over the average salary for a household. 2 little boys ages 3 and 1. Both of us have masters in our respective fields (school here is dirt cheap &#8211; a.k.a subsidized by the taxpayers).<\/p>\n<p>I started tracking in Jan. 2015, we had a NW of $108,671 back then. Now its $350,028. Every child slowed us down a bit, but that&#8217;s ok, it&#8217;s for them and we keep hustling.<\/p>\n<p>Our plan is to <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/retired-at-43-no-gambling-no-lotteries-no-bitcoin\/\" >retire early<\/a> in 9-11 years or semi-retire even earlier. We also bought an option on an apartment in Dec. 2014, they started building in April 2016, and we are finally moving in this summer if all goes well with the final inspections. Essentially we saved money on the deal because we (all the 80 apartment buyers) basically cut out the middle man and his profit. But it was nerve wracking and time consuming, and the building is in deficit so we need to come up with an extra $15,000 (per apartment) over the initial price estimate. We will never do it again. Either rent or buy off the market next time. But we learned a lot in the process, like we would rather pay more next time than go through that type of pressure.<\/p>\n<p>This year was a perfect storm for us as we had two kids in private daycare (public daycare doesn&#8217;t start here until age 3), and we payed rent and a mortgage. Tough, but we pulled through. Private daycare costs us $1,247 per month for 2 kids (we get 10% off for sending them to the same one), rent was $1,090 if you factor in utilities, and our mortgage payment is $1,020 per month. Income is $6,763\/mo net after taxes and retirement deductions, so we had some wiggle room.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/fintranslator.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Financial Translator<\/a><br \/>\n(Your biggest fan from Israel)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Love how connected the internet makes us :)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Snapshot #3: The Breadwinning Traveling Nurse<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-56874\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/180k-net-worth-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"180k net worth screenshot\" width=\"602\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/180k-net-worth-screenshot.jpg 893w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/180k-net-worth-screenshot-300x175.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/180k-net-worth-screenshot-768x448.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>This one comes from another personal finance blogger,<\/strong> but whom currently prefers to remain anonymous. Notice the # of months worked there for each year though, and how the worth still continues to go up despite some years only working half the time! Where do we get that deal?? ;)<\/p>\n<p>More info:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>I am an Associate&#8217;s-prepared travel Cardiac ICU Registered Nurse. My goal is to work two 13 week contracts per year. I bring home the bacon.<\/li>\n<li>My husband works for the subsidiary of a major airline as a trainer and ramp agent (the guys who load bags on the plane). He works just 20 hours a week and makes about $1 more than minimum wage, but brings home the flight benefits. We don&#8217;t have any babies.<\/li>\n<li>My husband also goes back to North Dakota every fall to help his father harvest, and I do temporary vaccination work at the local health department. I have a 401k there, and make really decent money for rural North Dakota, and he gets a cash gift from his dad for the help. The gift varies, but of course never goes above the cash gift limit. The highest we&#8217;ve ever gotten was $10k last year for six weeks of work.<\/li>\n<li>We are effectively homeless. We&#8217;ve been living out of a travel trailer the last two years but recently sold it in order to weather a Tucson summer\/monsoon season, now we&#8217;re renting some dude&#8217;s pool house. My current contract is up the end of June but I&#8217;m hoping for an extension. Then we&#8217;ll be free again to move about the country.<\/li>\n<li>We typically keep about four years&#8217; expenses in cash, but recently funded a hard money real estate loan for $35k with 4% interest for seven years. That cut our cash almost in half, but brings in $458\/mo in passive income.<\/li>\n<li>After finding the FIRE community last year we really stepped our retirement game up and now I contribute 50% (company max) to my 401k and my husband contributes 40% (his company max) to his. We invest 100% in stock index funds.<\/li>\n<li>Everything leftover from our paychecks goes into a money market that we&#8217;ll use to max next year&#8217;s Trad IRAs and HSAs, and everything leftover from that will go toward next year&#8217;s expenses. Anything leftover from that goes into our taxable Vanguard index funds.<\/li>\n<li>$200k is our Coast FI number which we&#8217;ll easily hit if I get an extension or a second contract somewhere else this year. Then with farming and the health department&#8230; forget about it. We&#8217;re rich, bitch!<\/li>\n<li>My husband will be able to retire with flight benefits after the age of 52 + ten years of service so our real FI date isn&#8217;t until 2031.<\/li>\n<li>He loves his job and is happy to keep working but I desperately want to get away from bedside nursing. I want to help people die, man. You know, be an ultra-part time hospice nurse.<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t include our cash, that hard money loan, or our vehicles in our net worth &#8211; our net worth is strictly our retirement and brokerage accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Living in a pool house, farming, not including cash in your net worth?!

The additional $200 is there as a back up to my emergency fund and if things work out, I will consider moving it to my mortgage to pay it off even earlier.\u00a0 Today I want to keep it liquid, in case I need it in the future.<\/p>\n<p>My plan for my ROTH account is to let it simmer, hopefully for the remainder of my life.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, I hesitate to share my story since my net worth is completely built on inheritance.\u00a0 Never appreciated what it takes to hold onto any windfall, be it inheritance, lottery or jackpot winnings.\u00a0 Today I do.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And that last part is what it&#8217;s all about, right??
