The interview was going well and all the questions were fun and light. I remember laughing a lot and thinking she was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then came a trick question\u2026 The manager asked, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you worked here for one whole year, how many times do you think you\u2019d be late for work?\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I was raised to be 100% honest, I thought about the question for a second. &#x1f914;\u00a0 Hmmm\u2026 I thought\u2026 out of 365 days, how many days would I be late?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>My answer was 5. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I told her that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would probably be late 5 times.\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You know, because of traffic, or sometimes my siblings hog the bathroom in the morning, or the train might be late coming home from school, etc. Shit happens, and I was just being honest!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The manager looked disappointed. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Really<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> disappointed. She shook her head. Obviously she was hoping my answer was ZERO. Employers want their workers to be late ZERO times each year! But, I was just an honest, innocent little 14 y\/o boy trying to tell the truth. I didn\u2019t know any better. &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, they hired me anyway. I <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/crappy-jobs-on-my-path-to-fire\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worked there for 4 years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 and if memory serves me correctly, I wasn\u2019t late once!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, that interview changed me. I remember thinking afterwards\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe I should have lied? Maybe I should have just told the manager what she wanted to hear so I could \u201cimpress\u201d her more?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Telling People What They Want to Hear<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe it was my training in sales. Maybe it was my immature desire to always be liked\u2026 Whatever the reason, over the years I got pretty good at <\/span><b>telling people what they wanted to hear.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An interviewer once asked me: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHow do you feel about cold-calling people?\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I replied that I had cold-called hundreds of CIO\u2019s in my sales career and closed many sales deals from it. I know how to do it and I\u2019m good at it! (This is technically 100% true.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what I <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">didn\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> say is that with each outbound cold-call, my heart dies a little. Although I love making money and will do anything asked of me, I truly don\u2019t enjoy interrupting busy executives in the middle of their day to push my agenda over theirs. Cold-calling sucks!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you can\u2019t say stuff like that in a job interview, right? You have to hide some of the truth, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same with the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cwhere do you see yourself in 5 years?\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> question\u2026 I remember once a district manager asking me this, and I replied, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSir, I would love nothing more than having a position like yours in 5 years. I hope to climb the ranks here and get promoted internally. I think this company could be my forever home.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what I didn\u2019t share were my true thoughts, which were like\u2026 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSir, in 5 years I see myself handing you my resignation and telling everyone here byyyeeee &#x1f44b;. I\u2019m secretly buying rental properties for passive income and I really dgaf about your corporate ladder.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Too Much Lying Can Backfire \u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon reflecting, I think hiding too much of the truth is one of the reasons my sales jobs never worked out over the long term. I\u2019ve now learned that <\/span><b>lying in interviews can be like lying to myself.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s a red flag that things probably won\u2019t work out with that employer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the interviewer\/employer doesn\u2019t like me \u2013 the REAL me \u2013 then I\u2019m signing myself (and them) up for disappointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today I have no problem telling interviewers exactly how I feel and my real thoughts. I won\u2019t lie. I just can\u2019t do it. And thankfully, things are working out just fine. I\u2019ve been offered some killer roles over the past few years and found an awesome home with my current employer without having to hide any truths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, maybe I\u2019ve just been lucky recently?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Should You Lie During Interviews?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely want to hear your thoughts. But, I\u2019ll leave you with 2 final points.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, it\u2019s no secret that employers sometimes lie. Have you ever been promised something in an interview, only to start working there a few weeks later and realize it\u2019s actually the opposite? Companies tend to tell you the good things about working there and brush over bad details. Is it just expected that both sides are lying during interviews? We\u2019re all saying the same shit just to land the job\/worker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, if you\u2019ve had an interview lately, no doubt you\u2019ve googled \u201cTop Interview Questions\u201d to prepare yourself. The internet is full of articles that not only tell you the questions that will be asked, <\/span><b>they tell you how to respond and what to say.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is just like telling interviewers what they want to hear. Is this lying if everybody does it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those of you interviewing right now\u2026 What\u2019s your experience?\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any recruiters in the crowd who want to chime in?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OK \u2026 I got a fun question for you today \u2026 Should you LIE during a job interview?
