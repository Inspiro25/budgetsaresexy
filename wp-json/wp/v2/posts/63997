We had enough income from our business to replace our current living expenses. We were FI right?

A year before, I probably would have taken it. But it was no longer about the money. My husband and I decided we were going to prioritize happiness and quality of life, and this type of work no longer fit into either of those categories. So, the answer was actually easy, it was NO! (I can\u2019t lie, did have a pang in my stomach though and a quick flash of all the $$ did cross my mind. It was quick, but it was still there).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Post-FI = Sitting around eating Bon Bons<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I felt like we were somewhat prepared for a post-FI life and that all of our unhappiness of doing work that was not fulfilling wouldn\u2019t be solved overnight. I was building some space and freedom to explore new things that would light me up. Really, I just wanted to sit around and eat Bon Bons all day! That sounded like a delicious plan!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, by the way, that was my first project once I quit my job. Since I am a \u201cdoer\u201d and like to get things done and check stuff off a To Do List, I decided that my first week of retirement was to learn how to make Bon Bons. I read about how to temper chocolate, I borrowed some molds, bought all the ingredients and set out on becoming the next chocolatier! <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230; to make a long and messy story short, I had chocolate all over the kitchen, in my hair, on the light switch, etc. Let\u2019s just say that my new life as a master chocolatier ended in one short week. The result of this little mini-experiment was some good treats and I had fun in the process, but I was not going to build an empire making or selling chocolate. I would leave that to the pros! I discovered that I really just like eating chocolate, not making chocolate!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The chocolate theme continues&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, our Oaxaca trip was planned for 6 weeks after I was done working. I did the chocolate thing, hung out and relaxed, practiced some yoga, slept in, visited some friends and family, did a pet sit in Portland, Oregon, and was enjoying my post-FI life. I was ready for my next \u201cthing\u201d! Yep, I had rested and was ready to begin to make some money, because that is what I have been trained to do for practically the last three decades.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oaxaca would have all the answers \u2013 the right group of people to help craft and mold the next three decades of my life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>NIFTY (No Income For The Year)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64359 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/6-Nifty-e1639979570706.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever been posed a question that leaves you speechless?

As fate would have it, I sat next to a fellow participant of the group of entrepreneurs and people from the FIRE community that were gathering to spend time together, deepen our friendships, and continue to build a community of like-minded people. The question that stumped me (after I had expressed how I had pretty much reached financial independence, had retired from my W-2 income and was ready to start something new after 6 weeks of rest from 3 decades of work was):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What would you do if you were not allowed to make any money over the next year?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This simple but deep question was what set the tone for the rest of my trip.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did not have an answer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realized deep down this was a better question to be asking myself rather than just jumping into the next thing that caught my fancy. At some point in the trip, while I was working on this question, I realized that if I had just jumped into whatever seemed to be a good business idea that in 3 years or maybe 5 years (if I was lucky) that I would end up in the same spot as I was right now. I would be burnt out, working to work, and just checking things off my To Do list since that is what I knew how to do. I had not given myself the time and space to figure out what I wanted my next 3 decades to look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Pressure valve released<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By allowing myself to take a break, I mean a real break, like don\u2019t pursue anything for the next year kind of break, it actually took the pressure off. During this trip, I did not have to worry about pursuing a business venture and I could just relax, have some fun, and enjoy life. What!?!

Okay, this is not a question, but you get where I was going.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am just going to tackle #1 in this post, but I found that working on #2 &amp; #3 really helped during this process and found the following podcasts really helpful in working on my purpose and eulogy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/broketowoke.com\/030-write-your-own-eulogy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broke to Woke: Write Your Own Eulogy<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/broketowoke.com\/s2-e01-get-all-the-should-out-of-you\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broke to Woke: Get all the SHOULD out of you<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Values \/ Priority<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started with a list of my values: Health, Helping others, Practice of Gratitude, Time for myself, Travel, and Things that light me up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I made some crazy word association charts and tried to connect them, got myself all confused and was even more clueless on what to do with all that information! I think, I was trying to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">think it<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too much and did not really let it flow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So then, my friend had me pick out of my crazy flow chart my top 5-6 values and list them in two columns:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Values for myself<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Values for others\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, I had to pick 1 value for myself \u2026 just 1. This exercise went from \u201cpriorities\u201d to \u201cpriority.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Health<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My priority was now my health and time for myself (see how I snuck 1 extra in there, they are connected, right? ;))\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, what would that look like? It took me a little bit to work this out, but this priority statement is what I ended up with:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Prioritize time for my whole health: physical, mental &amp; emotional<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is now my priority for the next year while I am not \u201callowed\u201d to make money. This has actually proven to be harder than I thought, but that is a blog post for another day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Driving in the slow lane<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, this is where I am today. I am not exactly sure where I am headed with my new priority statement or how this will all shake out, but this gives me some areas to concentrate on while I continue to decompress and take time for myself. What\u2019s the rush? I have found it hard to slow down and it\u2019s been hard trying to not \u201cfill my day\u201d with things so that the day feels full, like in my working life. I have decided that it is okay to have an empty calendar so that I can create space and time for my Whole Health. I am trying to only have a maximum of two scheduled activities per day and the rest of the day is open and fluid. This has proven to be hard, but I am slowly working on this and trying to not overbook myself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have realized that I do well when I have accountability to others, so this is what I am planning to do as my next steps in this process of my #1 Priority: Me.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Physical Health<\/b>:<br \/>\na. <b>Pilates<\/b>: I joined a yoga studio and have scheduled a killer Pilates class 3 days a week to work on my core.<br \/>\nb. <b>1 Pull Up Challenge<\/b>: My goal is to be able to do 1 Pull Up this year. I found this\u00a0 <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdfitness.com\/blog\/do-a-pull-up\/\">blog<\/a> that has a good progression plan for a pull up since I am weak like a kitten&#8230;well close enough.<\/li>\n<li><b>Mental Health:<\/b><br \/>\na. <b>Mastermind Groups:<\/b> I am participating in two Mastermind groups. I started one with the women from our Oaxaca trip and have set up calls to support each other as we are each going through various stages in our lives. By engaging with people that want to help and support each other, we can all learn and grow.<br \/>\nb. <b>Value Statement:<\/b> I am trying to figure out what is important to me. I have not spent any time really digging into what I value and how I want to prioritize my time and energy. Any resources you know of to help with this? Hey, if you have read this far in this long-ass blog post, maybe you have some suggestions?<\/li>\n<li><b>Emotional Health:<\/b><br \/>\na. <b>Build Community:<\/b> Post COVID, and after a year of partial isolation, it has become clear to me that reaching out to friends and spending time with family is a way to fill my emotional bucket. I have made nine trips in the seven months since I quit my job! Yep, Crazy! It was a mix of visiting family for several weeks at a time and visiting friends I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had a couple of pet sits as well, which have been a great way to reconnect with pet energy and an opportunity to stay at some amazing properties at the same time. Funny thing is, both our pet sits this year have been for Mexican street dogs&#8230;the Mexico theme continues! If you want to support a great cause check out the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlamosDogFoundation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alamos Dog Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they rescue dogs off the streets in Alamos, Mexico.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We plan on continuing to select pet sits across the US over the next year as we travel to visit friends and family. We are exploring driving Old Route 66 in Spring 2022. Who knows, my father has a 1955 Pontiac and maybe we will drive that beast across America?!?! Might be more of an adventure than we are ready for! I just want to find the best apple pie on Route 66! Might not be good for my waistline, but it would be a delicious way to experience the open road! Any suggestions?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>A long winded wrap up<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that money is no longer the driving force in my post-FI life, I hope that by the end of 2022 my NIFTY Project will have offered me an alternative path. I want my next 3 decades to be a life filled with intention, meaning and joy. Making small intentional and incremental changes really does move the needle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So&#8230;what would <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do if you were not allowed to make any money over the next year? How would you spend your time and who would you spend it with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be well &amp; Cheers!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jen<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>**Update 2\/8\/2022: Jen has started a blog!
