What was I thinking!?\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#x1f926;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came to a similar realization recently\u2026 If I\u2019d never left my sales job a few years ago, <\/span><b>there\u2019s a fair chance my wife and I would have reached FI this year. &#x1f92f; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crazy! I could have been \u201cretired\u201d right now, at age 36\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But instead, we\u2019re still many years away from financial independence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you who don\u2019t know, in early 2018 my wife and I left our jobs to begin a 1 year sabbatical. It somehow turned into 2 years off for me, and since then I\u2019ve only returned to part-time work, earning less than 1\/5th of my prior salary. We are now on the Coast FI train, intentionally slowing down our journey to FI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I\u2019m being honest, it feels really shitty thinking about how much money we\u2019d have in the bank if I\u2019d just continued working. Part of me is kicking myself for not taking full advantage of high-income-earning years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, the other half of me is at peace with it all. I\u2019ve accomplished some cool stuff and grown a lot as a person the past 3-4 years. My lifestyle is already much like a retired person\u2019s. If I could go back and change it all, I\u2019m not sure that I would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m still processing all the thoughts and feelings on this, so bear with me if some of this post flip-flops around a bit. There\u2019s a bunch of things to consider &#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Regarding the Money &#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, so, if I never left my old job and kept earning money until today, my guess is we\u2019d have an additional $500-700k saved for retirement. Maybe more. The reason I can\u2019t calculate an exact savings number is because 50% of my salary was commission-based. Who knows, maybe if I had a blowout sales year I could have saved an extra 1M+ over the past 3-4 years. Very possible and crazy to think about!\u00a0 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(It\u2019s also possible I could have been fired or laid off during covid &#8211; you never know).<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, would having $1M more in the bank really change much for me right now? Would I really feel more free, confident, or happy than I am right now?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I don\u2019t know. &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up I\u2019ve always had this recurring thought&#8230; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I just had XXX amount of money, I would finally feel good about things.\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In my early 20s that number was like $100k, then it grew to $500k, then $1M, and beyond&#8230; Somewhere along the way I realized <\/span><b>this might be an unquenchable thirst<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I am trying to chase feelings (freedom, confidence, happiness) that aren\u2019t actually tied to how much money I have in the bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, one of my favorite posts from Mr. Money Mustache is called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2018\/03\/09\/money-and-confidence-are-interchangeable\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money and Confidence are Interchangeable<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here\u2019s an illustration from the post\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64247 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-08-at-4.58.04-PM-e1633922234650.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"555\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This blog post came out right around the time I was quitting my job, and it helped a lot with my mindset shift. My biggest takeaway was that <\/span><b>more money doesn\u2019t actually give me a whole lot more confidence in life.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In fact, I was noticing the opposite. As my savings pile grew, I became more adamant on needing my number to be bigger and bigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would it be nice to have an extra $1M in my retirement accounts right now?<\/span><\/i> <b>YES!!!!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But would it realistically change what I\u2019m capable of in this world?<\/span><\/i><b> NO!!!<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Regarding Personal Growth &#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who\u2019s taken a long sabbatical can probably confirm this:\u00a0 You experience <\/span><b>rapid change<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a person during time away from work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s like cramming 10 years of living into just 12 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without work interfering with everyday decisions, you start to question things&#8230; EVERY thing, in all aspects of your life. Personal development, reflection, your relationships, travel, career evaluation, emotional progress &#8212; you name it, it changes when you quit your job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as the progression of <\/span><b>who I am today<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I can easily say that I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today without dropping work and starting my self-exploring journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">didn\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> leave my job, I might have continued being the same person I was back then. This wasn\u2019t horrible, but I certainly was not the chilled out surfer idiot you guys read about on this blog.<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Oooooh, I just came up with a future post idea about who I was 5 years ago, stay tuned!!).<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Regarding the Lifestyle \u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was chatting with a friend this past weekend and mentioned that I could have been retired by now if I\u2019d never left my job\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His sarcastic reply was, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou mean you could have been drinking beers under a palm tree all day, surfing and napping whenever you please, never going into an office, just relaxing and enjoying life?\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We both laughed, because THIS IS what my life is already like, now. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I happen to have a palm tree in my front yard that we were sitting under.)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Apart from the fact that<\/span><b> I have to still make some money somehow,<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> my lifestyle is already quite nice. Working part time is very much like being retired. And many forms of self-employment offer the same lifestyle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of thinking about the things I don\u2019t have (an extra $1M in the bank), how about I focus on and enjoy the things I already do have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve touched on this a little before within the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stages of financial independence<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026 Once you\u2019ve got a decent sized nest egg and your investments are on auto-pilot, there is a TON of freedom that can be realized &#8212; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">almost<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as much as if you\u2019ve already achieved FIRE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think about the lifestyle I will have as a financially independent person, it might be very similar to what I already do today.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda \u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just 1 decision\u2026 looking back, there are a million little things that I could have chosen differently that would have resulted in more money for me today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I can\u2019t go back and change the past. What\u2019s done is done, and I am where I am right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I love reflecting on the past, I more so enjoy being my rich and happy present self, as well as dreaming of the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wishing you a great week ahead!
