The idea is attractive and inspires so many people. But the truth is that the concept of financial independence or retiring early has been around for a while.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you\u2019ve been reading that blog about the 20-somethings who retired and now travel in a van \u2026 or the 30-somethings who quit their white-collar jobs to pursue their passions \u2026 or the 40-somethings who retired from full-time work to be full-time parents \u2026 you might wonder: What happens later? It looks great one year into this so-called \u201cretirement,\u201d but what happens when the blog runs its course or the money runs out? What happens to their seemingly perfect family life?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m going to tell you about the latter and what I learned as the product of a FIRE family. Let\u2019s fast-forward 30 years, though. I co-host a podcast called<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/friendsonfire.org\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friends on FIRE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I wrote a book about<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2sPIzuj\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">changing your relationship with money<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I have reached FI with my wife and two kids. And while this article is about my life, it\u2019s about my life <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when I was a kid<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and what I learned as a result of it. My parents retired at 42, and perhaps they were part of the OG FIRE movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my dad was in his 30s, he got hooked on the idea of financial independence. He had a good corporate finance job that he enjoyed. My mom worked with hospitals and held a variety of jobs working primarily with recovering elderly patients. They were both successful and happy, admired and respected. And when I was 10 and my sister 8, they both left it all behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I barely remember my parents working. They didn\u2019t leave in the morning, get back late at night, or step away from dinner to take a call. They were full-time parents. And while I knew in my heart that I wanted the same and would lead a life of similar intention, I\u2019m now at the same point in my life where my parents made <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decisions. Upon reflection of my evolving understanding of life, I realize that FIRE isn\u2019t just the best choice for me; it\u2019s the only choice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Here\u2019s what I have learned from growing up in a FIRE family\u2026<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Your Time Parenting Is the Best Gift You Can Give Your Children\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think about Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs, once you can provide physiological and safety needs (think: food and shelter), the most valuable thing you can give your kids is your time. No amount of money can replace the impact a parent\u2019s time and attention can have on a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents were always there. And I don\u2019t mean at every lacrosse game, I mean at every practice, too. My dad helped start the team at my high school and was always around, helping make that experience better for me and everyone else. He was greatly appreciated and admired for it. That involvement was a critical factor in my passion for the game. In college, when I was playing at the University of Michigan, he came to every game, too. And he lived in St. Louis! He\u2019d fly out to Arizona or Utah, Pennsylvania or Florida; it didn\u2019t matter. He came to all of my games. Our parents were there if my sister or I needed help with something, whether it be homework, crafts, sports, or hobbies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64285 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Mike-and-Dad-scaled-e1636346187285.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>You\u2019ll Figure It Out\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents didn\u2019t have some elaborate master plan for what to do with their time, but now after 30 years of not working, they\u2019d tell you that they\u2019ve been pretty darn busy! What many people contemplating retirement struggle with is what they\u2019d do with their lives. My parents wanted to travel the world extensively with us, which they accomplished, but past that, they put themselves in situations to find meaningful opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you go to an office for eight hours a day, the opportunities that come your way are someone else\u2019s, or you\u2019re too busy and tired to engage with the ones that aren\u2019t. But if you are out in your community, place of worship, or neighbor\u2019s BBQ, and you have time and energy, a whole new world of activities presents itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s ok not to have a plan for every hour of your life, but when you have the time and the energy to explore, you\u2019ll quickly be bombarded with an endless supply of opportunities aligned with your values and interests. As a kid, I was fortunate that the activities my parents found to fill their time quite often included me. I realize now that this was by design.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Do It While You\u2019re Healthy\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m 39 now, and getting old sucks already. My parents are now in their 70s and starting to pull back on some of the adventures. But when they were 40, and we spent months traveling the world, they were superheroes to my sister and me. They seemingly didn\u2019t need sleep, could carry everything on their backs, and found a solution to every problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ll permit me a slight digression, a myth I encounter frequently is that working hard in a job teaches work ethic. I can tell you that for the few years I remember my dad having an office job, I didn\u2019t learn a damn thing about his work ethic there. But when I saw my parents overcome obstacles, solve problems, and find success outside of work, I learned a great deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But parents need to be healthy to work hard. In the same way that you can never regain the past time with your kids, you can never have the health you once had. So if you want to embrace your life fully, the opportunities that come your way, and the time with your family, don\u2019t wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64284 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Mike-and-parents-scaled-e1636346178443.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"403\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Knowing Yourself and What You Want Is a Critical Piece of the Journey\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most significant realization of my parents&#8217; decision to leave work is that it\u2019s deeply conflicting. I never thought about what my parents thought or felt making the decision; they were just <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But now I have kids and a career and feel all the same pressures and conflicts they felt. There are many competing narratives of what your life should be, delivered by companies, institutions, entertainment, and social networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are certain pieces of those ideal lives that you can and should adopt, but your life is still your own. Employers want you to have a long, fulfilling career with them, but that\u2019s in their best interest, not yours. Car companies want you to live free and play hard by buying one of their vehicles. Clothing designers want you to dress in the sophisticated manner they market to you and change every season to look the part of your place in society. But none of these things matter. And they drive you towards a life reacting to outside stimuli instead of pursuing what matters to you. The sad part is that for most people, you can\u2019t have both. You can\u2019t have a fulfilling career, drive a luxury car, dress to the nines, and be a full-time dad. I\u2019m more than fine with the trade-offs and my parents have no regrets for theirs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64286 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Mike-and-Mum-e1636346194245.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>You Won\u2019t Regret It<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been following FIRE bloggers for a long time, and I always wonder if they\u2019re truly happy. I like to think they are, but the difference between a fulfilling life and the appearance of one can only be found deep down in those individuals. I hope they have all found their purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have kids (and you like being with them), you\u2019ll understand that there is nothing better. There is nothing more meaningful, more joyous, more rewarding than spending time with your family and friends doing something you all enjoy. Sitting at baseball practice is probably not as fun, but real family time, in my humble opinion, is the meaning of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you decide to leave work, with its title and prestige and paycheck, you won\u2019t regret it if you leave because of family. This isn\u2019t to say that other reasons for leaving aren\u2019t worthy; they most certainly are. Whatever your purpose in life, if you pursue it wholeheartedly, you won\u2019t regret it. And your kids will thank you for it as I have thanked mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents retired when I was 10, and my whole life has been shaped by it. They\u2019ll tell you it was the best decision of their lives. You might have only recently heard about retiring early, but FIRE isn\u2019t a fad. It\u2019s not a gimmick, and it\u2019s not out of reach, although it does take discipline and focus to attain. We all want to live lives of meaning and purpose, but it can be challenging to do so in a society trying to make you broke.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to make a dramatic change in your life, don\u2019t look at it as leaving a career or checking out; instead set your sights on entering a more intentional life. And trust that it\u2019s the right thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64283 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/Mike-and-Family-scaled-e1636346168730.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*******<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mike and his friend Maggie host the <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/friendsonfire.org\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friends on FIRE Podcast<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; where they encourage friends to talk about money more so everyone can grow rich&#8230; together!
