Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start with the more positive test first&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>20 Signs You&#8217;re Financially Stable:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re at peace with your money situation.<\/strong> Yup, more or less.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t fight about money with your spouse.<\/strong> Thankfully!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t use your credit cards often, or if you do, you pay them in full every month.<\/strong> We put everything we can on our card to get the cash back and to budget easier, but then we pay it all off at the end of each month.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019ve got a fully stocked emergency fund.<\/strong> Fail.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A job loss wouldn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t pay your bills.<\/strong> Truth. For a little bit, at least&#8230; Unless we&#8217;re allowed to pull from our investments? (Which I&#8217;d never do! I&#8217;d go in debt before doing that!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Financial emergencies don\u2019t invoke panic.<\/strong> For the most part, yeah&#8230; It always stings though.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re okay with spending money on special occasions.<\/strong> No doubt! Can&#8217;t be obsessive!<\/li>\n<li><strong>The thought of being generous sounds exciting and not panic-inducing.<\/strong> YES!! I get more pain from *not* giving back as much as I want to vs actually giving it&#8230; :(<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re happy about your financial situation.<\/strong> I am.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Saving money has become a habit.<\/strong> Yup! Between retirement accounts and apps that help automate everything (<a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/digit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digit<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/go\/acorns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Acorns<\/a>) it&#8217;s been ingrained for years now.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Others\u2019 opinions about what you have\/don\u2019t have don\u2019t concern you.<\/strong> Ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Paying the bills doesn\u2019t require an in-depth plan.<\/strong> Haha, true&#8230; I love paying bills actually!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retirement and\/or kids\u2019 college expenses are covered.<\/strong> Retirement, yes. College for kids? We could be better about it&#8230; Kinda put it on pause the last few years while the Mrs. was working on finishing up her PHD, so once she&#8217;s back into the workforce again we&#8217;ll be revisiting it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your debt-to-income ratio is below 30%.<\/strong> Yup! In fact, it&#8217;s 0% now w\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/01\/we-sold-our-house-no-more-mortgages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the mortgages gone<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re thoughtful about purchases.<\/strong> I try to be, yes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoiding\/eliminating debt is a priority for you.<\/strong> It was in the top 3 over the years, but never really the #1 spot since we weren&#8217;t dealing with credit card debt or other worse-than-mortgage types&#8230; I typically prefer to invest over paying off low interest debt, but I go in kicks depending on what&#8217;s motivating me at the time.\u00a0 As for *avoiding* it altogether, well, that&#8217;s always preferable, yes, but I&#8217;m not opposed to taking on debt where it makes sense. Like for business or college or even loans to cover <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2016\/03\/borrowed-money-mom-dad-gave-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crap cash flows<\/a> for short amounts of time, etc. You never really <em>plan<\/em> to take on debt if you don&#8217;t have to, but you know &#8211; $hit happens.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You budget or you\u2019re so good at spending wisely that you don\u2019t need to budget.<\/strong> Used to be the former, now it&#8217;s moved over to the latter :) We more or less spend roughly the same every month minus some random events that go down, but I give us enough padding where we don&#8217;t have to worry about it much&#8230; But I&#8217;m still a HUGE proponent of budgeting especially in those earlier stages!! One of the best things you can do! (Which of course is why it&#8217;s in the title of our blog here ;) Though lately it&#8217;s more about *financial freedom* being sexy than anything!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You have a plan for the unexpected.<\/strong> No comment, haha&#8230; Planning is <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2015\/12\/6-things-i-hate-about-finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not my strong suit<\/a>, though depending on the situation I&#8217;m fairly confident we could overcome it. I just don&#8217;t have every last contingency planned or a million buckets of cash spread around for each possible scenario. Hopefully our cash + credit lines + investments could cover whatever might be looming!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You buy appreciating as opposed to depreciating assets.<\/strong> Yup, pretty much&#8230; I don&#8217;t really buy any &#8220;things&#8221; anymore but just little &#8220;experiences&#8221; like eating out or some beers and coffee here and there and those such things&#8230; All extra money pretty much goes into investments these days (or into my kids ;)).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Large purchases don\u2019t create a damaging ding in your finances.<\/strong> I don&#8217;t know what these large purchases would be, but yeah &#8211; we&#8217;d be safe from a lot of them. Or we&#8217;d just finance them if it made better sense and didn&#8217;t screw over our cash flow (see &#8211; I&#8217;m okay with debt! But that purchase better be something damn good like a unicorn or trip around the world or something!)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>How&#8217;d you do?<\/strong> I gave myself a 17 out of 20 as there were some halfies up there as well as one or two that I just suck at&#8230; Here&#8217;s the grading system Laurie came up with for it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>16 \u2013 20: You\u2019re kicking it!<\/li>\n<li>11 \u2013 15: You\u2019re doing very well!<\/li>\n<li>6 \u2013 10: You\u2019re off to a good start!<\/li>\n<li>0 \u2013 5: You\u2019ve got room to grow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>She&#8217;s an overly positive person :) I&#8217;d say if you scored anywhere from 0-10 there are some big issues looming and it&#8217;s great you&#8217;re reading $$ blogs! We all have something we can work on, that&#8217;s for sure&#8230; The important part is that we&#8217;re moving towards the right direction!<\/p>\n<h2>Now to the 20 Signs You Need a Financial Makeover&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/20-signs-you-need-a-financial-makeover\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/sad_georgie.jpg\" alt=\"sad george washington\" width=\"187\" height=\"151\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how similar in concepts these are as I haven&#8217;t looked at this for almost <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/20-signs-you-need-a-financial-makeover\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6 years<\/a>&#8230; If anyone&#8217;s still around from back then <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/2010\/08\/20-signs-you-need-a-financial-makeover\/#comments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">and left a comment<\/a>, you should see how you&#8217;re doing now in comparison! If you&#8217;re not any better I need to rethink this blog :)<\/p>\n<p>Here we go&#8230;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You charge group dinners on your card and keep your friends\u2019 cash to spend.<\/strong> I do, actually! Not a lot, but it saves me a trip to the ATM since I pull out $100&#8217;ish every month for &#8220;spending money.&#8221; Obviously the trouble area here is if you end up spending more than you intended to with all that new <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/how-to-rent-out-your-stuff-for-extra-cash-this-summer\/\">extra cash<\/a> in your pockets.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You spend more than 40% of your total income on rent.<\/strong> Nope&#8230; haven&#8217;t calculated it in a while, but I&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s around 20-25%?<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re constantly transferring your balance to get 0% interest on your credit card debt.<\/strong> Haha&#8230; Some people can pull this off pretty well (and to them I say, way to go!), but a lot of people get tripped up by the small print and lack of paying attention&#8230; It&#8217;s one thing to move over the debt from one place to another as long as the balance keeps going down, but if you&#8217;re continually adding to it there&#8217;s a bigger problem that needs addressing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You pay off one credit card with another.<\/strong> Isn&#8217;t that the same as above?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Less than 10% of your income goes to your retirement savings.\u00a0 (Or worse, zero percent!)<\/strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s not good :( Of course, *anything* above 0% is better than nothing, but the goal is def. 10% and up depending on the stage you&#8217;re in&#8230; You gotta be investing in yourself or you&#8217;ll never break free!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You have a credit card that doesn\u2019t give you anything in return, like cash back or airline miles.<\/strong> Is that even possible these days? I guess it could be, but hopefully anyone reading this right now knows there are a TON of options out there for rewards if you want them. I don&#8217;t believe in messing up a system that&#8217;s working for you to get them, but almost every single card out there does offer some type of goodies these days fwiw.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t know what IRA means outside of Ireland.<\/strong> Hah! That&#8217;s all we invest in lately so I hope I know what it is :) And I hope you do too, even if you&#8217;re not able to contribute yet! You will one day!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You pay the minimum balance on your credit card each month.<\/strong> Not preferable of course, but better than not paying them *at all!*<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t open your credit card statement because you can\u2019t bear to see how high the balance is.<\/strong> I feel for anyone currently in this spot :( If it&#8217;s you, PLEASE please please start facing the music and get a plan in order!! I know it&#8217;s scary but it&#8217;s only going to get worse until you face it! You can do it!! Get a glass (or 10) of wine ready if you need to! :)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t keep receipts because they remind you of what you\u2019ve spent. <\/strong>Haha\u2026 I keep all receipts regardless, but I can see why people wouldn&#8217;t ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You know your company has a 401k plan, but you have no idea what that is.<\/strong> Oh man, this is\u00a0 one of the EASIEST and SMARTEST things you can ever do. Companies are giving away free money left and right, and all you have to do is invest a little to receive it! Something you should be doing anyways! So please PLEASE hit them up if you haven&#8217;t started investing already and contribute *at least* up to the % they will match. There&#8217;s no better return out there, and you&#8217;ll hardly miss the $$$ from your paycheck &#8211; I guarantee it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You withdraw cash frequently from ATM\u2019s that aren\u2019t affiliated with your bank.<\/strong> That&#8217;s actually ALL I do since USAA doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;real&#8221; bank, haha&#8230; Most places are starting to do the same too, at least with online banks, so if yours doesn&#8217;t it might be worth looking into.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The\u00a0number of credit cards in your wallet is higher than the number of dates you\u2019ve had this year.<\/strong> Hahahaha&#8230; Fortunately no, but not by much :) We do need to get better at taking some alone time away from the kids though, which hopefully will be easier now that they&#8217;re getting older (already 2 and 4 &#8211; can you believe it??)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You buy so much on eBay that they\u2019ve awarded you VIP status.<\/strong> Hah. Back when eBay first came out yeah &#8211; I was an idiot &#8211; but now the only transactions that would be going on is them paying ME! They&#8217;re a hustler&#8217;s dream! ;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>You want to start a savings account, but then sale season starts again! <\/strong>Psshh&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t have an emergency fund to pay bills should you lose your job. <\/strong>Def. have one, though not as plump as it once was\/should be&#8230; Our biggest problem area right now.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your monthly extra cell phone minute charges are bigger than your monthly electric bill.<\/strong> Now THAT would be harsh.

Overall though I think we&#8217;re doing okay despite managing a family of four with one not-as-stable income over the past handful of years&#8230; I won&#8217;t be sad once the Mrs gets her career going again though, that&#8217;s for sure!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You spend more on new shoes annually than you save.<\/strong> Yeah right! I think the shoes I&#8217;m wearing right now are at least three years old, and they&#8217;re the *newer* of the bunch :)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Okay, so these questions were wayyy different than the first set, haha&#8230; But actually a lot more fun to answer! Looks like 6 years ago I answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to 3 of these, but this time around only failed at 2 of them &#8211; woo! A 33% increase in status!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How&#8217;d you do?
