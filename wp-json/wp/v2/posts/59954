Haha&#8230; but also the more household income = the more opportunities for everyone too. So score 1 for the Mrs. ;)<\/p>\n<p>And a pretty neat turn around from just a few years ago when she was at home with the kids and racking up degrees&#8230; Now I&#8217;m the stay-at-home parent watching as <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/from-single-income-kids-to-dual-income-kids\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">she climbs that corporate ladder<\/a>! From a $50,000 entry-level job to a middle-tiered $80,000 one &#8211; just under three years! Rockin&#8217; it!<\/p>\n<p>So of course I&#8217;ve got nothing but love for it :) But I know that&#8217;s not always the case in situations like these, so I thought today we&#8217;d use this platform to share any experiences\/tips\/resources we might have for anyone who&#8217;s *struggling* with this shifting dynamic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re a breadwinning spouse, what&#8217;s been working well for you over the years??

Trying to be 100% productive up in here and not add any unnecessary drama to anyone&#8217;s lives :))<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have much expertise or experience in this myself outside the little I just shared, but I do remember this book by Farnoosh Torabi making a splash a few years ago: <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2WfSWRx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When She Makes More: 10 Rules for Breadwinning Women<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2WfSWRx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-59956 size-full\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/when-she-makes-more-book-1.jpg\" alt=\"when she makes more book\" width=\"504\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/when-she-makes-more-book-1.jpg 504w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/when-she-makes-more-book-1-300x243.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a clip off <a href=\"http:\/\/farnoosh.tv\/books\/when-she-makes-more\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">her website<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When she brings home the bigger paycheck the rules are different. Female breadwinners face a much higher risk for burnout, infidelity, and divorce. In <em>When She Makes More<\/em> I present a bold strategy that not only addresses how income imbalances affect relationships and family dynamics, but also how a woman can best manage (and take advantage of) this unique circumstance\u2014emotionally, socially, and financially.<\/p>\n<p>As a member of this growing community, I wrote this book for myself, as well as for the millions of fellow top-earning women in the U.S. and around the globe. It\u2019s the ultimate guidebook for any modern woman who wants to successfully navigate her money, career, family and relationship in the event that she earns more. And all without guilt, shame or fear.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>[Looks like she also came out with a follow up\/revised version of it a year later too: <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2ulyKBu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When She Makes More: The Truth About Navigating Love and Life for a New Generation of Women<\/a>]<span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>There&#8217;s also a fantastic list of *women bloggers* that was recently put out by WomenWhoMoney.com that might help &#8211;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/womenwhomoney.com\/female-personal-finance-blogs-podcasts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Finance Blogs by Women<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Not sure <em>which<\/em> blogs specifically address being a breadwinner (maybe BitchesGetRiches.com?? Or am I totally making that up because they&#8217;re both BOSSES??? Haha&#8230;), but you&#8217;ll definitely find some great new reads to add to your collection :)<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, being a breadwinning *man* in this society can also cause its own set of problems too&#8230; Not in the same ways, of course, but when you&#8217;re raised with the notion of having to provide for your family your whole life it&#8217;s bound to cause a little stress!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said I didn&#8217;t have freak out sessions every now and then providing for my growing family over the years! Especially when we were popping out kids left and right and living <em>solely<\/em> off my blog income.

Haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>So I\u2019d love to hear from both the women and the men out there to hopefully get some well rounded discussions going\u2026 Whether you\u2019re on the side that\u2019s making <em>less<\/em>, or on the one that\u2019s making <em>more<\/em> in your relationship.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The more you&#8217;re comfortable adding the better so anyone who stumbles across this in the future can be helped as well.
