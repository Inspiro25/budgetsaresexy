Problem #1!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the note that got me going, in response to our post Monday on spending money <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/when-spending-money-improves-your-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to improve your quality of life<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, it&#8217;s not so much things I buy (I&#8217;m not good at judging if something I buy will genuinely improve my life), but instead it&#8217;s usually trips I go on that change my life.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s gifts I buy for others. It&#8217;s funny; for some reason it bothers me when I hear of others giving people really expensive gifts &#8211; it seems irresponsible somehow &#8211; but it&#8217;s my giving Love Language, so I of all people should understand the compulsion. There&#8217;s nothing I love more than to find out what someone really wants and to make it happen for them. Particularly if it&#8217;s something they would never be able to afford on their own or would feel right about spending that kind of money on themselves.<\/p>\n<p>I never go into debt for gifts, but as long as I have the money, I have no problem putting down a few hundred dollars on just one gift for someone if I know it&#8217;s something they truly want (and will appreciate it). If someone isn&#8217;t grateful or simply just doesn&#8217;t care about gifts, I won&#8217;t waste my money. But for a giver, it&#8217;s the best thing ever to find people who love getting gifts, because then we are both happy!<\/p>\n<p>I keep a running list on my phone, so if someone makes an off-hand comment about something they would like to have &#8216;someday&#8217;, I try to make a note of it to get for them later if they don&#8217;t get it for themselves. My current gift in the works is a sky-diving experience for my dad. :) &#8211; Leah<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I love more than to find out what someone really wants and to make it happen for them.&#8221; &#8211; so powerful!!<\/strong> And exactly the type of person I want to become!! Already started a page in my notes app to start tracking these overheard things, but I think it&#8217;ll take more than that for me to really get good at this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;If someone isn&#8217;t grateful or simply just doesn&#8217;t care about gifts, I won&#8217;t waste my money.&#8221;<\/strong> &#8211; I think that&#8217;s problem #2 for me :) Not that I&#8217;m not grateful or appreciate any gifts I receive &#8211; it really is a kind gesture! &#8211; but it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t *enjoy* getting the gifts and then most times having to feign excitement, typically at Xmas or birthdays :(<\/p>\n<p>It also doesn&#8217;t jive too well with the minimalist side of things, and I never want people to feel like they *have to* give gifts just out of tradition either. I&#8217;d much rather just spend *time* with you, especially if you don&#8217;t even have the means to exchange gifts, or worse &#8211; are in debt! (Oooooh maybe that&#8217;s a great gift idea for people?? Sending in debt payments on their behalf?! ;))<\/p>\n<p><strong>Although I will say,<em> gifts that come *out of the blue*<\/em> I do tend to enjoy<\/strong> as they&#8217;re usually things people overhear just like Leah was saying which is always magical to receive. Like books or music, or even a framed $10 bill when your blog hits its <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-years-of-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 year Blogaversary<\/a>!!!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/10-years-of-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55687 \" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/10-years-blogging.jpg\" alt=\"10 years blogging\" width=\"556\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/10-years-blogging.jpg 800w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/10-years-blogging-300x210.jpg 300w, https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/10-years-blogging-768x538.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(How thoughtful was that?? Thanks again <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thrivent.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thrivent<\/a>!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a follow up message Leah sent after I expressed just how much I admired her and wished I could be at least 1\/10th as good, haha&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Just so you know, I&#8217;m not always coming up with lavish gifts for people&#8230; It really just depends on the person. I&#8217;m giving a retired teacher friend of mine some old-time radio shows that we&#8217;d talked briefly about and are in the public domain. That costs me nothing.<\/p>\n<p>One day when my mom had a rough day at work I made her a &#8216;card&#8217; (just a single sheet of paper, really), and bought four little gift cards to go with it.<\/p>\n<p>But yeah, gift-giving is in my blood; it&#8217;s who I am. And as a result, I&#8217;ve even extended this same &#8216;match-making&#8217; between gift and giftee to strangers! I did a gift exchange through the mail once for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nanowrimo.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nanowrimo<\/a>, and since I had the real name of my exchange partner, it wasn&#8217;t at all difficult to find her social media profiles and see what she liked. Then I went to Amazon and customized her gift package to represent who she was.<\/p>\n<p>I know that level of detail may seem a bit stalkerish, but it&#8217;s just my attempt to let no gift go to waste. I think no one should ever have to say about a gift, &#8216;Well, it&#8217;s the thought that counts.&#8217; That&#8217;s just sad. A gift is special; sacred, almost. A chance to show how much you really know about that person; to represent the true level of a relationship in your life. It doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive at all &#8211; it can be free, or even an experience or some of your time or a favorite food &#8211; but it should be (I feel, anyway) personalized to that person.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, I feel so strongly about the importance of giving, and knowing that people don&#8217;t always have the time to put into planning these things, I had considered making it a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fivver<\/a> gig once. You know, pay $5 and some information about your person and the budget you have to spend, and I will send you some suggestions? That sort of thing. I don&#8217;t think I did it right though; either that or I had no takers. :P But it would have be fun. :)<\/p>\n<p>Good luck on your next gift giving experience! Hopefully you can start to enjoy it a little more seeing it through their eyes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;I know that level of detail may seem a bit stalkerish,&#8221; haha&#8230; the one time where it&#8217;s totally appropriate ;) And admirable!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So yeah &#8211; how do you go about being more like Leah here, or is it one of those things where it&#8217;s *in your blood and who you are* or not?!<\/strong> I have to think it&#8217;s a habit just like anything else and simply requires some good ol&#8217; fashion practicing, but curious to hear what you all do to be better at this and\/or even appreciating the *receiving* end of giving too.<\/p>\n<p>For extra credit &#8211; how do you cope with sending thank you notes as well??? Haha&#8230; Now those I REALLY hate doing! Again not because I&#8217;m not thankful at all, but it always just feels forced like you HAVE to do it simply out of etiquette. Instead I&#8217;ve been calling and texting my friends thanks and trying to be more genuine about it, but the wife still gives me side eye around it and considers it half-assing ;) Just like <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/cash-gifts-awesome-or-tacky\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when I give people cash<\/a> but who hates getting that??!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So please &#8211; help me reform and pass along all your amazing tips so we can make this world a better place!
