For Erin Carpenter, it doesn&#8217;t get better than this! Not only do you earn extra money with Air Force Reserve jobs, but you also get a retirement check.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>(Side Hustle by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aimhigherin.com\/p\/about-me.html\">Erin Carpenter<\/a>, as part of our <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/category\/side-hustle-series\/\">Side Hustle Series<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m an avid Budgets Are Sexy reader, and I never realized that <em>I, too, was a hustler<\/em>.<\/strong> It hit me like a ton of bricks, and I knew I had to share it with J$\u2019s readers! This may just be the ultimate hustle, because it\u2019s not just a part time gig \u2013 it\u2019s a second career, complete with a retirement check.<\/p>\n<p>By day I\u2019m a special education math teacher at a local high school. It\u2019s a career in which I\u2019ve invested years of time, education and money. I\u2019d always fantasized about serving my country, but I didn\u2019t want to give up my existing career that I genuinely enjoyed. Enter my opportunity: Air Force Reserve jobs!<\/p>\n<h2>How I Got Started<\/h2>\n<p>I called a representative through the AF Reserve <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afreserve.com\/\">recruiting website<\/a>.\u00a0 After a few basic questions (age, drug usage, etc.), they forwarded my information along to my local recruiter. If you already have a degree, it\u2019s possible that you can become a commissioned officer in the Air Force from the get-go. Those already working in the medical fields or ordained ministers can also join under direct commission. Due to saturation of Active Duty members in my area looking to transfer to the Reserves, it was suggested that I enlist and then put in a packet to switch at a later time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enlisting involves taking the ASVAB, a standardized test that tests general skills and determines the career areas that you\u2019ll be eligible to pursue.<\/strong>\u00a0 Enlistees also need to go through medical screening at the nearest Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS), meet height and weight requirements, and go through a background check for security clearance.\u00a0 This process took under a month for me, but it can take longer depending on your medical history.\u00a0 You may find that you require a waiver to enlist if you have a more \u201ccolorful\u201d past, including significant amounts of debt or excessive legal infractions\/tickets.<\/p>\n<p>After a few months, I shipped off to Basic Military Training (BMT) for the Air Force, at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX.\u00a0 BMT lasts eight and a half weeks, and prepares you mentally, physically, and emotionally for military service.\u00a0 The process breaks you down as a civilian\/individual and builds you up as a team member.\u00a0 Upon completion of BMT, I went to Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, MS, where I completed the six week Personnel Apprentice Course.<\/p>\n<h2>How Much I Make + Other Benefits<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Reservists work one weekend a month, with an additional 15-day period each year.\u00a0 Pay is dependent on your rank and the amount of years you\u2019ve been in the military.\u00a0 If you have special duties or skills, there are also special incentive pays on top of it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been in less than two years and I\u2019m an E-4, so my pay for four drills (one weekend) is <em><strong>$259.56<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That may not seem like much to you, but you need to consider all of the other benefits and opportunities that I haven\u2019t told you about yet!<\/strong>\u00a0 In the military, I can get Servicemembers\u2019 Group Life Insurance (SGLI) for $27.00 a month for full coverage of $400,000.\u00a0 I have comprehensive medical coverage for the ridiculously low premium of $54.35 a month as an individual.\u00a0 If I wanted to get family coverage (my husband\u2019s also a Reservist with his own plan; we have no children), it would be $192.89. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you what a savings that is over my civilian employer\u2019s plan.<\/p>\n<p>Now, these are all of the perks I get as a traditional Reservist, <em>but<\/em> the Reserves present many opportunities to pick up active duty orders where I can work full-time at my unit. I take advantage of these opportunities every time a school holiday comes up, and picking up a second paycheck pays off in spades!\u00a0 During these time periods, I make pay equivalent to that of an Active Duty member, $1946.70 a month. On top of that, I collect Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), which is $1158.00 if I\u2019m on orders (and the husband\u2019s not) or we both collect $870.00 if we\u2019re on orders simultaneously. If we\u2019re separated due to training or a deployment, the separated member collects $250.00\/month. for family separation pay. Both of us collect Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) at a rate of $348.44\/month.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Are you adding this up yet?<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0 Those insurance premiums I was paying as a traditional Reservist?\u00a0 Those go away while I\u2019m on orders and I\u2019m automatically covered.\u00a0 This week I went to an eye exam, ordered a new pair of glasses, and filled a prescription, with nothing out of pocket.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also eligible for a VA Home Loan after six years of service, and eligible for the Post 9\/11 G.I. Bill immediately.\u00a0 The more time I put on active duty orders, the less I\u2019ll pay for schooling.\u00a0 If I have three years of active duty service, I\u2019ll receive 100% of my G.I. Bill benefits.\u00a0 <em>Hello Ph.D.!<\/em>\u00a0 Even in the Reserves, I earn college credits in my career field, and with the addition of other credits, I can earn an Associate\u2019s in Applied Science in Human Resource Management through the Community College of the Air Force.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of being a Reservist is that it\u2019s not just a part-time <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/food-delivery-side-hustle-making-40-per-hour\/\">side hustle<\/a>.\u00a0 If I put in at least twenty years of service, I\u2019m eligible for retirement.\u00a0 At the age of sixty, I\u2019ll start receiving a retirement check every month, <em>in addition to my pension in my civilian career<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>Pros to Being a Reservist<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to maintain a civilian and a military career.<\/li>\n<li>Opportunity to pick up active duty orders.<\/li>\n<li>Travel!\u00a0 Some Reservists do their fifteen days of annual tour at a different location \u2013 <em>Aviano Air Base, Italy, anyone?<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Ability to serve locally.\u00a0 You pick your duty station \u2013 there are no military moves every few years.<\/li>\n<li>Paid lodging if you\u2019re outside of the commuting area.\u00a0 If you drive more than 50 miles to your base, they\u2019ll put you up in lodging at their expense.<\/li>\n<li>Free meals on drill weekends for enlisted members.<\/li>\n<li>All of the other benefits I mentioned above \u2013 insurance and education!<\/li>\n<li>Access to the commissary (grocery store) and base exchange \u2013 tax-free purchases at lower rates.<\/li>\n<li>Military discounts, offered by a number of civilian businesses.<\/li>\n<li>The opportunity to serve my country.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Cons to Being a Reservist<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Separation from family, although it\u2019s less so than active duty members.<\/li>\n<li>Deployments, although it\u2019s a matter of perspective.<\/li>\n<li>The mandatory commitments one weekend a month, fifteen days out of the year.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned to hesitate before making weekend plans, until I check my calendar.\u00a0 In some instances, your unit may allow you to reschedule a drill weekend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Success with Air Force Reserve Jobs<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 0px 0pt; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/budgetsaresexy.vercel.app\/images\/erin-reserves-awards.jpg\" alt=\"erin reserves awards\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" border=\"0\" \/>I\u2019ve been blessed to have a number of successes in my short career so far.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been recognized and awarded for my accomplishments, my performance, and the efforts I\u2019ve put forward in my training.<\/p>\n<p>As a Reservist, I\u2019m building a second career in a field (Human Resources) unlike my civilian career, including education and training.\u00a0 This opens up more opportunities for me, if I should ever decide to make a switch in my civilian careers. There are also chances to become a civil servant, and do my military job full-time, again, earning two pensions in the end.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Find Air Force Reserve jobs<\/h2>\n<p>The first step is to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afreserve.com\/\">call your local recruiter<\/a>.\u00a0 You\u2019ll make appointments to see him\/her, set up that appointment to go to MEPS, take your ASVAB, select your job, and sign your enlistment contract.\u00a0 While you\u2019re waiting to ship to BMT, prepare yourself for the physical demands you\u2019ll encounter there.<\/p>\n<h2>Know Before You Go!<\/h2>\n<p>Talking to other Reservists is a great way to get firsthand knowledge about what you\u2019re getting yourself into, aside from the information your recruiter will tell you. Military.com offers resources to help you <a href=\"http:\/\/www.military.com\/join-armed-forces\/asvab\">study for your ASVAB test<\/a>, and there are countless fitness programs online that you can follow. The Air Force even has an app for that!<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a ship date for BMT, Facebook is a great way to find groups of other trainees preparing to leave in your same month.\u00a0 You can also check out my blog, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aimhigherin.com\">Aim High Erin<\/a>, which helps future trainees know what to expect at BMT.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Best of luck if you give it a shot!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;<br \/>\n<em>Erin Carpenter is the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aimhigherin.com\/\">Aim High Erin<\/a>, and the recipient of the 2012 Milbloggie for the Best U.S. Air Force Blog.
