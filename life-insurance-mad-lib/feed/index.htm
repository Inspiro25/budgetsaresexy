					<description><![CDATA[Even though this article is a few years old- It&#039;s relatable today!
I LOVE mad-libs, I would have been one of those guests laughing hysterically. My husband Greg always makes fun of me for them.

Love your site and your articles are always a hoot to read!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OH MY- You crack me up!
1st...I LOVE MAD LIBS.  My husband thinks I&#039;m so silly when I do these with the kids but I just laugh and laugh.

I may have to use your mad lib fill in for a speech one day too- great idea.

Love reading your blog, just very &quot;human&quot; and I can relate to that.

Keep up the good work!]]></description>

Mr. Rounding the Bend, now that you&#039;re close to the end of those decades, are you still happy with your choice of a term of 20 years? Or do you wish now that you had chosen say 25 years or 30?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! My name is Petra and I picked up a term life insurance plan over 10 years ago when I was 25 years old. I currently pay roughly $30 a month for it through a Dutch insurance company, and I am relatively not healthy. I chose them because they already were my home insurer and the offer sounded reasonable, and so far I am pretty happy with them. Plus still alive (yay). 

If I had one piece of advice to give to anyone shopping for life insurance today, it would be to buy term life insurance that lasts long enough for your dependents to become independent, OR long enough for you to become wealthy - whichever comes first. 

    Your friend in finance, alive&#038;kicking Petra]]></description>

Hey, no shame in that! It&#039;s all a comfortability thing, really. And one I personally don&#039;t mind spending on as the extra peace of mind is worth it. But ask me in 10 years when I&#039;m (hopefully!) financially free and rockin&#039; it even more, and perhaps I&#039;ll have a change of heart :)

(Also keep in mind - *most* people do not have large net worths or are on their path to freedom, so for them it would be catastrophic if they passed too early. So I typically lean towards always saying &quot;yes&quot; to insurance since for them it would be an extreme help (and even though investing the $35/mo or whatever is helpful in theory, most people would just end up spending it anyways!))]]></description>

It does get more expensive usually as you get older for sure :( I know some people who don&#039;t insure at all since they have plenty of money to cover them now and forever, but of course it all depends on what &quot;enough&quot; means to you and what your future vision/goals are for those you leave behind. If you think you&#039;d be better off with life insurance, I&#039;d def. encourage you to work on getting some now vs later as we aren&#039;t getting any younger!]]></description>
