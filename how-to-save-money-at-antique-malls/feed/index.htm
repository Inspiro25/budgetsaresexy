					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Verne Halom&lt;/b&gt; - You don&#039;t know why people would leave their goods to be sold on their own? Just think about all that free time you&#039;d have to then make more money or do as you please elsewhere! :)  You just wouldn&#039;t make *as much* that route, but you&#039;d probably more than make up for it in these other areas you&#039;d be dabbling in... 

Cool about asking 10% EVERYWHERE though! I&#039;d never thought of that either really, just assumed it wouldn&#039;t work? Unless the item was damaged or a display model or something - in those cases I ask all the time and usually win :)

@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Apparently not! Both you and Verne up there must get everything cheap! Though I highly doubt you guys ask every time you check out at Target or Best Buy, I&#039;d like to see proof of that in person ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! At least they tried it out - I give them mad credit for that :) But you think $150 or so is a rip off? That sounds cheap to me!! But then again I don&#039;t really know what&#039;s normal out there... and/or outside the DC market which is all kinds of jacked up.

@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I don&#039;t think so either :) But I&#039;d be fine with used clothes that came from them if no one told me they were dead! Haha...

@&lt;b&gt;Joanna @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - What? Really? E-cigs?? Haha.. the only time I&#039;ve ever even HEARD of those was when I visited my friend up in Wisconsin... Is that near where you live? I don&#039;t think they&#039;re popular here on the East coast but I could be wrong... 

As far as testing out this trick at flea markets though, OF COURSE!! You can get way more than that off though - flea markets are all about haggling :) I typically always start my bargaining at 25-30% off no matter what it is (unless it&#039;s like a dollar or .50). But you don&#039;t physically say 10 or 25%, you just throw out a lower number that&#039;s roughly around there, and they 8 out of 10 times will accept it, and the other 2 times come back with something in the middle. So most def. give it a shot!

Oh, and regarding antique mall clientele - it&#039;s typically your older crowds who collect more high-end things. Or rare things. There&#039;s hardly any young people there (like in their 20s/30s/etc), unless they&#039;re just coming with their parents or something. But some are more &quot;hipper&quot; than others which would change things.

@&lt;b&gt;daveM&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! Or the thing has sat here for 2-3 years on end and they finally have a living breathing buyer for it! Haha... Actually my same friend up there just started selling on eBay too and got rid of something that&#039;s been in her stall for 3 years. It took 24 hours online to do it! So now she&#039;s gonna start listing more and be &quot;passively&quot; selling on both sides of the game, which I think is smart... The more people you put in front of your items the better odds of offloading quicker!

@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well I&#039;d NEVER own or run an entire mall I don&#039;t think, but I&#039;d certainly rent a small portion out if I think there were some bucks to be made ;) And/or I struck it rich off this blog and didn&#039;t have to worry about money any more, haha... cuz I&#039;d set up shop just for the fun of it! Especially one that had lots of foot traffic so I could meet a lot of people all day long :) Totally cool!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love perusing antique stores, and have always wondered what it would cost to run a place like that. The one time I asked about running an antique mall, they owner told me I had to be willing to give up all the days of the week, because basically they work 7 days and week and don&#039;t net a ton of cash.

I think you should get into one, though, so I can live vicariously through you!  ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is marketing at it&#039;s finest. Strike up a conversation, get rapport, listen, and close a sale. Probably the persuasive and skilled merchants do quite well there. The drawback is being unsure if there is traffic for your niche.
The mall you visited did a nice job of having the refreshments and cookies, you will think of that mall for years to come.
The point about the discount is well taken. Many people are reluctant to make an offer and will pay full sticker price. We have to keep in mind that the merchant may have no sales that day and will accept a sharp reduction so as to increase his sales.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if that discount works at flea markets as well... we have a great one in our area, and I&#039;ll give it a try next time we go! What kind of crowds frequent antique malls? Our flea market draws in this huge gathering of e-cigarette smokers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My parents tried out having a stall in an antiques/woodworking market like that (they are really into making $hit out of wood). This place had lots of vintage items but a few stalls with handmade stuff like my parents&#039;. They didn&#039;t have to be there at all, just like the place you went to. My parents ended up selling zero items so they got rid of it! I can&#039;t remember what their rent was, but I remember thinking it was a total rip off (maybe $150 a month or something, with a 3 or 6 month minimum contract?!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You never know if you can get something or not unless you ask. Even some bigger stores have employees that will give you discounts at the register and the worst thing that can happen is the person says no and you have to pay full price. Can&#039;t hurt to ask :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read through this post and couldn&#039;t understand why someone would want to set up a shop then hand the keys over to reception for them to look after  business.  Of course there will be better sales when you&#039;re present; the whole sales process is getting to know the customer, understanding what makes them tick, what their requirements are and overcoming their objections.  If you&#039;re not there, there&#039;s no opportunity for the sales process to take place, especially if &#039;reception&#039; aren&#039;t experts or know the goods.  

With regards to the 10% discount, I try this even in some of the chain stores.  Believe it or not, it has worked several times in the past!!! :-)]]></description>
