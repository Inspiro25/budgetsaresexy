					<description><![CDATA[Not getting one!! Started managing my witholding throughout the year, so that I don&#039;t give the Government an interest free loan for the year. I would rather pay a little bit at the end of the year. The good news is with the Tax Law changes (at least for my family) it&#039;s easier since it no longer makes sense to Itemize. 
Love the site BTW, keep up the great content!!!!!]]></description>

Heyyyy that&#039;s cool!!! I didn&#039;t even know you can take kids to that??? 

And smart about replacing the tub too so you at least get *something* good out of it, haha... The only silver lining to big repairs like that :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mostly rebuilding the old emergency fund! We had a plumbing issue the week after Christmas - the ~60-year-old pipe under our tub basically rusted shut, and since our home is in a slab we had to have the tub ripped out and part of the floor torn apart to run a new pipe. Since we had to do that we decided to bit the bullet and replace the old, chipped tub with something new, and fortunately we could just patch the floor since we tracked down matching tiles. But that took a big bite out of our emergency fund, so we need to replenish it.

But we did budget out a bit for fun - we&#039;re taking a mini vacation this summer and bringing our kids for a long weekend at Sesame Place, since friends of ours who recently moved across the country will be out this way and going to Sesame Place has been a tradition with them since we all started having kids. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Refund = vacation fund!  Probably goes against FIRE mindset but want to have some fun on my way to FI.  Was expecting a quiet low key year but now planning a cruise, trip to Vegas (luckily I’m not a big gambler) and a 12 day European trip.  Wishing refund was bigger to cover more of these costs, but oh well.  On the other hand, I always put my bonus into savings so guess I’m not being too bad with my money.]]></description>
