					<description><![CDATA[My favorite yard-sale anecdote comes from a friend whose sister was a super-saler, a Jersey girl who dragged her kids out every Saturday to buy.
One day her 4-year-old boy was looking at the &quot;free box,&quot; and picked out a little Happy Meals toy.
&quot;Those are free, honey,&quot; the yard-sale hostess said.
He looked at her and responded with what he&#039;d heard his mom say so many times: &quot;Would you take a quarter?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and son will be camping out at the annual Cub-o-ree tomorrow (rain at night, predicted-yowza!)  so I will be romping around doing my Yard Sale thang.  I am SO excited!
Nice haul.  I have about 30 silver certificates, and some confederate script that&#039;s pretty cool.  Oh, and about 10000 wheat pennies, all HIGHLY circulated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t even remember the last time I went to a yard sale, it&#039;s been forever. I guess I don&#039;t mind so much since I&#039;ve been decluttering and minimizing. Nice finds by the way. :-)]]></description>
