That seems like a happy medium :) And also shows that having too much money at your disposal could end up hurting you in the end too. We certainly wouldn&#039;t have put down so much if we didn&#039;t have it, but hopefully it was the right decision in the end.]]></description>

ouch! that sucks for sure - and is exactly why I&#039;m over home ownership at the moment. we&#039;ll see how being landlords go, but all I know is I&#039;m gonna be damn happy renting for a while and not worrying about the house in the slightest :)  Oh, to answer your question about the type of wood, I have no idea - just that it&#039;s real wood and sexy looking! Haha... also cheaper than the rest of the guys we looked at.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to be retning out my place soon and that was actually one of the reasons why I didn&#039;t want to go all out with renovations.  Well that, and the fact that I had literally no money in my bank account after I put my 20% down haha.  But now that I&#039;m renting I&#039;m glad I only did about 5k worth of cosmetic stuff since the place is nice, but not so nice that I&#039;m worried about a tenant messing things up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What type of hardwood? Home depot has the engineered stuff for roughly 1/2-2/3 of the real hardwood. You can&#039;t sand it down but it still looks incredible. Also have you gotten quotes from discount stores such as Lumber Liquidators. They can be incredibly cheap compared to the big box stores, especially if its a close out type of wood. As for the carpet in the basement, unless your basement is completely dry with no chance of flooding I wouldn&#039;t. If the carpet gets wet and isn&#039;t dried out real quick mold an nastiness will result, same with the pad. In the same vein, I made the mistake of installing 1200 sq ft of laminate in my basement. I got a kind that was supposed to be more water resistant then most and had just drylocked my basement. Well we happened to get the mother of all rain storms where there was so much water it seeped up through the floor vs the walls. Ruined about half my room less then 2 months after I spent a week installing it. Not a happy camper at that point lol. Nothing but stone tiles or the specialized plastic basement click tiles for me in the future.]]></description>

ack! scary!! I hope you get your deposit back too, but man - who knows.. not sure what we&#039;d do in that instance either :( Nor when (or if) we&#039;ll be selling our place... Kinda just going with the flow and taking one step at a time. And praying it doesn&#039;t get all scratched up hardcore like yours! :(]]></description>

Yup! Our plan is no pets at the moment, or cats on a case-by-case basis. Though we have heard cats can be bad for hard wood too if they pee all over it (acidic?). We&#039;ll see what happens :)]]></description>

yup! would have been double at other places for us too. maybe you can check with friends or family and see if anyone else has some better options for the reno? it&#039;s a ton of money to spend regardless of how sexy it looks in the end :(]]></description>

For sure. I don&#039;t expect them to come out perfect after years of renters, but I&#039;m hoping our selecting process helps a bit and they&#039;re still in decent shape by the time we go to sell one day (IF we go to sell it one day)... Was just hard to justify replacing carpet in the entire house every few years  and paying more in the end. But we&#039;re both so very new at this game so it&#039;ll be a good lesson learned if it goes haywire later.]]></description>
