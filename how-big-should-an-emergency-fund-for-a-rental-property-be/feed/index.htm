Nice way to plan ahead. I guess if the cash is all in your personal emergency fund bucket it&#039;s no big deal if you have enough. The trouble comes when you accidentally spend that money (or invest it) then have an emergency at the rental simultaneously. That&#039;s why I like separate buckets. Easier for my puny brain to visualize :)
Cheers Mandy! Good luck with your tenant replacement in July!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great post! Unfortunately doing this math I quickly realized I only had ~2 months in my reserves because I keep the bulk of my cash in personal savings. A few quick transfers and I&#039;m all set! 

Also, this is a good idea to transfer the money now as I just found out some tenants are not renewing their least effective July. Might as well earmark the funds now to fix things/touch up/plan for a month or two of vacancies, etc.]]></description>

Definitely the pandemic has taught us all a lot about planning for unexpected emergencies. (it&#039;s also surprising how quickly people forget afterwards haha!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I see no reason to NOT be overly conservative with an emergency fund in this case. If/when an emergency hits you may not even need to add any funds to it. 

When running our biz, we always had enough cash in hand to make it through any issue. I think the pandemic shows just how quickly things could turn south with things you’d never expect to occur.]]></description>

That&#039;s great!  Those are two big expenses you don&#039;t have to worry too much about yet.  I don&#039;t know if you have the A/C unit cleaned/inspected once or twice a year, but that does go a long way in extended the life of the units.  I&#039;ve lived in south Florida and North Carolina, and the humidity causes those units to be run hard and often.  It costs me about $89-$129.  As for the Bradford Pears, it stinks to not have trees there right now, but I&#039;m looking on the bright side.  The tree type has shown invasive qualities in NC and is now on the Do Not Plant List for the city, county, and I think the state.  It&#039;s a grafted tree that rots and splits really easily, and breeds with other species to produce even weaker trees in the wild.  Now I will have the chance to plant trees that are either more native or have a stronger wildlife benefit.]]></description>

Hi Shay! No harm sitting on cash right now and letting it build. You gotta do what&#039;s best for your situation and comfort level!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most people actually don&#039;t think about disasters that could happen in real estate. Not having enough emergency cash to float you in case of vacancies is a surefire way to get evicted. 

You have to know what you&#039;re doing in real estate otherwise you will get crushed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m following this with great interest.  My rental property is paid for and I am sitting on almost $25,000 in cash.  My original thoughts were to purchase another property but I am approaching retirement and don&#039;t want another property unless it is paid for and that&#039;s obviously not enough to purchase anything.  Housing prices have sky rocketed and I would make a tidy sum by selling but not quite ready to do that either.  I have a property manager so that is an expense I could eliminate but I&#039;m not particularly handy and I work a full time job so it seems to be a justified expense.  There is a lot to think about.  Including taxes.  Investing the cash would seem to complicate the tax picture.]]></description>
