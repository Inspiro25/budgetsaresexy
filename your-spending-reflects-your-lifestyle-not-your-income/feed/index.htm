					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know J.D. wrote for that magazine. I&#039;ll check it out. I haven&#039;t been reading my PF blogs lately. But I&#039;ve long disagreed with the 80% of income that financial advisers tout. I, too agree that it depends on your lifestyle. 

Financial advisers whether at a bank, credit union or financial company like Fidelity are all there to make money and while their advise is on the money a lot of times. Other times it&#039;s seriously unrealistic.

It&#039;s almost like they assume that once we hit our golden years that all of us are going to be shopping every day, eating out every day, golfing every day, hitting up the salon every day and going on constant trips. They act like we&#039;re going to go on some eternal vacation and while I do look forward to one day quitting the workplace, I know that it&#039;s not going to be a vacation.

Retirement advisers seem to think that the CEO, the accountant, the janitor, and the receptionist need to be on the same retirement plan regardless of lifestyle, income, and location. If you live in NYC you might need more than if you live in the mid-west. 

I&#039;m a female in my twenties, but shopping is pretty boring for me. I usually only go when I need to. My hobbies tend to include reading, writing, movies, drawing, graphic design, etc. Most of those are pretty affordable but if my hobbies were say sailing, or collecting then I would need more for retirement. 

My bf and I like eating out but not every single day and after awhile eating out every day can get boring so we alternate by cooking at home. I really wish retirement advisers would quit treating everyone the same way and customise retirement plans more. Anyway thanks for posting that. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;MariaN&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;the older I get the more money goes on glasses, teeth and hair colour.&quot;  haha... for me, it&#039;s clothes &amp; travel expenses ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Independence&lt;/b&gt; - Right.  10% sure ain&#039;t gonna cut it unless you&#039;re making BANK right now.... and for the next 30 years ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Success for Young Adutls&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, the balance can def. be tricky, esp. as things change over the  years.  I try to ask myself if I&#039;m happy before going to bed every night, and when it&#039;s a &quot;yes&quot; I know things are going well :)  If not, I try and find out why and see what I can do about it... money-related, or not. 
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting. I&#039;ll have to test that one out too, thanks man.
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Pretty pictures keep our attention better, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a nice way of doing it!  Scary as hell (re: medical costs) but def. smart :)
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll be back on track soon enough, I know it :)  You&#039;ve got too much spunk not to starting bringing in that steady income again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The average amount banded around for the boomers is $250,000 for medical expenses.  I took that and indexed to inflation + a few percent more (because health care keeps going up).  I also looked at COBRA so my EF and my amount I need to be making &quot;passively&quot; for financial idependence includes the cost of COBRA which for my DH and I is $550/month.  So I just count what we spend plus that and I think I will be ok for the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s tough to figure out how much you&#039;ll spend when you get older with healthcare cost raising. Those calculators are pretty neat.  I like the FireCalc a lot too, cool graphs. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also like the Flexible Retirement Planner as a tool.  http://www.flexibleretirementplanner.com/java/LaunchFRPWeb.html  It&#039;s closer to FIRE Calc, but runs on a monte carlo simulation instead of historic market returns.  It&#039;s an important distinction if you want to plan for longer periods since the longer the time period you run FIRE calc with the fewer runs it will be able to do. Whereas the monte carlo does not have a comparable limitation.]]></description>
