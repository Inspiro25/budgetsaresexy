					<description><![CDATA[This is a great post.  It is true that you need to start by doing small things to scale back your budget.  An easy way to do this is by shopping around and trying to find as many discounts as possible.  There are many discounts online that most people do not utilize enough.  For example, money can be saved by eating at home instead of at restaurants.  However, what after college job leaves you with the time to cook?  Instead, Restaurant.com offers discounted gift cards to many local restaurants.

					<description><![CDATA[Haha...truth be told, I refused to watch it for a while. But then I got hooked!!!  I know it looks trashy and seems to add zero value to society, but the kids on that show really aren&#039;t that bad.  Once you get to &quot;know&quot; them on the show you can appreciate the craziness :)  Or at least I can.  I think the media makes the show look way worse than it is, but regardless it sure was a hit!  GTL, baby.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post.  Upon reading the first quote, I headed over to youtube to watch some of it and PLEASE tell me you do not watch that show!  haha that is such a joke!

While the principles you talked about may seem basic, I think these basic things are what we often neglect the most.  If consumers were to stop and analyze more purchases in this light, there would be a lot less credit card debt out there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it is imperative to have a financial plan.  Just like if you were going in vacation, you pick a location and then how the heck do you get there ?  If you don&#039;t have a map and just start driving in the general direction than i suppose eventually you might find the place you are looking for.  But what about all the detours that you might find yourself along the way.  Stopping for directions would always be good, but if you had planned the route before you left the house then chances are you would have had smooth sailing (bar any unforeseen circumstances, like a car flat tire or breakdown, just like in real life). 

 If you can get where you are going with the least amount of stress than it&#039;s the best route of all to take.  Get out your maps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good post!  I have also seen the similarities between diet and finances, especially with food diaries vs expenses tracking.  I know some also disclose their food diaries to keep them in check and I am sure that displaying your expenses to the world would also make you think twice before spending.

Summer is an easy way to get caught up in spending.  Kids are home, weather is good, so many things to do and spend money on.  Having a plan and budget is a great way to keep things in control]]></description>
