And now the list of side gigs featured here is over 70 long!

None of them are truly *passive* (and of course none are get rick quick or else we&#039;d all be millionaires by now ;)) but they&#039;re all great for earning extra cash and hopefully having some fun at the same time. For really passive stuff I&#039;d look into investing strategies where you put money in and then let it work on your behalf vs always having to work yourself for the $!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your posts are phenomenal and totally creative. My job requires me to work all day and at least 3 nights per week. Child support takes away anything extra I make for the next ten years. Do you have a list of passive income ideas that are just as lucrative you can share? I love this post because now I know where to send my nephews for work. Thanks again for everyone and their input . You guys are inspirational! Happy New Year ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm....I could be down with the professional public speaking circuit for that much money! Sounds especially lucrative if you just keep giving the same speech over and over and it no longer takes much prep. Plus, everyone is forced to stay there and listen to you!!!]]></description>
