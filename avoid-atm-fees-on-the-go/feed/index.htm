					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I can&#039;t stand large banks anyways.  Bank of America is the worst.  Took me 4 tries to cancel my account last month!  Pros and cons w/ all places but jeez...

I get free ATM withdrawals from USAA too, but if the point is to avoid going to the atm cuz I&#039;m lazy, well, that&#039;s another story ;)  I try to take out $100 in cash every paycheck and live off that until the next one comes.  This works about 75% of the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Micki,

In my town there IS no Bank of America or Wachovia ATM&#039;s let alone a brick and mortar bank for either of those two companies. I think the closest ones to any place that I ever go are in Cleveland, Pittsburgh or Buffalo and those are two hours away from me. I have lots of little local banks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is how I get all my cash: at the drugstore or the Asian market two blocks away. I don&#039;t like going to the ATM because I&#039;m paranoid I&#039;m going to get mugged or have my card compromised by a skimmer.
However, I&#039;d also like to note that my bank will notarize something for me for free. It&#039;s something to ask about so you&#039;ll be ready the next time. That is, assuming the bank was even open when the OP needed the service.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope everyone checks the policy at their bank.  I bank with M&#038;T and my &quot;card&quot; is a Visa check card. I can use it as debit or credit.  In order to get cash back from a purchase I have to use the card as a debit card - and I get charged a fee to use the card as a debit card instead of a credit card. 

Be careful and familiar with your bank&#039;s fee schedule.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shelly @ Coupon Teacher: It sometimes can be hard to remember, eventually it just becomes habit.

Que: Same with us. The bank that has out main checking account is at least 5 miles from our house. There are about 10 around, but it&#039;s like they decided that they&#039;d stay out of a 2.5 mile radius of our house. :-/

Carrie: Good idea. I don&#039;t know if it would work for me since I eat about 3,500 calories a day though!

Ace: Good point! That&#039;s often where I&#039;ll get my cash is at the grocery store. It saves you time and money.

Sense: I&#039;ve been there before, but never used an ATM, and I guess I was lucky.

nyx: Gift cards can also be dangerous. They are basically an interest free loan at best, and if they often have terms that make spending the full amount on the card difficult so they end up being a waste of money.

Curt and Halothane: Ally.com refunds all ATM fees as well. I have had a great experience with them thus far.

Micki: True. I have family that uses local credit unions as their banks, but there is only one location in the world. I always ask them how they&#039;d get money if they were traveling or something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In addition, I would also recommend switching to banks that are more common to avoid ATM fees as well. Bank of America, Wachovia, etc are banks you will find everywhere! As for the local credit union, more than likely will not be in your vacation spot or when your somewhere unknown. Also,I have used that tip above regarding purchasing an item and getting money from your debit cards to avoid CRAZY fees from the ATM&#039;s but YES, stay within less of the ATM fee you were about to pay. What do you mean? If the fee cost $2.50. Go a local store and pay for something less than $2.50 because you might as well pay $2.50 at the ATM if you go over. I love it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are actually accounts you can get where the bank will reimburse any ATM fees you rack up (I believe I have seen this both through Fidelity and Charles Schwab) - while not traditional banks, they definitely make it so you don&#039;t even have to worry if there is a convenience store nearby.]]></description>
