					<description><![CDATA[Reading these never get old :)  Thanks again for playing along everyone!

@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes, not fun wherever you are with a cranky toddler - sorry for your loss too :(  and awesome about your consignment $$!  wow that&#039;s good.
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Woah!  Now that is TRUE hawk&#039;ness.  I look like a faker compared to that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - Nice move w/ the train!  I&#039;d always go out of my way if it meant saving THAT much money.  Unless I had to be somewhere on time ;)
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well then, congrats!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh yeah smoking costs a pretty penny I&#039;m told.  Much harder to stop that than to cut back in other areas I&#039;m sure ;)  But if you ever did it, you&#039;d be rewarded handsomely!  With both $$ and health.
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer&lt;/b&gt; - YAYY!! CONGRATS!!!  Really really exciting time in your life right now - suck it all in, baby!!! :) (and hilarious about Stephan, haha... he probably is!)
@&lt;b&gt;Kristin&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, eating out used to get me too every day.  But I just budgeted it in since I wanted to keep it up and allow it to be the one area I splurge in life.  You can&#039;t force yourself to change if you truly don&#039;t want to ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - Ice Spiders? hahahaha... do I really want to Google that?
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; -  Good call on the credit-back try!!  Sometimes it&#039;s hard for me to ask too, but 9 times out of 10 if you&#039;re real nice &amp; cool about it, esp if it&#039;s the first in forever, they&#039;re pretty good about waiving.  ALways worth a shot for sure - nice reminder :)
@&lt;b&gt;David&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;ve never watched any of their shows fully yet, but I can imagine using the same stories over and over.  When you find something that resonates you usually run with it.  Which is why it sucks watching your fave comedians/speakers more than once or twice cuz it&#039;s usually same stuff all the time.  Congrats on the raise asking btw!! I assume you got it since it was a good money move ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, damn right on that one!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Urkel-Os!!! Ahahahhaha... soooo funny.
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - I know, I&#039;ve been sad all weekend thinking of your situation :(  Need to call you soon too, but Nate and I are playing tag-team with ya ;)  I really REALLY really hope we can find you a (paying) position w/ Love Drop.  It would be an honor to have you on our team and help families together.  Although you already ARE on it! haha... but you get what I&#039;m saying :) Talk really soon, my dear DB.
@&lt;b&gt;rainbowfish&lt;/b&gt; - Ewwww yeah those $5 cards are nasty.  I slip and buy them every now and then, but only cuz they&#039;re so damn convenient sometimes ;)  Esp if those are the only ones at a store the night before the big day!  Big ups for sending money along to help Tuscaloosa - they need more people like you.
@&lt;b&gt;Debbie Beardsley&lt;/b&gt; - But man, isn&#039;t Starbucks such a treat?? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Meredith&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... totally going to find his fan page now :)  Rock on, yo.
@&lt;b&gt;South County Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for blogging about it!! I used to work for a timeshare - and hated every day of it!  I&#039;ll admit for *some* people it&#039;s worth it, but for 95% of the others it&#039;s not.  So good luck, the odds are on your side w/ backing out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - You too, awesome!  Going over now to check out ;)  Crap, can&#039;t leave a comment as I don&#039;t use any of those services :(  Might be worth adding the &quot;name/url&quot; feature on?  But here&#039;s my comment if you wanna see :)

&quot;haha thx for playing along my friend!  (and for the kind words - you trying to make a brother blush??) I&#039;ve gone on and off w/ newspapers but I&#039;m currently off.  I wanted to get coupon section too but never used once!! haha... after all that extreme couponing hub bub tho, I may give it a shot for a few weeks and see what happens.  Just don&#039;t feel like dealing w/ all those phone calls they hit you up with once you cancel! soooooo annoying.&quot;]]></description>

1. Almost falling for a Timeshare deal at the thing we went to. Thankfully we were able to back out and not go through with it.

2.Getting some overtime on my paycheck from working that lifeguard class!

3.If I counted all the money I can save, probably 3-4 months....?????

4.I have no clue what-so-ever... but hopefully he won&#039;t be one of those celebrities who ruins his life. 

5.I say Dave Ramsey. For the every day person, he&#039;s got a plan that people can follow, and I&#039;m game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Biggest mistake: letting my DD buy the mother&#039;s day card for the grandmas; $5 a card
Best: The $50 I sent to a school in Tuscaloosa that is raising money for the schools that were destroyed. 
An extra $1,000: If I buckled down, maybe 3 months. I save that much a month, most months anyway
Urkel: no clue
Sexier: only know a little about each one, kidda do my own thing... I would say it is a tie.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1 - What was your stupidest money mistake this week?
I&#039;m not calling it stupid but going out for a pedicure the day after getting laid off isn&#039;t probably the smartest thing to do.

2. What was your best?
Actually, the smartest thing  actually involved spending money - I bought a new pair of running shoes. It&#039;s easy to put it off because it&#039;s expensive - but, new shoes means less pain, less injury and probably less doctor visits for hurty knees down the line (THUS: SAVING MONEY).

3. How long would it take you to save an *extra* $1,000?
Hmmm. This is a bad week to ask that. It could take awhile.  :)

4. What ever happened to Steve Urkel?
I think he&#039;s still acting, to give a totally boring non-joke answer. Seems like I just saw his name in a movie review and I was like, &quot;holy shit, I&#039;m old enough that Steve Urkel is playing a parent in a movie.&quot;

5. Who is sexier: Suze Orman or Dave Ramsey?
Suze. It&#039;s the hair. :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Worse- my phone. I upgraded for 3-6 months since I picked up a second job for that time.
best- I didn&#039;t spend any money this week. Either I spent too much last week or just too busy.
Save-as of right now 1 month.  When my 2nd job ends way too long.
Urkel-no idea, but he was rather funny
Dave or suze-neither.  budgets are sexy ;)]]></description>
