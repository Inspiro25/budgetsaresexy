					<description><![CDATA[Awwww, that IS wonderful!!  I really admire that about Peruvians too :)  And a lot of other similar cultures that somehow us Americans have not followed suit with for the most part ;) Thanks for stopping by, my friend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI, I am peruvian and I just wanted to add that the wonderful thing about polladas is that most of the people that attend the polladas are poor people ( they most probably also have their own huge economic problems at home but it doesnt matter, they will make an effort and buy at least one ticket). One of the things I am most proud about Peru is how family and friends are first , always!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of the cake-walk.  As a Yankee I had never heard of this, but when I moved to Virginia this was a local way to raise funds for people or places.  To those who haven&#039;t done it, you put numbers on individual donated cakes, sell tickets/raffle for the fundraiser, have 20 folks at a time rush around like musical chairs onto 20 chalked boxes, or 20 taped numbers in the street,  and then stop the music, pull the raffle number and who ever is standing on the corresponding number wins the cake!  Lots of cake walks in the Valley in Virginia for folks with cancer, or financial issues, or local fire departments, etc.  Sometimes it isn&#039;t really cake that is raffled at all - could be anything really.  Fun and you do get to meet the locals!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Amy Lou - you&#039;re very right on that one... I believe it&#039;s in our human nature to support others and probably today the ways of doing it have shifted (for example, giving a hand when a natural disaster occurs on a distant country). Thank you for sharing your Rodeo experience... it sounds like a tight and supportive community. 
@Michael Senchuk - congrats for the land!!! 
@Ginger - thank you for the comment, I think Amy Lou has shown a great example and if other people think like you, it would probably become a more widely used practice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Ginger - those communities do still exist! Perhaps not geographically, ie, by neighborhood. They certainly exist in common interest groups. For example, when something happens to a rodeo competitor, other rodeo families step in and hold fundraisers. I&#039;ve been blessed to be involved in many such wonderful groups of people. In the Rodeo Association where I&#039;ve been a member for more than half my life, we have many, many fundraisers to help others in our rodeo family; houses burn down, children critically injured, family deaths... This practice isn&#039;t exclusive to rodeo people... It happens all the time. Relay for Life is another wonderful example. As long as there are human beings on this planet, we will be taking care of each other.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is a wonderful idea if you have a supportive group of family/friends.  I sometimes wish the US still had those kind of communities where people banded together to help each other.  A little example would be people bringing over frozen casseroles when someone gave birth or there was a death.  Now people just buy frozen meals.  I wonder if the recession may cause the younger generation to start building a community, I know I&#039;d like to try to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting, especially since my wife and I bought some land in Peru last fall, and are currently in talks to develop it. I checked out his blog and bookmarked it, though I don&#039;t speak Spanish yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, first of all thank you for allowing us to post on your blog.
@Melissa - frequency depends on multiple variables, but clearly one person or family can&#039;t organize this events so frequently, since they are reserved for emergency situations.
@cashflowmantra - yes! I&#039;m sure people in different countries and cultures have similar fund-raising events... and of course this is one of many other &quot;creative ways&quot; to solve a money emergency.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great idea.  Sounds like the fundraisers that might occur here in the States for individuals facing large medical bills for cancer treatment or a transplant.  People are always ingenious at problem solving.]]></description>
