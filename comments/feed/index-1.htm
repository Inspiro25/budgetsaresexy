					<description><![CDATA[We used an earlier version of these resources and paid a lawyer friend hourly to look over what we came up with: https://store.nolo.com/products/marriage-domestic-partnership
I think I paid $450 or so for my lawyer and my now-husband didn&#039;t end up hiring anyone because he didn&#039;t want to pay for it. 
Looking forward to your next post]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the more regular postings!!!

No prenup here (I was 24 and had read exactly one book about personal finance, which involved how to make a household budget). 

No dog to decide about, but inclination would be to share if needed. 

I’m curious what the terms of your prenup are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great read and inspiring post! Indeed: Build a life you are excited to retire into.

A family member of mine retired very suddenly (because she was exhausted) and consequently did so without having prepared any lifestyle tools to help her navigate this &#039;new normal&#039;. 

Therefore, I&#039;m all for the idea of a sabbatical. To me, it comes across as a bridge wíth a safety net.

Thanks!]]></description>

It&#039;s great when you can feel secure enough to let a little loose with the budget. I haven&#039;t regretted my increased spending!

I love the idea of volunteering in order to get total control of your own schedule.]]></description>
