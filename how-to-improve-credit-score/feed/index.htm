Yup! Exactly why I mentioned them at the end of the blog post - they&#039;re bad ass! And while you&#039;re in there you might as well pick up your credit score too and get it all done at once :) Though that part is not free, but it is cheap...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to point out what everyone seems to miss - you can actually get THREE credit reports a year for free.  
 Annualcreditreport.com lets you access your credit report from the three main credit bureaus. You can order your report for free from EACH of them once a year. 
 So, you can either order your report from all three once a year, or you can get the report from each bureau at a different time throughout the year. 
   The latter is our preferred method, this way we get a look at our report three times a year to make sure everything is correct and looking good.]]></description>

Same boat here. 23 years old, 730-740 credit (should changetowards the up, just paid off last couple K on my truck cause I got sick of interest) And end of September my Capital one $300.00 back of the wallet credit card FINALLY hit 2 years. My girlfriend rolls her eyes at how amped this stuff gets me. ;P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I have read at least 15 different articles on credit score and what to do and not do to increase it, but you still had my full attention when reading your article! I can&#039;t agree more that it doesn&#039;t really matter how much you make but what matters is how you handle money! One of my friends has a low-paying job, but she has always been very responsible with her cash. When her car broke down, she was able to get an almost-new car for $0 down at an interest rate of 3.2%! 

Another point in your article that I like is that no credit fixing company can do more for you than what you can do yourself. Just pass up this additional expense! Of course, unless your debt has gone to collections. 

I personally use my credit card all the time and then pay it off. It&#039;s because I get 2% cash back bonus and other rewards for using it. So every month I end up with an extra $20-30!]]></description>

my coworkers and I follow the cc rewards a lot since we don&#039;t have corp cards.  The plus of closing accounts is you can reapply for the same bonus in the future (usually after ~2 years) or to keep your avg age of account from getting too diluted.  It&#039;s less of a ding to have the credit inquiry than it is to have your account age become undesirable. Along those lines it&#039;s better to close a newer card instead of an old card you don&#039;t use, unfortunately.]]></description>
