Awesome! I&#039;ve heard about this for small businesses - I think &quot;cloud kitchens&quot; are becoming popular too for several restaurants to share resources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the list. I have another suggestion: kitchen rental. Good for those people who have cooking and baking side-hustles who may need a kitchen area with more space and better equipment.]]></description>

Yep, I know what you mean about seeming creepy! Also with COVID and such that adds another layer of weirdness! 

Congrats on the AirBnB success! So good to hear!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool! I love the idea. I guess most of my stuff is not in very good condition to rent. However, I have rented our house through airbnb for more than 10 years, I have loaned our home through home exchange and used other people houses. All great experiences. A great thing for the environment. I&#039;ll check some of the options you posted. I looked out of curiosity the rent a friend one in my area, after all I have a free afternoon... it&#039;s a bit creepy though, I have to say.
