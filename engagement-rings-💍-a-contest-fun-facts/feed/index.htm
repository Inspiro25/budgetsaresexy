I&#039;ve never heard that saying before - it&#039;s marketing genius!

There&#039;s something so cool about matching plain gold bands. Nothing flashy, just a symbol that means something to you and your spouse. Nice!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We chose not to get me an engagement ring! It&#039;s not the norm in the country my husband is from and I&#039;ve seen so many of my girlfriends turn into green eyed monsters comparing their ring to others that I was happy to opt out! Me and my husband wear matching gold wedding bands. On the other hand (literally!) I wear a pile of bling. And it&#039;s all bling I&#039;ve bought myself! Bonuses, birthdays, etc. De Beers (the inventor of the diamond solitaire for engagements) had an advertising campaign in the 80s I believe that said, &quot;Left hand for WE, right hand for ME&quot;! so they could sell more diamonds to women!]]></description>

This is an awesome way to look at wedding bands. Maybe we should rethink the way use them. Maybe we should exchange them at engagement, since this is the real start to the commitment.]]></description>

Fast food, tax advantages, and cheap rings! What a great story haha. I&#039;m hearing a lot of people go for the silicone rings these days - didn&#039;t know they were that cheap!]]></description>

Awesome compromise to have both rings from both sides of the family!  I&#039;m with you - simple looking is more my style than flashy big ones. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the option of not 1, but 2 family heirloom rings. My grandmother left me her wedding band and engagement ring when she died, and my husband had his grandmother&#039;s ring, which was also his mother&#039;s ring (she&#039;d had a new one made later on as an anniversary present so wasn&#039;t wearing it anymore). I knew it was important to my husband to have the engagement ring from his side of the family, so he proposed with that (I&#039;d never seen it but knew about it), and I used my grandmother&#039;s wedding band for my wedding ring. I still have the engagement ring, and only one unattached brother so hoping he&#039;ll want to use it someday. Either way it&#039;ll stay in the family somehow. We did have to get a new setting for the diamond (1/3 ct. emerald cut), and had the wedding band dipped to change from yellow gold to white gold. The total cost for the setting, dipping, and a white gold wedding band for my husband was $950 if I remember correctly, which was almost 1/4 of our wedding budget (we ended up spending more than that total thanks to generous gifts from family, but the total wedding cost was I&#039;d estimate in the $8-10k range for 120 guests). I love having rings from both sides of the family, and the also the fact that they are not gaudy or ostentatious which is fine for some people but not my style at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I got engaged/married over $8 of food at Panda Express. We&#039;d been dating for a while, he&#039;d recently lost his job with health insurance, and I mentioned out at lunch one day that in our state (Kansas) common law is a thing: you pretty much just decide you&#039;re married then file taxes together the next year. If we common law married, he could be on my health insurance. We knew we wanted to be together regardless, so he asked &quot;Will you common law me?&quot; Yep! 

We didn&#039;t purchase any rings, but after a few months, my stepson (11ish at the time) complained that I kept on getting hit on while he and I were out and about together, and he didn&#039;t like it. Guys figured I was a young single mom, and somehow that brings on flirting? No clue, I didn&#039;t know that could be a thing. But I decided to order some silicone bands since I dislike wearing metal rings. Got a pack of 5 rings for about $12, so $2.40 a piece? I also ordered some silicone rings for my husband since shortly after we married, he opened his own handyman business that has been going great. All in all, it&#039;s worked out quite well.]]></description>

Hahaha great story! It&#039;s the thought behind it that counts, not the filthy plastic baggy or the horrible timing :)   Gives you something to laugh about later in life!

I also don&#039;t have expensive tastes. But, it&#039;s nice when people spend money on you and show you affection in a way that&#039;s meaningful to them. I&#039;m glad you like the ring and recognize the beauty, not the societal crap!

Cheers for sharing, Tracy!]]></description>

Wow I didn&#039;t know about moissanite stones. And I only recently learned about lab diamonds. It&#039;s cool to see people getting more creative and hopefully nobody looks like a jerk if they are putting a lot of thought and effort into the decision.

That&#039;s funny how you were dressed when you proposed! :)  Looking silly definitely wins you pity points and increases the chance of a Yes. Nicely done.]]></description>
