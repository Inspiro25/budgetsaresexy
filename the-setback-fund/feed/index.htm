Oh yeah, that realtor is history.  She seemed to think I wanted something already done, overpriced, and in a dicey neighborhood rather than the worst condo in a good neighborhood.  One unit actually had the bedroom window facing the garage exit where 60 residents park their cars.  GAH.

I love taking people out for bourbon!  I have a friendly aquaintance with the owner of a bourbon bar in my neighborhood, and we met  there with an Italian rockabilly band so we could all do as many flights as possible.  That night ended with me explaining to the Italians that hugging Chicago police officers is not a good plan. Even if you are saying &quot;Thank you for your service!&quot; in English. 

I do like them simple, though.  I tried fig and blueberry, but ewwww.  And don&#039;t get me started on the lavender whiskey trend.  If I want tea and flowers, I&#039;ll get tea and flowers.]]></description>

You need a new realtor! Haha..

I was DYING over here pouring over them - they&#039;re great! 

Most especially that “Beer, bourbon and excessive fun” fund :)

Tell me you&#039;ll treat me to one of your favorites if we ever meet up in real life? I don&#039;t know much about bourbon but I&#039;d love to! Always enjoy it whenever I *remember* it&#039;s an option (which is rarely)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do the multiples to make myself realize &quot;I CAN buy this, but I CAN&#039;T afford it.&quot;  Please don&#039;t judge, and keep in mind as a single person in a great city, I live small. At least, that&#039;s my excuse for the following account to be funded at a higher rate per month than my rent:

&quot;Beer, bourbon and excessive fun.&quot;  This is for an emergency of the entertainment variety, as it seems there are months out of the year where EVERYONE comes to town right when I&#039;m at the end of the month...  Or when one of my photo clients says &quot;Hey, we comped you a room, if you jsut want to relax for our two-day shoot.&quot; (yes, please.  But now I need underwear)

Others of mine have been/are:
&quot;The cat can&#039;t die&quot; (I take it out of the beer fund.  How bad would I feel if I couldn&#039;t treat the cat because of my beer budget?)

Shit breaks.  This fund is currently broken, as I lose phones. However, neighbor gave me their trade in. so WIN.

Toys

Summers without bartending (I&quot;m a teacher who once thought working in the summer sounded great. never again.  So... since I work 37/52 weeks, I try to save 28 percent.)  Miserable failure at that this year, but a tax return will cover my malfeasance this year.

Second Act.
This is when I allow myself to spend money on a hobby that might become a twilight career.  Currently photography.  Has also been used for additional teaching certifications, and sometimes just to buy bourbon at a networking event.  Because I hate networking.

I also separate my fixed expense account from my discretionary fund.  I like this because I need that flexibility.  Some months I eat out more and that has to be higher, while the grocery bill goes down.  Sometimes the car bill is low because I had to spend it on uber. (remember, I have a healthy bourbon fund)

Also separate account for money going in/out on my rental condo.  Easy way for me to see that it&#039;s paying off or not.

And.. I will say, when applying for a mortgage, my realtor HATED these accounts.]]></description>

Hi Kristina,  

Ally is currently paying me 2.20%.  When I left Capital one 360 earlier this year they were only paying 1%.  I had been with them since they bought ING Direct.  Over the years it seemed like they were getting less and lass competitive.  So far I have been happy with Ally, they give me the same ability to create sub accounts on the fly that  Capital One did.

Also on a personal note I never forgave them for charging me a late fee on a credit card many years ago for paying my account one hour late.  I was on west coast time and they informed me the payment was calculated via eastern time.  I’m much more responsible now and would never wait that long but still it felt good to finally be Capital One Free lol.]]></description>

I like that idea of selling your kids&#039; stuff and then stashing the money into their accounts :) I might have to try that idea as it might just help my kids WANT to finally get rid of some of their stuff! Haha...]]></description>
