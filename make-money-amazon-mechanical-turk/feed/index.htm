					<description><![CDATA[I have been working at this for a year now and I have made 1,000 in total. I only have 3,732 hits I work about 8 hours on this 4 hours during the morning and 4 hours at night. I do everything from the 0.01 to the 2- to 3 dollar ones. Pretty much everything I have noticed though recently that there are so many people posting now that are just rejecting people for no reason. However I am still trying to get to the 5,000 hit range my friend is making about 10 to 50 dollars a day after she hit that mark. I probably will not hit 5k this year but still working at it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank God for such generous corporate tech overlords to give us low paying work so we can do more work on top of our other work so that we can maybe hopefully someday get out of debt and buy a home.  Thank you corporate overlords.  What would I do without the opportunity to work 80 hours a week below minimum wage?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/make-money-amazon-mechanical-turk/#comment-252612&quot;&gt;Josh B&lt;/a&gt;.

I agree  with Josh.

Hello everyone,I saw this post and just wanted to put in my  2 cents.
 I am 3 months in. The first few weeks were low but then my earnings started going up . I now transfer $100. every week into my account (CASH STRAIGHT TO MY BANK)...This is working about 4-5 hours each day. I have worked  a little longer days during one month and earned $150. those weeks. I average $400.-$600 per month just working at home. I began with a little 7&quot; Tablet that&#039;s 8 years old and very slow. I recently bought a laptop and it&#039;s much easier. 

Be encouraged,It can be done if your&#039;e willing to devote some time to it.

I am facing one problem though: I will soon be moving to the Philippines and $600. monthly is a sustainable income there ( it&#039;s like earning $3,000 in USD) but I cannot get paid in cash...IF ANYONE HAS ANY IDEAS HOW TO GET AROUND THIS, PLEASE COMMENT!  Is it possible to get paid in cash while on &quot;Vacation?...Know what i mean?..I will still be a US citizen with my same address on my Mturk account. Please share any info you have on this topic..Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/make-money-amazon-mechanical-turk/#comment-247603&quot;&gt;A load of crap&lt;/a&gt;.

If you aren&#039;t able to make over 40 dollars a week on mTurk you might as well stop doing it. I make well over 100 a week. Honestly I used to make more. Now the majority of my income on turk comes from the requesters who assign it privately. The published ebook and promotion of Mturk is going to ruin it. When batches go up now they are gone in 15 minutes. There are way too many workers and it is a battle of who works the scripts better to grab the HITs. Articles like this and selling ebooks to get people to sign up will quickly make it worthless to anyone. There isn&#039;t enough work for the people who already have account but more sign up everyday. This also drives the wages into the ground. Requesters don&#039;t have to pay anything because someone will do their work no matter how low the pay.]]></description>

I am 13 days in and I have made $227.00.  Each day gets better and better.  You learn quickly how to use scripts and forums to maximize you time on working worthwhile HITs.  It is definitely within reason to make $100 and up per week.  On a side note, many of the tasks are fun.  My wife thought I was insane and wasting my time until I transferred a little over $200 to my account after 11 days of working it.]]></description>
