I finally caved and let Mr. Mt buy the shiny toy he has wanted the last 8 years. As we were driving home all I could think was, &quot;Crap, now how am I going to explain this on the blog?!&quot; =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It takes major guts to swallow your pride and ask for help...and that goes doubly when it&#039;s an area you&#039;re supposed to be great at. I give this guy a lot of credit for stepping up and taking action. 

Knowing and doing are just not the same thing.

Great food for thought.]]></description>

Great point! I did not ask, but you&#039;re right - that could certainly skew things. Probably too hardcore for someone trying to get back on track, but not others who could be reading this. So thanks for sharing it :) Reminds me of when my company would match in that way so I&#039;d turn up the heat to 90% of my paycheck going to my 401(k) until it maxed out and then had the entire year of plumper paychecks :) Which I couldn&#039;t have done without having side $$ coming in (and making it even more motivational was that my employer matched 100% of 100% you put in - which was unheard of!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does your friends 401(k) have a &#039;true up&#039;.   Some firms will match your 401(k) based on your payments for the entire year - not just based on what was contributed each paycheck.

Primarily this is for people who max out their legal contribution early in the year (so can&#039;t contribute say for Nov/Dec), they will still get a match for that period.

Seems like your friend could contribute the maximum for the rest of the year (my employee limits it to 50% - up to the legal annual limit) and maximize his match for 2014.]]></description>

That&#039;s because there is no &quot;right&quot; thing :) Statistically there may be one, but most people don&#039;t live their lives based on numbers as our feelings tend to creep in. So my opinion has always been to just &quot;do what feels right&quot; and then as time changes, and different life events occur, adjust and keep asking yourself &quot;what feels right right now?&quot; You can never go wrong paying off debt or saving/investing as either route grows your net worth.]]></description>
