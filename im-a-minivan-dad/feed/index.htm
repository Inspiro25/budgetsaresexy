					<description><![CDATA[I had a minivan (as a single young man!) for years and LOVED IT. 

I could fit dogs, surfboards, everything. It&#039;s the only car I miss. Got a prius to spend less on gas, but man, I loved the Man Van.]]></description>

Hey, congrats on the upcoming addition! It really depends on your comfortability and finances, but typically the lower terms you can get the better... I&#039;ve had them from 36 months to 60 months (!!) before, but in almost all cases I paid it off way sooner anyways. And some people will still recommend financing it even if you have the cash! (so they can maximize the dollars by investing/etc...). Really just depends on your overall strategy and comfort with it all :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This article came at the perfect time! I have two kids and am anticipating a 3rd in the near future.  Trying to convince the wife that the practicality of a van is the way to go!  The sliding doors along convinced me. 
I have a question for everyone.  What type of terms should I be looking at?
J. Money I saw that you had a longer than 36 month term on one of your recent purchases.  Thoughts?
Thanks all!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went the opposite way: I downsized my car from a four door to a two door. 

Just before Christmas I bought a 2016 Smart ForTwo with 17,000 miles on it for $10,700 (including shipping from Washington to Texas). I purchased it through TrueCar.com and sold my 2014 Nissan Cube to Carvana. I paid cash as well - I never thought to ask if I could put it on a credit card! Since I knew exactly what I was looking for (model. color, trim level, etc.) and had driven a Smart before, purchasing it online wasn&#039;t a problem for me. I did a FaceTime call with the dealer so he could show me the car (which is in practically perfect condition). I loved the whole process - by far the easiest car purchase I&#039;ve ever made! And selling my old car was just as easy: I filled out a form online, brought it in and they transferred the money to my account within a day or two. Quick and painless, which are two words I have NEVER associated with car sales!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on becoming part of the minivan team! I myself have been driving a Honda Odyssey for 2 and half years and have loved it. I started off with a 2011 Odyssey because my husband bought it for my birthday even though I was against driving a minivan for so long lol but once he brought it home and we started driving it my kids and I loved it, it was exactly what we needed to maneuver around easier. Just last year though we traded in our 2011 Odyssey for the 2019 model and we have loved it. I am pretty sure you will love it just as much as we do, now we don’t know what we were waiting on to get one prior to our first minivan since I was driving a 2016 GMC Sierra with 2 toddlers which was so not comfortable when traveling and dinging all the other cars doors when trying to get kids out.]]></description>
