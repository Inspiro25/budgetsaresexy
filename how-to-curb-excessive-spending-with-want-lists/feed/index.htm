					<description><![CDATA[Agree with everything but the bike, and I&#039;m glad to see a few others on here with the same sentiments.  And that&#039;s the coolest thing about FI!  You drastically cut the spending in the thing that aren&#039;t important to you so that you can spend extra on the things you really want.  If that&#039;s a bike, Great!  If that&#039;s not a bike, Great!  

Happy want listing!]]></description>

I think we&#039;re birds of a feather on this topic! Photos are really all you need. Use whatever &quot;play money&quot; to have a nice time while you&#039;re THERE, vs. bringing home crap. Course, I went against my better judgement this trip with the watches and chocolate, but I don&#039;t travel alone overseas much these days. If Mrs. Cubert were with me, she&#039;d help keep my spendthriftery in check! :-)]]></description>

Haha yeah - I always envision a pile of cash next to the item I want and see which one excites me the most :) Usually the cash wins, but not always!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our first few overseas trips we did the whole souvenir thing and realised how much clutter we&#039;d accumulated not to mention the wasted money. Our family aren&#039;t keen traveller&#039;s so we figure if they want a souvenirs it&#039;s a good time for them to get themselves overseas (not working as yet :p). Now we just send a post card which fits in with our minimalist values and resist buying ourselves anything as well - there are only so many shelves and walls! To me our photos, memories and the occasional ticket stub is our souvenir :) 

I enjoy watching the occasional House Hunters episode but thankfully never feel the urge to buy any 4000 squre foot home with 3.5 baths and 5 bedrooms and a huge backyard as I am pretty content with the time it takes me to clean our current humble abode and pretty keen to keep it that way ;) 

But definitely think of the nice things we could have or upgrade but my thing is always asking myself &#039;do I hate this enough to spend the money on it&#039; and that usually gets it off our list :)]]></description>

Great point, LeeAnne. We&#039;ll see how disciplined I stay with this wish list approach. 

And I can certainly relate to buyer&#039;s remorse *before you even get to the register!!* Ha! Done that MANY times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re human - I think it’s common to have our moments of “wanting to keep up with Jones’s”.  The question is do we act on that feeling.  I like the idea of writing down our wants and thinking them over.  I’m also one of those who picks up an item, puts it in the cart, walks around the store and then talk myself out of it (most times!).  I do agree with others though that some times you do have to splurge on yourself and enjoy life - especially on vacations. (Of course, still within reason.)  I would be so bummed if I traveled somewhere but was so thrifty I missed out on the adventures/experiences of that area.]]></description>

It sure is expensive! I&#039;d have been happy with a Domino&#039;s deep dish after all that 20E pie. Man...

So, what&#039;s your secret for finding the cheapest (and best) chocolate to haul back to the states??]]></description>

Thanks man! I agree with you. Combine those dollars with the experience = recipe for good memories. You don&#039;t have to overdo it of course. But enjoy yourself while on vacation, especially if you&#039;ve worked to obviate airfare with credit card hacking!]]></description>
