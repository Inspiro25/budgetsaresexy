					<description><![CDATA[Too funny (odd)
I just read a sad comment about Warren Buffet and since I have a weird “connection” to Jimmy Buffet I wondered if they were related.
That is how I arrived at this site.
No worries (or hopes) about being in Jimmy’s will! If he remembers me at all, it will be as the agent who bruised his pride!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No - I&#039;m not being sarcastic.  I was quite surprised when I received my results.. Also I found that I am related to Leo Tolstoy from my dad&#039;s side.  I have 3 stars appearing on my 23andme.com profile from Jimmy, Warren, and Leo.   You have my email address if you would like to contact me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I received my DNA testing results from 23andMe it turns out I am related as a distant cousin to both Jimmy on my mom&#039;s side and to Warren on my dad&#039;s side.  Should I appear in a article with them as the genetic link between two unrelated Buffetts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J this is so flipping random and I love it!  Not something I&#039;d ever even thought about, let alone thought I read about...I am definitely down with the cheeseburger (make mine garlic fries, thanks!) though; wouldn&#039;t that be a cool chat?

My personal belief?  Mr Buffet, of the frozen concoction, ought to be named a saint!  He may not have invented it, but he sure brought fame to the drink favored by so many.  I know you&#039;ve given it up for Lent, but your days are flying by and that yummy margarita might be the way to celebrate your days of sacrifice.

On the other hand, being a beer snob myself, I&#039;d stick with the beer.  Whatever you choose, cheers to you!!!]]></description>
