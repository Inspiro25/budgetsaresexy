					<description><![CDATA[Congrats J$!

My favorite charity is Pencils of Promise. Just $25 is enough to pay for one kid&#039;s education for a year! Also, 100% of your donation goes directly to educating underprivildged youth. My buddy Blau is running a campaign to raise $25,000 to sponsor an entire school http://3lau.com/. He&#039;s well over half way to that goal and I think you should strongly consider donating through his site or directly at http://www.pencilsofpromise.org/]]></description>

My favorite &quot;charity&quot; is NPR... it&#039;s the way I stay informed about most things. They have a lot of in-depth reporting on a myriad of things. I heard one about prison camps in North Korea the other day.]]></description>
