					<description><![CDATA[Haha... and I&#039;m sure those 10% are putting in 99.9% of the time and passion to get there too!  It&#039;s no coincidence the hustlers get to the finish line a lot faster ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome post my friend, enjoyed reading it, im pretty sure everone would love to be a pro and live the poker life, shoot I wouldnt mind it at all but it is not an easy thing to do as they make it seem. Im still shocked at the 90% of online people are losing money, but it must be true cause I keep seeing the same 10% making a living at it lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, man, this stuff was HUGE just a few years ago - pretty crazy how things have calmed down lately... but good for your friend for killin&#039; it and taking advantage when he could, that&#039;s awesome.  And I share your dream of playing in the World Series of Poker one day!  That would be tight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally know someone who won $250k in one cash on party poker a few years back.  There&#039;s also a few others who also went to my high school that went pro.  This post was obviously written before Black Friday, and now the only sites available to Americans are basically filled with sharks.  But the point I want to make is a lot of it is timing; the guy I know who made the $250k cash built his bankroll on $100 and $200 sngs, playing 8-12 at a time.  He was a college freshman during the &quot;golden age&quot; of poker where ppl really didn&#039;t know what they were doing, so he could make a high profit margin on these games.  Today even the best players only make a few % profit margin, and it varies greatly.

I personally only play now every once in a while for fun.  Yes, I try to win, but I am not going to put in the hours to build a bankroll and try to make consistent side income doing it.  I do hope to play in the WSOP some day, but probably in a lesser event (i.e. $1.5k event vs. $10k main event).  I still love to see what&#039;s going on with poker and the culture surrounding it.  It&#039;s really intriguing to see the kinds of people who built their life on the game as well as how they move on from the game (if they do at all).

Love the post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, that&#039;s why I don&#039;t try it full-time ;)  As much as I&#039;d LOVE to!  I&#039;m way too emotional...  I wish you could have seen all the other comments here, there was a great discussion going on before they got wiped away (I had to switch from Blogger to Wordpress and lost &#039;em... boooo)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a boring job. My dad used to gamble a lot, but only in person.
It seems you are pretty disciplined so you can make money at poker. I think a lot of people are more emotional when they play and I guess that&#039;s why they don&#039;t do well.]]></description>
