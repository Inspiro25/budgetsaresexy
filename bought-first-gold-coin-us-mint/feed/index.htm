					<description><![CDATA[I am not really worried about everything being digital, but I do think that gold pieces are a good investment.  The only problem I see is the spread or commission you pay to purchase and sell gold really hurts the ROI.  Diversifying is very important and adding gold can&#039;t hurt.  Like Tyler S. said that is a lot for ounce of gold, but it is pretty cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; - I know!! Real freaky if something should happen later... bleh.
@&lt;b&gt;Einstein&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah - it&#039;s def. a fun buy/investment ;)  Doens&#039;t do much but it sure looks pretty!
@&lt;b&gt;Christopher @ This That and The MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Beleive me, if I&#039;m buying bars I&#039;m not gonna be blogging about my net worth anymore ;)  I don&#039;t see myself going that route though anyways unless I hit the millionaire one of these days (Mega Millions is up to $500 MIL btw! Crazy!).  I don&#039;t believe in the apocalypse THAT much ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I think that would be worth something in a worst case secnario ;)  And in the meantime you can enjoy the beauty by wearing &#039;em!  Unlike my coin, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jules&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhh really? That is so cool!  And yes - you better remember some time in case something shall happen! Haha... I remember a story back in the day where the dad died and the kids found THOUSANDS stashed away up in the attic and no one ever knew about it (or *how* he came across all that money). Guess he didn&#039;t have time to explain :(
@&lt;b&gt;Modest Money&lt;/b&gt; - Right now it&#039;s more of an insurance/curiosity kinda thing, but I&#039;d consider selling it for sure if the timing/price was right.  But more than likely I&#039;ll keep it and hand it down to future generations :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh I&#039;d love to see one of those things in my collection! Wanna sell one to me? Haha... I still have my GLD funds too (and a lot more of it), but something cool about being able to hold it in real life :)
@&lt;b&gt;John &#124; Married (with Debt)&lt;/b&gt; - Ya never know ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Leigh&lt;/b&gt; - I actually agree with you 100% :)  Though not sure it&#039;s at the peak here - people  have been saying that for years, even when it was at $800/oz.  But yeah - as of today I def. bought at the high point.
@&lt;b&gt;Squeezer @Personal Finance Success&lt;/b&gt; - True that, but I can use the gold to buy guns and food and all ;) To someone who wants to then use the coin for something that&#039;s important to them (there will still need to be some sort of universal &quot;money&quot; I&#039;d imagine - not everyone would want to trade him something for his guns if they already have enough).
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, yup!  It&#039;s nice to cross it off the list :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... yes, but can I jump into mine a la Scrooge McDuck like you can?  Nope ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m pretty sure if it came to that, you&#039;d gladly have my coin that 1 gun when I could by like 20 w/ it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooooooh I am so interested in that!! Just read your post - that is great man.  I am SO going to do that one day! haha... a bag of cool coins like that??? Shoooooot... even w/ the world remaining in tact, that would be awesome to have :)  Thanks for the info my brother, you&#039;re a smarty.
@&lt;b&gt;The Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - Oddly enough I just bought a skull and crosbones pirate flag ;)  Arghhhhhh...
@&lt;b&gt;Jefferson&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I can understand that :)  Luckily this thing came in that big box you see there, and the coin itself is inside some plastic thingie so I can&#039;t even touch it! Haha... probably a good thing though cuz I&#039;m sure I&#039;d smudge it all up and what not... but def. hard to lose unless I forgot where I hid it or something.
@&lt;b&gt;Emily McCormick&lt;/b&gt; - I love ancient ones too!  Much more cooler in my opinion, but I guess they don&#039;t satisfy the &quot;gold&quot; part of this latest experiment for me :)  But for pure &quot;awesomeness&quot; - I&#039;m totally with you there.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Wowww totally!!  Back then gold was SUPER cheap :)  I wonder if Goldschlager gets more expensive as gold rises? Haha... if you&#039;re a liquor drinker you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about.
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yea.  Win-Lose situation or Lose-Win situation :) Guess that&#039;s what hedging does for ya...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In high school,my sister went on a trip to Alaska and brought back as a souvenir for me a vial of gold flakes in water. It was about 1/10 of an ounce of gold. They actually sold it for less than the spot price of gold. It was $10. Unfortunately, I lost it in a move, because now that $10 investment would be worth 16X as much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re a coin collecting family, and my husband is dreaming of the day that he can get a gold coin much like you have - but we&#039;re waiting. The price of gold is just so high now.

I like ancient Roman coins myself, but that&#039;s how I roll.

The coin is beautiful.]]></description>
