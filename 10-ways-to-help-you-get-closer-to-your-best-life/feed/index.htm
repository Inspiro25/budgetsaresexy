That&#039;s cute :)

Did they save all the notes? My oldest son still has his from years ago when my wife would slip in pictures of things to brighten his day... She eventually ran out of things to draw, but now that he can read I&#039;m working on doing something similar like you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My boys took lunches to preschool in the summer, and I wrote a note on their napkins and signed it &quot;Dad&quot;. The preschool teacher had to read it to them, but it brightened her day as well.

Most of the times when I send my wife a text I end it with &quot;XOXOXO&quot;.

My suggestion to everyone to get closer to their best life is to be generous. I mean very generous. The ones you listed are good and proper, too. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ll start putting love notes in my husbands lunch.  Everyday of the work week, even if I have the day off, I make his breakfast and lunch.  If he has the day off and I work, I just put it in the fridge for later.  After 30+ years he expects it (I guess) but when he changed jobs and the people he works with found out they were amazed!  The first time he said thank you in years made me want to cry.  I don&#039;t do it for thanks, just because I want him to eat healthy and filling meals, but the reminder that I&#039;m appreciated meant so much.
What I&#039;m getting at is this: Just a simple &quot;Thank you&quot; for something that people do all the time for you can make a huge difference.
So J$, Thank you for all you put out in the universe for us. : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow J!  Just wow!  Opened my eyes to lots of new and different ways to follow my mantra, which is CHOOSE KINDNESS.  The back-up store is awesome.  Not taking the last brownie is a Hall of Fame move. Thanks again for even more thoughts about changing my mindset for the better.]]></description>
