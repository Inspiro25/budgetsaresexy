I know a few people that try to do electricity-free days a couple times a month. Fun little way to cut back :)]]></description>

Really? Maybe it depends on the type of A/C unit you&#039;re running? I&#039;d like to see the real data they use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice tips!  Here is one more to add to the stack: 
Get a box fan, and put it facing out in one of your open windows at night.  Crank the fan up and open all your other windows.  This will blow the hot air out and suck the cool night air in through your other open windows.  In the morning, close all your windows and curtains to lock the cool air in.  

Even on 100+ degree days our house stays cool well into the afternoons with no AC!  The key ingredient for this to work is a big swing between night and day temperatures.  The bigger the swing, the better it works!

Our first summer of doing this we saved a total of $120 off our electric bill without changing our thermostat setting . . . and the box fan only cost us $9 on craigslist!  That&#039;s a 1,333% annualized ROI . . . We beat the stock market AND sacrificed zero comfort!

Cheer!

That&#039;s so cool! The struggle is a constant reminder that A/C is actually a luxury in life - one you have to work for! I agree that you get used to being warm over time. Apart from the odd heatwave, I&#039;ve always been able to acclimate to where I live, and enjoy the heat.  Love your blog btw  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some great tips! One thing I&#039;ve been doing, that&#039;s sort of unique to me, is that my air conditioner only works if I turn it on, go outside, and use a long screwdriver to nudge the fan to get it spinning. It would be a simple fix (though the risk of zapping myself into oblivion looms on my mind) but I&#039;ve toyed with leaving it. It encourages me to hold off as long as possible in turning it on, and run it to a certain point and then turn it off. Even this weekend with temps in the 90s (very hot for us up &#039;nort folks!) I ran it for a few hours in late afternoon/early evening. Doing a lot of the above helps a lot in reducing the use! Last year I just didn&#039;t use it at all. I find if you don&#039;t use it all the time, you get used to the warmer temperatures.]]></description>

Wow I didn&#039;t even think about the rust! That&#039;s crazy and definitely a good reason to keep air flowing! Good work on the fan, they are lifesavers :)]]></description>
