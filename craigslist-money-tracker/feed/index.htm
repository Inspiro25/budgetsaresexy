Great tip! I&#039;m actually no longer on Facebook anymore (i never leave that place happier than when I got there?) but I&#039;m gonna forward this to my wife who loves that site :) Not a bad idea to list anything that doesn&#039;t sell off CL there too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Selling items on FB resale pages is far better than Craigslist as far as being harassed by scammers (I have been more than once).

I always have to fill out the receipt myself which is already signed at the bottom. I typically just guestimate the values and keep it on the lower side, but if you want to make sure you&#039;re doing things right check out this valuation guide by Goodwill:

http://www.goodwill.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Donation_Valuation_Guide.pdf

Salvation Army has one too:
http://satruck.org/donation-value-guide

I then staple a separate sheet of everything I donated to it which I do before I throw it all into a garbage bag or box to donate. It takes an extra minute or two to do it, but BOY does it save you time later and make it easier on yourself. Once you know what you&#039;ve donated you can easily then add &#039;er on up and you&#039;re done :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When you drop your items off at the Goodwill do they fill out the receipt for you or just sign it and hand it to you? They do the latter to me and I never know what to put down for the value of the items I donated. If they do the same for you how do you determine the value?]]></description>

There you go! A *guaranteed* win right there :)

Right now I mostly sell stuff I already own from my house since I haven&#039;t been out yard saling or thrifting for a while (having babies curbs that! :)), but I do pick stuff up every now and then and try to flip for a good profit. That&#039;s a really fun game to play and I don&#039;t have a problem at all trying to work it like that so long as I&#039;m not acquiring stuff that I can&#039;t offload! The old me would have just kept it all for myself, but now I get the pleasure of both sides - owning it for a little bit and then making $$$ off it soon after. Win-win!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J$ I was just curious, do you only sell items you already own or do you buy items at garage sales/thrift stores/flea markets to resell? 
 
PS Thanx for all the PF tips. I took you up on your suggestion about the $$ jar. We played the lotto every week for years, no luck. This week we finally quit. Putting the $6 weekly we used to spend into the jar.]]></description>

Hah! Yeah, some items are just much harder to offload than others I find. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an economy type thing. Though the seasons do play a roll too and some stuff is more wanted than others. 

Now I just keep &quot;renewing&quot; all the items that sit there until I can&#039;t renew anymore and they&#039;re expiring. After lowering the price here and there until I hit the lowest I&#039;m willing to take. If it&#039;s still a no go by the end of it, it&#039;ll go straight into the donation box along with a few others that have sadly made it there... But at least they all leave my house at the end!]]></description>
