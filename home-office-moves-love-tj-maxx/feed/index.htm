					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahhahah... drinking?? at 8 am?? haha you crack me up girl ;)  I TOTALLY love Rugged Wearhouse too!  Just wish there were more of them closer around... gonna think of angels now everytime I look at rugs, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Kim&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh glossy red sounds cool!  It&#039;s totally cold down here now too - only we have nothing to warm it up yet :(  Maybe time for another fake fireplace? Aww yeah!!
@&lt;b&gt;Daisy&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Daisy!  I&#039;ll try and convince them to come up your way ;)  You guys love deals too!!
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, great idea for sure.  And you know I would DEF look into that too, but no way in hell the wife is gonna allow that ;)  &quot;It&#039;s too weird&quot; - believe me, I asked... but it&#039;s all good, I don&#039;t mind running the show down there for a little while... we&#039;ll see what happens when/if I get bored, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - IKEA! IKEA!!! Haha... I wonder if you&#039;re out and about right now as I&#039;m typing this up?  I&#039;d totally give you all my candy if you stopped by, haha... I used to like Idea a lot too, but then everywhere I went the rooms were decked out w/ them - now it bothers me.  If you&#039;re good at blending it in w/ other stuff though, I&#039;ll allow it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Now that you think of it, I totally meant to blog about my desk first!  From Craigslist!!  It&#039;s dope.  Well, if you like green and browns and &quot;old stuff&quot; haha... but it&#039;s what got me to get down here to begin with -- I needed something exciting to get me to clean up! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! I refused to use mine at all until it looked nicer ;)  And since it was up to me, it took ove 5 years! Haha... but now all is right in the world again.
@&lt;b&gt;Barb Friedberg&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Barb! Me too :)  Tell your daughter I say hi! (That sounded bad, didn&#039;t it?)
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle@Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s what I&#039;m saying!  Even my wife at first doubted my curtain skills ;)  Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jon &#124; Free Money Wisdom&lt;/b&gt; - OOoooh I LOVE Adidas pants!  Esp the one w/ the old school flower logo - those are hot.  Well done!  (And I promise to do my best to stay out of girl stuff, but I can&#039;t promise it ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ Afford Anything&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, you should!!  As long as you get bargains and can relate it back to money, of course ;)  Sometimes I have to stretch, and others I don&#039;t care cuz it&#039;s such a nice break from writing 100% about money sometimes, haha... you know what I&#039;m talking about.
@&lt;b&gt;Jason&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I&#039;ve always been jealous of those who can rock the living room like that :)  I just can&#039;t work well on a laptop unless it&#039;s just pure typing... I always have like 10 billion screens open at any given time, haha... maybe I can blog during commercials though?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have an office space in my basement, but I almost never use it.  Most of my work is done on a side table in my living room... which is where my laptop stays 95% of the time.

Maybe in the future I&#039;ll start to utilize it more, but for now my living room has been a fine working space!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweet! I love those stores because of the great bargains on almost everything. Whenever I travel, my mother gives me list of things to buy from Ross, TJ Maxx and Marshalls. lol. I always thought that the idea of using a curtain panel as a shower curtain was cool. Men everywhere should be inspired!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking good! I have to say though, that this is an interesting choice to start on your new office. The first thing I showed people of mine is the enormous desk I have (yep, more space to organise but...). And the blues - cool, calming...It looks like you will continue writing cool posts!]]></description>
