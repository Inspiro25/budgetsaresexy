					<description><![CDATA[I agree I have heard of people who say you should have an account for every goal but it seemed like that would add a lot of work. 

Right now we are still at the physical decluttering. So I haven&#039;t really looked much at accounts. But we did close a bunch of CD&#039;s 3 years ago when we did aggressive debt pay off so we have less accounts now. 

One thing I do know is that we take advantage of automation. And that does simplify our money management]]></description>

Haha, there you go :)

And at least you know *how* to do it as you&#039;ve done it once before! This time though it&#039;ll be in much better circumstances I would imagine?]]></description>

You know it!

I also like that minimalism mentality of &quot;one thing in, one thing out.&quot;

If you follow that there&#039;s no way to over-clutter again! it&#039;s just swapping in older stuff with better stuff in theory :)]]></description>

And now REALLY want to see a picture of that motorcycle trailer, haha... please tell me it&#039;s a trailer you attach to a cycle - like for storage or something cool?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember the days of minimalism - mine were unintended but very much enjoyed. After a divorce 6 years ago, I arrived back in Canada with just 4 moving boxes and a bike. It was so liberating, and truly left me feeling like anything and any road was up for grabs.

I love the road I&#039;ve chosen, but now find myself with a huge farm house full of stuff that is not mine...and a barn...and a workshop... and.. and.

The challenge to boil it all down to what we need is overwhelming. 

I&#039;ll start with getting rid of debt ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me, &#039;simple&#039; and minimalist have always come easy--seem to be in my genes. Lots of stuff around and overflowing closets make me nervous. The more stuff there is around, the harder it is for me to find something that I really need. Now I just have to get my spouse on board. ;)]]></description>
