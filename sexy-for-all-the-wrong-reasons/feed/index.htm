Good point! I shouldn&#039;t make fun - you&#039;re right, this is a legitimate search term. J$ must have posted an article about this in the past and that&#039;s where people must land searching for this.  And now that I think about it, might be a good topic to post on again! My gramps had dementia and had assets and stuff that needed management.]]></description>

There were some other very weird ones that I left out too. There were over 2000 search terms I was looking through in the report! Maybe I&#039;ll do this again in the future.

Happy Friday, have a great weekend Fiona.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The last one is actually legit. As you get older, especially if you have a family history of some sort of dementia and don&#039;t trust or want to burden family members, what do you do? Obviously, they&#039;d be using your money to pay your bills and you&#039;d have to pay for the service but how much should you pay and how do you know they won&#039;t steal everything. You&#039;d be surprised at how many older adults fall for the your grandson is in jail send me gift card scam - definitely a sign they could probably use some help....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy Friday Joel!

This is the blog post I needed to read to start off my day :)
Thanks for sharing this - and I&#039;m not going to lie, some of those search queries had me crack up and laugh :) 
Sounds like BAS is being found through many different (and interesting) search queries these days... lol

Cheers,

Fiona]]></description>
