You&#039;re a natural!

That hat would make me happy too - I love hats :) I basically have to wear one anytime I don&#039;t put my &#039;hawk up because it looks so ridiculous when it&#039;s down, lol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I barter from time to time without even thinking about it. 
Some examples: 
- I made a cake that a friend liked and wanted to order one for her family. I told her I didn&#039;t take orders but she offered to give me one of her handmade hats she was selling on ETSY in exchange for a cake. Somehow this made me happier than if she just paid me in cash.
- I borrowed a leaf blower in exchange for coffee from a local cafe. Bonus - we got to go out and spend quality time together.
- A friend offered to let me borrow her kids toys and I brought her food when I picked them up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband does construction &quot;side jobs&quot; and over the years has bartered for a trailer, wood stove, car vacation and so much more.  I have to agree with the first comment though,  you can&#039;t pay the mortgage with a trailer! He never lost money though. I will give him that. And we still barter stuff : )]]></description>

Love it! 

My kids actually just tried paddle boarding yesterday on a lake and thoroughly enjoyed themselves :) Well, they enjoyed &quot;falling&quot; off it I should say as their cousin was actually doing the paddling while they sat on the edge of it and when they found out how much more fun it was to fall into the water than stay up top dry, they kept &quot;accidentally&quot; doing it over and over and over again ;) More than one way to enjoy a sport I suppose! Haha...]]></description>

AHHH I Never finished that book!! I read the first half of it where he got from the paper clip to a keg of beer and neon sign i want to say, and then I helped a family member back up their stuff for a move and it somehow got bundled up and lost forever!! Have to make a note to pick it up from the library finally and continue it... It was super fascinating and he eventually did get to the house! (And then a million people tried copying him and failed, lol...)]]></description>

Fun!!

Food trades are the best too because if you don&#039;t use it up they&#039;ll go to waste!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s refreshing to hear this is alive and well! We were ahead of our age in college, when I would take notes for classmates who were working, and when I brought them notes they covered my dinner. Favors or Bartering? 

I also have a friend who is very good with fixing bikes. He fixes them up for a few of us, and in turn I let him borrow my paddleboard and detail his car. Friends help friends and if that&#039;s friendly bartering then I hope it continues!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This makes me think of Link&#039;s Awakening,  Great game... maybe it was the Ninetndo-esque squid at the beginning of the article. 

Also, that person that bartered their way up from a paper clip to a house.

Also, Also, I&#039;ll trade you this sweet Air Guitar for a 6-pack of Beer.  Anything over $10, No college beer tho...]]></description>
