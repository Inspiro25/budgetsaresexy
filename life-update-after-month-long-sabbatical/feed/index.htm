Oh cool!

I don&#039;t know of others really, but would love to stumble across more as the movement gets more popular.. (it&#039;s def. a lot more so now than it was 3-4 years back!).

funny you can&#039;t stand Kondo - I feel people either love her with a passion or hate her with a passion, haha..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back! Missed having the posts in my inbox everyday. 

You have surely had an eventful summer. Great tip about updating the insurance coverage. The amount of insurance you have paid for the ring reminds me of a time when we had some things in storage. I get that sometimes it is necessary to do this, but it used to frustrate me to no end that we spent more money on storage fees than the value of most of the things in the unit because they were our things. #facepalm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oof, sorry to hear about the health stuff, hope you and the little one are recovering quickly. Loved the Playing with FIRE doc, couldn&#039;t stand Kondo. I wrote about both, feel free to check &#039;em out if you feel the urge and have the time.
Do you know of any other films in a similar vein? I just checked out Painting Anna upon a rec from Angela @ TLRE. Looking for more to enjoy and review.]]></description>
