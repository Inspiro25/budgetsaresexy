					<description><![CDATA[Question for The Critter Depot. Your avg sale was about 26$ the first year and then 43$ the second year. It is now up to 73$ per sale. That is really impressive and amazing
 As a fellow small ecommerce business owner Could you share insight how this is achievable with your products only being in the low 20$ range?]]></description>

Bingo.  If the caretakers have a younger pet, then it makes more sense for them to select the 500 or 250 count of crickets, because a younger pet won&#039;t intake as much as a mature pet.  J.Money, sound like you have some experience in the art of product pricing?]]></description>

I noticed that too right away - thought it was brilliant! And I bet people still pick the lower ones even if it&#039;s not *as good* a bargain so they don&#039;t waste crickets (am I right?).]]></description>

Thanks for the compliments.  I&#039;ve been reading up on Sam Walton and Jeff Bezos, and figured a $20 flat rate price was not only a great price, but simplified the decision process for the buyer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome story. Also, just looking on your website the professionalism shines through. Very good prices (man, if only you were around our ends 10+ years back :) - have never seen flat package prices) and guaranteed live delivery, I am amazed. Please don&#039;t be offended, but I have to state that I kind of hate these sneaky little bastards. You have all my respect that you can handle them as you do. As a former tarantula breeder, bought huge amounts of them. They are noisy and their cooperation levels are very low when you want to feed them to spiders (however I cannot blame them, would do the same in their place). They are great from a nutrition perspective though. In the end, we replaced them with superworms for the smaller spiders and cockroaches for the medium-sized ones, those are much easier to handle. So kudos to you, this is a business I would not like to do because I know exactly how much time and effort does it require. It would drive me insane. :)]]></description>

I haven&#039;t tried them either.  And they do offer some intriguing health benefits.  So I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing if they can provide both health and wealth into my household.]]></description>
