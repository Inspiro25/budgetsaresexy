I agree with this. If you have talked to him about it before and he didn&#039;t change, it&#039;s because it&#039;s your issue, not his. You can try to &quot;convince&quot; him of the benefits of saving money, you can manipulate him through tears and guilt trips, and you can even give him ultimatums. But you can&#039;t make him change. If you don&#039;t see concrete steps (ie him reading books on personal finance, making a budget, talking to you about it) within a couple of weeks, I&#039;d say it&#039;s a lost cause.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did this after college when my BF at the time wouldn&#039;t stand up and grow a spine (not financially), and it was wonderfully freeing to stand up for myself and stick to the standards I wanted in my life. 

I couldn&#039;t disagree more with MandyT&#039;s assessment from the lens of my experience. I was willing to work with him and compromise and grow together, but when I laid out very basic principles that were important to me, he told me point blank he wasn&#039;t willing to try changing anything. That&#039;s so frustrating - why should I be the only one in the relationship to change and grow? How does that make sense? We&#039;re all flawed and we should all be addressing our faults, but it&#039;s not one partner&#039;s job to do all the changing and growing, nor should they have to direct all the change. That&#039;s exhausting. We should accept our own responsibility, naturally, but that doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t get to be frustrated if our supposed partner won&#039;t work with us as part of a team until we&#039;re perfect.  

Grow together, y&#039;all!]]></description>

Amen on that last one...

If he&#039;s not motivated after &quot;the talk&quot; then there&#039;s no hope.]]></description>

Could be correct there, if you&#039;re assuming all men are tameable ;) We also don&#039;t know how much - or long - Elle has been bringing this up over time, though I am glad we are seeing different opinions here as you&#039;re right that it takes two to tango.]]></description>

I still feel like I&#039;m in my 20&#039;s too, though I just hit the big 4-0 (!!!).

When you&#039;re old like me you&#039;ll have all those debts paid off and sitting much prettier :) Keep on going!]]></description>

Agree and I have a similar story here. We&#039;ve been married 3.5 years and have progressed further down this path with similar income trajectory. Congrats to you, Megan and hope that everything continues well for you!]]></description>
