Awesome Donna! I wish I had heard this message more when I was younger. The education never stops!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article! Thanks so much Joel - have sent this to my sons, all 4 of them lol!! 
I&#039;m such an advocate for continuing education once school finishes - in fact, that&#039;s where the real education really begins, right?!
Enjoy your weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was horrible at math. I think my grades were not much better than yours. I live in Belgium, Europe and our school system was one of the best of the world for years, so thats also a bit of an excuse.
Although I did finish a Master Degree in something not Math-related, the last job I had in my working career was beeing responsible for a big budget for maintaining 16 University campusses. I always thought that was hilarious, but apparently I did a good job.  I stopped working 5 years ago at age 33 and since then my husband and I have been supporting our family with three kids with income from our investments. My husbands insists the financial independence part of our life has all happened because of me and the way I use our money.
So yes, everything is possible if you just focus and keep your goals clear!
Have a nice day,
Angelina]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/math-personal-finance/#comment-309600&quot;&gt;JASON BROWN&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Jason! Yep, so much of personal money management is about mindset and basic behaviors. Math skills certainly provide a potential advantage - but nothing trumps behavior and good habits - which we can all learn pretty easily.]]></description>

Me too! The way we are taught resonates different for each person. I&#039;m an &#039;applied&#039; type of learner, so formulas don&#039;t make sense without a backstory and real world example attached :)   Cheers Christine!]]></description>

It&#039;s sad that people shy away, or use &quot;bad at math&quot; as an excuse not to take any action. Glad you know where I&#039;m coming from and are helping encourage people to think differently!  Cheers MMW, have a wicked Friday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My goodness, point #3 resonates. If it weren&#039;t for a spreadsheet that J$ posted on this here site years ago I wouldn&#039;t be half as far along as I am toward FIRE. Everything we do is on the shoulders of giants; even those with the best ideas would never get them implemented without the efforts of talented colleagues and friends. All we&#039;ve got is varying shades of attitude, luck, privilege, and inspiration.]]></description>
