					<description><![CDATA[Good article. 

One other way to save money this week is to eat leftovers in the cabinet instead of buying new items.  It&#039;s amazing how much we all have in the cabinet for a rainy day that never comes. 

Thx.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Give your wallet/purse to your friend and tell them not to give it back until after the weekend&quot; cracked me up a lot! I did that in high school then the next weekend, it was already missing $10! I would stare at my friend and point at my fingers at her.

					<description><![CDATA[Smart boy you got there J. Money...I guess the fruit doesn&#039;t fall far from the tree as they say. :) Sarcastic or not, he does have a point.  It really doesn&#039;t take a rocket scientist to explain how to save money.  Start small and keep adding...the more the merrier. But the key, is to start!  :)]]></description>

Haha.... well, I&#039;ll have to disagree with you slightly here, but overall yes - people generally spend way more on their cars than they should. But I only mention that to them if I hear them complaining about having no money ;) Some people like cars as it makes them feel good (myself included) and are good about prioritizing their $$. So to those I say keep on going! It&#039;s all about goals and aligning up your purchases to help meet them. Doesn&#039;t matter to me how people reach them as long as they do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice and clear. I continue screaming the same ideas all day long and people just pull out their list of excuses. The shift is not tactical, the shift has to be mental. 

The silver lining is that the more that we continue repeating the same message the higher the probability that some one will listen. 

My number one tip is: Get rid of your freaking car... I idolize automobiles. We all the new car sharing network, this dream is becoming closer to reality. If you do have a car. Why in earth do you need to spend a lot of money on it. A car is a tool, nothing more than that. 

Thank you for letting me rant as well.]]></description>
