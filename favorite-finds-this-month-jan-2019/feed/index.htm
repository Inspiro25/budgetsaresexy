Very true on that..  And a point my wife likes to bring up anytime she&#039;s trying to convince me to think about going back to owning too :) It take at least 4-5 days for things to get looked at here at our rental which drives her nuts...]]></description>

Haha!  Thank you.  The upside is you are in control of when (immediately) you get it fixed and you choose who to fix it (if you can&#039;t do it yourself.)]]></description>

Yeah - makes it 10x more fun when friends and family are involved I bet :) And you&#039;re right you definitely can&#039;t be afraid of fixing things or stretching yourself if you want to make the Big Bucks! If it was easy there&#039;d be millions more doing it...]]></description>

Nice!!!

I&#039;ve never put any together myself, but we go to the local train show every year and my kids LOVE IT... Will probably pick one up for them at some point to go around the Christmas Tree as well as the years go by :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Always interesting to see what other people come up with to make money. 
Your link to the flea market flipper confirmed my belief that your best bet is to find a niche that you understand and enjoy working in - voila. 
95% of his picks were of the same category, the most profitable involved hard work, sizeable investments, even mechanical, electrical, technical repairs not to mention muscle and massive shipping costs. 
Interesting, but not exactly easy or even possible to replicate. I loved that he made such good money on the Harley Davidson sign. I found it impressive how their family dynamic included his wife and children in a flea market vacay trip.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yo J,

Again, not related, just my daily &quot;what&#039;s up?&quot;  Am I a stalker :-)  Anywho, next time some jackal starts the whole own/rent debate you can tell them some homeowner in Internet Land has to pay $1,200.00 to get his furnace fixed today.  Woohoo, put that in your pipe and smoke it buddy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I see you&#039;re into trains like I am. I grew up playing and setting up the model age-old scale railroad layouts. I had the Amtrak locomotive, old-school vintage steam train with the smoke coming out the nose of the locomotive, and cons of track with switches. I don&#039;t know where any of that stuff is today from my childhood but I&#039;m trying to get back on track with my age-old scale model railroad layout game after almost 30 years. That&#039;s the part of my childhood that&#039;ll never leave me. So it was ironic that isolate you border caboose for $36,000. Are you going to sell it or use it as a means of getting business? :-)]]></description>
