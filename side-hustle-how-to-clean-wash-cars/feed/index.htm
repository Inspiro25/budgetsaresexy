					<description><![CDATA[Years ago I worked with a guy who loved detailing cars. He had a friend who was a pretty good mechanic. They&#039;d go to the &quot;repo depot&quot; and buy repossessed cars at auction. My co-worker would make them look spandy-new inside and the mechanic would tune them up. Then they&#039;d sell the cars for less than a dealer would but still make a very nice profit.]]></description>

Its amazing how good detailing can make any car look :) I myself have a 20 year old purple Fiat Panda, and after a good detailing session it looks like new! (If thats possible lol)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like great way to make some side money! I live in an apt complex though so I barely manage to wash my own car. I use coin-ops when I can and dry and wax the car myself. I know someone though who details car as a side job, he detailed my car and made it look like new almost! A 7 yr old car too!]]></description>

It is very enjoyable for me, and in all honesty when someone looks at their car after I have cleaned it and is very pleased, then that is a good feeling for me :)

I know some other people who clean cars and they charge more than me, but I have not really been doing this for THAT long. Perhaps when I have done more cars and become more confident then I will raise my prices, thanks for your comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That sounds like a great side job for you being that you like cars.  I&#039;m not a car guy so I don&#039;t think I&#039;d enjoy it too much, but I would consider doing it if I needed the money.  My buddy used to &quot;detail&quot; cars and he&#039;d charge upwards of $100 per car.  Not bad for a few hours of work.]]></description>

The $8 wash is not by any means a comprehensive inside/outside deal. Most of my customers want &quot;the works&quot; (which includes everything except claybar treatment as this has to be requested specially) which costs £20 which is roughly $30 US dollars. Perhaps you may be right about perhaps undercharging though, its certainly something for me to think about thanks! :)]]></description>
