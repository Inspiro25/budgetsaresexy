					<description><![CDATA[I sold my printer on CL and share one with my boyfriend now (we live together). I found ink on ebay for 1/3 of the price of regular ink. It was factory sealed and the seller had excellent feedback ratings. Take that, ink racket!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh cool!  Glad you&#039;re a USAA member too :)  I have all my IRAs with them as well, but I&#039;d be lying if I weren&#039;t tempted to switch to Vanguard... I just like the super convenience of everything in one place right now, but we&#039;ll see if that changes later.  Have a great weekend, my man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. I don&#039;t really like popcorn, so I never buy it.
2. I drive around and try to find cheaper public parking if possible. If not, I bite the bullet.
3. I get a discount by ordering printer ink through my friend that works at Epson, but if I can&#039;t get that, I order generic after-market ink.
4. Yeah...restaurant drinks are a rip off, but it&#039;s nice to get tanked once in a while.
5. I only buy bottled water for parties or emergencies. Rest of the time I use a reverse-osmosis filter and reusable canteens.
6. I use a French press coffee maker now. I just buy the beans from the gourmet foods grocer.
7. I stay away from restaurants on holidays. Too crowded = bad service.
8. I prepay for discount movie tickets. Have a handful but haven&#039;t been in a long time.
9. My family has an auto-repair shop. Oil changes are free...sort of.
10. Ugh! Yeah...if I have an early flight I&#039;ll hit up the McDonalds in the airport. I always hate myself afterwards.
11. I hate Ticketmaster, but there&#039;s almost no way to avoid the fee&#039;s unless you live close to the venue and have to the time to hit up the box office. I wonder how the class action on the fees is going.
12. USAA member as well. Love them!
13. Recently switched my Roth IRA over to Vanguard to use their funds exclusively. I hope to pay less on management fees with their index funds.
14. I&#039;ve never paid for baggage fees. Only time I had excess baggage was when I was in the military and the airlines waived the fees.
15. You&#039;re right...junk food at events are so satisfying! Guilty!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not sure I agree with getting a mechanic to do the oil changers. Take the time to learn how to do it the correct way yourself, it is dead easy and you will save a fortune, you will probably do a better job than most mechanics would do. Having said that I have seen cars that probably would not be able to be done so easily and looked as though they would require special tools and advanced lessons in contorsion not my idea of a practical car to own. I normally drive Fords or Holden&#039;s as they are always easy to service and the genuin spare parts are reasonably priced.
Doing your own services will not void the manufaturers warranty as long as you use genuin spare parts and the job is done correctly. I usually buy new or near new cars and I do all of the services myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually disagree about oil changes.     Maybe this is not common in other parts of the US, but most of the dealers near me offer loss-leader oil changes, so they can get you in to propose more expensive service.    Pricing out a factory filter, plug gasket, and 6 quarts of oil, plus hassle of disposal comes pretty close to the $29.99 they charge for the full service.

That being said, you need to be able to say &#039;no&#039; to the other services the service writer will propose.   I stopped doing my oil changes long ago, although still do 30K service myself.]]></description>
