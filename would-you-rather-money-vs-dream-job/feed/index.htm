					<description><![CDATA[I definitely choose a dream job over a high paying job that I dislike.  I would want a job that I love going to because for majority of your life you&#039;ll be working.  Besides being miserable dragging yourself to work I want a job that doesn&#039;t even feel like work but, fun.  A job you hate will make you sick of life. My dream job would be a professional drifter or circuit/rally driver, or even a Major League Gamer (MLG).  I would even love to work as a marijuana farmer/grower in Washington/Colorado (legalized!) or even Amsterdam (don&#039;t judge me haha).  These dreams are huge and I know this will never come true but, life will be great having these kind of jobs.  At the moment I am in college having no clue on what lame/non exciting major I want to enter in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;DSO&lt;/b&gt; - Not a bad dream to have though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Musician&lt;/b&gt; - Amen to that. I&#039;m living my dream and it&#039;s pretty dope most times, but man there are def. times I wish I could go back into the &quot;real world&quot; and have stability again.  Pros and cons with everything! (Now if only I&#039;d pick up my guitar and start learning once and for all, jeez....)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was 22, I would say dream job. I&#039;m 27 now and I have a dayjob that pays the bills. I&#039;m ok with it. The problem with the music industry is that it is VERY tough and you don&#039;t get paid often on most gigs unless you do wedding/cover gigs. You also need to be connected and socializing with these folks will cost money too. Did I mention late nights, early mornings, and staying up for up to 4 days straight?

I have what it takes but I can not accept the fact that I will be financially strapped indefinitely. I think most people are attracted to the IDEA of living their dream lives but are unwilling to bear the consequences. 

If you can bear the low-quality lifestyle, by all means go for it. In this day of age, this seems like a suicide to me. I also have a mortgage, meaning I can lose my asset if &#039;my dream&#039; didn&#039;t become a reality.

When your passion becomes a job, it becomes a job, literally. Can you cope with it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I had a dream job, I would take 1/4 of the salary. I wouldn&#039;t think twice.

I don&#039;t care about $ and it&#039;s very to find ways to cut things out if you really want to do something - but I&#039;m single with no dependants or obligations. :)

Unfortunately, I&#039;m one of those &quot;well what do I REALLY want to do?&quot; We&#039;ll see. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d leave my current job in a heartbeat. I feel that even though I would be making less money overall, the fact that I would be excited and enthused every day would make a difference. I also feel that those emotions would make me better at my job and thus eventually earning more than I currently do.]]></description>
