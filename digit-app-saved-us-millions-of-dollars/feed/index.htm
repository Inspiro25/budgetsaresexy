My friends and I are pretty bummed about the $2.99. The &quot;interest&quot; earned is so minuscule that the charge feels like salt in the wound. I guess we fell in the Just Using it For Fun category, because we&#039;re pretty much all out now.]]></description>

Nope!

If they&#039;re helping you save hundreds/thousands of dollars extra in your life, then in my opinion whether it&#039;s free or $2.99/mo it&#039;s still more than worth it in the end.

Now if you&#039;re a money nerd or were just using them for fun - like most of us $$ bloggers - then no, it&#039;s probably not worth it as we&#039;re all pretty good at doing it on our own.

Really just a matter of what section you fall in there, and how well you know yourself. But considering Digit is targeting all those people who suck with saving vs those who are good at it, their service is still going to help gobs of people every month :) So I&#039;m still a fan!]]></description>

Awwww, well thank you darlin&#039;.

I do hope you really enjoy them! No shame in cutting the experiment out sooner than 6 months if you find out they&#039;re not for you :) A lot of this stuff is just testing out different ideas and tools and strategies until you find the stuff that works the best for your situation/comfort levels. So good job taking action and giving things a try! and thanks for shooting me a note too! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$$$,
Well, I finally took the plunge, thanks to you.  I&#039;ve been waivering for almost 6 months and then, after very careful consideration and based on your history, said okay I&#039;m in.  Not a control freak, just a little timid about my erratic spending/saving habits.
I&#039;ll give it 6 months and hopefully by then I&#039;ll have gotten over my own crazy habits and will let digit do its thing.
I faithfully follow your site; don&#039;t comment much but I&#039;m out here, like I&#039;m sure lots of other people are.  I count on your wisdom, experience, and sense of humor to keep me moving towards my goals.  Thanks for helping us all, whether we have big or small money!!!]]></description>

Agreed - that WOULD be cool!

I&#039;ll pass this over to them too in case it sparks anything :)

RE: &quot;Goals&quot; - I&#039;m just learning about them now, but yes - they Digit will auto save for those as well as regular savings. I started a goal for $100 for &quot;beer money&quot; and then forgot about it, and a week later it was topped off :) Kinda neat!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the Digit &quot;talks&quot;.  I think I&#039;m one that helped you get $5 recently.  Lol

I&#039;ll likely use this as a &quot;fun money&quot; type of account. 
Question:   I setup a goal for a certain amount for the year.   Will digit distribute some money to the normal savings (default) AND the goals section?   Or do I need to push money to the goals section?

Lastly, it appears you put a bit of info out there that Digit is possibly planning.   I really like the sound of it.  It would have been helpful in the past years to pay off debt with this app, and other items.   Mostly debt free now... but I know it would be helpful to some others out there. 

I lied... this is the last part: 
LOYAL3 is a great app for buying stocks.  Free. And the best part: you can buy portions of a stock.  While I like RobinHood; I don&#039;t like being forced to buy a whole stock at times.   So I say all of that to say this: digit would become an absolute powerhouse if they can do like LOYAL3 (but allow purchases of ALL stocks).   Especially in little bits and pieces like digit is doing now to save us money.]]></description>
