					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, I discovered your blog, and the first post I read is a... Poem?.... 
And it was great man.  This line resonated with me the most:

&#039;Wealth is the ability to believe in yourself and know that you are “enough” &#039;

Sometimes, I wonder if I&#039;m chasing Wealth to have enough or to prove to myself and others, that I am &quot;enough&quot;.   
Thanks man, great poem, great post.  I&#039;ll keep reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent poem J. Money. It sang to me all the way through. I have spent many years trying to instill in my children (who are all grown now) that money is not about being able to buy things, it is all about the power of choice. Instead of being forced to choose things due to lack of wealth, your choices will always be yours when you have the amount of money you determine to be wealthy. 

I am also kind of touched that you cut off the adds, that was quite the altruistic move on your part.  Thank you..]]></description>

Dang, sorry to hear man! Have you thought about joining some clubs or volunteering at places you care about?! That completely changed the game for me... 

Took me a handful of months to figure it out, but once I started volunteering more and then going to the gym/yoga studio my friendships quadrupled! They&#039;re not the same friends that you normally hang out with on nights/weekends, but there is def. good people around during the work days - they&#039;re just in different spots :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now that I&#039;ve reached FI, I just feel a bit lonely, bored, and depressed.  I am grateful for the freedom, but having some trouble getting my footing in this new chapter.  I am still hanging on to working just a few days a month because of that (I don&#039;t really want to or need to), but there is so much extra time now and the few people I do know are working or raising a family etc.  Just a random thought I&#039;d throw out to you or anyone reading.

Peace]]></description>
