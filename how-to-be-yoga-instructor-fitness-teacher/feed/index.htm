					<description><![CDATA[My situation was a lot of luck. I worked in a very upscale gym in Chicago and got my start last minute subbing for them even before I had fully completed my certification. We moved to Dallas probably 3 weeks after I completed the 200 HR program, which was challenging, I&#039;d had three jobs lined up in Chicago before making the move. 

As soon as I got here, I started sending my resume and applications. It sounds like you&#039;re already thinking outside of the box but have you tried gyms, rec centers, religious facilities, aging care facilities, hospitals, country clubs, etc? Yoga has gotten so popular and is recommended for so many types of people now that the sky is the limit. I was hired on at our local YMCA, which at the time was such a blessing because the branches have experienced some incredible growth over my almost 5 years now and offered me opportunity that I would never have expected. I also have been teaching at a local upscale gym which helps me to keep my skills sharp and work in a more studio-like environment. It&#039;s funny because I no longer teach in a studio anymore, I found it to be more time for less pay. 

OH! I just thought to tell you, a critical way to get your foot in the door is to contact every studio owner and gym group fitness coordinator you can find and see if you can be on their sub list. Instructors get sick, injured, have sick kids, etc and there is a constant need for subs. It&#039;s a really easy way to get your foot in the door in various places. Also, talk to studio owners about auditioning for them. Invite them to your park classes! 

It gets more competitive all the time because there are always more teachers finishing up their certifications but who knows, you might be the next Darren Main in a few years and routinely have 100-200 students taking your classes in San Francisco (which 500-100 euros isn&#039;t bad for a little more than an hour&#039;s work!). Best of luck to you. You&#039;re on the right path.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post, it&#039;s good to see that it&#039;s possible to have success as a recent teacher. I would like to ask some ideas how did you find your job so soon? i&#039;m a recent teacher, just got my diploma a month ago, though it&#039;s been 6 month that I&#039;m organizing my own group, first only to practice teaching, but by now I&#039;m teaching with confidence, and of course I practiced yoga before starting my teacher training. I&#039;m not in the US, but we also have many studios here, and hundreds of other teachers as well... Normally studios require someone with 1-3 years of experience. I&#039;m sending cv-s everywhere, teach classes in 2 languages outdoors, and I have many good comments about my classes from my students in my grouop, but I can&#039;t show a previous job in a studio, as I&#039;m just starting. In the park and at the beach where people like me start, the average price is 5 euros/student, and there are about 15 more yoga groups every day, so you won&#039;t have 10 students in every class, and can&#039;t ask a higher price either...I try to be positive though, I just wonder if there is any special way to contact owners, networking...etc. beside sending cv-s, that they have immediately employed you or you&#039;re just simply lucky? I would like to live from what I love to do and teach, and yoga is one of them. Thanks in advance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, thanks for sharing.  I got into yoga (primarily hot yoga) about a year ago and I haven&#039;t been practicing as much as I would like to.  About two weeks ago, I learned that one of girls I know is yoga instructor certified and I started to think about getting trained myself.  I plan to get yoga instructor certified this Fall/Winter and plan to do it as a side hustle.  Like some of you already mentioned, I am a lot of growth opportunities in the fitness/yoga industry for the future.  Once certified, it gives me the flexibility to pretty much teach anywhere and as much or as little as I want to (assuming I can find work that is).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been thinking about yoga as a side hustle. I currently pay $99/mo for hot yoga! The break even point for getting certified for $2500 and teaching for $40/class would be 63 classes. If you figure you can teach at least once a week that&#039;s close to a year which is not bad at all! Plus, typically you get free yoga classes or reduced cost at the studio you teach at which makes it a win win.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad y&#039;all liked this one!  I still have yet to try Yoga or Pilates or any of that kinda stuff - even though I WOULD be up for it as it looks pretty peaceful and relaxing :)  I feel like I&#039;d need to go w/ friends or something though as I don&#039;t have the balls to try it on my own, haha... maybe one day...

And thanks again to Mrs. Anonymous Side Hustler for sharing this with us today!  Very very cool stuff, you&#039;re awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[NancyO brings up a really great point.  If I had known about the Yoga For Trade (YFT) program before I decided to get certified, I could have saved half of what I paid.  

I can&#039;t stress enough how positive this experience has been for me but before I started, I was really nervous (doubted my abilities, worried about the money, etc.).  My only regret was not doing it sooner.  I&#039;m lucky that my husband convinced me to take the leap of faith and just sign up.  The initial payment was a tough pill to swallow but it&#039;s allowed us a financial freedom that we didn&#039;t have before and for a truly negligible 3-6 hours of my week.  I wrote this for J$ awhile back and I&#039;m still turning down work and opportunities regularly because I don&#039;t have the time.  A co-worker of mine recently started teaching full-time and studios continue to open and flourish in our area.   

I think yoga/fitness have a lot more room to grow.  Fitness gets more and more importance every year and group fitness classes will continue to draw people (just like me) that are more likely to get the workout in with other people to hold them accountable.  Yoga, in particular, draws people in because it&#039;s a workout followed by some light meditation and relaxation.  The busier we get as a society, the more that it becomes a necessity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seeing how you made up your costs so fast is very encouraging. My wife is attempting to do a little &quot;side-hustle&quot; of her own and get an extra teaching certification. It can be hard to put up the initial investment, but it helps to think of how much it can make in the future. Do you think that yoga will continue to have such a large following in the US, or do you think it will eventually decline as a fad?]]></description>
