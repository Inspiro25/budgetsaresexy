Oh hey now - look at you going back in time! Fun to see man - congrats on the twin girls! You are a brave, brave man haha... We&#039;re about to now have our 3rd kid already (!!!) and oddly enough I&#039;m right back to being a stay-at-home dad part time again after many years going the full-time daycare route :) But you&#039;re right - it&#039;s a lot easier/cheaper once school started!! Just got out of diapers too, but not anymore haha... 

Thanks for taking the time to stop by and check-in. Glad you&#039;re back to reading the blog again :)]]></description>

I am replying to my own comment I made 5 1/2 years ago. I had twin girls since I wrote this. Daycare would have been crazy expensive, but my wife stayed home. Ironically,  I have become a Stay-At-Home Dad myself. I sell on eBay and Amazon FBA amongst a couple other things. Except now my kids are all in school, so I am not sure if I am technically a Stay-At-Home Dad. Now I am just a guy that works from home in a quiet house.

I used to visit Budgets Are Sexy almost daily. You went in a different direction sometime and life took over. I just found your blog link on a blogroll and I started taking a stroll down memory lane. So happy to see you are still going strong!

Congratulations on your successes.]]></description>

Ahhh the memories!

We&#039;re back to daycare this time full-time + half day preschool for my oldest (I know have 2 kids!), and it costs us a whopping $2,000/mo. And that was the *cheapest* of all the options.

I am considering pull them both out half-time to nap at home (2 hours right there) and then hang with dad, just not sure if my online businesses can handle it yet... But I do agree - it&#039;s def. a blessing to be able to do so if you can work it out! It&#039;s been awesome spending the mornings and drop off/pick up times with them as the &quot;dad in charge&quot; since my wife went back to a 9-5 :) 

Thanks for getting me to look at this older post - it&#039;s been a while! Actually, exactly 4 years ago today!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being a stay-at-home dad is awesome, and the money savings is fantastic as well! I just recently (August 2016) became a stay-at-home dad myself and have to say that I&#039;m digging it. But, I do have to say that $900 for a month at 2 days a week is a bit ludicrous! I mean, we spent $250 per week, but that was for 2 kids for 9 hours a day 5 days a week! Plus, they had a preschool curriculum and food was provided (and my kiddos can eat!!!).

Anyways, I know this is an older post, not sure where you are on it today, but I would have to say that becoming a stay-at-home dad was one of the best decisions our family has made!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hah! I&#039;ve met face to face with many a up-the-back poops already - they get me every time! ;)  Pretty cool you&#039;ve been doing it for 3 years too, I didn&#039;t know that. If only we lived near each other so we could have dad parties!

@&lt;b&gt;Katie&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!! I&#039;m glad y&#039;all are finding a nice balance over there :) I *think* we&#039;re getting closer to one, but still way too knew to know yet... I am enjoying myself though! Hehe... even as I sit here doing work at 11pm &#039;cuz I know all day tomorrow will be filled with baby time!  Pros and cons, I suppose. Totally worth it though :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For sure there will be some adjustment as you get used to the little guy&#039;s schedule.  But you can do it.  You&#039;ll find watching him may be harder than any job you&#039;ve had but most times it will be awesome hanging with him.

I&#039;ve been a stay at home dad now for three years.  For us it was the same issue - if we both worked then essentially one of our salaries was going to go to daycare basically.  It&#039;s insane.

Best of luck.  Beware the up-the-back poop.  And feel free to shoot out an email if you&#039;re finding you need some guy support.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Enjoy being home with your baby!  My husband and I take turns being the stay-at-home-parent.  I work part time (about 30 hours) he works full time+  (self employed).   I&#039;m home most days but 1-2 days a week I teach and he&#039;s home with the baby.  We love the balance and the equality it brings to our relationship - he knows where things are and what to do as well as I do. 

 An added bonus is that we each have a much clearer idea of each others professional responsibilities, priorities and work style.  For example, we&#039;ve learned that I am much more productive first thing in the morning, while he gets stuff done better later in the day.  If we&#039;re both swamped I&#039;ll work from 6-9am then take over childcare.  He&#039;ll then head to the office and stay as long as he needs to, I&#039;m no longer stressed because I started my day by being productive.  

There were several months of transition and figuring it all out but I think we&#039;re both more efficient with our time now and our communication (particularly around time management) has improved dramatically.  Most importantly, our baby girl is thriving and sees an example of parents balancing work and family time daily!  

Hope your experience is as positive as ours has been!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, 

If you ever get some extra time I could always share my business idea with you.  I do, however, plan on using it or one of my other ideas to become an owner once again.  It has been driving me nuts for years not having any ideas I truly like.  The baby one is pretty cool, but not sure if it would be feasible.  Anyway, I hope staying at home is going well and the baby bonding is fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome!! I totally forgot you had a wee one at home now too - that&#039;s exciting :) And I&#039;m slowly figuring out that same stuff too - no errands get done when you&#039;re with baby 100% of the time, but that&#039;s OK as long as you know when to turn off and on your brain like that :) The first day with him this week was awesome, but I did catch myself trying to squeeze stuff in here and there only to get more frustrated. On the 2nd day I wised up and just &quot;let it be&quot; and wow was it more smoother and relaxing - I loved it. Well, actually I loved BOTH days, but the 2nd one was more chill :)

Here&#039;s to spending quality time with our babies! We&#039;re def. blessed, indeed.]]></description>
