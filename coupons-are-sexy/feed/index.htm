					<description><![CDATA[WAY late on this one due to back-from-vacation backlog, but I always put my vote in for the Refund Cents site.  (You can find it under &quot;$$ Saving/Making&quot; on my &quot;Resources&quot; page.)  

They do all the work for you--post coupons as they&#039;re available, match up available coupons with your store&#039;s weekly circular deals, post rebates and other deals to help you get cash back or stuff-for-cheap.  If there was only one site I checked for all my couponing needs (and there pretty much is now, my time has gotten so limited), it would most def be RF.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;The Calculator Dude&lt;/b&gt; - I like to think so ;)
@&lt;b&gt;DWilson&lt;/b&gt; - Love it! I want to see a picture of that coupon book ;)  Maybe you should start a couponing blog and share your tips with everyone? That would be cool.  And you can update w/ weekly savings and what not, hehe... but if you thought couponing took up a lot of time, boy... don&#039;t get started blogging unless you&#039;re ready to get addicted! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ 20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, but we all have different audiences too :)  You know how many millions and millions of people are online every day looking for coupons? It won&#039;t get saturated ;)  Do it if you really want to.  Not sure if they have wedding-specific ones, but maybe?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought about including it for my site too but if too many bloggers are doing it, the market will be saturated :( So far I&#039;ve only seen you and PT Money implement it so far. I would love a plugin for wedding planning coupons though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a couponer. Like seriously ( I even have a book). I won&#039;t buy anything before I check to see if I have a coupon. This does two things, I make more informed purchases and I save money. I started doing this just to get by bu, found myself needing to get more for less with the expansion of my blended family. I get coupons for food (coupons.com, redplum.com) and or manufacturers sites. I also get coupons for clothes. good, services, resturants ect. (retailmenot, couponcabin, facebook) I have created an email dedicated to fielding all the coupons ads and coupons that come in! 

I save lots of money doing this.REALLY. I am in the process of finding a way to accurately calculate my spending so that I can see the savings in black in white. We use to shop at a warehouse store spending $500+/month. Now I spend roughly $300/month and that includes tolietries. But, this does take up time! I cut out coupons from 2-4 circulars a week, organize the coupons and coordinate the sales w the coupons to get good deals if possible. I only buy what we need or actually use- the rest I clip and donate to APO&#039;s and FPO&#039;s overseas, as they can use 3 month old coupons. 

To those who say couponing is not for the health eater, not true! The diet of myself and my infant differs from the rest of my family; I eat very little meat and majority organic or natural foods. Most stores carry a natural or organic line, some even have coupons ex. Safeway ( if you sign up for their club card). Wholefoods also has its own instore coupons. You can check a site called mambosprouts.com they offer printable manufacturers coupons. Also most manufacturers will send you coupons if you write them and ask.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Woo, thanks so much!  I, too, do most of my shopping at Amazon.com :) I keep storing up all my credit and it feels like I get stuff for free there now!  Can&#039;t beat that.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - thanks for answering them :)
@&lt;b&gt;Gina&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I can imagine.  You power through and get those deals though, whereas I just click away happily and move onto the next place I can find whatever coupon I&#039;m looking for ;)  I hate giving up my personal stuff for something small in return.  Though I&#039;m thinking of creating a fake account for everything - then it&#039;s on! :)
@&lt;b&gt;C Ann&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  Thanks for responding for me :)
@&lt;b&gt;kirazona&lt;/b&gt; - I need you at my house!!!  I want free toothpaste for life! Haha... rock on with your bad self ;)  (and I&#039;ll have to check out GeoQpons too - never heard of, but I got an iPhone!)
@&lt;b&gt;Soam @ Savings.com&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome to see you here brotha!  Thanks for stopping by and making yourself available like that - much appreciated :)  And I&#039;ll see you real soon again at FINCON, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$ and Team - you guys are rockstars! Thanks for all the feedback and great answers to the questions. If I can help demystify anything about the coupon world I&#039;m here to help. At the end of the day I think all coupon sites just want to find great deals (that work) and pass that on to customers.

 Here at Savings.com we&#039;re understand that there is a bit of a deal overload going on right now (my gf gets about 10+ emails about deals everyday) - local deals - daily deals - weekly deals - travel deals - national online merchant deals - and what we&#039;ve done is try to aggregate all of it into a personalized feed to give the customers the deals they actually care about. 

In the end, everyone is trying to spend their money wisely. Either to get out of debt, buy a home, or save up for a family. We&#039;re just trying to do our part ;) Thanks for your help J$!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t consider online coupon codes &quot;coupons&quot;. Do they help? Yes. Do I Google them when there&#039;s a discount/coupon field at checkout? Of course.
Coupons however, are generally printable, or have a bar code you scan at the register. I use GeoQpons on the iPhone. LOVE it!

I get most of mine from the newspaper and match with sites like couponmom.com and thekrazycouponlady.com. I don&#039;t coupon for lots of food, but practically all of the non food household goods I have close to a year&#039;s supply of. My coupon savings nets me anywhere between $300 and $450 a month lately, and I&#039;m able to give away a bunch of it to my family. (Our family will never have to buy toothpaste again.) 
I&#039;ve got coupons for protein bars, milk, yogurt, string cheese, organic eggs, free salad with salad dressing kit, etc. Yeah, there are a lot of &quot;packaged&quot; options. Skip them. There&#039;s coupons for free and nearly free candy that I don&#039;t use because I would be a very large woman if I did! But for the nay-sayers - go ahead and keep paying full price because you guys are the ones that pay for all of us to get these outrageous deals. Oh - any my fiance&#039;s favorite perk - he never ever has to eat generic food again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At first glance I think your Coupon Section is a good idea! Now, to the other questions:
1. I use online coupons anytime Im shopping online, which isn&#039;t too often, maybe 2-3 times a month. 
2. I usually Google, check their Facebook fan page, then the actual website. 
3. Nope, I just Google.
4. Nope, don&#039;t care where I get the coupons from as long as they work.]]></description>
