					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s what I&#039;m currently doing actually - killing off #2 first cuz I like to see it dwindle and dwindle more :)  And then yup - hopefully be able to then refinance to a normal rate for that 1st, jeesh... but we still got some ways to go until I can fully squash it. Business has been low overall the past couple of months, so we&#039;ll need it to go back up again to start paying off extra again... fingers crossed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow a 10% month!? That is unreal.  I did well this month but not that well.  Any thought about killing off the mortgage #2 instead of #1? I know it is a low 2.2% but how much would it lower your monthly nut?  Would that lower your DTI to refinance #1 since 5.5% is WAY too high]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - That works! $2,500 is a ton of sexy money! Keep it up :)
@&lt;b&gt;Derek @ ThePointsGuide&lt;/b&gt; - It would most DEF make sense to refinances, though as you&#039;ll notice in those numbers you just laid out our house is WAY underwater still :( Which means no one will allow us to refinance unfortunately... On the plus side, we DID get lucky with our same mortgage holder last year who had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/we-refinanced-our-mortgage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CRAZY deal going on&lt;/a&gt; we took advantage of, and was able to drop our rates from 6.875% down to 5.5% which helped a ton (And also moves us from &quot;interest only&quot; to a &quot;traditional&quot; mortgage). Other than that though, I&#039;m afraid we&#039;re $hit out of luck until we pay more off... I like where your head is at, though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - HOLY CRAP!!! You killed it!!! What changes this month for y&#039;all to be able to go up so much?? Or are you now going up that on a regular basis?? (How hot would THAT be!! :))
@&lt;b&gt;Adam Hathaway&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, go for it dude. Even if you just did it every other month it may help you keep a better pulse on your finances. Though if you&#039;re current quarterly system works now, you may not want to mess too much with it if you think you&#039;ll just abandon it altogether.
@&lt;b&gt;Ian&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! That&#039;ll def. get you to learn for sure :) I think it&#039;s awesome that you went out and built something and then turned it around like that though - that&#039;s great. And was one of my main reasons for selling too - I wanted to go through the whole process of selling a site and experience it :) And of course the money didn&#039;t hurt either, haha... Unfortunately I can&#039;t disclose the site per our contract, but I doubt it&#039;s one  you&#039;ve heard of before. Keep on hustlin&#039; bro!
@&lt;b&gt;Neal&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh I like that! And no - I&#039;ve never thought of that before actually? It does make sense though. Even though they&#039;re online they&#039;re still income-producing &quot;properties&quot;... Hmmm... It also makes me wonder about accounting in general too - like if they&#039;re supposed to be considered &quot;assets&quot; when filing taxes for a small biz, etc? I should probably ask my accountant on that :) Very interesting stuff though for sure - I&#039;m gonna think more on this and see if I end up including it or not down the road. Thanks for sparking some new brain waves!
@&lt;b&gt;Will&lt;/b&gt; - Dude, $50k is nothing to sneeze at - the fact you&#039;re GROWING and going after your goals like that is great! I don&#039;t know how old (or young) you are exactly, but I can tell you I didn&#039;t start paying attention until I got into my mid-late 20&#039;s and it would have been a WAY diff. ball game had I started even earlier. Not that I have much to complain about now, but you know what I&#039;m saying. The earlier you start, the better you&#039;ll be for the rest of your life! So keep rollin&#039; with it brotha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats great J Money. Some of you guys are really rockin&#039; it, impressive stuff. No where near as impressive but I did hit an all time high and crossed the $50k mark for the first time. I&#039;m still young and I&#039;ll be up there with you guys some day. Anyone else ever feel like they don&#039;t make enough money to support their savings habits? I guess if thats all I can complain about then I&#039;m doing alright.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money, 

Have you considered putting your internet assets on your balance sheet? I&#039;m self-employed and put the value of my business on balance sheet (accounting practices always sell within a tight multiple range). I can see how calculating a conservative value for website may be difficult. 

I enjoy your site. 

Thanks, 

Neal]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nothing like a whopping chunk of cash to make you feel good about your finances!

I might have asked already, but what site did you sell? (or is it a secret?)

I&#039;ve sold a few sites for big money.  Annoyingly, I sold one for $4000 back in 2008 and the guy (who was obviously an experienced flipper) sold it almost immediately for $25,000! 

I know better now! :)]]></description>
