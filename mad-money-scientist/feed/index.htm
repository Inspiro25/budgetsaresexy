YAYYYY!! Great experiment you&#039;re trying over there - I love it! Please let me know how it went at the end, or if there&#039;s even an end! :) Doing a no-spend month years ago was one of the best things I did for my wallet as well. Couldn&#039;t spend anything outside of bills and it&#039;s since saved me at least $200/mo as it completely changed my mentality. I wish the same for you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the &#039;check email once a day&#039; message. Coincidentally, here&#039;s what&#039;s at the bottom of every email I send: &quot;To help me single-task effectively and preserve space for offline life, I download email two or fewer times per day. Please phone or Skype me for urgent matters. Thanks!&quot; I have been amazed how liberating this has been for me. Feels like every day has an extra hour or two of productivity. Though I admit sometimes checking email more often is tough to resist! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great! It&#039;s really interesting to think about how a tentative &quot;experiment&quot; can become a true habit. I&#039;m actually doing an experiment right now for the month of October, where I&#039;m committed to buying zero restaurant food and zero takeout food. And while I *say* that I&#039;m doing it just as a temporary challenge, I&#039;m certainly hoping that some of it will rub off beyond October. I&#039;ve actually already been forced to develop some small habits during the first week of the challenge that I didn&#039;t have before, like thinking ahead about what I&#039;m going to have for dinner, heading to the supermarket a couple evenings a week, and walking by the 50 delicious takeout places on my route home without stopping at any of them! 
I love how you talk about growth, too -- it&#039;s important to have the attitude (in life in general) that there&#039;s always room for growth, rather than trying to fool ourselves into thinking that we already have everything pretty much figured out. 
Thanks for posting!]]></description>

I just email a new person a day :) (well, usually just work days, but sometimes weekends too). it&#039;s weird at first but once you get into the habit it&#039;s pretty easy. And since you&#039;re only writing a sentence or two it doesn&#039;t take up much time either - though you do spend some sometimes finding *who* to email. give it a shot for a week and see what happens!]]></description>

holy damn! you figured it out early!! Would you like to write up an article on it possibly for my audience? how you got to this level, what your expenses/income looks like/etc?

I started an early retirement series but only got one out the door, haha...
