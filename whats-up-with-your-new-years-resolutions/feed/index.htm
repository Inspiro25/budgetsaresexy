					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Kat&lt;/b&gt; - You are right!  I def. need to break it down more and track better.  My way is certainly not working.
@&lt;b&gt;Miss Jane&lt;/b&gt; - That is awesome :)  I love lists like that.
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...you cheated.  And I agree - I have to lock this time issue down before going on my own. On the plus side, I&#039;m usually pretty good about knocking out the major important things each day.
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah Fowler&lt;/b&gt; - CONGRATS!  You are a BEAST at reading those books, crazy impressed!
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh i like that!  can i write on my hand instead?  that usually helps me pretty well when I remember.  Would love to have it 2nd nature though, good lookin&#039; out.
@&lt;b&gt;Karmella&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well right something down NOW to accomplish until the end of the year :) You can do it!	
@&lt;b&gt;tom&lt;/b&gt; - Zing!
@&lt;b&gt;Dena&lt;/b&gt; - LOVE the &quot;shop only once a week&quot; idea!  It&#039;s def. hard, you&#039;re right, but you get used to it pretty quickly.  I gave it up for 3 months once and never went back to the old ways ;)  Good work on sticking to a budget too!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Just be sure to wait for the RIGHT one!  No rush at all, esp in this economy :)
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMan&lt;/b&gt; - Sweet man!  Clicking over as soon as I post this to check it out.  You&#039;re gonna love blogging!
@&lt;b&gt;JMK&lt;/b&gt; - Getting rid of your HELOC would be amazing.  We&#039;re so far away from doing that ourselves that I can&#039;t even fathom it.  Keep rockin&#039; it!
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel211&lt;/b&gt; - We all work a bit differently, so as long as you&#039;re sticking with what you&#039;re comfortable with it&#039;s all good :)  I like separating some things out, while combining others.  I&#039;m sure over the years it&#039;ll all mix into one big bag of awesomeness though. But for now we&#039;re killin&#039; it so tally ho!
@&lt;b&gt;vml&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s true at some companies, I made sure it wasn&#039;t at mine before doing it ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I realize that a lot of married couples still keep separate accounts - but to me it seems strange that you would still think of your retirement accounts as two separate things. I mean, I realize that they are - but to me it would make more sense to consider it one goal to max them both? I guess I&#039;ve never really understood the whole split accounts thing - I get each person getting a &quot;fun allowance&quot; each payday, but it&#039;s hard enough for me to figure out bills without feeling like I have to split everything up like a 19 year old college kid with roommates. Why add so much more confusion?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.  Make $6k in extra mortgage payments.   $3k done, so $1k behind schedule.
2.  Contribute $10k to retirement accounts in addition to 6% deducted  at work with 3% match. $3k done so way behind on this, but I have until the end of February to meet the 2010 tax deadline.
3.  Pay off $12k HELOC.  $11k done $1k to go. Ahead of schedule.
4.  Have new roof installed (all cash) before the snow flies.  We had budgetted and saved assuming this could be up to $20k. Quotations so far are all over the map ($14k, 22k and $36k!). One quotation still to follow.

Number 4 is the reason 1 and 2 are behind schedule. I basically stopped making on those until I really figure out what the roof is going to cost. We&#039;ve ruled out the $36k quotation which was completely nuts. We&#039;re still waiting for one more quotation. If we spend $20k or less we&#039;re on budget and I&#039;ll then go back to working on #1 &#038; 2. If we spend more than $20k the extra will have to be dealt with before we can go back to working on 1 &#038; 2.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess my New Years Resolution was to buy a house.  More like &quot;Out the door by 24,&quot; I&#039;ve started the house hunting process and am still waiting to find the right one.  Here&#039;s hoping it happens by the end of the year!]]></description>
