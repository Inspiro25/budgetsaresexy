The buffer&#039;s where it&#039;s at. I keep $1k in our checking for exactly that - we always forget something or do something stupid!]]></description>

That emergency fund vs paying debt off priority is always a juicy topic in finance. They&#039;re both super important of course, but it&#039;s interesting to hear both sides battle for which is *most* important to do first.]]></description>

That&#039;s awesome! And really, making the risks less risky is my favorite part of having a system like this. It&#039;s so much easier to take those big leaps when you know that the fall won&#039;t be very hard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-to-be-financially-invincible/#comment-162356&quot;&gt;Mrs. Bookworm&lt;/a&gt;.

First of all, nice work! I couldn&#039;t agree more that having a dedicated e-fund is a huge help, especially instead of relying on retirement accounts. So good for you for making that happen!

In terms of how much you should have, I would say there&#039;s no one-size-fits-all answer. The standard goal is 3-6 months worth of expenses, and I think that&#039;s a good starting point. But to give you a little more detail, here&#039;s a post I wrote on this topic that gets into different variables that might cause you to aim higher or lower: &lt;a title=&quot;How Big Should Your Emergency Fund Be?&quot; href=&quot;http://momanddadmoney.com/how-big-should-your-emergency-fund-be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How Big Should Your Emergency Fund Be?&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a title=&quot;How to Build Your Emergency Fund in Stages&quot; href=&quot;http://momanddadmoney.com/two-stages-of-emergency-fund/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;And here&#039;s another one that talks about building your emergency fund in stages.&lt;/a&gt;

Hope that helps! Feel free to reach out any time if you ever have more questions. Good luck!]]></description>
