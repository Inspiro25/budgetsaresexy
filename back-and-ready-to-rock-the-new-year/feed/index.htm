I have never thought about decluttering my SM accounts suprisingly.  I may have to give this a try in the future!  Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

Wowwww.... where is y&#039;all&#039;s homeland??

I remember once a colleague from India was visiting and when we all went to Subway for lunch he opted out and didn&#039;t get anything.. When I asked why he said because it was like $30 or $35 spending power back in his own country! I was blown away!

(And agreed about the shut down.... 800,000 lives being messed with right now, insane...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good for you getting away with the fam! I was just thinking today &quot; I can&#039;t imagine a month without my paycheck coming in.&quot; And after 15 days I would be gasping for air. Not trying to get political here but you just don&#039;t do that to people; this is the second time they do it.
Anyway, I am glad to hear about your wife&#039;s new job and opportunities.
My mom, who recently (April 2018) joined my family in the US, finally was able to find a job; just 20hrs a week @ 8.50 per hour. No much for American standards. 7k a year. She couldn&#039;t make it if she wasn&#039;t living with me. But now get this, that amount of money equals 150+ years of work in our former homeland. Sick! 
I never thought I could be even remotely thinking about retirement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, that&#039;s some serious productivity for being on a break, you nerd! Seriously, congrats to your wife on the new job. 

I watched home alone 2 with my niece &#038; nephews on Christmas. IDK why but that movie stresses me out. I much prefer Elf. ;-)

I&#039;m seriously excited about 2019 and set up some big goals like create a will, work on writing a book, etc.. Furthermore, I set up clearly defined action steps so to ensure success. 

Love the way you experiment with stuff on the blog. Life is dynamic. 

Cheers to a rockin&#039; 2019, J!!]]></description>
