That&#039;s pretty sweet. We get all our rolls from the fed, so there probably aren&#039;t any random ones in them, but the branch I work at is literally in the Walmart home office parking lot, so all the execs who go overseas always bring something in with the rest of their American coins. It&#039;s hard to pick them out sometimes when there&#039;s so much going through the machine.]]></description>

Nice! I usually find some fakers in my rolls from the bank I sort through too. Once I found like 3 different foreign coins in the *same* nickel roll, haha... And at the same bank that once gave me a &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/bank-gives-me-guardian-angel-coin-other-errors/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;guardian angel coin&lt;/a&gt; instead of a Sacagawea $1.00 one! Though that one is happily sitting in my coin collection cuz I thought it was pretty cool :) Especially after that Sunday&#039;s sermon at church was all about guardian angels - pretty crazy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now I need to get my hands on a new crisp $100 bill! It&#039;s a bit tempting to frame it and hang it up now. Makes a bit more of an impact than framing a dollar bill right? Then again it&#039;s just asking for someone to take it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think we should just go with $100 coin, try counterfeiting that.  I&#039;m kidding of course, I really don&#039;t like getting coins, ever.  I actually don&#039;t even use paper currency if I can avoid it.  Can I just start making payments via retina scan?  I would go with a fingerprint but those can be lifted.  It&#039;s a little harder to scoop out my eyeball.]]></description>

Dude, money is disgusting. I&#039;ve had some pretty bad, close to throwing up, experiences. I don&#039;t see too many old stuff, but I&#039;ve seen a LOT of cool foreign coins that people try to put through the coin machine we have. I got an old Deutsche Mark penny a few weeks back, which was awesome because a) it&#039;s no longer in circulation and b) I lived in Germany for a couple of years.]]></description>
