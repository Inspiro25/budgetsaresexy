					<description><![CDATA[Adam - The credit card was paid off before the 90 days. I had the money available to do so. The $50,000 was less than a year&#039;s spending. We used them up after about 8 months. 

This deal is long behind me. There was no interest to eat up any of my profit, it was all paid before the card charged its regular rate. You&#039;re welcome to view it as a pile of debt, but as I always had the cash to pay it off, I view it more like turning $50K I would spend in the next 8 months, and turn it into $54,500. There was never any risk of expiring before we used them. 

To be clear, in effect, I exchanged $50,500 in cash for $55,000 in Visa gift card.  It &#039;cost&#039; me 25 visits to CVS, at 10 minutes each, 4 hours of time. A bit of a pain to use $500 cards. But as the balances dropped below $20 or so, I just dumped them against my cable bill. An easy bill which let me make multiple small payments on line. Some stores (Trader Joe&#039;s for one) easily just ran the card to zero and told me the amount I still owed them. So maybe a few hours of extra pain to use these. In the end, $4500 is nothing to sneeze at. 30% of 55+ Americans don&#039;t even have $10,000 saved for retirement. Smart is seeing an opportunity, assessing the pros and cons, and jumping on it. Stupid is not going for a full $100K. 

I believe you misunderstand the timing, the risk, and the concept of money for nothing. Excuse me, while I queue up some classic Dire Straights.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From what I understand, the tax ramifications do not matter in this instance because essentially you have $50K in gift cards and $15K in debt with $4,550 in cash back rebates, none of which are income because you don&#039;t have to pay taxes on money you already paid taxes on. If you do the math then you are left with your initial savings of $35K and a profit of $4550, but that is only if you paid off the $15K credit card debt in full without having to pay any interest. If you don&#039;t pay off that debt in full before the 90 days interest free period is up and only pay minimal payments after that until it is paid off you will have made no profit as the interest will eat the $4550 and then some over the life of the loan. And from what you said, you did not pay it off in full, therefore you made nothing but a pile of debt and turned all of your liquid savings into gift cards that expire over time if you don&#039;t use them. Sorry, but that doesn&#039;t sound to smart to me.]]></description>

You are incorrect. This is a rebate and as such is not taxable. The courts have ruled on such matters previously against the IRS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got the same offer and did the same thing, Only got a double bonus with Stop and Shop giving 2 times points for gas rewards. So besides earning $4500 in cash back (3964.50 net profit  minus the $5.95 per card for 90 cards). I have paid under $20 all summer to fill up the car from July to Sept. taking off $2.20 a gallon for each fill up. This card is golden if you get an offer. As for cash flow i have a home equity line of credit and used Bluebird card to unload the gift card money for no fee at Walmart]]></description>

@blabla - I see what you mean. The 10% reward was only for gas/grocery/drug store. So had I simply used the card as usual, only 1/3 or so would have gotten the full 10% rebate. 

What you miss is that my normal card gives 2% back on all purchases, so between the 1% fee and 2% regular card, my real gain was 7%. I&#039;ll concede that. Either way, it was a once-in-a-lifetime deal. (until the next one comes along)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your accounting is incorrect. You only made $4550-1800 with the deal. You have to discount how much cash back you&#039;d have had if you just with your normal business. Since you say you spend $6000 a month, and the offer lasted for 3 months, that means you&#039;d have had $1800 cash back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@booyaa - I&#039;m still following the conversation here. I see that for your spending, there might not be enough regular expenses to make this worth the effort. I just looked to see where we stand and there&#039;s $10K in cards left at about the 10 month mark, so we&#039;ve used $4000 per month on average. 
I&#039;ll add one point I missed in the article. Some charges withhold or freeze an amount higher than the bill, hotels and restaurants, for instance. So a dinner bill of $200 might freeze $300 on the card until the charge gets fully processed. No argument from me, this meant tracking and a quick check on line to verify the lower amount plus tip was withdrawn. After a month of that, I stopped using them at restaurants. All in all, if this exact deal came up again, I&#039;d jump all over it and see how far I could push it.]]></description>
