					<description><![CDATA[In Switzerland, I pay 16$ for unlimited talk and text and 3GB of cellular data, which is enough for me with so much WIFI around. And best of it, I can use an iPhone because all providers have GSM. Because we&#039;re the most expensive country in western Europe I&#039;m astonished how expensive telecom in the US is (but health industry is it as well...). My whole family of four has individual contracts which are together cheaper (55$) than one usual contact with the market leader.]]></description>

Yup, I&#039;m still rockin&#039; Republic going on a cple years now and very much loving it :) We pay $25 for each of our lines and the quality and phones just keep getting better over the years! 

I don&#039;t know much about Cricket, but the other two players in the game to check out are Ting and then Project FI - Google&#039;s mobile service. Everyone I know who isn&#039;t w/ Republic is with one of those two guys, but really you can&#039;t go wrong with any of them because they&#039;re all better than the major players in the game! With much less rules too...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of these comments are pretty old, but it looks like you updated the post in August... would you still recommend this with all the other options out there these days? I&#039;m currently using Cricket, which is the pay as you go ATT dealio... waaaaay cheaper than a regular plan @ $100/mo for 5 lines. Just curious if I could be saving more, and if you&#039;d recommend something other than republic three years later?
Thanks!]]></description>

Yup! Was just gonna say what Rene did :)

We&#039;re still on the old plan, but will be moving over ourselves to the newer one since every time I look at the data it shows we would have saved a few dollars.... I think we&#039;ll all be forced to convert over anyways, which really only sucks for those who really suck up the bandwidth offline.]]></description>

Hi Carla,

I am on the $10 plan but from what I have seen the refund plans are very popular. I really love RW.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I was excited to look at the opportunities that Republic Wireless could offer me but when I went to check their website today, I noticed that they no longer offer the deals you show. They now have a Republic Refun Base Plan. Have you looked into this new plan? It is very unfortunate that they discontinued the options that you mention on your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree on wanting an iPhone - I LOVE Apple products - but I was pretty surprised how solid Republic is overall. I had a few drops and my wife said it wasn&#039;t as clear as my iPhone on the other end, but for the price it&#039;s tough to beat. Unfortunately Verizon is head and shoulders above all other carriers for coverage in my area so it&#039;s going to be tough to switch but RW definitely has me thinking about it!]]></description>
