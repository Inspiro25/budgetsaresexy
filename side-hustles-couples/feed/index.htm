Haha I like it!  My wife indirectly contributes to everything I do. She really is the &quot;better half&quot;. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some of my better-written blog posts were proofread by my wife (She&#039;s an English Language Arts Teacher) The poorly written ones, most likely done without her editing. 

So, I guess that kinda counts for starting a blog together haha.]]></description>

I guess work and passions change as you grow older and I can see how some jobs would be tougher together than others. :)
Have a great week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I spent 8 years working alongside the my hubby and honestly loved it – we met in work, and were friends for a long time before we got together. However, in the last year we now have separate jobs and I honestly think we would drive each other crazy if we worked together again! Love this list though as there are things you can still do as a couple, but separate – ie house sitting. It gives you the flexibility for all situations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We love doing things together. I joke that my wife is my editor in chief as she reads each article before its posted to help have a second set of eyes to make sure it makes sense. Sometimes there are more questions than other times but it is good fun. Also, we have rental properties together. We split the jobs so it isn&#039;t really working together but still nice to do it together.]]></description>

Same - my wife has zero interest in blogging (although she&#039;d be great at it if she wanted to)!  I think each partner has to like whatever you&#039;re going to do or it&#039;ll be short lived :)]]></description>

This is so cool to hear :)  Couples podcasts are really fun to listen to - I&#039;ll have to check it out!   
PS. love the Soul Purpose triangle on your site. Keep up the good work! I&#039;ve been blogging every day for a few years, and its both an amazing and challenging endeavor. Let me know if I can help in any way. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I each have our own side hustles and another joint one:

Me:  Blogging at successtriangles.com and running a couple of HOA websites. 
Wife:  Selling jewelry
Together:  A podcast about funny/stupid stories from across the internet.

We both have day jobs as well, but as soon as the &#039;work day&#039; is over we both go to work on the side hustles. The blog is relatively new so there&#039;s not much income. She makes about $4k a year off jewelry and I clear around $1,200 a year running HOA websites.  We have recorded over 125 episodes of the podcast and increased monthly downloads to around 25,000, although we are still trying to figure out how to monetize it since it is a niche topic.

Side hustles together can be a lot of fun ;-)]]></description>
