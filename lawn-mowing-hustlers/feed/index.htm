Oh, I&#039;m right there with you!

I mean &quot;hustler&quot; in the most positive way! I think it&#039;s great to be providing services people need in the community, and exactly why I mentioned even thinking about starting one myself.

I&#039;ll have to disagree with you on the &quot;bum w/ a cup&quot; route (to me anyone who needs to beg has it worse off than I do, so why not give a couple of bucks?), but Hustle Time I&#039;m all about.. 

We even have a series dedicated to Side Hustles if you haven&#039;t seen it yet: https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ways-to-make-money/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Calling it a &quot;hustle,&quot; to seek gainful employment is hardly fair.

If no one would pay for grass cutting, we&#039;d have more people looking for a handout.

These are honest people, looking for honest labor. 

I never give money to a bum w/ a cup.  But I am always ready to overpay the scouts for a car wash.  You encourage bums and beggars, you get more of them.  Your encourage honest laborers, you get more of them.]]></description>

Hah! Yeah, for real.

And crazy he can&#039;t find reliable help??? I feel like so many people are in dire need of a steady income that they&#039;d be all over it. That sucks.

We literally had someone knocking on our door just today asking to cut our lawn :) And I&#039;m in a totally different house/state than when I first published this article a cple years back - hah. Hustlers are everywhere!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That sounds like a great deal to me...for $20 it would have to be a small flat yard.
Around here it costs way more, but the yards are not small or flat (WV Hills)

My husband owned/ran a lawn care business for the last 8 years and it is a good gig...his biggest problem was having too much work and not being able to keep any reliable help.
At one point he had enough work to hire 3 other people full time but had to give it up because over the 8 years time he only found one reliable person that would actually show up for work.

He recently backed out of most of his biz to work a &quot;real job&quot; for a while...just got burnt out on it and he is waiting until our son gets a little older so he can work for him...but he still has a few jobs that are pretty quick and easy that nets him an extra $300 or $400 a month during the April thru October months. 

My 11 y/o son thinks its great that he earns $10 a week for helping to mow the neighbors lawn for an hour.
There is quite a bit of demand where we are despite the fact that we live in the &quot;country&quot; where you would think people would mow their own lawns!?!?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also don&#039;t forget about all that dang CUT grass that then gets scattered across the lawn that you have to clean up too, ugh... at least with my lawn mowing skills. I have a bag attached to the thing but I swear it doesn&#039;t do anything. Still have to sweep and clean up after the cutting anyways which I&#039;d much prefer to put on someone else ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$40 per month does sound great.  Very good marketing, like you said.  I&#039;m trying to think how often I cut my lawn in the summer and honestly can&#039;t remember because it&#039;s been so long.  I think I cut it every 2 weeks, and after 2 weeks it tends to get rather long.  The worst part is that if you wait a few extra days beyond that, it becomes hard to cut and chokes the lawn mower (if you have a mulching mower rather than a bag mower), so you often have to raise the mower up and not cut it as close.

I definitely think the $40 per month is well worth it for the peace of mind, even if I would never cut my own lawn every week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have always hated yard work and actually budgeted in lawn service expenses before we even considered buying a home.  At our last house, we paid $25 every two weeks from April through October for mowing, edging, weeding, and clean up since our yard was small.  Now it&#039;s $38 a pop since our yard is huge and we have 3 flower beds, BUT IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT.  I get to avoid allergies and use my time elsewhere and my lawn guy can make a solid living.  It&#039;s a win-win, lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I sometimes forget that doing a lot of things yourself requires ownership of the tools too which all takes up space. It could get pretty cluttered fast in small places!]]></description>
