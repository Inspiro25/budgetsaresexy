Ha! I didn&#039;t realise that this was a local term!

&quot;cowboy builder&quot; 
British English informal
a house builder with no proper training or official qualifications who does work of a low standard
E.G.: &quot;Do-it-yourself decorators and cowboy builders are ruining Britain’s historic towns.&quot;

Nope! We allocate every dollar to go somewhere too. The only thing up for grabs is “found money”. So anything above my expected raise (hubby is retired), gifts, anything we weren’t counting on goes to the travel fund. It’s our biggest splurge and even though we travel closer to 3 star than 5 star we take some amazing trips. All about making memories with the kids rather than buying junk. So yeah that whole 2k would go in the travel fund for next summer.]]></description>

No, you&#039;re not ;)
Since I put aside all bills and then allocate money by percentage of the rest (emergency, investments, all sinking funds, groceries and going out), every pot would just grow that much faster and I may even splurge on something or go out with friends one more night this month. Btw, the year is up with the electric company, and instead of taking my money this month, they&#039;re refunding overpaid bills instead - two months worth. It&#039;s not $2,000 but score :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love these lessons to your kids. For me, nothing else besides living life on my own terms would do. I once read something Ernest Hemingway had written about this and realized that&#039;s how I am. I took kind of weird path in life but it&#039;s my path and I lived my life the only way I could imagine. I think that&#039;s why FIRE resonated with me - it&#039;s a way to REALLY live life how I want. Perfect!

As far as the $2,000, I think it would go straight to investments. I just installed my new toilet with another FI friend today, and just ordered my new fridge, so I think my home improvement projects are done for a while. So I think I would put those little employees to work making me more money!]]></description>

Congrats!!! Always a good milestone! And you&#039;re definitely not alone in the &quot;figuring it out on your own&quot; department regardless of what our parents/friends tell us sometimes ;) Most of us are pretty slow and take a while to finally catch on, haha...]]></description>
