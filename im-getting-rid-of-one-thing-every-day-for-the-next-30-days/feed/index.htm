Haha yeah - that&#039;s def. much more hardcore than just 1/day ;) And looks like you still got the main takeaway by the end anyways, even if you did stop at #8! It&#039;s all about paying attention more and re-evaluating!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i did this a while ago. photographed my progress on instagram to keep me honest. my approach was slightly different as i got rid of 1 item on day one and then 2 items on day 2 until eventually 30 items on day 30. this was really hard and at about day 8 i could no longer find more than 8 things to get rid of. i live a fairly low footprint life already, so this was tough, but got me to seriously review why i keep certain things around.]]></description>

YUP! No one said you had to trash it all - just &quot;get it out of your house!&quot; Haha... My box is overflowing and ready to be donated any day now - and we&#039;re only a couple weeks in :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been doing this declutter approach for about two months now.  But, instead of throwing it away, I have placed them in boxes designated for our city&#039;s annual citywide garage/rummage sale.  Make a little extra cash and try to save the Earth-well at least I won&#039;t be the one throwing it in the landfill or burning it.    

It actually feels good to be able to declutter.  The house gets lighter after each purge!]]></description>
