Yikes!! Haha... If I still used my salt shaker I&#039;d give it a shot though :) I literally haven&#039;t touched it in weeks, and while I miss it, I&#039;m surviving okay it seems... everything&#039;s just so bland!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad you&#039;re &quot;being an adult&quot;. Just taking care of ourselves alone is a job. Our gadgets would remind us every five minutes that we need to do something just to stay status quo. Since you&#039;re busy working hard being a better person, I found a free tip on Twitter for you from Dr. OZ that deals with blood pressure (which you mentioned in a previous post). I can&#039;t say your dentist will like it when you visit but oh well (get it. . .garlic).

Here goes. . . ‏@DrOz 3m ago

To lower your blood pressure, try replacing your salt shaker with a garlic and herb spice. This can save over 600mg of sodium per serving.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I go to the dentist every 6 months for cleanings, the dermatologist at least once a year for a skin check, the eye doctor for an annual eye exam and my physician makes me get an annual physical or I can&#039;t be in her practice. Oh and of course the annual visit to the gyno. Being healthy requires a lot of doctor appointments! I can&#039;t imagine how many I would have if i weren&#039;t healthy!]]></description>

Will do.  I don&#039;t anticipate any problems from here on out.  My stress level is better and my cholesterol is excellent now.  I think it was just a bump in the road to catch my attention.  I plan on being around for a loooooong time!]]></description>
