					<description><![CDATA[Hah! Well you&#039;ve come to the right spot :) Though I must say I rarely even think about it anymore and the chair has just become a part of the office... I can tell you that my back hasn&#039;t hurt an ounce since getting it though? But that could be because my old chair sucked and the Turcotte could be fine too... Though a small part of me now wishes I got that one just cuz it looks so much better and I&#039;d probably have gotten used to it anyways... 

If I were you I&#039;d think about buying the Roncer and trying it out for a few days, and then just return the one that you didn&#039;t like. (If you can front the money for a bit). Though not sure about putting it all together and then taking apart/etc - might be too much of a pain.

Oh, to answer your question RE: hours - I sit in the Roncer anywhere from 5-8 hours a day. Feels the same whether I&#039;m in there for 20 mins or 8 hours so I think it&#039;s fine. I could have sworn it was much more comfortable in the store though ;) (mine also doesn&#039;t lean back AT ALL like it did in the store - not sure if that was cuz I didn&#039;t put together right (a high possibility) or cuz i&#039;m imagining things and it doesn&#039;t go back at all. Just something to consider though)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not only do I do this as well, but I&#039;m having the same exact dilemma you had. I&#039;m also trying to choose between the Roncer and Turcotte; they&#039;re currently both selling for $60. I purchased the Turcotte yesterday, but it&#039;s definitely not ergonomic and my behind is already hurting on this chair. I&#039;m strongly considering exchanging it either for the Roncer or the Lorell Executive High-Back Chair on Amazon for $100 more. What has been your experience with the Roncer? Would you recommend it after having used it? The website says it&#039;s rated for 3 hours of daily use, which is far less than I would be using it.]]></description>

Actually, that&#039;s because most of those sites cache the prices and then do a last minute check for changes when you are ready to book. They could be from days ago. Sites that end in vacations.com do this check after you select the flight or hotel, but before you checkout. 

Bonus tip: search, wait for it to load and search again. Repeat until no more results come back. There&#039;s often a cut of for how long to wait for replies, but more may get cached for the next person on the background.]]></description>

I think what Johnny means is if you&#039;re just adjusting yourself, not the chair.. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[haha... I see both sides of it myself, and really just comes down to personal preference and what the item in question is. for bigger things I&#039;d probably go with the better quality one so it lasts longer (if more money DOES equal better quality, btw - it&#039;s not always the case!), but on smaller items I usually choose the cheaper ones...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friend wanted to buy a washing machine.  Her husband had a connection that would get him a discount on a fancier washing machine.  She said she only wanted the non fancy anyway and it would cost lest so they&#039;d be spending less.  But her husband went ahead and got the more expensive one simply because it had a discount so it was worth more.  But they spent more money!!

I can see both sides.  What do you think about it?]]></description>
