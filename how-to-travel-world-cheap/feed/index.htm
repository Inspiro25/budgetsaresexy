That sounds interesting indeed :) I don&#039;t personally know myself, but I bet some good time on Google might help? Or maybe just call local realtors over there and ask them directly? That might get you an answer even quicker.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would love to buy a property in Cape May, Cape May Court House, etc., rent it out, and be one of a few investors.  How would I get info on this?  I don&#039;t want a timeshare, just an own share!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just got back from the EU, points and miles, 3 of 5 flights were business class.  Our room was upgraded with wifi, full breakfast each morning, full happy hour with unlimited beer and wine with hot and cold appetizers/dinner.  

We got the points from Marriott&#039;s black card and 58 room rentals in a year.  Miles from job.  Trip was valued at minimum of $18K.

Wonderful romantic tour and came back home not in debt!!  Hooray!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MIND BLOWN with Amazon Payments. To make sure I&#039;m not completely ignorant: you are essentially just shuffling your money around between bank accounts (if it is going from you to your spouse for instance or from you checking at one bank to your savings at another bank) but the money is getting charged to your credit card and you can just pay it back to the initial account.  That is a CRAZY awesome way to rack up points on credit cards!!]]></description>

The Ink Plus and Ink Bold earn 5x at office supply stores, so you can earn 5x with them on gift cards bought at Office Depot, Staples, Office Max, etc. I know you don&#039;t want to hear it, but there are better offers for the Delta Gold card. :-( Don&#039;t hesitate to email me before you apply for a card. I&#039;m always happy to help!]]></description>
