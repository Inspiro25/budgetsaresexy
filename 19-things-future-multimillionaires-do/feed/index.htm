Hell yes on that last one!! I ask that all the time when at antique stores or yard sales :)

Very true about *action* too... All the reading and thinking and strategizing is nice, but if you never do anything about it it doesn&#039;t matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here are a couple of thoughts:
1)  Networking up and down.  Talking to people who can help you.  Talking to people you can help.   = Talking and engaging with everyone.
2)  Strategic Planning:  I found there are two steps to &quot;getting what you want&quot; or &quot;accomplishing a goal.&quot;  First step is crucial: THINKING &#038; PLANNING (how to reach goal).  Second step is:  DOING.  The &quot;doing&quot; is actually easier than the &quot;Thinking and Planning&quot; which takes much more deliberate effort.  Therefore, &quot;Strategic Planning.&quot;

*Doing Something Is Better Than Doing Nothing.*
*If you want results, you must take action.*
*Everything is negotiable.  Always ask:  &quot;Is there any way I can get a better price on this?&quot;*]]></description>

Here&#039;s what the original author says about &quot;thinking strategically&quot;:

&quot;This is really just a fancy way of saying that wealthy people have usually learned to decide what their goals are, then work backward to figure out what they have to do each year, each week—and even each day—to make it happen. Then they track their progress.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried #1 (They develop multiple income sources) multiple times in my 20&#039;s, but I was never successful. Even lost money a few times. I&#039;m in my 30s now, and do have more than one income source, although my day job is still my #1 money maker.

I don&#039;t know how to tell if someone &quot;thinks strategically&quot; though. Maybe I did?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I always saved and lived below my means, I thought I would work forever.  At age 50, I took a hard turn and reconsidered that mentality.  I started investing regularly and intelligently for the past 5 years, and it has handsomely paid off.  It&#039;s never too late to change money habits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#4 both ways: Maybe they mean using the network for themselves and also working it by connecting people within your network? I try to be a connector of people in my network more than I use it myself. Then if I have to use it, I&#039;m usually happily surprised when I ask for help. Or maybe they mean giving back to the network as much as you get. Either way!]]></description>
