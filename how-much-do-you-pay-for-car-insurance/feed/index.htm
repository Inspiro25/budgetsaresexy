					<description><![CDATA[USAA used to charge me $567 for six months for the car I have now. Now they want $1,000 for the same car. Nothing&#039;s changed. Same address, same credit, still no accidents or tickets. 

Geico wanted $129 for two cars including a 2019 Hyundai Elantra we got brand new today for two drivers. Geico for the win.]]></description>

It does seem like a lot off first glance, but then again you&#039;ve got two really nice new cars that&#039;s probably contributing to that. Wouldn&#039;t hurt to shop around a few places and compare though? 15 minutes can save you 15% or more ;)]]></description>

Ouch! I&#039;m sorry to hear that... must def. be because it&#039;s your first time trying to get insured :( I know you can have insurance *without* owning a car which might help with building up history, but you&#039;d have to look into and see if it&#039;s worth the $$$.. I did it a few times when I lived in cities where I didn&#039;t need one so my history wouldn&#039;t lapse and it was super cheap, but not sure if that&#039;s because I had already had a car before or not. Could be an idea though?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently got a quote for $4,358.00/ 6 months from Geico and I’m 23, and I’ve never owned a car before and I guess it will remain that way. I’ve also tried other companies, but the quotes just got higher. I’m a student with good grades and I have a 736 credit score, but the discounts don’t help much.]]></description>
