					<description><![CDATA[Why is it our natural tendency to categorize finances and health separately? I think finances should be considered part of one&#039;s health. I don&#039;t know about you but being broke takes a toll on my mental and physical health (stress, long hours, etc.). With that in mind, health is always about moderation and balance. We can&#039;t eat cake every day and be physically healthy just like we can&#039;t work 12 hours every day or go on vacation every day and be financially healthy.]]></description>

You would not believe how you have said the right words at the right time and what an effect they have had on my day, and how calming they have been. &quot;Patience&quot; and when &quot;those stars align later&quot; is what I needed to hear today. I will keep dreaming J. Money, since life without a dream is just a string of days. For now I have to go email the realtor who has been haunting me since Friday when this unit came on the market. Again, thanks for being so generous with your time and knowledge, and for being so kind. Many many thanks.]]></description>

BOOM! You&#039;ve said it even better - &quot;having options&quot;. That really is one of the best gifts you could ever give yourself, and to have that in your 40s no less - amazing! I def. think you made the right call here, but don&#039;t let it stop you from still dreaming and trying to land an awesome place in the future :) Good things come for those with patience, and when those stars align later you take it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/health-vs-wealth-poll-which-should-be-first/#comment-269441&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

I can&#039;t thank you enough for taking the time to respond J. Money. I thought of the home on the 18th floor through the weekend. I woke up on Monday morning very happy that I don&#039;t have to go to work, while I was laying in bed hearing the cars in the neighborhood start up one by one. Just the thought of not having to spend another day in an office behind a desk is enough to convince me that dream home or not, life is much more than the four walls we live in, be it in a luxury building or a regular building like the one I live in right now. Today I have the freedom to go away for a month or two or three to almost any part of the world. if I bought that home, I would be limited in my choices. I think what it boils down to is having options and by buying that home I would have much less options and that really scares me. I will let someone else purchase that unit on the 18th floor as I am confident the economy will take a downturn in early 2020. I simply do not trust the economy these days J. Money, tariff wars and all, we will see the impact soon. I want to say economy is good right now, but everything is good until it is not. No new home for me J. Money. Thanks for being the voice of reason and balance. I will be staying put and shoveling cash in the market and keeping my options open and my choices plenty. After all life is about having choices. My home is paid off and a new home is just a &quot;want&quot;, not a &quot;need&quot;. What I need is a roof over my head which I have. Many many thanks for your time in responding. Stay well.]]></description>

Intriguing dilemma indeed!

And I think it boils down to one main question: which is most important to you right now: retirement or dream home? If retirement is tippy top of priority, i&#039;d probably sit back and continue watching until I finally got a better deal on the home and then jump all over it. Dream homes are much more exciting when you feel like you&#039;re scored :) If you feel in your bones that the time is now, however, and after 18 years you just might!, i don&#039;t think it&#039;s the worst thing in the world to splurge and finally get your home either. But just so long as you&#039;d be willing to go back in the workforce if the $hit hit the fan. And at 40 years old that shouldn&#039;t be too hard, eh? The beauty here is that you have soooo many years ahead of you with either route you choose, so that certainly helps with all big decisions you make. Whatever you do, just be sure to come back here and let us know :) Always thrilling to think about whichever way you go!]]></description>

It&#039;ll all start coming to you too over the years! The longer you blog the more time for people/companies to find you and send you over stuff :) Feel free to riff off this one if you&#039;d like - I&#039;m sure they&#039;d love it!]]></description>
