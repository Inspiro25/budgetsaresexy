					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you can anymore :( It needs to be attached to someone I believe who would manage it/vouch for it, ya know? But you could always give admin to someone else first OR make a new fb profile that&#039;s more on &quot;the low&quot; to continue forward with it? luckily my personal one wasn&#039;t attached to any, but my J. Money one sure is!]]></description>

If you have a phone that has an internal address book, it prolly also has a block list. its like a special address book for your &quot;extra special friends&quot; like Card Services ;-)) Scroll to the number, press menu or save, and see if &quot;block list&quot; is one of the choices. if it is , Bingo!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My goals this year are pretty tame, but all stuff I need to get done. I&#039;m working on them - like learning more about investing and going to the gym, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve accomplished one yet. I think the goal I&#039;m most enjoying so far though, is my goal to come up with a 5 year financial plan (I&#039;m such a nerd) - probably because I&#039;m finding it challenging and it really makes me use the grey-matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holy crap that&#039;s a large goal! I don&#039;t even read 10 books a year! Or even 5 books! Haha... but if you count all my magazines and online articles I bet I come close ;)

Good for you though - I admire those who soak up books like that. You&#039;re always expanding your knowledge! Not to mention enjoying lots of your free time :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/new-years-resolutions-update/#comment-114438&quot;&gt;Jason Price&lt;/a&gt;.

Haha, what&#039;s sillier is if you have dress shirts AND suits AND tons of ties but you haven&#039;t worn any of them in 6 years! Like me! :) I keep wondering if I&#039;ll ever get back to a &quot;real job&quot; though in which case I may need them again?? It&#039;s not like I attend that many weddings where I need to constantly be switching it up either - I need to work on this more. Thanks for the reminder :)]]></description>

Woahhhhhh I want one of those!!! That is brilliant!! Totally like the olden days too where people traded for stuff instead of using money :) So cool you have a group like that - I doubt I could get any of my guy friends to participate, haha... I don&#039;t even know if I have the balls to ask them! Totally relaying this over to my wife though - I bet she&#039;d love that kinda stuff :) Thanks!]]></description>

Oh, really? How do we get it to our block list? I didn&#039;t know you could even do that??

You&#039;re right about the illegal stuff though - if they&#039;re going against the law then yeah they&#039;re not gonna listen to me unless maybe I threaten to report them? Not sure if there&#039;s any real threat there or not though, haha... Guess we&#039;ll find out soon if these places keep calling me back :)

And yes!! I always get &quot;card services!&quot; Drives me nutso!]]></description>
