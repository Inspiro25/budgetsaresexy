					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, for sure.  I don&#039;t mind spending a lot of money even if I know I&#039;ll be making more using an adviser than going it alone.  I guess that&#039;s the problem though is that you don&#039;t know until you&#039;re there ;)  Unless you do a flat comparison and manage 50% of your own money yourself, and then give them 50% to manage or help you with/etc.  Kinda like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-401k-ira-test/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Roth IRA Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

All in all though, if you can find a good adviser you can trust, I think you&#039;d be in good hands.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As bad as some financial advisors are (the commission factor) there are a lot of people who will do a far worse job with their investments if they go it alone.  They might lose more, a lot more, than they&#039;d pay an FP in commissions.

Maybe the best route is to go with an independent FP, one who works on a flat annual fee.  Taking away the FP&#039;s trading will eliminate the commissions and the financial distortions they cause.  Also, if the FP is paid on a flat fee he&#039;ll be more interested in the performance of your investments.  After all, if you have to write a flat fee check once a year, you&#039;ll be able to compare his fee with the returns his recommendations produced.  If the performance isn&#039;t good, you might not invite him back for another year, which he&#039;ll be well aware of.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for sharing this with us Mr. Anonymous! (uh-oh, now everyone knows you&#039;re a guy! haha...)  REALLY really interesting stuff - and appreciate you divulging it ESPECIALLY since you still work there!  That takes balls my friend, and your secret is safe with me :)

@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this too Matt!  Esp. coming from another person who&#039;s been in it, and went on their own like that.  Good for you, bro.
@&lt;b&gt;Babs&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I&#039;m a big fan of paying someone money when they MAKE me money ;)  I&#039;ll pay thousands if they&#039;re making me hundreds of thousands! Haha... true you gotta pay attention to where you go, and who you select though - it&#039;s never a black and white choice.
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!!  (and yeah, didn&#039;t write this but I wish I did! haha...)  I think I read that NY Times article too - pretty crazy.  Though saving &quot;too much&quot; is way better than SPENDING too much at least ;)
@&lt;b&gt;DebtTips&lt;/b&gt; -  Yup, sales is a whole crazy bag of tricks.  Unless you&#039;re actually GOOD and can genuinely give the customers what they need and they keep coming back cuz they trust you.  I always figured that *that* would bring in way more sales than one-time bonuses for selling them something wrong in the first place.  Repeat customers are always better than one-offs.
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting... agree on starting in the 20s, but neat to see you&#039;d go w/out the planner.  Thanks for sharing :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; -  Good point!
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, totally.  And same goes for your career and life, in general, too!  Except for maybe our moms :)  They&#039;re always looking out for us, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Ten Bob&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s f&#039;d up man, good for your friend.  People can turn into monsters when it comes to money and their own self-interests, makes this world worse off.  And it&#039;s not that easy to just leave a job for it either, so tell your friend I highly respect him!
@&lt;b&gt;Johanna @ Betterment&lt;/b&gt; - No hidden costs are nice ;)  I&#039;ll have to check it out in a bit.
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff Reed&lt;/b&gt; -  I was wondering when we&#039;d get a comment like this!  Haha... love it, thanks for stopping by and sharing :) No ranting at all, you have a fair and valid point there my friend.  There are DEF some excellent advisors out there with consciences! And glad to hear you&#039;re one of them (and are willing to stand up for them and say so!).  I didn&#039;t write up this post - it came from an insider at one of these large institutions - but I think the overall point of &quot;be careful!&quot; shined through here.  Which was why I was more than happy to post it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J.
Unfortunately the financial industry has its fair share of me-first, greedy sales people. However there are more honest, comitted professionals than some might think after reading this post.  I haven&#039;t been in the industry for 25 years because I take short-cuts and try to make quick bucks at the expense of my clients.  It is about a &quot;mutually beneficial relationship&quot;.

I left a firm because they recruited me saying: &quot;You don&#039;t have to sell proprietary products. You can offer clients anything you feel confident will serve your clients.&quot;   That didn&#039;t last long when I went outside for a majority of the investments I used.  I recruited my next broker-dealer and am in a franchise advisory group with national broker-dealer.  I am my own boss and therefore get to do what I believe is in my clients&#039; best interest.

The cornerstone of these relationships is planning.  I help them plan for the certainty of uncertainty.  If someone was about to retire in 2008 but had to keep working because their 401k got hammered they will never quibble over the fee I charge to do a comprehensive financial plan for them.  They now know that the cost of not planning is far more than they imagined.

I think this post was informative for many readers.  However, the next time you pull the broad brush out to paint a picture, consider leaving some room to talk about how some people do it the correct way.  Thanks for letting me rant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a great &quot;insider&quot; article. This really resonates with me as I work for Betterment.com, a product designed to remove the unnecessary complexities of investing. Fat fees from financial advisors are one of those unnecessaries. 
Brokers want you to trade as much as possible (it generates fees) and advisors want you to think that they have some special sauce with which they can beat the market. They don’t, especially not after fees.
Betterment.com was founded on this very idea - that investing should be simple and accessible. They only charge a management fee of 0.3%-0.9%.
There are no minimum balances, no transaction fees, no holding periods, and no hidden costs.
We hope more people will speak out on this topic - thanks for being so candid!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Edward. Great point. ALWAYS ask what your adviser is going to make on a transaction and if there are any hidden fees. With insurance it is going to be commissions almost always and that is why some planners are Fee-Based instead of Fee-Only. However, if they are independent they should be able to quote you insurance costs for many companies. For example, an independent planner can usually sell you an insurance policy from many of the firms that are out there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a friend who used to work for [very disappointingly one of my own financial institutions] and he ended up quitting because he was so sickened by obscene tactics used to meet quotas. Hearing one of his co-workers convince an elderly lady to invest in something they all knew was a losing deal was the final straw. Luckily he had no consumer debt and a 6-month safety net so he was free to make a choice.

@cashflowmantra - amen to that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My roommate works at insurance company and has been pushing a plan. But he was upfront to what his commission would be...a whopping $40.

So that would be my advice. If you are uncertain on how straight shooting your advisor is, ask him what his commission would be if you bought whatever he was advising. If he won&#039;t tell you, than that should tell you enough right there. If he does, figure out whose making more money out of the deal, him or you.]]></description>
