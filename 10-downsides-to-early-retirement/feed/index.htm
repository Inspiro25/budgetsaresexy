					<description><![CDATA[Good article, but the point about social security isn&#039;t as bad as stated for higher earners. The first $ put in have a 6x better return than the last $ if you&#039;re above roughly 35*12*$5100 total put in. So it&#039;s a lot better deal to put in the minimum amounts than the max.

					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I also retired early (in our early 40s), I can very much relate to all of these.  Like you, I have found many ways to overcome these downsides.  One of the biggest keys we&#039;ve found to be happy in early retirement is to continue to challenge ourselves.

Travel is a big part of that.  In the 3+ years since retiring, we did a 5-week tour of SE Asia, a 2-week tour of China, a tour through the Panama Canal, and a cruise around the Mediterranean.  We&#039;re now planning a 5-week driving tour around the Eastern US, which will include both of our 30-year HS reunions and FinCon in Orlando (where I&#039;ll be speaking).

I sometimes wonder if my wife and I retired too soon, so it&#039;s very reassuring that your only regret is that you didn&#039;t do it much earlier!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great list.

After finances, the biggest issue in my experience is keeping the mind engaged. My stepfather, a professor of pulmonary medicine, retired early for health reasons. He wasn&#039;t mentally prepared. Going from teaching residents in a clinical environment to a somewhat forced retirement caused him to fall into a pretty serious depression. He finally came out of that and found another passion - painting. He and mom built a studio for him in their house. She had to pry him out of it after awhile. He wasn&#039;t ready to retire and hadn&#039;t prepared mentally for it. The early years were tough. 

My most offered piece of advice to clients wanting to retire, either early or normally, is to have a plan for how you will spend your time. Too many people&#039;s identity and worth are tied to their jobs. 
Gotta think about that well before retirement. The consequences of not doing so can be significant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The easy answer to loss of income, loss of identity and boredom was to create some lucrative side gigs. While I don&#039;t need more money it is kind of comforting to have stayed at a zero withdrawal rate for the first three years of our retirement. Plus as a consultant I maintain the well known brand I built during my career. And working one or two days a week still leaves me ample time for volunteering and our many hobbies. I think it may work better for people who loved their former jobs like me. If you hated your former work then finding highly paid work you would enjoy is going to be much more challenging.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post and very insightful. 

For point 7, would it help if people first reduced their working hours by a day or two every week? Instead of working 40 or 60 hours a week for 20 or more years and suddenly getting to 0 is hard. But getting from 40 to 30 is doable and in a year you can become comfortable going to 0. In the meantime using that extra day to get into clubs or nurturing hobbies may help getting there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny - I think #5 would go the opposite way for me. Currently I am at a desk job, so it&#039;s difficult to find time for physical activity. If I were retired, I would have a LOT more time to be active - it&#039;s unlikely I would be sitting in a chair all day.

Otherwise, good points, and many I hadn&#039;t thought about. I&#039;m still aiming for FIRE, though. :)]]></description>
