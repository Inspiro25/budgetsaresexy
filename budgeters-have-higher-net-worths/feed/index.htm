					<description><![CDATA[LOL  I love that motherbudgeter website.

We only started having a budget last March.  Our net worth has skyrocketed.  We feel like we have a plan for buying a house in the next few years, and without our budget, we wouldn&#039;t be able to handle it.  

I sum it up with this quick story:  Friends got married last year.  We budgeted over the 4 months coming up to the wedding.  Drove out, had a blast, and on the Sunday after a friend said &quot;Man, this was fun but I can&#039;t believe how much money I spent.  I&#039;m going to have to shuffle some money around so I can pay some bills....&quot;  My wife and I were shocked.  We didn&#039;t even think about how much we had spent.  Checked the budget when we got home and saw that we actually were $150 under budget!  BAM!]]></description>

I imagine that its as simple as:
&quot;Those who budget are at least trying to pay attention to their financial health, and are therefore more likely to tailor the outcome in their favor.&quot;

If you are not paying attention, it will all slip through your fingers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budgeters-have-higher-net-worths/#comment-133109&quot;&gt;Done by Forty&lt;/a&gt;.

Yeah, I think everyone budgets to a degree - even if it&#039;s in their head and it&#039;s rudimentary. My guess is that Mr. MMM knows he makes well over what he needs in any given month - especially with the awesome success of this blog - so that he doesn&#039;t need to concern himself much with cash flow. He knows more is coming in than going out because he&#039;s a jedi master at keeping his expenses crazy low. (I don&#039;t know who or what jedi is actually, but hopefully I used him/it right in that thought ;)).]]></description>
