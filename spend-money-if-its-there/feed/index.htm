					<description><![CDATA[Hi J. 

My weakness in &quot;spending it if it&#039;s there,&quot; is my family.  Example: we just went into a skateboard shop for my daughter&#039;s 10th birthday present today and dropped $175 on a skateboard, helmet, pads, and shoes.  Because we shopped smart and the owner of the shop was just plain cool, we saved over $50 on the total bill, but we were planning on spending only $100 to just get the board, trucks, and wheels.  

What happened is that the &quot;mom&quot; in me wouldn&#039;t stop thinking, &quot;Her old pads are probably too small now, and her bike helmet doesn&#039;t cover as much of her head as the skateboard helmets do...and oh, yeah, I&#039;ve got a $70 affiliate check from my personal blog I&#039;ve been using as a bookmark all week because I didn&#039;t have time to go to the bank. And it&#039;s cheaper than an emergency room visit, and she&#039;ll be safer, etc.&quot;  (All totally justifiable in my husband&#039;s mind too.)

So instead of saving that money like we were planning on (for new tires ironically), we spent it today.   If it wasn&#039;t there I don&#039;t think we would have spent it since we&#039;ve lived without a credit card for 2 years now as we&#039;re working to pay things down.  I guess we did better than we would have in the past, but winter&#039;s a-comin&#039; and mama needs new tires. 

Great discussion you&#039;ve got going on here!  Thanks for the fun read and food for thought!

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;dojo&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah girl!!!  You figured out how to rock it, well done! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Well, you may not &quot;need&quot; it exactly, but you obviously WANT it at those times ;)  Which is fine, if that&#039;s what the money is supposed to be for.
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - True, but if you save first w/out knowing how much you can save, you&#039;ll end up going in debt.  So you&#039;ll have $500 of debt while you have $500 in savings! haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s one suggestion: Automate your savings. You can&#039;t spend it if it ISN&#039;T there. If you tell Ally Bank or ING Direct to siphon $500 out of your checking account each month, you learn to live on what&#039;s left.
Since it takes a few days to get the money back out, perhaps you&#039;ll come to your senses before buying that new Benz. Or 1,000 sticks of gum.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s VERY easy to spend money, when you have it. I&#039;ve done mistakes too, but weird enough, in the past months, though I earn 5 times more than 2 years ago, I spend LESS. Now I buy food and what&#039;s needed and not splurge on stupid things anymore. once you get some discipline going on, you can keep that &#039;inflation&#039; under control ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - I keep from spending it, personally, until I Really want to buy something :)  It doesn&#039;t matter to me whether I have the cash in my hands or not -- if I want something bad, I&#039;m gonna go out and buy it either way.  But if you&#039;re asking how &quot;others&quot; do it, yeah - I don&#039;t know.  That&#039;s the part I&#039;m confused about ;)
@&lt;b&gt;bogofdebt&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, I think that&#039;s a wonderful quality to have :)  Though you should probably get better about being good to yourself too!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s def. tricky and the problem most people see to have unfortunately.  I think you&#039;re right on track w/ getting it OUT of your account and invested/deposited somewhere where it&#039;s harder to touch!  I read a book once on this guy who opened up an account on the other side of town, set up auto xfers to it every month, didn&#039;t register for online access, and then tried to forget about it.  Since it was too far away to just &quot;stop in&quot; and he didn&#039;t have easy access online, it was a PAIN to ever go get it out so he just left it and lived his life for a few years, looking at the statements every few months.  Maybe you can try that?  It worked for him :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - At least you know yourself!  It&#039;s much easier to try and fix things when you KNOW how you operate :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey @ Zero to One Million Challenge&lt;/b&gt; - Agree!  I hope to always be able to purchase things that are very important to me no matter if their big or small.  Being financially secure like that is a huge blessing :)
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for sharing :)
@&lt;b&gt;MommaStar&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... That&#039;s the part that drives me crazy!  Just spending cuz you have the money to do so!  Not that I&#039;ll ever tell another person how they should be using their money, but if I&#039;m ever asked for advice you better believe I&#039;m gonna whip it all out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, that&#039;s def. true -- you DO end up paying more as you get older, at least from high school age up to your 30&#039;s-40&#039;s (then maybe it levels off?).  But at the same time, you should be making more too so at least that&#039;s comforting :)
@&lt;b&gt;Leslie&lt;/b&gt; - Makes sense!  Especially if you don&#039;t *want* to spend money on those little things you enjoy.
@&lt;b&gt;Foxie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yes!  Your financial priority is showing me a good time in those cars whenever it is we meet up :)  I SOOO need to ride in them soon!
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s all about priorities, my friend!  Some people value things none of us would imagine.... but that&#039;s okay, since it&#039;s their money ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, or you could do the whole &quot;take out $100 in cash every paycheck and use that just for little random stupid things&quot; deal :)  Any money I have in my pocket is allowed to be spent anyway I desire.  Oooooh, that should be another post of mine! Haha... I&#039;m making a note.
@&lt;b&gt;Brad Moore&lt;/b&gt; -That seems to be the consensus among some :)  Guess it&#039;s all about knowing yourself and what the best way to do things is!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to have a problem with that....if I had it in cash, then I would spend it. Especially when I was a college student.

Maybe cause I am an old man now. But it&#039;s not the problem it was. I think also has something to do with having wife and 3 kids now. I think I would feel guilty knowing I just blew 3 dollars and yet I didn&#039;t give her that same opportunity.

I have had clients tell me, however, that spending the cash makes one more frugal - rather than simply swiping!]]></description>
