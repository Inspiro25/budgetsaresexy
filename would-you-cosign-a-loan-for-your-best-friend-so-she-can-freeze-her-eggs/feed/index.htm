					<description><![CDATA[She is very optimistic to consider this option, if she is already 41 with no partner in sight.  

However, this hits close to home.  At 33, I decided to give fostering a try.  Certification was easy, though the actual fostering was a nightmare for me. I gave up the adoption hope that I’ve always had because private adoptions are at least as expensive as buying a new car.  So, I did the crazy.  I started asking around to find a sperm donor at 36 so I could do this thing on my own. I was quite amazed at how many men said no, but because they would want to be involved and I didn’t want involvement. Sperm banks require quite a bit of money, depending on how many attempts you make. I was hoping to find someone that I could have access to for medical questions or whatever, if needed in the future.  It worked out well, I’m currently 41 and have a perfect for me 4 year old daughter.    

This option can be amazingly cheap if she can find someone she knows to donate… and she can do the actual insemination herself.  I did it with my doctor cheering me on… after doing a double take when I told him what I was up to.  

Tell her not to lose hope, but consider more options than egg freezing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is a solid &quot;no&quot; because it does not sound like she is in a good financial spot, and her egg quality at this point is very low, and her pregnancy could result in problems that could leave her unable to work for a while.   That being said, she sounds determined so your best bet would be to cover the bank interest as a gift if you can&#039;t say no to her.  Really her best option is donor sperm and insemination (ASAP) like others have said, and not waste her money on the egg freezing.   It&#039;s just biological facts that childbearing is a young woman&#039;s game!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Super interesting. As a woman who did freeze her eggs, I know a lot about the process and would never have considered it at 41, the chances of healthy eggs being frozen in a large enough quantity to be viable for IVF is slim - I did it at 35 and the odds were already declining. So from the success perspective, this investment is not likely to pay off her her, and totally agree with the fostering or adoption route, there are so many kids in need of loving parents. 

Also - I live in Chicago and 0 options cost anywhere near $30k for a cycle, maybe 2+ cycles with meds and no insurance coverage? Anyways, whatever it costs, if she can’t afford this on her own, how do you afford IVF and then raising a child? She would still be paying this loan off for years and that money would be better spent on raising a foster or adopted child. 

I do agree that if someone were to offer to help financially in this scenario it should be seen as a very generous gift.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, the odds of a successful pregnancy from this are not in her favor, it’s just most likely too late already.  She needs to try an IUI with donor sperm RIGHt NOW and not keep waiting for a partner. Single motherhood is her best option of having a baby and it needs to be soon. I would gift her money to get donor sperm and an IUI as it would be much cheaper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t.

All the negative reasons you&#039;ve listed far outweigh the positive reasons. &quot;The gift of a baby&quot; is a fallacy because they could have the baby, even without an interest-free co-signment.

Likewise, I would feel extremely uncomfortable cosigning with someone who, you said yourself:

&quot; She is 41 years old, super smart, has a great job, but hasn’t been a great money saver in life&quot;

And even moreso, I&#039;d feel very uncomfortable helping her deliver a child into a world if she is unable to save money. Not in like a &#039;judgy&#039; way, but that baby&#039;s gonna have a pretty terrible life if their parents aren&#039;t financially responsible enough to rack up enough money where 20k won&#039;t be a huge dent in their net worth.

Like sure, you&#039;ll feel great helping her because you&#039;re doing *her* a favor, but you&#039;re not doing the kid any favors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t do it, not because I don&#039;t have it, or don&#039;t want to. Money changes relationships with people, so I never lend to friends or family, ever. When my husband was alive he was always bailing his son out with &quot;loans&quot; that of course, never got paid back. One day I finally said, if you can&#039;t let it go, then don&#039;t give it.

Now I know this is a different scenario, but the reason Judge Judy has so much material and makes so much money is because of family and friend &quot;loans.&quot;

If you value your friendship more than anything, don&#039;t do it. Instead, if you have the money, give her a few thousand as a &quot;gift&quot; towards the loan instead. Let her figure it out, plus there is always adoption.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a best friend so if they were in a jam, I&#039;d just give them the $20k....even $30k.  But I would just gift it....no loans, no co-signing.  But here&#039;s the key, she isn&#039;t in a jam.  She just doesn&#039;t want to pay the interest.  She can get the loan from the bank so she should go that route.  I would even be willing to say to my best friend&#039;s face:  &quot;If you were in a jam, I&#039;d be first in line to help.  But you&#039;re not in a jam.  Pay the interest.&quot;]]></description>
