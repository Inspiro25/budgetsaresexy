					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for being so open and honest (as always) J!! Yes, we have a lot more in life insurance than that. There&#039;s so much to think about with insurance w/ kids: college, daycare, (if something happened to one of us and the other still had to work, we&#039;d need daycare), paying off our mortgage, etc. We also don&#039;t have a lot of other investments (other than hubby&#039;s 403B) to draw from so we wanted to max out the life insurance as much as possible. Sounds like you guys are good for double-income-no-kids though. 

I&#039;m now considering switching to DirecTV after the baby gets here... one life change at a time. LOL (Not that cable is a major life change, but you know how it is when you work from home... a few hours with no Web access can really screw you up!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always found it much more enlightening (yet maddening) to show all of your &quot;paycheck expenses&quot; like Federal Withholding, Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, health insurance, as budget items.  They are, after all, MAJOR expenses.   Doing that, you&#039;ll see that, like most people, you spend as much on taxes as you do on food and utilities combined.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;ve tried calling those jokers and they just mess things up every time I try to get something done.  once they left us without cable for like 3 days!  just so i can get a discount... can&#039;t stand them :(

insurance -- we (my wife and I - no kids) have like $250k or $300k each.  can&#039;t recall of my head.  i&#039;m sure adding in kids def. raises it a bit ;)  you&#039;re probably good.  I use USAA for everything - if you can get in there GO FOR IT!  so incredible.

look for an update on this soon!  i want to see what our numbers are looking like these days... i&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re way lower ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Damn, I thought Optimum Cable was high. We&#039;re paying $118/mos for phone/cable/internet. 

Have you tried calling to see if you can get a deal? If you call and threaten to switch, they might knock down the price as a Triple Play customer (to the introductory rate). Unless that IS a deal. 

Also curious (if you don&#039;t mind revealing) how much life ins. coverage you have? We&#039;re paying $150 a month, but we have 2 kids (well, we purchased w/ 2 kids in mind) so I guess we need more than you. I&#039;m just wondering if we should have shopped around for a better deal on that!! 

I like seeing your breakdown and noting that you don&#039;t &quot;skimp&quot; on anything... you&#039;re frugal, but not insanely so. You still eat out, wife drinks Starbucks, etc. etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jonathan&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  That was just MY portion ;)  We pay about $2200 minimum every month - crazy, huh?  I should actually update this again - soooo much has changed over the last 2 years.

@&lt;b&gt;Kim&lt;/b&gt; - HOTNESS! That sounds like a most beautiful plan - good job :)  Maybe I&#039;ll see you around during our travels?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great!  I went through a similar process to figure out how much money we bring in after taxes and where all of that money goes.  My husband and I are saving up to quit our jobs and travel the world indefinately.  We make average-people salaries and are saving $30K a year- it&#039;s all about priorities!]]></description>
