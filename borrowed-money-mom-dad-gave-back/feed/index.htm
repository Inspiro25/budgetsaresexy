Good luck! Though please don&#039;t rush if you don&#039;t know where exactly you want to be living for 30 years - that&#039;s a long time! :) Maybe y&#039;all need to go on a fun road trip this Summer and scout out some spots?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks J. Money this one was fun to read.  Glad you got the money you needed to stay out of excess debt.  Me and my boyfriend of 16 years are still looking to buy land and build our dream house ( what we can afford that to be any)  ... My parents are also going to have money and their used and antique collections given to their 4 children.  I can&#039;t wait to get my grandmothers on my dad side, bed room set.  I have 3 other grandparents that passed as well, and till this day I do not know what I will be getting passed on to me, but I will treasure any and all of their old belongings.  Keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I search for land and a builder, process is taking me over a year and I still do not know what company to go with or what town we will settle in.  This will be a 30 year house, not a starter house, so the stress is on unless we win some realyl big money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The whole thing about privately borrowing money from family is an interesting topic and one we&#039;ve had to consider here at Dividends Down Under, although we haven&#039;t blogged about it.

We are about to go through IVF to (hopefully) have our first child, it&#039;s all very expensive territory. My grandfather (who is wealthy) offered to loan us money, and said out of all the family we are &quot;the most likely to pay it back&quot;. We haven&#039;t accepted or declined, I guess it is a little comforting to have that option as a &quot;back up&quot;, but I feel very strongly of doing this on our own.
A loan is just impatience manifested in finances, keeping strong with saving and working towards the goal will always promote personal growth. You have to make that money either way, you can either get a &quot;lump sum&quot; today and spend a long time paying it off, or save gradually for the lump sum (knowing you did it all on your own) - and that&#039;s only if you&#039;re lucky enough to a loan &quot;interest free&quot;. 
There aren&#039;t really any lessons to be learned or personal growth in instant gratification.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/borrowed-money-mom-dad-gave-back/#comment-228188&quot;&gt;Dr. Beard&lt;/a&gt;.

I was raised to have a similar mindset when it comes to money - when I have it, I&#039;m happy to freely give/loan it out to close friends/family who need it and who have a similar respect for that money that I do. I&#039;ve been the beneficiary of such gifts in the past, and I treated them as loans to be repaid as soon as I was able. It brings me peace and happiness to return the favor-- especially if I see a friend struggling over something I can help. 

More interestingly, to me at least, is the ongoing &quot;interest-free line of credit&quot; I have with my father that began in 2011 when I was just a poor college student taking an extended international trip. He gave me a secondary credit card on his account to be used so that I could avoid international fees, and he&#039;d send me a spreadsheet each month of what I owed him so I could transfer it back to his account from my checking. 

It continued well into my move back to the US to start my first real job, into my first apartment, and then through more stable financial times - when my recurring bills showed up to my permanent address--&#062;his house, where I no longer lived. He continued to simply pay and later bill me, and let me pay him back for his convenience as much as mine. The balance of who owes who has shifted between us more times than I can count, and I think we both enjoy emailing a 4 year old spreadsheet back and forth month to month (or less frequently, when we remember), because it gives us something to bond over. It&#039;s easy to want to be independent, to eschew all debt... But sometimes turning it down takes away something from the person who offered it in the first place. I wrote about the &quot;Bank of Dad&quot; last year on my blog (linked above).

We would have definitely declined the offer if it were like that! So it&#039;s good to know yourself well, and your family too for that matter :)]]></description>

It&#039;s good that you know yourself so well! More chances of making decisions off that vs what others think/say/are doing :) As for our decision over here, it was a joint one but up until this point she was the only one to give an answer (albeit a strong one) while I was still trying to figure out where I sided... Eventually I realized I wasn&#039;t going to move much from my 50/50 stance, so best to go with hers since it made her super happy/comfortable and solved the problem once and for all... Just wish it took me sooner!]]></description>

I&#039;ve borrowed funds from family before and found it was a more stressful debt than owing the bank or a credit card company!]]></description>
