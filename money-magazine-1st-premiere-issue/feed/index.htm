					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I bet :)  Not many people can say they&#039;ve worked there before!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian D.&lt;/b&gt; - Isn&#039;t that funny?  There were a ton of other great ads in there too, but would have taken me forever to post &#039;em all up :)  Blasts from the past, for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;Romeo&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!  40 years and we&#039;re still talking about pretty much the same thing.  Kinda like that book - The Richest Man in Babylon too, you ever read it?  Love this old stuff :)]]></description>
