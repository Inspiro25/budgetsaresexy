					<description><![CDATA[Actually, if you get the Citi Rewards+ card, that would make total sense.... it rounds every purchase up to the nearest 10 points.... which is the equivalent of 10 cents... Normally it takes $10 bucks to get 10 points, but you&#039;d be getting the same 10 points for 10 cents, which is literally the best points/per dollar rate I&#039;ve ever heard of.  I swear I am not employed by Citi btw]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Although depending on what card it was... you might get the $.10 waived. Many of the credit card companies won&#039;t bother sending a bill for that little. Silver lining?]]></description>

I probably wouldn&#039;t have done back when I was a cashier cuz I was pretty hardcore about evening out every night ;)  But if i had a tip jar or coins laying around? hell yeah!  Although nowadays I would have totally let you slide... i&#039;m trying to be nicer in life ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe they actually charged the card! LOL!

I was in a similar predicament once - squeezing out the last of a gift card - but i was about a quarter short. The cashier wouldn&#039;t even bother swiping my card. She just let me go. I don&#039;t know if she paid that quarter shortfall out of her pocket, or it was a &quot;cost of doing business&quot;. I imagine they probably saved money on the transaction fee...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find puppy dog eyes to be really helpful if I&#039;m a few pence short at the register...the shop assistant always let me off when I turn on the charm...I mean...sympathy.

Couldn&#039;t you have *negotiated* the 10c away? You have it in you J$!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The lowest amount I have ever charged was .50 for a pint of milk.  As a small business owner, I know that the transaction cost the company a lot more than the .10.  Usually there is a .20/charge fee + a percentage.  They should have just given it to you and saved some money. : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;sf&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I have to decline those bags every day at lunch.  Crazy that we now have to pay 5 cents per bag in DC, but then again their plan of us cutting back is working!  at least for me :)  that&#039;s hilarious you put it on your c/c, haha... you beat me!
@&lt;b&gt;sarah&lt;/b&gt; - I was kinda thinking she would find one too but no luck.  I didn&#039;t see any coins laying around though (believe me, I looked!).
@&lt;b&gt;Uncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you though!  I don&#039;t care how much school costs, I really think it&#039;s best for people in the long run.  Every extra degree gets you further up the career ladder! As long as you stick with it and it applies to your field later, of course ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... oddly enough it&#039;s starting to grow on me.  Kinda like those really ugly wrinkly dogs - the more I look at it the more I start appreciating it&#039;s uniqueness!
@&lt;b&gt;DHouv&lt;/b&gt; - Oh for sure, much cheaper.  Good job beating me too!
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, great movie...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Me too.  Oh well, maybe next time :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, you got close!
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just a matter of time until you do something to one up me ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Haha that&#039;s awesome dude. Well played.
@&lt;b&gt;Suba @ Wealth Informatics&lt;/b&gt; - You ladies and your elephants! :) It would be interesting to see how you could end up with a $0.01 amt to pay w/ c/c too... short of running out of gift card money ofcourse.
@&lt;b&gt;Lop&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  That&#039;s pretty clever.
@&lt;b&gt;Daniel Howard&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m sure it did :)  Although they have to have some sort of REALLY good package deal.
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - Now THAT is awesome!  Reminds me of the time my friend got mad at 7-Eleven once and paid his gas bill with about $25 in pennies :)  He literally dumped this huge jar allllll over the counter and then walked out.  He had balls.
@&lt;b&gt;TusaRebecca&lt;/b&gt; - A nerd who beat my record!!!  Good job :)]]></description>
