HAH! You&#039;re right - way more odds getting in an accident on the road than up in the sky :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yikes! Scary stuff. I used to fly sailplanes (engineless airplanes), and when people would tell me they would never fly in one of those, I used to tell them the most dangerous part of the flight would be the drive there. :)

Driving is dangerous, especially with drunk and distracted drivers. Glad you and the family weren&#039;t hurt!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Crazy story! Just glad no one was hurt in that accident! And glad you weren&#039;t in the car with the kids. Always pretty scary being in the car when it happens. Hopefully it&#039;ll all work out with some fat stacks of cash. Or short stacks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude! Major bummer. I hope it works out for you. About a year and a half ago, I got backed into by some silly girl who I guess mistook reverse for forward (hey, it happens...) :). Ended up getting a tiny little blemish in my bumper, and a free full detail job out of it. Thankfully there was no permanent damage.

I figure she was just checking me out in the rearview and in shock of my amazingly chiseled face.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow what a crazy car accident! Its lucky that you were inside and no one was hurt, but it must have been unsettling. I know it would take me a while to calm down from all of that. I think I would also be paranoid about my car for some time afterward. Usually you feel confident that nothing bad will happen to the car when its at home!]]></description>
