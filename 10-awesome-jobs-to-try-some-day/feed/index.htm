					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not exactly #4, being a garbage man, but you could clean up trash outside commercial properties like I&#039;ve been doing since 1981. It&#039;s almost as easy to do as going for a walk and the money&#039;s great too! You shared my story last year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What fun!

I used to be a hairstylist. It&#039;s very hard on the feet and back, plus too many stinky chemicals, back in the day of perms especially.

This year, I&#039;ve taken a year leave from my job as a university program coordinator to teach school on a Cree reserve in northern Canada. I&#039;m learning a LOT and enjoying teaching more than I expected.

Things I&#039;d try if money &#038; ability weren&#039;t issues:

Florist
Chef
Frugal &#038; Healthy cooking teacher
Science journalist
Travel writer
Restaurant reviewer (skulking around eating gourmet food in disguise -- cool!)
Marriage counselor
Movie director 
Personal trainer / yoga instructor 
Carpenter
Glass blower]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Darwin&#039;s Finance&lt;/b&gt; - I like the way you think.  You could also become a Principal and call your wife into detention!  (what?)
@&lt;b&gt;donkee&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I wonder if it&#039;s physically possible to pull off each of those in one lifetime? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Austin&lt;/b&gt; - Or better yet, a full-time photography blogger!
@&lt;b&gt;Carmie of the Single Nester&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...I&#039;m 6 ft and used to play varsity volleyball in high school, wanna switch?  (but then you&#039;d have to become a man too, not sure if you&#039;d be up for that)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One job I would like to try is Professional Beach Volleyball Player.  But alas, I am not 6 feet tall.  As far as Barnes and Noble employee, I tried that part-time because I love books.  What a mistake.  You might want to scratch this off your list.]]></description>
