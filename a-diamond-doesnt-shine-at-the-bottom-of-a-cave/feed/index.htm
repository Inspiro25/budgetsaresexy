That&#039;s the best position to be in for liquidating coins or antiques - emotionless! It would be much harder for me to sell my collection vs having others do it :)

If you need any help with it though, just give a shout... happy to review any pictures if you want to take any and pass over. I could at least tell you quick if you have anything *worth* spending your time on or not :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s also a pretty coin. All the design iterations over time for all the denominations is very cool. 

Great lessons &#038; cool chance encounter you had!

I ended up with some coins and struggle to make the time to do at least a cursory assessment to be sure I&#039;m not going to get way under value.  Plus getting ones head around just selling vs trying to time the market* vs a past family member put time into collecting them. Yet the coins don&#039;t hold the specific nostalgia or collecting thrill for me. They have transferred some wealth, even if it&#039;s face value to my generation, which was the intent.
* oh right, that&#039;s a lesson I should already know.

I need to re read your article and try to find some time on a rainy weekend this fall to dive back in.]]></description>

Yup! First I always like to hold them though so I can *feel* all the history :) And add to the hundreds (?) of hands who held it before me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great illustration about how to value things.  I hope you normally place your coin collection in inert holders.  Oils from your hands can cause damage  to the coins and effect their value.]]></description>
