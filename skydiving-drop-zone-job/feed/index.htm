I never thought about it either on my one (and only) jump. Better someone to pack it who knows what they&#039;re doing though than yourself! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really interesting. I guess I&#039;d never really thought about someone actually packing the parachute into a bag that someone ultimately pulls. Someone&#039;s gotta do it though, right?

While I&#039;m far too skittish to jump out of a plane, I wonder if people who jump think about the person packing their chute before jumping. I know if I did get the courage to get up there, the moment I thought about that I&#039;d start second guessing myself...Meaning there&#039;s room for human error.

Give yourself some serious credit, though. Even though jumpers have a backup chute, their lives are very much in your hands. That&#039;s got to be a great feeling when everything works out the way it&#039;s supposed to.

Thanks for sharing this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the post - and an interesting concept for making some money on the side! 

The picture at the top of this article was taken in Queenstown, New Zealand (also known as the adventure capital of the world - bungee jumping was invented there!)  

I went skydiving there in November of last year (ironically with the same company that is shown in the picture - NZone) and can&#039;t recommend it highly enough! Many of the instructors have done 10,000+ jumps which is amazing to me. 

Paying to go skydiving may not be one of the most frugal activities, but I did it as part of a once in a lifetime trip around the world, so I felt like it was money well spent.  Now I&#039;m back to diligently saving so I can go back to New Zealand - soon!]]></description>

Even if you don&#039;t like or want to try skydiving, it is still a fun atmosphere and a great way to be involved without being an avid jumper!]]></description>

Yes, I have to say that working at the drop zone got my brain into a different mode than my typical day job did. It was fun to expand my knowledge with the video work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t even know this was a thing! Maybe I should try sky-diving first before I get on a side hustle like this...:P Sounds so exciting, though! Seeing all the excited/nervous jumpers before they go and then come back. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Neat story and interesting choice for a vocation! 

Good to hear you were exposed to different areas of the business. I also have an interest in video so doing video work must have been really fun for you. Great way to exercise our creative sides!

Though I&#039;ve never been skydiving, it&#039;s something I&#039;ve been curious about. 

Thanks for sharing! :)]]></description>

That&#039;s cool that you were an avid jumper! I never got past my second tandem jump, but I still love the atmosphere at drop zones!]]></description>
