Oh, I 100% agree with you. I never buy anything off Amazon or any store that I don&#039;t think I could love or need. It just happens that often times it doesn&#039;t fit or work as marketed, etc since you can&#039;t see and test it in real life. So of course you need really good return policies for online ordering since it has a higher percentage of it not working out than real life orders ¯\_(ツ)_/¯]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I try to be mindful of my purchase first. I make a list of things I want and see if I&#039;m still thinking about it later in the week, or even a few weeks later. Often in that time I find I&#039;ve got one, or a work around. (Safety first, I&#039;m not cobbling together extension cords.)  Front end mindfulness to complement your end of use (to you) plans.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a real problem with this attitude: &quot;Just like all families in the country, Amazon is at our door daily. But unlike other families in the country, whenever we buy something we don’t end up liking or needing, we return it RIGHT AWAY!!&quot; Having Amazon at the door daily is certainly NOT the case for my family or most people that I know, and hopefully not the case for the target readership of your blog.

I think your general approach is a great idea for thrift store purchases or collections, but I strongly encourage you to spend more time UPFRONT determining if the Amazon purchase are something you need or like in the first place, rather than ordering just in case it works out simply because it&#039;s so easy to return. I&#039;ve read a number of articles about how so many of the returns are just trashed as it&#039;s too costly to deal with them.  And I&#039;m sure this is especially true for all the cases where the customer has no incentive to take care with the item to make sure it goes back in pristine condition carefully packaged.]]></description>

I mean, you&#039;re right about donating.  I painted a grim picture but in reality with 4 kids ripping through stuff at a blinding pace, we schedule at least 4-6 large donations to purple heart annually.  Really was just trying to make a point about valuing your own time.]]></description>
