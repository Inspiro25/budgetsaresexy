					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the mention, bud! I love how everyone here is pretty much on board with giving back in some way, it makes me so happy to see. (And sad when people think that giving is not at all important.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a set amount per month, and charities selected for a reason, for most months. Or for when I know a friend does a particular race / event. Plus a few unassigned for last minute requests. This allows me to not feel &#039;guilty&#039; when randomly asked. I&#039;ve had a chance to check Charity Navigtor to inform my decision etc.
Your post did prompt me because I hadn&#039;t yet done my January donation which is related to my uncle who passed away, whose birthday was in Jan. All done now!
I have a friend who usually does one of those mud runs in June and someone else does a charity bike race in August.]]></description>

Yep - we never truly know what a persons&#039; gone through or is currently going through :) Just gotta do our best to override our thoughts and give as best as we can! And it&#039;s perfectly normal btw to FAIL at our giving too, as I certainly have over the years even WITH these tricks! Just gotta keep practicing!]]></description>

Excellent!!

That makes me so happy to hear!! 

Will you please let me know how they go over time if you end up trying them? :)

I bet you come up with even more tricks of your own once you get going too.... It all makes you much more *aware* of the opportunities out there...

I&#039;m excited for you!]]></description>

Very cool on the matching :)

Unfortunate that it&#039;s *only* through 501c3s as so many people in our COMMUNITY needs the $$$/support, but I get why they do it that way...]]></description>

Good for you!! Yes - ANYTHING is better than nothing in all cases, haha... We all have these little things that get in our way though :) My wife refuses to give to people on the streets as she&#039;s never sure what they&#039;re actually going to do with it so ends up not giving anyone anything. (Also for security reasons too as a woman, but mainly the &quot;end result&quot; thing). I keep telling her that in either case they still need it more than we do, but not sure how much that&#039;s helping :)]]></description>
