					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently getting paid to work out.  I took a seasonal job as a UPS delivery driver.  I work 12 hour days and my fitbit tells me I&#039;m walking 8-10 hours per day.  It is 3 steps into and out of the truck for every delivery and there is the lifting / carrying as well.  Since December 1st I&#039;ve gone from 204 to 188 pounds and made $5000.  

Body by UPS!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This idea usually appeals more to the teens, but still: offer to walk / jog with people&#039;s dogs for a modest fee. Here&#039;s why you should consider it, even as an adult:
1. there&#039;s definitely a need for the service, because I, for one, have paid someone to take my dog on good long walks before. As someone who works at times over 60 hours a week, I don&#039;t always have time. And even when I do, I&#039;d still dish out $10 for an extra run/walk to keep my canine best friend happy. I know many others who would do the same.
2. Dogs are great exercise companions - they never complain.
3. You can do it together with your kids.
4. Regularly Walking / Jogging / Running Definitely helps lose weight.]]></description>

Pact is awesome. I get between $1.60-$2 a week. It has forced me to go on a walk for my lunch breaks because if I don&#039;t they&#039;ll charge me $5 a missed day :P Much easier to get motivated to workout when you know that you&#039;ll be charged not to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may not earn money by exercising but you are in fact saving money by doing so.  The additional health benefits from working out and making your health better are saving you from having to visit the doctor with the added health issues of being overweight.  Instead of finding a way to take money from an insurance company, think about saving the dollars before they leave your pocket by not having to pay deductibles and co-pays :).  For each dollar you DON&#039;T spend, you&#039;re effectively making that + whatever tax (state income, federal income, etc) you&#039;d be paying on each of those dolla dolla bills you earned, making it even better than earning more!]]></description>
