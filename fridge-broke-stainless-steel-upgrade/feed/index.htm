					<description><![CDATA[Haha... a great way to think about it, I guess :) As long as you have the money set aside just waiting for it to be used!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the new fridge!  We will hopefully be moving into our new house within the next 3 weeks and I am actually a tiny bit worried about the fridge I bought actually fitting (also a stainless steel beauty that will be hard to clean, lol).  Based on the measurements, we should be good to go, but the actual empty space in the new kitchen looks smaller than I think it should be, lol.  I will be measuring again this week.  Anyway, congrats!!!  Looks great!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never get tired of looking at it :)

@&lt;b&gt;Gillian @ Money After Graduation&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;ll def. be trying all different kinds and will hope the more natural ones do the trick, but if not I&#039;m sticking to the one that works.
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that sounds miserable... I think in those cases you do have to chalk it ups as just a crap deal and move on before you get too frustrated :( You have a great head on your shoulders!
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Well that sounds pretty! I think anyone who can make white look good (and natural) in their home is awesome.  Farmhouse sinks are dope too!
@&lt;b&gt;Sean @ One Smart Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - We&#039;ll see which one ends up working... I have a feeling I&#039;ll be trying a lot of them.
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - That doesn&#039;t piss me off! Haha.. I love it :) And have even bought some of those discounted &quot;floor items&quot; at Home Depot myself! If I recall correctly we got our stainless steel stove for like $400 off - it was awesome.  We just got stuck in some bad timing this go around, but it&#039;s all good.
@&lt;b&gt;Pam&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! Thank you. I will look into :)
@&lt;b&gt;WorkSaveLive&lt;/b&gt; - Windex?? Haha... okay, worth a shot I suppose?
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - LUCKY BASTARD!!!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha oh yeah... right now those veggie sections just hold beer bottles at the moment ;) So looks like we&#039;ll all get healthier as the kid grows up!
@&lt;b&gt;KT&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome, way to go! I don&#039;t have the patience or desire to do it myself cuz we wanted a more updated one anyways for when we sell/rent out the place... great you were able to rock it yourself though! Sorry to hear about your g-pa too, I miss mine as well :(
@&lt;b&gt;anna&lt;/b&gt; - Really? That&#039;s awesome! I&#039;ll try that one out too then :)
@&lt;b&gt;daydream kate&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  Floor models are def. the way to go - we just didn&#039;t have that option in this particular case :(
@&lt;b&gt;Andi&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool! Okay, well maybe that part will be easier then? And roger that on ventilation/etc - it did cross my mind but only momentarily... I&#039;ve been paying attention to heat though and so far so good, but appreciate the reminder to stick with it.  We def. don&#039;t need anything messing up our entire kitchen and/or house! Scary...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So...two things. One is since you squeezed that fridge in, you&#039;re going to want to check on it every once in a while to make sure it&#039;s not getting too toasty and can vent well. Our delivery guy wouldn&#039;t even install ours unless we had an inch or two on each side. And based on your pictures, your cabinets are &quot;American Standard&quot; cabinets which was one of the most prolific construction grade cabinets in the 90s. While yes they are not pretty to look at, the boxes are usually all standard measurements. You can always measure out the cabinet doors and drawers and set up a craigslist search. I&#039;ve seen people sell gorgeous modern ikea cabinet doors for 30% of original price.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@JMoney: Now that you mention it, we did get a pretty good deal. Granted, we needed a smaller model because of a really small space, but we didn&#039;t have to drop a ton of cash. We ended up getting a floor model for $400. And we didn&#039;t pay for hauling because we have a truck, so we just moved everything ourselves. So not as bad as I remember!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few short weeks ago my fridge freezer also died. I came home from my grandpas funeral to discover my frozen food defrosted and my fridge not as cold as it should be. 

But I did something different. I didn&#039;t rush out to get a new one. I got my tools together, and googled the possible problems and over 2 days I fixed it. 

I might not have a shiny new one but it is working like new again. And in the end it only cost me things I happened to have in my home anyway. Much better for my budget especially as I was pre-self-employed at the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugh, the search (and the cost!) are exactly why I&#039;ve been neglecting getting a new fridge.  Since it&#039;s just me, I picked up a mini-fridge with a small freezer on top to tide me over until I move or finally spend the time searching for a new fridge.

Congrats on the new fridge!  It&#039;s a good looking one and you&#039;ll need it once the kid starts growing up and loving fruits and veggies!]]></description>
