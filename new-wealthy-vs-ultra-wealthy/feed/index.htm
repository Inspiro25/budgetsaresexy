					<description><![CDATA[Such an interesting observation.  I am now thinking of mt salt covered car sitting out in the lot.  To be fair, I did get it washed last Wednesday but the roads this time of year make it impossible to keep clean.  I do though try to get it detailed every year of two to keep it looking nice and get out any ground in dirt and salt from the floor carpeting.  

Now I am wondering if I keep it cleaner, will I be wealthier?  ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is terrifying! The back seat of my car is a MESS, but my kid who snacks there a lot and brings all sorts of trinkets with her everywhere, is to blame for it. Do I get half of a pass??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having a new car makes you more likely to clean it and keep it that way, I think. I bought a used car about a year ago and while it wasn&#039;t new off the lot, it was new to me and I&#039;ve made it a daily chore to take everything out with me when I exit. I no longer throw receipts, etc on the car floor and expect I&#039;ll clean it up every month or so. 

That may be one reason why wealthier people have clean cars. They want to keep their cars clean, and keep their wealth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friends have a mixture of old and new/expensive cars.

Almost universally, the ones with young children will have messy cars.

Perhaps in your case, the ultra wealthy are likely to have (if they have any) grown up adult children so no mess there.

The new wealthy perhaps either don&#039;t have young children or the children aren&#039;t allowed in their Ferraris/Porsches?

My car is spotless (no children), yet I work best with a cluttered desk (which gets cleared up by the end of the day due to company&#039;s clear desk policy!).]]></description>

I went from a high school of blue collar but smart/motivated kids (&#038; parents), to a university of mostly old money and new money (plus us scholarship kids, who mostly didn&#039;t fit in).  

It was fascinating how often, in college, people would say scathing that someone was &quot;nouveau riche,&quot; while people strove to be more Old Money (without actually being that shabby).  Nouveau riche (new rich) was the flashy insecure kind of rich, like rappers and dentists, whereas Old Money could afford nice things, but didn&#039;t stress about having shiny new clothes, cars, electronics, etc.   

It was actually really helpful to me, as a poor kid among the wealthy to ultra wealthy, to realize that I didn&#039;t have to try for conspicuous wealth - I could focus on actual finances, and be discreet with any wealth I gathered.]]></description>

That&#039;s pretty clever, actually.

My trick is to have a dog sling in the back seat (protects the seats, protects them from falling if I hit the brakes too fast), and I put cups/cans/trash on the back floor, where it&#039;s hidden.  Mwahaha :)]]></description>

I believe that broken window theory - as engaging as it is in theory - has been thoroughly debunked, as its enactment coincided with overall crime reduction already in play, and mainly involved criminalizing and harassing marginalized people of color, poverty, disability, and mental health.  Not one of our brighter moments, societally.  http://socialistworker.org/2013/10/10/broken-windows-is-a-broken-idea]]></description>
