					<description><![CDATA[Very nice!  It&#039;s fun when the net worth chart starts to look a bit more vertical.  Mine&#039;s doing the same mostly due to stocks.  Do you think the market will keep going up for a bit, or do you think it&#039;s going to peak soon?]]></description>

It does account for it because I don&#039;t have to pay any more taxes based on my business income this year compared to last (I&#039;m down about 50%). So since I&#039;ve been paying every quarter as if all was the same as last year (aka double what I should have been!), I&#039;ve already in effect paid taxes on this money ;) So it is included, but not - if that makes sense? Not sure what type of income it goes down as (I&#039;d guess capital gains?) but I do know I&#039;m done paying taxes for the rest of the year. Which is the only good thing about losing business income, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question for ya: Does the $50,000 gain account for the taxes that you will have to pay for having sold your business assets? (And does your accountant think these will be business assets, so ordinary income, or actually capital gains?)  I&#039;m always curious to know how people account for such things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the progress.  I know I was shocked once I started keeping track of everything in Mint.  It has really helped me keep my spending in line because I can see it creeping up all month long and can really nip excess spending in the butt.  Nothing like seeing the hard numbers each and every day to help keep me in check.]]></description>
