					<description><![CDATA[I believe in paying off any and all debt before venturing into investing. If someone struggles with debt, how could they possibly believe they would be ready to invest? Then of course there are the ones that believe in leveraging debt to invest but I believe only a select few can benefit from that rabbit hole.

Pay off debt!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here we go again.  Average rate of return of 8%.  I love how those in the finance industry pick numbers like that and make you think it&#039;s conservative yet never tell you that that rate of return can be 0% depending on what you invest in.  You better pray that the mutual fund you pick is a good one because there are hundreds of bad ones out there.  Picking mutual funds these days is as bad as picking stocks IMHO.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The answer to the dilemma is simple: Determine which option is more profitable for you. To do that, you have to figure out your after-tax return for each choice.&quot;

Agree completely; people have the erroneous idea that there&#039;s a concept such as Good Debt and Bad Debt. That&#039;s all well and good when deciding whether or not to take on the debt.

But, once you&#039;re in debt, there&#039;s only Cheap Debt and Expensive Debt: cheap debt helps you fund other investments (kind of a proxy investment loan) ... and, expensive debt is, well, expensive and should be paid off asap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, personality def. comes into play.  Although I&#039;ll admit I happen to saver from &quot;don&#039;t mind  having debt as long as I&#039;m saving lots of money!&quot; to &quot;I hate debt!  Want zero of it even if that means zero emergency fund!&quot; haha...  I think going with what feels right for you at any given point in time is the way to go.

					<description><![CDATA[To me it would all depend on the how much you owed as well as the type of debt.  All of my current debt are student loans - for me, the best return on investment is to pay those off as soon as possible.  Every situation is different and personality of the person will come into play as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that the best choice for you depends on your tolerance for risk and your long-term financial goals. But if debt really is a &quot;problem&quot; for you, I would think changing your behavior is &quot;of value&quot; too.  So if I had a problem with debt - especially credit card debt - I would focus on paying down debt at first.  I wouldn&#039;t worry about the math.  

And even with tax-deductible debt, once you factor in risk and tax treatment of gains, you may find that - for the short period of time it will take to pay down your debt if you&#039;re really focused - the potential gain is not worth the risk.  Finally, there is some value to being debt free.  It simplifies things.

But I don&#039;t mind the &quot;do both&quot; suggestion.  In the end it&#039;s &quot;personal&quot; finance.  So do what works for you.  But I doubt you could &quot;save&quot; or &quot;invest&quot; your way out of debt if you have debt problems (maxed out HELOC, credit cards, car loans, etc.).  I think that&#039; a behavior problem and the &quot;interest rates&quot; are not the issue.  I would stop trying to do the math and focus on changing my thinking.]]></description>
