					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/calculating-net-worth-does-home-value/#comment-238796&quot;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;.

That&#039;s a pretty good way of doing things, actually! I wasn&#039;t even including selling % in our net worth... 

We&#039;ve since sold our house since this posting and very much enjoy renting (freedom!!!!), however for the past 7+ years of owning it we found using our realtor&#039;s calculation was the most accurate. And when we actually did sell it we were spot on with the purchase price! Maybe you can befriend a realtor to help out once a year? We didn&#039;t update it much outside of that...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do the same as Tom.  But how do you easily get a value for the home?  I have been using Zillow and subtracting 20%. Then I subtract an additional 10% for selling expenses.  Looking at actual sales in last 3 months, and calculating a price per square foot I get a larger value. Even using the lowest number from a foreclosed fixer upper.  The house is a large part of my retirement plan. Therefore, I am trying to keep the numbers realistic.   The current difference between the lower estimated value and mortgage+ selling expense s $130 k in my favor.  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ooh I like that! I agree that the house probably needs to go in the calculations, esp. since you need something to offset the mortgages too which need to go in there, but hadn&#039;t thought about including more into the house&#039;s value like you&#039;re doing. That&#039;s a good way to think of it, thanks man!

It sucks all the other comments here got wiped away when I moved blogging platforms a cple years ago, but maybe you&#039;ll start a new discussion here for anyone who reads in the future :) So thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - I definitely think a house value (realistic sale price- minus remaining mortgage) should be part of Net Worth. Net Worth to me implies all assets minus liabilities ... and should not factor in liquidity.  That could be a subset of the Net Worth.. your liquid or semi-liquid net worth ... and not include house.

  But to calculate my House Value ... I also factor in the cost of selling ... 6% to real estate agents, etc.  and to be very conservative ... I factor in 10% selling costs (real estate agent; some pre-sale fix up; lawyer fees; moving, etc.)  

Using an easy example.  Let&#039;s say you own a house that would sell for $500,000.  Your remaining mortgage on it is $250,000.  I would take the $500,000 - subtract 10% selling cost or $50,000 ... leaving $450,000 .. then subtract remaining mortgage of $250,000 which gives you $200,000 net house value to add to your net worth.

If your house goes up in value 10% over the years to $550,000 in this scenario, then the 10% selling goes to $55,000 .... minus the remaining mortgage of $250,000 ... you would have $245,000 net house value to add to your net worth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally, I believe including your home depends very much on if you anticipate selling it in the future and down sizing or some other &quot;change during retirement&quot; plan. If someone intends on dying in the house they are currently in, they should not include the home in their net worth.]]></description>
