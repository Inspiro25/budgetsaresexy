					<description><![CDATA[Be careful using the car buying certificates. If you use them at another dealer USAA will not honor the advertised APR! The certificate they sent me said take to any dealer, I did and bought a new car and then USAA says it does not count for the interest rate reduction. 

Feels like a bait and switch, not expected from my primary bank. Time for a change!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you both! I look forward to the new, easier, and more secure way of doing things.

Have I mentioned how excited I am to be soooo close to my first USAA branch? I&#039;ve actually seen ATMs and Financial Centers near FT. Hood where I&#039;ll be stationed.  I hope I don&#039;t bother them too much...nothing like being able to FINALLY shake a hand of the greatest customer service team...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been a member of USAA since the late 90&#039;s, and I will NEVER have another primary bank account. I am due to PCS to FT Hood in September 2012, and am thinking it&#039;s time to dissolve all secondary accounts (due to no USAA branch when opened). My wife has an account with a credit union she has been a member of, almost since the day of her birth, so we will probably keep that one; however, that is purely out of HER loyalty. 

I have a recommendation/request for a feature upgrade. The military is now using CAC (Common Access Card) readers for CAC (ID) cards to access secure information (personal), and for easy access to DFAS mypay, AKO/DKO, Army publications, etc. These devices with the CAC card can also be used to digitally sign documents.

My recommendation/request is that USAA also use this technology for their active duty members to be able to securely access their USAA account(s). I bought a personal CAC reader for $25, and am able to access all things CAC related from the comfort of my own home. I think this would be a huge security/identity protection asset. 

Any thoughts from USAA officials?

v/r,

Jim]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am looking for a young lady who went to school in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1959-1960.  Her
name was Kitty Bush and she lived down the street from me.  Her parents and mine were good frieds and kept in touch for a long time, but lost track somewhere along the way. My parents are deceased now and so are hers and I don&#039;t have and address for her.  If anyone reads this knows Kitty, please  contact me and put me in touch with her as there are alot
of people who would like to see her again.
                                                                          Thank You,
                                                                              Rita Cook]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friends think I secretly work for USAA with the amount of raving I do about them.  All the way out here in Chicago we don&#039;t have any physical branches but there have only been a few instances where that has been an issue.  So my husband and I opened a savings account at a local bank and a safety deposit box, this also allows us to do something with the insane amount of coins we collect....

On our last family vacation my husband (quasi jokingly) asked if I wanted to drive through San Antonio on our way just so I could drop in and say hi.  I&#039;m not sure what he would have done if I said &#039;OH YES PLEASE.&#039;]]></description>
