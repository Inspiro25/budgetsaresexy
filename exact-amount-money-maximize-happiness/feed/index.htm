					<description><![CDATA[What resonated most with me about your quote from MilesDividendMD was:

&quot;So if a purchase is not worth the freedom that it will cost, that’s when I’m apt to choose to say &#039;no&#039;.”

It&#039;s so powerful to think of it that way. Money is not money. For most of us who still work for a paycheque, it&#039;s time and effort. Unfortunately, because one is mentally removed from the other, we don&#039;t think of it that way...and credit cards are even more removed from the active effort required to achieve purchasing power.

I like the Ultimate Cheapskate&#039;s idea about keeping an hourly cost conversion in your wallet. What each price level would cost in hours of work (a net, all-in hourly rate). 

Buying that pair of shoes will cost me 5 hours of effort. Is it worth it? Better yet, what if I put the monetary equivalent of those 10 hours in long term savings instead and saved myself more of that life energy in the future? That pair of shoes just got even more expensive.

That mohawk of yours just got more attractive, didn&#039;t it...]]></description>

Yeah Econ! I&#039;d have paid a lot more attention in those classes growing up if I knew what I knew now :) Back then I just wanted to get through it and be done, haha... So enjoy and soak it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think about this all the time! Literally in economics classes they teach that companies try to maximize profit and people maximize happiness. The problem is that most people are not very good at optimizing their money. Nice examples of how you&#039;ve used this principal in your life.]]></description>

That&#039;s a great example, man. Though you know I still have to give you a hard time on the car and price tag :) It&#039;s a good thing you rarely spend any money on yourself!]]></description>

There you go!! I&#039;m all about the &quot;cycle of fun&quot; as I call it. If you can find ways to make money to fund your splurgy habits, go for it! I do the same thing with coin collecting - I mainly only use money I&#039;ve earned from selling previous coins or other things around the house. So basically getting rid of the stuff you don&#039;t care about, and using the money to fill up the stuff you DO. No shame in that!]]></description>

Oh, for sure. Even once you have everything you need you can do so much GOOD in the world with tons more money! Even if you just donated it all or set up foundations/etc... The trick is just knowing that you have all you need and can be content :)]]></description>
