Well babies eventually grow up into small rambunctious kids, haha... 

But sorry you didn&#039;t enjoy the post. A con to always being transparent with your thoughts and emotions means you&#039;re bound to upset people sometimes... I just do my best to help more often than I do hurt :)]]></description>

I love your blog, but this post is really bothering me. Seems you&#039;re a bit emotionally wrapped up in this rather than being objective, which is what I normally appreciate about your posts.

First, as someone previously pointed out, you complain about the landlord lying and admit that you did the same thing. Second, you said, &quot;I love me some small living, but with babies I just can’t do it haha&quot; and now are saying,&quot;It’s not even like a baby takes up that much space?? (Or does damage?) It just sits there wiggling and crying haha&quot;.]]></description>

Yes, that&#039;s what I was going to suggest.  When the old landlord told you that you could stay, you should have called the bluff by asking for a short-term lease that would have lasted until the end of the school year.  It&#039;s playing with fire to move into a place where you know they are selling, and once you go off lease, you are fair game.  But because they were so nice and sweet, your guard was down.   That&#039;s why people become cynical--because of a-holes like that. And that&#039;s why in business (and a landlord/tenant relationship is a business relationship), you have to back up &quot;promises&quot; with documentation. Unfortunately, I&#039;ve learned from being in the military:  if it&#039;s not in writing, it doesn&#039;t exist!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It sucks on your end but the lease was month to month and it just business.   If I had been the Landlord with good tenants in this situation,  I would have waved last month&#039;s rent or paid within reason for the movers.    Probably was a large difference in potential selling price point for Spring versus later.   Plus,  no one knows what is going on in the Landlord&#039;s life.  They made need to make hard decisions like this to get the most money they can for something sudden in their life.     I just try to presume the best in people.

On a different note,   sound like even though it was not a situation your family wanted the new rental is a better layout for all including the cat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a quick comment. A similar thing happened to me in the apartment I was renting from a close medical school friend-turned really nasty and ended the relationship. (I was in the middle of a difficult fellowship when they decided to sell the apartment-giving me almost no time to find another place in nyc). The sum result is my new apartment was infinitely better, I removed myself from a situation that caused me constant stress in my living space and ultimately, I’m pretty sure that while I might like to have inflicted pain similar to what they put me through, karma does come around...just not on our time frame! 

As for your particular situation, I fail to understand why they couldn’t have negotiated a move out for you that would have accommodated the children’s school with the buyer-e.g. a purchase that worked in a June move out for you. C’est la vie. The greed of real estate often clouds good intentions. Good luck on baby dime! And enjoy the extra space!!]]></description>

Definitely! Keeping him in to close out the year, and won&#039;t be xfering to the new school until the following school year. I agree not worth the chaos, especially with just a few months left. Thanks for popping in :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m late to the comments so someone may have already said this....

You most likely can keep your son in his current school until the end of the school year.  I was able to do this one year and know others who have also done it.  Would mean less change for your son right now with so many other changes happening.

There are pros to switching to the new school right now also - he&#039;ll meet kids that he can play with over the summer, any anxiety over changing schools will be for a short period rather than months &#038; months, you&#039;ll be able to start the walks to school right away.

So glad the new place has more of what you want and need.

Can&#039;t believe the landlords didn&#039;t put the house on the market but with a longer closing period to honor their commitment to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[International school teaching is kinda similar for me and my colleagues who live and work around the world ... by the very nature of being an international school teacher ... most of us live in rentals and I did too for the early years ... we were constantly living in rentals and kept our items down to several pieces of luggage .... when my coworkers move on ... they sell or give away all their junk from Ikea or what have you ... and it is yes common for the landlords to kick folks here seeing overseas the rules are more lax? :) ... lots of fun ... would be good to hear from folks like  …. myself who have a homebase overseas … I am F.I. but still do international school teaching … which is busy, but have 3 months of holiday to explore the world …. my friends and co-workers are from or have moved and worked … all over the world.
