					<description><![CDATA[@Ace - I don&#039;t think it is as difficult to see in ourselves as we think, it&#039;s just that so many people are in denial when it comes to their own financial motivations. Being in denial means that you can still justify your purchases. ;) haha!

Thanks for the great comment, I am glad you enjoyed this post. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really great topic.  What makes it so difficult is that it&#039;s so easy for us to identify when this happens to other people.  We can see people&#039;s vain attempt to buy happiness, for example the stories of lottery winners losing all their money and getting into debt.  What is difficult for us to see is how we do this ourselves.  The best thing is to become aware of your tendencies and try to catch them before they happen.

Great post Brad!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@EVERYONE - I am so sorry I am just now getting to respond here. I was really looking forward to seeing your response. I have been out all day helping my in-laws remodel their new house they will be moving into next month. LOTS of painting!

@Everyday Tips - Well said. It&#039;s all about mindset. There is a direct correlation between your mindset and how you act based on how you think. It really is everything and unfortunately people make the mistake of thinking money will solve problems. The real problem solver is ourselves and we can use money as a tool to make it easier. 

@Ariella Brown - That is definitely a great illustration, thank you for sharing it! :D

@Stephan - Damn right man, otherwise you will lose your frickin mind. LOL People have got the mindset that fun is owed to them before security so they obsess about having fun all the while their financial situation is getting worse. People have to know when to sacrifice fun so that happiness can manifest itself in the form of security later in life. It&#039;s NOT fun scraping together pennies at retirement to pay for your light bill. :) Great comment!

@Rex Huston - You&#039;re very right Rex! Happiness can become a result of spending money but I think you nailed it when you said &quot;taking some days off to spend with your family can.&quot; 

My thoughts exactly!  ;)

@Money Smarts - You are so right. If you are miserable, it&#039;s not money that will make you happy, it&#039;s what you value and how you embrace what&#039;s important to you. :)

@finallygettingtoeven.com - Exactly, the hole will continue to exist until you address what&#039;s really making you unhappy! Rich or poor, your happiness comes from a place that money can&#039;t buy.

@Derek Sisterhen - Amen Derek! I like the way you think. If you are content with what you have and have made sure there is balance in your life, then everything that comes beyond that is not only more enjoyable, but it is certainly more special. Something I need to use that thinking with is eating out. I enjoy eating out, but I bet I would enjoy it a whole lot more if I didn&#039;t do it quite so much. haha! The novelty of what we do always makes it more enjoyable in the end.

Excellent comment Derek...your radio show rocks man! Keep up the terrific work you are doing!

@Favor - That&#039;s a great way to view the world! My father-in-law always tells me to Christ is happiness and I have to agree completely. :)

@Yana - Believe me I understand completely how you feel about the new home issue. We are currently selling our house so that we can rent. Our idea is that for the next 5 years we will save, save, save, and when the time is right we will buy our house without the burden that is debt. Another thing I like about renting instead is that there is also a lot less responsibility. It&#039;s a lot less stressful to call the landlord than it is to fork over the dough to fix your plumbing nightmare.

On the other hand, now probably is one of the best times to buy a house if you&#039;re in the market for one. If I were buying right now, and was going to have to get a mortgage, I would totally get a 15-year fixed rate. That would help me sleep better at night for sure. :D

TAHNK YOU EVERYONE for the great comments, and again I am so very sorry it took me all day to respond. Have a great weekend, I am so glad you enjoyed this post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Money is not love, and it can&#039;t buy happiness.  Having said that, life is much better when you have enough money.

One thing I&#039;ve noticed about myself is that I am possibly too thankful.  As a result of being happy with what I have, I am not ambitious at all.  The most current example is that we are looking at homes, after having rented for many years - and it is my husband that is pushing for this.  Only because he wants it have I considered that it could be a good thing to do; after all, our place is getting old and has already had problems with termites.  His problem is that he doesn&#039;t like neighbors or not having a garage.  I see advantages, but I also see what we have - a very cost-effective way to live.  I love not spending much money!  And I appreciate all the good things right where we are.

As far as happiness, I&#039;ve never been happier, but I am stressed about the house thing.  I wish we&#039;d just find the one and have enough money to buy it, so I could get back to everyday comfortable living.  I&#039;ve always been appreciative of every little thing, but the happiness factor for me is about having a peaceful home and not having to be around people who are troublemakers.  When I parted ways with people (by nature, not intention) who lived to make others miserable, I got so happy from the relief that it almost seems like a disorder.  LOL.  But I don&#039;t want the cure!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i think that you can buy happiness but something that you cannot buy is joy. By definition happiness is what you feel when good things are happening to you. When you have fun, you are happy. so the only thing that you have to do is spend some cash and be happy. Joy is something that God gives]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thankfully, I don&#039;t chase happiness with money. Basically because my life is rooted in Christ. 

But I do like to have fun. And travel. And just relax outside. I agree with most of Derek&#039;s last paragraph, I treat things like that as a blessing :)]]></description>
