Hey, don&#039;t gotta tell me twice! If you&#039;re hustlin&#039; all night, then sleeping in is usually around the corner - at least for me. Though I like to go on 3-day binges and then sleep for like a week, haha... which is also prob. not good for you ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ps I also wanted to say that getting up early doesnt make you healthy-It is one of the major causes for type 2 diabetes and most heart attacks happen early in the morning.Lots of sleep makes us less stressed,helps our immune system and stops us from need facelifts (thats why its called beauty sleep).I need my ten hours to feel in top form and to make sensible  decesions about money and life. Enjoy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think getting up early is relative to your business. For example some people get up early because their clients live in a different time zone. I usually get up at the crack of noon. A well rested brain thinks clearly.Enjoy!]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you mentioned this. We should not delude ourselves into thinking copying some wealthy folk&#039;s single habits will magically make us wealthy.  Getting up early and counting our calories will make us healthy, not rich. You have to turn those habits into something that will generate a lot more income.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No wonder I&#039;m not rich.  I&#039;m not doin well in most of them.
1. I like to go to bed late and wake up late. FAIL
2. I do keep list of tasks to do so I won&#039;t forget, but I don&#039;t think the quality of my tasks are that good.  FAIL/WIN
3.At work, I don&#039;t take long lunches although I&#039;d like to.  FAIL/WIN
4. I never count calories.  Don&#039;t even know how.  FAIL
5. I don&#039;t gossip at work, but I do join in on occasional gossip in my personal life.  FAIL/WIN
6. Although I don&#039;t post things much on facebook or other social networking sites, I do continuously check on them.  My fingers just move on my smart phone.]]></description>
