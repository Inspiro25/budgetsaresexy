					<description><![CDATA[We were starting to get worried about our youngest son because he couldn&#039;t sit up without help at 10 months of age, let alone stand.  If he wasn&#039;t propped up, he would just roll off to the side LOL  Then, overnight, he literally sat up, stood up and walked.  No kidding.  Your son is adorable :)]]></description>

Oh wow - what a great experience for a kid though! It&#039;s great to be exposed to so many different cultures :) I&#039;ve been fortunate enough to live a similar life growing up in a military household and wouldn&#039;t change it for anything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember a friend telling me, she knows someone whose baby didn&#039;t talk properly until he was 4 or 5. The parents got him checked but the doctor didn&#039;t find anything wrong. They got in touch with a speech specialist and found out that one cause might be that they moved a lot. The baby was born in Japan and they stayed there for another year after that and then moved to the Philippines and stayed for another year. And then moved to Singapore and stayed for 2 years or so. Plus the language they use around the baby was never consistent so the parents made the necessary changes and in less than a year the little boy&#039;s speech improved a lot. So I guess they&#039;re right, children&#039;s milestones are not tied up to a certain age.]]></description>

From what I hear they do. They help teach you ways to help them communicate better and &quot;tricks&quot; of the trade. Which can only really help. Perhaps the problem is we suck at trying to teach him? We are 1st time parents so it&#039;s very possible ;) Hope to see you this week!]]></description>

YES!! Can&#039;t wait to show him what *real* responsibilities are ;) And that money doesn&#039;t grow on trees! Haha... I have a feeling I&#039;ll be turning into MY parents any day now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/baby-costs-update-15-months-20000-later/#comment-127348&quot;&gt;too funny&lt;/a&gt;.

Maybe I&#039;m confused? Or you read a diff. article and I don&#039;t remember what I said in that one? Haha.. All I know is that our baby is currently in full-time day care - which is doing a decent job - and the reasoning for it is because I need to work full-time and my wife needs to work on her dissertation full-time :) The only complaint I have is dishing out $1,000 a month, but it&#039;s a necessary evil so I&#039;m sucking it up and just bitching a little on it here on the blog.

And now I&#039;m going to go grab a beer to un-confuse myself, haha... we never did get one when I was living out there! Glad you and the wife/kid is doing well :)]]></description>
