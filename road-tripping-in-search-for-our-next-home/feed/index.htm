					<description><![CDATA[Next time your rent a car, check out USAA - they offer rental car discounts (and other discounts)!  Going through USAA has been cheaper than other deals I&#039;ve found online every time I&#039;ve rented a car (or every time except one, I forget).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well guys, we&#039;re back! And it was SOOOOO Fun!!! I&#039;m about to write up a post all about it to hit the stands tomorrow, but wanted to hit some of y&#039;all back first before doing so. Thanks for sharing all your tips and thoughts with us! Who knew NC had such a huge fan base! Freaking awesome :)

Want to take a guess at which city I preferred over the wife, and vice versa? We both fell in love with one but not the other, haha... d&#039;oh.

@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - No, but that&#039;s a great idea though! I should totally sign up to their emails, thanks :) And I was born in Florida! But havne&#039;t lived there in yearrrrrs... Wouldn&#039;t mind being back though.
@&lt;b&gt;Ginna&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that would be fun! I&#039;d certainly NEED a pf community wherever I&#039;m going cuz my wife is tired about hearing of it ;) Thanks for the willingness to help out! I may take you up on it later.
@&lt;b&gt;Brad Chaffee&lt;/b&gt; - I WANT TO LIVE IN CHARLOTTESVILLE!! But the wife says no :( Booooo....
@&lt;b&gt;Emily @ evolvingPF&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! It seems like Dirty D has a TON of hardcore fans! Always good to hear when considering places to move to :) And YES - you should totally get all the PF Bloggers around again there - that&#039;s so fun!
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - I think Panama City would most DEF be on my list of places in Florida too - I heard it&#039;s crazy fun there! If you like the bar scene, at least ;)
@&lt;b&gt;slug &#124; sunkcostsareirrelevant.com&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it was hard to know where to go and not go while there, but we&#039;ll be back again I&#039;m sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lyn @ Pretty Frugal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, right? I guess they just have good feelings or something :)
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - I could live there in a heart beat if it weren&#039;t so far away :(
@&lt;b&gt;Christopher @ This that and the MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;ve only lived in Manhatten before, but I both loved it and hated it ;) The pros and cons there are to the extreme! (And yup - 1st major road trip w/ baby and he did so good!! I shouldn&#039;t be surprised, but I am :))
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah! Believe me, it&#039;s on the list too ;) I&#039;ve already lived overseas and it REALLY helped put things in perspective. Plus, it&#039;s really fun as a kid too. Only thing holding us back all the way is the distance away from friends and family, but if we only left for a year or two? Wouldn&#039;t be that bad.
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah! That&#039;ll be an adventure all on it&#039;s own, being a landlord :) If we end up loving it, maybe we&#039;ll get into a new venture there!
@&lt;b&gt;Becky&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!! We didn&#039;t have enough time to explore too in depth, but I&#039;m digging the sounds of that Satellite Bar and Xmas light display! Both are right up our alley :)
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - I def. see that now :) Though it still reminded me of Charleston to some degree.
@&lt;b&gt;Atlantalee&lt;/b&gt; - That sounds good! We were there last year and it was fun :) I&#039;ll run it by the wife!
@&lt;b&gt;daveM&lt;/b&gt; - Now THAT is a good idea, man... How easy would that be?
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! You are the opposite of me with living, that&#039;s awesome :) And so random, eh? Thanks for all the info! I was reading it out loud to people this weekend ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt;- I did not :( I had to pass up like 5 antique stores too cuz we were low on time! Haha... I made sure to put up stink about it too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Paul @ The Frugal Toad&lt;/b&gt; - Oh hell no! I signed on that line to borrow that money, so now we owe it! Had it gone the other way we wouldn&#039;t be bailing out, ya know? :)
@&lt;b&gt;christina h.&lt;/b&gt; - Ack! I need to go there!!! And oddly enough I was trying to convince my wife of it too on yesterday&#039;s drive home :) Only problem is she can&#039;t STAND the Steelers and I can&#039;t get her past that! Haha... But I&#039;m working on it... I think I&#039;d enjoy it there too from the one time we drove through on our way to Ohio. It had all sorts of cool terrain there!
@&lt;b&gt;Tushar @ Everything Finance&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it would, but we&#039;re gonna go with a broker company too manage it for us so we don&#039;t have to :) It&#039;ll cost a pretty penny, but it&#039;ll be worth the stress/time/etc. Especially if we&#039;re no longer living around the area!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Exploring moving to a whole new area is a huge step! I hope you find a place that you like. It&#039;s probably best to rent out your house and rent your living quarters in your new town, but do you think it will be difficult to be a landlord from afar?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pittsburgh! We have an incredibly low cost of living, beautiful hiking all around, four huge parks within city limits, amazing things for families to do, great night life, and lots o&#039; jobs. Last week, my husband and I attended MakeNight, a chance for grown ups to get to run wild all over the Children&#039;s Museum of Pittsburgh. We met awesome people, acid-etched shot glasses (to take home), made jewelry (to take home) and cheese, screen printed and made paper, and there was an all-you-can drink FREE bar as well as lots of amazing food. Cost? $10. No joke.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in Wilmington, and I&#039;d recommend it, only because I love it here. I&#039;d definitely recommend it as a &quot;small&quot; Charleston, and it&#039;s continually growing. It&#039;s definitely a slower pace than the RTP area, though, and there isn&#039;t as much to do as in the RTP area, but that doesn&#039;t take anything from Wilmington. We also have some of the best beaches on the east coast.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to do tech support for LA and I always had to keep in mind when sending someone to an office to pick up equipment that their commute time  was not like a normal city commute but an LA commute. Kind of like converting Celsius into Fahrenheit -  double it and add 30. 

I think LA would be a wonderful place to VISIT. I bet you&#039;d get a lot of great ideas for posts from a 1-2 week visit. NC sounds quite nice based on the feedback from other readers. 

PS I hope you find time to check out some thrift stores in your travels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up in Wilmington, NC, went to high school in Durham, went to college in Chapel Hill, lived in Raleigh for a while, now live in the DC area ... basically the opposite of your plans! If you have any questions about NC or any of the places above, I&#039;d love to answer them!

Wilmington is a lovely place -- nice beach, slower pace of life, but not that much to do! Besides eat at Flaming Amy&#039;s Burrito Barn -- that place is delicious!

Durham has its own identity -- People from Durham call themselves &quot;Durhamites.&quot; They are rougher places and better places to live in Durham. The Raleigh area is safer on aggregate and depending on where you are, can have cheaper rent. I rented a 2 bedroom house, 1 bath for 600 dollars a month in Raleigh. Currently paying 1475 to live in a 1 bedroom apartment in Montgomery Cty.

As far as schools though -- The Triangle area is heads and tails above Wilmington IF you get in the right school district.]]></description>
