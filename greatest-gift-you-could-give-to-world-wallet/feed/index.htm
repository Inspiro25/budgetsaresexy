					<description><![CDATA[This is very interesting and probably one of the most important things we need to be aware of in our modern society... especially since &quot;Attention Deficit&quot; is now a rampant &quot;disorder&quot; and taking drugs is the most common solution. I&#039;m 42 and this was unheard of when I was a kid. But, I was also outside playing with the neighbor kids, rescuing hurt animals, climbing trees... this means getting dirty, getting exercise and getting sun and fresh air. Now, kids are holed in houses and cars in the summer and school in the winter. They are learning about our ecosystem from books instead of getting out in nature. Adults are sitting far too long in cars and cubicles, and eating convenience foods. We have addictions to facebook, internet surfing and video games. Like you said, we need to understand our connection to the planet and to others. This modern way of life isn&#039;t serving us much, considering happiness has declined steadily since the 1950&#039;s and over 2/3rds of Americans are unhappy and over 50% are taking anti-anxiety or anti-depressant meds. I&#039;m not suggesting giving up modern amenities, but like you wrote about, it is so important to pay attention and be present. 

Also, you mentioned how people spend their time... I love the saying &quot;Don&#039;t confuse activity with accomplishment.&quot; We tend to spend so much time on busy activities, without a lot of time spent pondering, wondering, wandering, etc... 

GREAT article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm...to live my life with the purpose of truly obeying the Lord and desiring to please Him in all my ways. In and of myself I cannot be kind, caring, giving, or anything good when I&#039;m wrapped up in myself. Putting Him first and praying that He use me and fill me with His love and fruit makes me put my eyes on Him and helps me treat others in a God given way]]></description>

I&#039;m still pretty impressed w/ myself about it, haha... I wonder what the purpose of me thinking it - and then sharing it with others - will turn out to be :) Hopefully something good!]]></description>

Was so glad to see you doing that too!

I don&#039;t know if you saw this, but someone left a comment on Rockstar about it:

&quot;Thanks so much for finding this! I have been looking FOREVER for a student loan spreadsheet that includes all of the different income-based repayment plans, so this is an awesome find.&quot;

Well done, man :)]]></description>
