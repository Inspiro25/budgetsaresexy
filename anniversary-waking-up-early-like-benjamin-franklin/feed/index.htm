					<description><![CDATA[I used to get up early on a regular basis when I was in high school and worked on a horse farm (4:30-5:00), and sometimes in college depending on my work schedule (one semester I worked 5:00-7:30 before an 8:00 class).  I really enjoy the early morning hours, but sometimes I had to stay up later for work/school and my schedule gradually shifted. Since I got married in August, though, I&#039;ve been getting up at 5:30 with my husband most mornings and am rediscovering how much I enjoy those early morning hours. We just signed up for a gym and I plan to get up at 5:00 so I can fit in a good hour workout before work. I am also more productive in the morning than at night so I am happy to go to bed at 9:30-10:00 whenever my schedule allows.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved this! I get up early as well, and coffee is a must. I truly believe you get so much more accomplished with an early rise and as someone else commented I&#039;m older and I think a bit wiser, so my late nights with friends is usually over by 9 pm.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Franklin was the original blogger - the guy had a newspaper in Philadelphia and its possible he published this, not necessarily because he practiced this schedule, but because it made good copy. 

Also, Franklin probably had servants to take care of his kids, do the housework, etc.  I don&#039;t seem much in his schedule for any of those activities.]]></description>

It is indeed!

But doing it half the time at least gets you to a half a million ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, 

Awesome to hear that you&#039;re still doing the 5am wake-up call! I can only do it half the time or so and the other time I want to sleep in just a little bit more. 

I do agree that it slows time waaaaaaay down though, which is refreshing. You help inspire me to do better with the early wake-up call. I believe it&#039;s a common habit of millionaires.]]></description>

Oh yeah, I&#039;m always busting up sucka MCs about TJ — dude spent MAD amounts of cash. He&#039;d go to a book store and clean house, buying books by the cart-load and often sending them to other people if he had duplicates. Furniture too - far more than could ever fit in his places. At least Bennie Frank practiced what he preached for most of his life. He also wanted to jail journalists who were critical (sounds familiar?). He&#039;s not my fav...]]></description>
