					<description><![CDATA[Do you “own” your home or do you rent? We will own it when we&#039;re done paying the bank :)

If you own, how much did you pay for it? 149k with 10k down on it.

How much is your mortgage/rent payments? Just the mortgage is ~$800 and it&#039;s ~1200 with the taxes and insurance.

Where do you live? Hattiesburg, MS

Do you own any other property? Nope

*Bonus* Are you Happy with this? This is absolutely our dream house. We started making the list of features to be included in our dream house before we were married. We didn&#039;t start looking for a house until we were 100% out of debt and then we didn&#039;t engage a Realtor until we had ~15k to put down and for closing costs. We had already driven by all the potential houses we had looked at online. We visited this house on the first &#039;official&#039; day of viewing houses and signed the offer that evening. It has *everything* that was on both my and my husband&#039;s dream house wish list. It is our first house and it may very well be our last house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you guys so much for dropping all these!  It really is helping me put things in better perspective and making me realize that a change is DEF in order for my living situation.  This is nuts!  You guys are doing so good!!! :)  Very very proud of y&#039;all.  Putting me to shame fo sho.

@&lt;b&gt;Meghan&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, affordability is key!  So if you get bored or wanna leave it/sell it/etc but can&#039;t for some reason, at least *financially* it&#039;s not hurting you or screwing you up :)  So well done!  You did much better than me! Haha... (also, love your penguin icon)
@&lt;b&gt;Teresa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I can see that.  And what are the odds you live in the exact same spot as the commenter before?  Cool! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - SOLD!  You need to be a pitch woman for Cleveland - I&#039;m getting all excited over here! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Amy Lou&lt;/b&gt; - Where is &quot;home&quot; for you?  I forget.
@&lt;b&gt;LLF&lt;/b&gt; - What if we lived down the street from each other? :)
@&lt;b&gt;KSUE&lt;/b&gt; - And I appreciate you sharing :)  We really are getting to know each other a lot - I love it!
@&lt;b&gt;Paul&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwwww, at least you know what you&#039;re doing!  Damn man, that&#039;s awesome.  Totally different than a 27 y/o at home not doing anything w/ their life.  I admire you, bro.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you “own” your home or do you rent? I &quot;Houseshare&quot; with some friends (so I rent/they own).
If you own, how much did you pay for it? They paid $875,000 about 14-years ago.
How much is your mortgage/rent payments? $600/month rent for 3/rooms/half the house.  We split up utilities.
Where do you live? Santa Cruz, California
Do you own any other property? I own 1/10th of a house worth around $150,000.  (It was my grandmother&#039;s house and is paid off. We have it rented out - split 10 ways we each make about $100/month). I have owned a condo before in San Jose and I lost money on it (sold at the WRONG time!).
*Bonus* Are you Happy with this? Very happy!  I&#039;m now living in a beautiful house with an ocean view.  My money is helping my friends keep their house (and the lower rent helps me stay afloat with my kids.   Prior to this I was renting a 2-bedroom apartment in the same area for $1150/month for comparison.

Loved reading these, so  thought I&#039;d share.]]></description>
