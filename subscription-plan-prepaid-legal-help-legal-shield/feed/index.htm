					<description><![CDATA[I remember pre-paid legal being the latest fad like 20 years ago.  Its one of those fads that comes and goes, like bottled water, room air de-ionizers, vitamins, exercise equipment on late night tv, etc.  Sure you may get some use out of it for civil matter, but don&#039;t expect them to help you in a murder case.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the info so far guys, pretty cool to see what other people are using out there :)  I&#039;ll holler if I end up using them, but right now I&#039;m thinking I won&#039;t... unless I get some sort of free trial or something... Hmm....

@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking... though MAN is it good when you need it!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, and how comfortable they are I guess.
@&lt;b&gt;Pam&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! Pretty cool it&#039;s working for him :) Thx for the info.
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, haven&#039;t heard of them before. Will go over and check &#039;em out as soon as I post this up - thanks :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Def. a good biz model!
@&lt;b&gt;Adam Hagerman&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha... reminds me of those stock brokers who always try and sell you on their services, but when asked to see their OWN portfolios they somehow don&#039;t like it ;) Same thing with financial managers too. My friend&#039;s dad would only use those who would supply him with their tax returns to prove they know what they&#039;re doing, haha... makes sense!  And nice to hear from ya bud - it&#039;s been a while :)
@&lt;b&gt;Gina&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!! And $6.95 is a lot better than $20-$50 too :) Thanks for the info!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Right?  It&#039;s hard to tell sometimes if it&#039;s GOOD to run into these things we weren&#039;t expecting and/or ever thinking about, or if it&#039;s bad cuz it just adds more complications and money out the door? If only someone tell me what kind of *sign* this was! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it funny how we never think about paying $15 a month for a service we&#039;ll rarely use until we&#039;re presented with the ability to buy it? Imagine what would have happened, J., if you hadn&#039;t run into this lady. Would you have needed LegalShield?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Forgot to mention, they help you  get a lawyer out town when  needed.  Husband inherited a house/estate of dead uncle. We are two states  away. The service found us a lawyer that would discount their fees to help us. I think we are saving anywhere to 1-2000.00 in legal fees, compared to normal prices to settle an estate) .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I have this legal service, Legal Access Plans LLC, it is deducted from husband&#039;s paycheck every month for $6.95. It covers both of us and our parents too!
We have use it for making wills, settling an estate out of town, legal advice, and they offer financial advice as well.  We are using it this week for legal advice for a divorcing family member.  It comes in handy..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kind of have an ironic (and irrelevant) story regarding someone trying to sell me these services before. 

Back when I was an IRS tax examiner (gasp!) I once audited an individual who was selling these services. He placed the income (very minimal) and expenses (very high) on his Schedule C and was selected for audit. Turns out that most of the expenses while legit, were not deductible. He even tried selling me the services during our appointment. Talk about guts!

The ironic part of this story is that he didn&#039;t even use the services that he sold. He just represented himself in the audit.]]></description>
