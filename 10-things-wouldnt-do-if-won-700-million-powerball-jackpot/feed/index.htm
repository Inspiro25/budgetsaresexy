Agreed... And I&#039;d pitch in at work too just for avoiding that feeling too of missing out while everyone around you is celebrating! haha... that would be miserable. (until they all quit, of course ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That powerball is even bigger now! So good luck. And I certainly think your list is a noble one. It&#039;d be great to hear of someone winning the lottery and not having it ruin their life within five years. Maybe that will be you! After all, the best time to end up with extra money is when you&#039;re already doing something you enjoy and living a lifestyle you value - then you can actually spend the money on things that matter. Thanks for another great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t even know what to do with that much cash! I never participate in the lottery either, but I participated in a pool at work and my husband also bought 2 tickets, just so we wouldn&#039;t miss out. Looks like we get a free chance at Wednesday&#039;s drawing because we got the Powerball number right, so we should win $3 or something like that. Something I think I wouldn&#039;t do is quit working altogether. I would quit my current job, but I would look for a non-profit to join, or do some missionary traveling and working or something. I just couldn&#039;t do absolutely nothing for the rest of my life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t play the lottery on a regular but I have been buying into the work pool. I&#039;d hate to pass it up for the simple fact that they may hit and I&#039;d be the only one out, lol But seriously I tend to think how this amount of money would actually change my life for the worst. People coming out of the wood work asking for donations, worrying about my kids and their safety on the way to and from school and what not, trying to keep my values, not raising spoiled children and on and on and on. Yes having this cash would definitely help me to do much good in this world but with it comes a lot of responsibility and many worries. Just my thought.]]></description>
