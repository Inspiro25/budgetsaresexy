I&#039;m not sure I could since we don&#039;t have any equity in it? Or at leas without putting down $90k like the last time I tried to refi with a plain 30 year :(

Plus, at this point we&#039;ll probably end up selling it sooner than later anyways so I&#039;m not stressing about the interest rate as much as I used to. It&#039;s now a rental property as we&#039;ve since moved so odds are we&#039;ll sell as soon as we think we can break even.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why not refi that mortgage down again into a 15-year conventional - you could lock in 3.25% easily and save almost $6k a year in interest?  Even if the refi could a couple $$ upfront - the pay back period is well worth it...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking good man. Great idea tracking the kids&#039; net worth. We should do the same. All his net worth is in his 529 so it should be easy enough. I&#039;m still not comfortable sharing our number with the public...]]></description>

Just a heads up, PV, RATE, and PMT are two other functions that do exactly what you think they do. Trade out the variable in the same formula. 

&quot;How much do I need to save per period at a given interest rate to reach $1 million&quot; 

Glad you asked, PMT will tell you!

					<description><![CDATA[J$,

Awesome update. Love that you&#039;re tracking your children&#039;s net worth separately like that. How awesome that they&#039;re already off to a great start like that? They have a larger net worth right now than I did at 27 years old! :)

Looks like you guys won&#039;t even have to contribute that much more going forward to give them a solid college fund after you factor in compounding. 

Best regards!]]></description>
