					<description><![CDATA[This was really inspiring!  I graduated with $34000 of debt, which for a Canadian with a BA in Unemployability is an awful lot.  (I&#039;m a queer atheist who majored in Religion and minored in History; I&#039;m far from in demand.)

I got a job and worked my ass off to get a quick raise to and all the overtime (at 1.5x my wage) I could handle.  I got a cheap-ass crappy apartment with a roommate, and put his share of the rent/utilities/groceries straight into loan repayment. I lived off dried beans and rice.  I investigated loan forgiveness programs that people didn&#039;t know existed and got over $6000 knocked off.

I finished school at the end of April 2008; my loans were paid off by the end of that summer.  And then the economy fell apart, and I was okay, even when I lost my job in January 2009, because I&#039;d paid off my loans.  And it all felt damned good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this - I am sure it will inspire so many people. What I liked best? You know that we humans tend to like people who remind us of ourselves (and things that remind us of what we did)? Well, I was almost crying when Joe was saying that he was going without things he thought he could never be without and it felt good! This is what I have been doing for the last two and a half years and have paid off over $100,000 of &#039;credit crunch&#039; debt. It can be done! And it feels good - we don&#039;t really need &#039;stuff&#039; and we already have too much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have read about his story and find it so inspiring!  Yes, he has a good income, but he also had a lot of debt and he did what he had to to get rid of it.  What a great success story!]]></description>
