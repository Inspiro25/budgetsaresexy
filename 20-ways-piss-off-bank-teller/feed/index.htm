Several years ago, one of the major US banks was involved in a class action lawsuit because their coin counting machines were found to be inaccurate.  When this was announced, most large banks immediately discontinued offering this service in order to avoid potential risk to both their clients and their shareholders]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Retired banker here.  Loved this!  Adding:  if I ask for your ID, don&#039;t give me a hard time about it - I need to know you are YOU!  Or say &quot;where&#039;s so and so, she knows me&quot;.  I don&#039;t care - I am the one waiting on you right now.  I have a few stories of my own :)  

Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

Thank you for making those comments.  The tellers who acted professionally are all gone from my bank.  In their place, are tellers - and now all women - who fawn over ANY man who walks into the place - he could be covered with manure - and treat women - unless they are friends with them - and boy, they know a lot of them - like crap.  I can&#039;t change banks, and I need to go into the bank for my transactions.  I expressed my concerns - and compliments - to another branch manager of the same bank.  Was it handled professionally?  Now, I am but laughing stock.  And I&#039;m not exaggerating.  If there was another way, or another bank, so I would never have to interact with this scene....]]></description>

Couldn&#039;t pass this up, you make it too easy.  Tracy, have you ever heard of Secret Shoppers? Or maybe did you bother to interact with a few financial institutions before you plunked down your little weeks worth of a nest egg? Or better yet, the good ol &#039;policy item&#039;, which is generally the only way to GET a non member check cashed, at least without a shitty fee. The policy item refers to a check drawn off of the bank the filthy annoying worthless non member has brought it to. Perhaps that non member was checking out the service, OR maybe they just had some unfortunate luck and didn&#039;t have the ability to get to their own bankKeep in mind, that check didn&#039;t materialise from thin air, IT CAME FROM ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS! 
On another note, I read a very interesting blog recently on how banks influence how checks post, with the full intention of making sure a portion of them bounce so they can skim those fees. Personally it always looked fishy to me, and I sure can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised. You say your not gold diggers, but even the account policies are significantly more opulent, convenient and money saving for those fortunate enough to be able to keep higher balances deposited. It&#039;s shameful, truely disgusting.]]></description>

Ladies and Gentleman! I used to work as a teller for Bank of America. I also worked as an instructor at a Beauty School. And as a Hair Stylist. Have any of you gone to get your hair/brows/hooves serviced? I&#039;m betting yes. While some of your petulance is not without merit, a good deal of it is plain rediculous! Last time I checked there were no requirement for anything other a High School Diploma and some hands on experience to work as a teller. Of course poise, a steady demeanour, appropriate fashion sense, good focus, an award winning personality, and perhaps a slightly above average I.Q couldn&#039;t hurt, along with being able to pass all those pesky background checks, etc. A cute figure never hurts either. But let&#039;s be realistic here; your essentially entry level customer service reps, not Manager of Branch Operations or Senior Loan Officers! Everyone hates working with/ touching the public. As a Hairstylist, I had walk in clients, that would show up literally 30 seconds before closing and expect a full shampoo, full highlights and lowlights, a trim, a blow dry style, AND be educated on how best to maintain their new personal investment they just dropped $500! Not to mention our sales quota&#x200d;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2642.png" alt="♂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I wonder how many repeat clients, not to mention kick ass tips I would have gotten with the attitude in this article. And keep in mind your lofty expectations of special treatment the next time your find yourselves client side to a fellow grunt in the service industry, and a parting tidbit you may find interesting? A LOT of your masseuses, Cosmotologists, esthetician etc now have DEGREES!! Just a little cure for the weenie whining. Your welcome&#x200d;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2640.png" alt="♀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is in response to Vicki&#039;s comment.  Sounds like the common denominator for most of your troubles is you.  Your choice of going strictly electronic is probably the best choice for all involved.  What #18 is likely referring to are non-customers who go into a bank and get thier panties all in a bunch because the bank won&#039;t bend over backwards to serve them.  What?  You don&#039;t have $8,000 in large bills?  That&#039;s ridiculous!  Sorry no...we don&#039;t have a money tree in the vault that is abundant with $100 bills, and with what large bills we do have on hand, we reserve for our customers who actually hold accounts with us.  You can have a mix of bills, including some sweaty stinky 50&#039;s and $20&#039;s or...take the check to your own bank and let them put a hold on it until the funds clear.   Don&#039;t mistaken that for bad customer service because it is providing good customer service for those who are actually...you know...customers.]]></description>
