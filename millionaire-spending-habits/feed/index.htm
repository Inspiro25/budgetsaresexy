					<description><![CDATA[The 3K for vacations number threw me off. Maybe that is because it is something that I choose to prioritize over other things in life but it is easy to spend that much traveling! I wonder if that is just hotel and flight?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got 4/8 on crossing dots with this list. 

I find it interesting that a large portion of these millionaires uses credit cards, but I guess it depends on many different factors. It must be nice spending $3,000 on a vacation :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That $3,000 for vacations, is that per person?

A family vacation for $3,000 would be a steal but I guess it also depends on what is classified as a vacation. We go camping a few times a year and each time it probably costs $300-500 total. If we take a vacation that requires a plane then we&#039;re easily over $3,000.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;m spending more on &quot;vacations&quot; now that my girlfriend lives over one thousand miles away. Airfare has been under $1000 total for both trips, but cabs from airport and food maybe trip me closer to $1300.  

Now give me my millions! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even $3,000 on a vacation blows my mind at this stage of my life. I fully expect to spend more than that on long, drawn-out expeditions someday, but the most expensive vacation I&#039;ve taken so far was a spring break cruise that ran about $1,500 for two - ticket, drinks and travel to the port considered. And that was a ridiculously lavish week or so. What do people get when they spend more??]]></description>
