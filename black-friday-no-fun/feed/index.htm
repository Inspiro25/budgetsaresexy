					<description><![CDATA[Hahaha... you make a solid argument, my good friend. How about you jump in fully clothed then, but also with a pale of blood? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One question... why does it matter if you jump into the gator infested swamp naked? I would think that combining something fun (skinny dipping) with something not fun (alligators) would make it slightly better (like mixing eye drops with mace to mute the effect). Unless you&#039;re wearing a chainmail shark suit I don&#039;t think the clothing will make much difference.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Black Friday tradition is slowly seeping its way into Canada. I am not a shopper at the best of times...I didn&#039;t get those genes...let alone when it is crazy nuts out there. I went Boxing Day shopping with my sister in law one year and almost had a heart attack with the insanity of it all. I am with you; I would rather do any of your 7 listed and then some than take part in that chaos!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ll just do my shopping online.  Or maybe I&#039;ll wait for small business Saturday...Or Mainstreet Monday... I don&#039;t remember which it is.  All the small local business do a sale on one of those days.  Much less publicity though so the crowds aren&#039;t as bad :).  I think if I tried to go out on Friday I&#039;d just get into a fight with someone trying to push past me for the newest tablet or TV.]]></description>
