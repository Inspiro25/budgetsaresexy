Ooooh now that is a program!!! I bet SOOOOO many people have signed up to it too and then been *tricked* into saving more! lolol... Whatever it takes though! ;)

As for where to put it, I always dump mine into index funds as I like to just keep a certain max in savings and then the rest there, but these days interest rates are much higher than normal so you&#039;ll probably find a new home for it soon I&#039;m sure :) 

Thx for sharing! Smart credit unions!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My credit union has a program where they have a raffle that you can win if you sign up to save $25 a month. I signed up, and although I never won the raffle, I found that, after a while, I had $1,000 saved that was in a CD. Finding out the CD had a low yield, I cashed it in and am going to invest it in something else. Any suggestions? Since it&#039;s such an easy way to save, I upped my monthly contribution to $100. That will increase my chances of winning the raffle. Eight credit unions are in the raffle pool. When I talked to the manager about it (she waived the $25 charge to cash in my CD), she said someone from our credit union had won a couple of times. The biggest yearly raffle is $5,000. Saving is good and it&#039;s sexy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greetings from California! I just rediscovered your Recommendations page.  Those resources are much appreciated!  My car had an altercation with a telephone pole recently and the pole won.  So happy to have an emergency fund, as I learned to do in the FIRE community.  Carry on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. Money! Happy National Savings Day!

Not totally related, but just wanted to thank you for all the great content over the years. When I started reading your blog, I was drowning in over $67,000 of student loans. The current balance is $18,932.35 and the end is in sight. Of course the first step was creating an actual emergency fund and then not using it for anything other than an emergency. This helped me stop the credit card use and forced me to create and stick to a realistic budget. You were one of the first money blogs I followed and I&#039;ve learned so much over the years. Thank you again!]]></description>
