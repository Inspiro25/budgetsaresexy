					<description><![CDATA[You prompted me to come up with my own list and write about it haha.  Mine were very similar to yours, with a few added (like accidentally-on-purpose never getting around to getting cable again once we moved this past summer...lol) but it was fun to look around and see the ways that we don&#039;t even REALIZE we are saving money just by habits we&#039;ve become accustomed to.   (My hubby would live on PB&#038;J as well...but only if I make them.  He says he can taste the love in them and they&#039;re better than the ones he makes lol)]]></description>

Remember that cheap pay-as-you-go flip phone I was using when I wrote that &quot;Living in the Quieter Spots of Life&quot; post? Still using it three and a half years later. It costs me $2 a day if I use it and nothing at all if I don&#039;t. Since I work at home, I can go for weeks without using it for anything except a timepiece.

Oh, and my partner cuts his hair too -- with a Flowbee! Details at:

We are still frugal-with-a-vegeance, and still entirely stupid about each other. &#060;3]]></description>

Little kids (and some big kids!) like a PBB done in this way:

Split a hot-dog roll.
Spread with peanut butter.
Put the banana in whole.
Pretend you&#039;re eating a hot dog.]]></description>

I bought six cloth napkins for a quarter at a rummage sale in 2004. Still using them, so I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re cheaper than paper towels since they take up practically no room in a load of laundry. 
And hey J$, a frugal tip: If you use a paper towel to wipe up spilled water, don&#039;t throw it away. Unfold it and put it on the counter to dry, and it will live to fight another day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/frugal-by-accident/#comment-223435&quot;&gt;Retire Before Dad&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey, some of us women do our own hair, too!

I cut, color, and highlight (foil) my hair. I get supplies from a beauty supply store. Learned from a random stranger in a church bathroom about cutting a gypsy shag by flipping and twisting hair and lopping off the end. 

Hate making and keeping appointments. Hate spending that RIDICULOUS $ to get my hair done. And I&#039;ve gotten as many compliments on my hair when I do it as when a stylist does it. --LA]]></description>
