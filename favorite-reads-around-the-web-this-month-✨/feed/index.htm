					<description><![CDATA[Loved the tax cartoons, but I would differ a little in the advice.  Aren&#039;t taxes going to always go up?  Why not pay the tax now, when I have kids,etc… and put in ROTH now? skip the traditional IRA part.....start the ROTH conversions NOW.   Two reasons:  Taxes always go up and the money is growing tax free.  For instance, I pay the tax, put in a ROTH, buy Apple stock.  The Apple stock grows now TAX FREE.  I&#039;m not paying tax on the growth, wouldn&#039;t t I be paying tax on the growth in a traditional IRA?  I think the 401K is important......especially to get the &#039;company match&#039; *Free money*.  There is also something about qualifications to Medicare and income when you reach that age. Another thing to consider is an emergency.... If I need to reach in for a new roof, etc if the money is in ROTH and been there many years I don&#039;t worry about the 5 year penalty .]]></description>
