I wish I could pay for bills/rent with my credit card
I always use my credit card to pay for anything because I&#039;d get 10% on spending my own money since, apart from an intro rate, I pay in full every month.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish my credit card had a TV screen on it.  It&#039;s just the right size, and would come in handy when I forget to charge my cellphone.

I hate that my credit card has tiny letters that I can&#039;t read when trying to give the expiry date over the telephone.  Makes me sound stupider than I am.

I wish I could pay for my mortgage with my credit card, I&#039;ve been saying that for years.

I always use my credit card to purchase everything I can because I don&#039;t carry cash (curse you, parking lot attendants!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha... i can&#039;t believe that WoW is real! Good find Ken.

Sorry for all those who had trouble commenting and got back the &quot;too spammy&quot; error message.  I think it was actually because every sentence up there contained the word &quot;credit card&quot; and wordpress thought y&#039;all were promoting that ish all over ;)  oops!  it wasn&#039;t me, i promise.

Glad some of you were able to comment though - loved hearing your different takes on it.  Happy Sunday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I currently have no credit cards because I have just (and by just I mean two years ago) have joined the pay down your debt movement! I only use my debit card and cash, which proves to be difficult, but I finally make just barely over what I owe, so I can live cheap and still actually pay minimums on bills.

When I had a credit card it would have been something like this...

I wish my credit card had a no clothing buying lock.
I hate that my credit card has(had) such a high limit on it.
I wish I could pay for bills with my credit card (because I had so many!)
I always use (used) my credit card to purchase clothes and food and beer because all my friends were always cute and going out to drink and I got jealous if I couldn&#039;t go out with them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m the same way. I wish I could pay for EVERYTHING on my credit card. I calculated the rate of return as 1% which is pretty good, and I put my hotel apartment on there, I put all of our plane tickets.. it&#039;s incredible how fast the points rack up.]]></description>

I love the list.  I really don&#039;t care what my credit card looks like so long as it is accepted for my purchases.]]></description>
