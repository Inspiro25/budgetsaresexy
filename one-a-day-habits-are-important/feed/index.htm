					<description><![CDATA[I am just starting my blogging journey, it&#039;s great to get some tips from your article plus from the other commentators on how you schedule your writing. We are all mega busy, so I look forward to trying several things to check which one works for me, and concentrate on developing that as a habit. 
Thanks for your tips!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! You are right that getting into good habits is so key, because they become automatic in future today. Currently I am trying to do that with flossing! Ha. I have always been bad about flossing, but I am trying to really get into a habit that sticks!]]></description>

There are pros and cons. The key phrase is &quot;Once I get going on something&quot;. I often have trouble with the getting started part, but I&#039;ve figured out that the resistance to starting is generally related to set up time, both physical and mental. If I have to take half an hour to drag out a bunch of stuff and then another half an hour to remember what I&#039;m doing, I had better be able to work on it long enough to make all that &quot;worthwhile&quot;. On the other hand, if I only have a few projects, it&#039;s easy to remember what&#039;s going on with each one and I can generally find room to leave them set up and ready to go. The downside, is that I don&#039;t do very well with juggling a lot of projects at one time. With two or three projects set up and in progress, I can happily go all day. With multiple projects that I need to &quot;get started on&quot;, I can happily waste the entire day away and do nothing at all. I think I&#039;m probably just really bad at switching tasks.]]></description>

I&#039;d love to get a few weeks ahead myself.  Not even 1 a day!  I have trouble with the baby (~15 months old).  I can&#039;t do anything till she&#039;s asleep and then I&#039;d like to spend a little time with my wife.  You did it right getting out of the 9-5 prior to having the baby!!]]></description>

It&#039;s just about priorities, really. You wouldn&#039;t skip an entire week of your job, would you? Even if you didn&#039;t want to go or it was hard to get going? :)]]></description>
