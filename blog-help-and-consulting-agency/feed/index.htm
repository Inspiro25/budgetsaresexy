					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much :) 

And &lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt;, I think you&#039;re doing it right too with that route.  Go through the process and work out all the kinds while helping people for free (and getting those testimonials), and then once you&#039;ve gotten it down start putting out that price :)  We did the same thing and the part I wasn&#039;t expecting was how much more CONFIDENT we got after each and every call we did.  We learned parts that worked well, and parts that didn&#039;t, but overall we felt a lot more secure in what we were offering, and how much we were helping, once we started DOING IT.  There&#039;s a lot more effort and behind the scenes work that can go into a lot of these services that the customers/clients don&#039;t see, so it only adds to the reasons why charging can be important.  Good work getting it out the door! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can totally relate to the difficulty of charging people for something you could give away for free. I just launched a side hustle doing job search coaching, and it&#039;s something where I know there&#039;s a need and I know that my time and expertise are valuable, but I just want to help people so much that I want to offer to help everyone for free. I am working with a few free clients right now to get references and spread the word, but I know it&#039;s going to be hard for me to charge my first client.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations! You should be very excited about this. It is such a great idea with two awesome guys behind it. :)
I should admit that I absolutely agree with the fact that you have to ask for what you want. People cannot read your minds! (thank God!) :)]]></description>
