Hah - awesome! Thanks so much for letting me know - it&#039;s notes like this that KEEP ME continuing with the blog! Without feedback it would be like talking (writing?) to a wall :) 

I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re enjoying it. It&#039;s taken me a while to really *understand* money, and now that it&#039;s sunk in I see the whole world different. And hopefully you guys start doing so too! It&#039;s amazing once you &quot;figure it out.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, i started reading your blog last week since Republic Wireless shared that 7 things article, and posts like this are the reason I continue to read. Money is all well and good, but it isn&#039;t happiness, and you get that. You seem very self aware and understanding that priorities are different for different people and that priorities change. I&#039;m loving your advice. (also this gives me something to do when i&#039;m sitting bored on the night shift and motivates me to keep up with good spending habits)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh wow I think you&#039;re getting soft in your old age :)

But this is actually really good, and an important message. While we&#039;re always hustling for more and working on our &#039;staches, gotta take a moment to appreciate all we already have. 

I get an automated email every night that&#039;s tied to a Google form that asks what I got done that day and what I&#039;m grateful for. When I&#039;m down I can read through the hundreds of entries and realize I&#039;m making progress and all things considered, life&#039;s not so bad :)

Cheers,
Nick]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lol what a thing to tell your wife even if it is true! I hope you don&#039;t do it right before she&#039;s about to fall asleep to jolt her awake:P 

I&#039;m pretty happy with my life and what I have. All my needs are fulfilled. I&#039;m still working towards a lot of goals but no rush at all. No kids yet though! That&#039;s one goal coming up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is perfect. Just what I needed! I&#039;m having a tough time with money right now, but only because I perceive it as tough. I could have it way worse. I&#039;ve got my sweet husband napping by my side and my cuddly dog nearby. Life ain&#039;t so bad. Time to put the tablet down and enjoy their company. Thank you for the reminder to be grateful.]]></description>
