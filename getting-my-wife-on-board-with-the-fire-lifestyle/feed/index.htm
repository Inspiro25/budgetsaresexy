Hey thanks Adam!  I&#039;ll admit, I didn&#039;t have the exact math to back up that saying at the time - because it depends on how much we make vs. how much we need later.  But it&#039;s not about the money - it was more about making sacrifices now that have huge payoffs later.
Cheers!

					<description><![CDATA[Hang in there Paul. Progress is progress, even if it&#039;s slow. I think every couple can look back and identify things they could have done more efficiently. Just got to keep moving forward and try to learn from the past.

Love the 8 cylinders analogy. It&#039;s time to fire them all up!]]></description>

Sorry to hear he was laid off, but I&#039;m glad you&#039;re already thinking about making good changes for the future! Tough times and conversations in life lead to golden moments later on!

Good luck to him on the job hunt!

					<description><![CDATA[This is such a great topic and one I wish more people had the courage to tackle (although, I understand why they don&#039;t).  Wife and I continue to struggle with this.  Brief moments of clarity followed by stupid purchases that we NEED but somehow make our lives significantly worse.  I&#039;ve just been luck on the earnings side of things and been able to keep ahead of it for the most part BUT I know if we were running on all 8 cylinders, we&#039;d both be retired right now.  I know its a process but also its in how we both communicate.  It feels like we are getting there, albeit slowly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that you should be on the same page financially before you ever get married. Actually all the important parts of life, spirituality, having kids, where you’d like and hate to live, view on pets, political views, career goals and everything money should be thoroughly vetted.  Marrying someone without knowing where they stand on even one of these topics is risky business. Marriage is a lifetime commitment so there should be a great deal of discovery before signing the contract.  We did that and after 41 years of marriage we are still waiting to have that first fight about money.]]></description>

It&#039;s cool you guys can divide and conquer like that. And it definitely helps when your partner isn&#039;t a big spender and has little wants in life.
Please tell him THANK YOU for his service. Enjoy the long weekend :)]]></description>

I like the way you put it about playing your strengths. My wife and I are the same... She could take over at any point, but doesn&#039;t have the interest that I have. Regardless, she is involved and approves every decision we make.
Congrats on early retirement - to both of you! Life is definitely good!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband was laid off from a six figure job due to COVID and we have no idea if he will be able to replace it or not. We’re “ok” because I also make six figures but we have already vowed that once he’s working again we are getting serious with FIRE. I don’t ever want to be “ok” again, we earn too much for that.

The lay-off was the push my husband needed, I think. Fingers crossed for us! He’s interviewing almost weekly right now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I have been married almost 12 years and I&#039;ve always been the one handling the money. We started off our marriage like that because he left after 6 months to deploy to Iraq so I was the one at home who could pay the bills and I&#039;ve been doing it ever since. He knows about how much we have/ save but he&#039;s not really into money. He&#039;s also not a big spender so it makes it easy for me to keep a handle on the money.]]></description>
