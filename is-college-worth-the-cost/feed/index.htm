					<description><![CDATA[btw I went back for degree in Political Science as I always had interest in it and I am not involved with local politics and work with several not for profit groups. My programming still pays majority of the bills though... I did not learn this in school, I learned it for fun when I was a teenager. Most of the classes I was taking at university were already behind the industry, that is why I left, I already knew all the stuff and wasn&#039;t learning anything. I am not sure if all industries are like that but IT definitely was and still somewhat is...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree with some posters don&#039;t do it unless you have a safety net. Myself I come from a poor family, my parents couldn&#039;t afford to send me to school. I paid it all myself. There wasn&#039;t this time to sit, get funded, ponder life. I needed to pay rent and eat. So where do you get these contacts for funding or joining your entrepreneurship? College. Where do you think people are going to respect you? College... It&#039;s almost sadly a prerequisite for anything these days. I actually dropped out of school after 3 years to work in the IT industry...(I was a straight A student) I made a lot of money for awhile and quit b/c the money was too good to turn down, but that was THEN in 2001. 10 years things have changed, do not believe that stuff above in this article for most purposes. Those companies were happening almost 10 years ago as well. Jump to current, people want the degree (in what field doesn&#039;t really matter). I would certainly avoid taking on debt for a graduate degree though unless a co pays for it or if you are an elite academic. I eventually took out some loans just to do be able to do easier, what I was already doing! Try changing a job if your successful business suddenly dries up and you have to work for the man a bit. What happens if the bank starts funding your loan? Experience? HAH. The HR department wants the degree. The potential clients wants the degree. I would have the degree just for a backup but working for yourself is also great. Think of it as investment in yourself just in case you ever have to work a real job. In the information age, I definitely agree modern education is behind the times and brick and mortar, along with the huge salaries are quite arcane.]]></description>
