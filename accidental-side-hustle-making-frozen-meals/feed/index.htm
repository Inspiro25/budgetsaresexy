					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/accidental-side-hustle-making-frozen-meals/#comment-251194&quot;&gt;Daniel Palmer&lt;/a&gt;.

It is totally illegal in any state I&#039;ve seen.  If you accept  payment for food you make, you must use a kitchen that&#039;s been inspected and passed inspection.  Your &quot;side hustle,&quot; might work for a while, but if ONE person even CLAIMS to get sick, or if ONE PERSON calls the state, you&#039;d be shut down, and fined.  If you don&#039;t have a &quot;commercial kitchen,&quot; or you don&#039;t have access to one, PLUS the proper storage facilities for your frozen meals, you can find yourself in serious legal jeopardy.

Your idea is not new, either.  It&#039;s been around for as long as people had the ability to cook more than they needed.  The difference is that today, there are so many choices that aren&#039;t illegal for people to get prepared foods, that you don&#039;t see people doing what you suggest.

Do what you want, and if it all works out, great, but if it doesn&#039;t, consider that, &quot;According to the Pure Food Act, failure to abide by these regulations can result in a Class IV misdemeanor, which carries a fine of $100 to $500.&quot;  (https://www.platteinstitute.org/research/detail/nebraska-is-choking-on-its-cottage-food-law)

I am 100% on your side here. If it were up to me, you would be able to make and sell whatever you want.  But, the reality is you are taking a big chance - and suggesting to your readers the same.
