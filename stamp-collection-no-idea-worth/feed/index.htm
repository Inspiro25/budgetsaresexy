					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. Money, 

I know this post is pretty old and no one has posted on this for awhile, but I thought that I would give it a shot and post something a little more recent. I acquired some of my grandfathers stamps and he was a collector for the majority of his life. I have since become a hard-core philatelist and can&#039;t get enough, That being said, I have learned a ton of useful info in the short time that I have been collecting and would love to chime in on your stamps if you&#039;re for it. Just wanted to put my two cents in there and see what comes of it. Any help that I can give, let me know...

JK... p.s. those initials aren&#039;t intended to mean Just Kidding... They are my initials ;)]]></description>

Fun!!

Prob good not to get your hopes up for sure since the whole market has collapsed since your father collected, but you never know! There are gems out there that are highly sought after!

I&#039;d search online for the nearest stamp *clubs* or stamp *shows* in your area, and if you don&#039;t find any try *coin* clubs/shows and there should be one or two people who can guide you... The collectors there also usually like to buy up collections or at least can tell you the best way to do so.

Let me know how you make out - I&#039;d be curious!

(PS: I sold my collection here to a friend in my coin club who&#039;s brother collected stamps :) And turns out the collection wasn&#039;t worth a whole lot, haha...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi my name is Jamie and I was just left by my father this stamp collection and im seeing that most of the stamps i have are supposedly worth thousands of dollars. I have ones unused washington 2 cents and also sheets of unused ones. I have no idea where to go or what to do with these. Any suggestions? I feel as though i may be sitting on a gold mine but dont want to get too excited in case they are some kind of copies or something. That would be my luck]]></description>

Oh cool! I&#039;ve always appreciated stamps - especially the older ones - so I agree that sounds like a great way to spend an evening :)

As for my collection here - I ended up selling it to a friend for like $20 or $25 who was going to turn around and gift it to his brother who&#039;s a big collector. So I didn&#039;t make my millions off it, but it was good to finally pass it on to someone who could appreciate it even more while freeing up space in my house :)

Have fun at Museum day if you&#039;re heading to it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J. Money,  How did you make out on your stamp collection that you gave to a friend ? Anything of interest?

My wife and I were checking out stamps we own from early 1900&#039;s-Most are from US and others are from foreign countries. It was a cool way to spend the evening.

Did you know 9/21 is free museum day? Check out the link for museums to visit....

Thanks for blogging about your interest in stamp collecting!]]></description>

Call or visit your nearest stamp club in your area! They can help value/sell it for you no problem :) You can also look out for coin and stamp shows and bring them there.]]></description>

If you want to do it yourself, I found this book helpful when I was going through mine: &quot;The Official Blackbook Price Guide to United States Postage Stamps&quot; It was really hard though, so I opted for having a friend bring them to a local stamp club he attended. That&#039;s the route I&#039;d go if you&#039;re looking to sell them as they can not only value them, but then make an offer if interested :) (from everything I&#039;ve heard though, they&#039;re selling for 40%&#039;ish of value these days...)]]></description>
