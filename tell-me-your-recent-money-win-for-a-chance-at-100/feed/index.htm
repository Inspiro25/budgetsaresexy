Well we are landlord and I figured if we can do long term rentals why not a short term :)]]></description>

Oh sweet - I don&#039;t follow your other site so I actually didn&#039;t know you had already shared your thoughts in that review - thanks!
I actually got started with investing by using Robinhood since September, at the recommendation of one of my classmates. I found it really accessible for someone super new to investing (and definitely utterly clueless), and it really got me interested in actually doing that (more logically/profitably and less on a whim, haha). So that&#039;s where I&#039;ll be funneling in my extra cash for now, until I am no longer a student and have an actual job that might provide enough extra for a proper size portfolio of more long term holdings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is pretty modest, but it&#039;s recent. My favorite magazine came up for renewal earlier this month - $67.50 for a year&#039;s subscription. I remember thinking, &quot;It would be awfully nice if I could get it cheaper.&quot; I was supposed to pay in three installments, but they sent an invoice for the entire amount. I went to the website to pay by credit card and found out that I could get a year&#039;s subscription for $25, two years for $34! I signed up for the two year subscription. From now on, I&#039;ll always go to a magazine&#039;s website to see if I can get a better deal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our company changed our health insurance benefits which surprisingly reduced the cost to me.  Instead of pocketing the extra $10 a month I upped my retirement withholdings.  Investing that extra cash will benefit me more than an extra cup of coffee a month.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We saved $1,000/year by cutting cable bill in half!!  We were paying Comcast $180/month previously for a combined &quot;bundle&quot; of internet &#038; cable with over 200 channels. In March 2016, we cut our bill to $90/month by siginificantly reducing the number of channels to just basic channels. Then we paid Sling $20/month to actually sign up for channels we actually watched. In March 2017, I called Comcast &#038; further reduced our bill to just $70/month as I had to tell them that I was ready to switch to Direct TV!!  What a NICE SAVINGS on a nuisance bill...cable!!]]></description>
