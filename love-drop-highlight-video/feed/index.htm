					<description><![CDATA[WoW!  You sure know how to make a lady cry.  What an incredible thing you and your Love Drop team are doing!  We donate to several causes (mostly education and the environment), but to see the faces of the people you are helping must be an amazing thing.  Great Job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aww, thanks guys - that means a lot :)  Can&#039;t take credit for a lot of it though cuz it was our team of 1,000+ that pulled it off each month. The whole thing&#039;s been an amazing adventure, and really proud of everyone for coming together to do something cool.  It&#039;s proof we can ALL change the world with baby steps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That was incredibly touching! Even though there were no spoken words in the video, you could feel the pain these people were experiencing while telling their story. I know I don&#039;t really know you J, but I&#039;m really proud of what you have done. You should feel really good about using the power of blogging to reach out and affect these families lives in such a personal (and positive) way.

On another note, I&#039;m always striving to improve my life and do something to help people. Seeing you put your plan into action and being successful at it really motivates me. The feeling that following through with an idea is possible is amazing!]]></description>
