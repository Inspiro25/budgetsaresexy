					<description><![CDATA[My hardest financial woe has been recovering from my husband&#039;s layoff last year.  Thankfully, he has a new job that he absolutely LOVES; but we obtained alot of debt that 6 months he was not working.  We used credit cards to buy those all-important groceries so that the money we did have went to pay that pesky mortgage.  We are slowly (and surely) paying those darn credit card balances down.]]></description>
