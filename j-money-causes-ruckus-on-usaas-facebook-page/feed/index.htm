					<description><![CDATA[Coming from a mom of 15 and 14-year-old boys who both have their own USAA checking and savings accounts (since they were 8), I can personally attest to the theory that making money management cool WORKS.  The minute I put their Mastercard debit cards in their chubby little 8-year-old hands, they&#039;ve wanted to know more.  They&#039;ve come to me unprompted and asked to be shown the family budget.  We recently refinanced our mortgage and made them part of the whole process.  Showing them the difference only 1.5% makes in our monthly mortgage payment blew their minds.  Dad and I have NEVER had &quot;private&quot; financial conversations.  We&#039;ve even asked their opinions.  Let me tell you, if you want to pump up a kid&#039;s self-confidence, ask for their opinion.  Eeek!  I think I&#039;ve gotten off the subject a bit.  In closing, I can also attest to the fact that if you call anything sexy around teenage boys, you will have 100% of their attention and they will do whatever you say.  Like a trance.  Seriously, try it.  Anyway, rock on J.Money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J., I&#039;m an old fart and didn&#039;t think twice about the language in your article.  Some people are over the top in trying to &quot;protect&quot; their kids.

Hey, the most important thing is you got them to read and talk about your writing.  Great job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Angie, you are not alone :)  I discourage the use of the word &quot;sexy&quot; in my house because I think it is confusing for my four pre-teen girls, and I&#039;m not getting anywhere near &quot;pimpin&#039;&quot;.  Heck, we&#039;ve just moved to an area with more visible prostitution and I am trying to figure out how to explain that to my girls.

However, I don&#039;t have any problems with J using it here, because it is totally appropriate in the context of this site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be the lone dissenting voice here - I don&#039;t let my kids read your website.  They don&#039;t have the maturity to understand tongue in cheek usage of words like sexy and pimpin, even if they do have the ability to read the words.  Of course at 5 and 7, they haven&#039;t finished learning about puberty, let alone all the good stuff that comes with being an adult. ;)
When they are older, that&#039;ll be a different story, and I&#039;ll be better able to explain both the normal concept of sexy and pimpin, as well as the context in which you use it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the love guys!  Although I am a bit surprised that not one person has said I&#039;d scare their kids away ;)  There&#039;s gotta be SOMEONE out there that wouldn&#039;t show this to their children right?  No?  Sexy is here to stay? :)

And &lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - that is so cool you have my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/sexy_saver_certificate.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sexy saver certificate&lt;/a&gt; up on your fridge!!!  haha...that totally made my day. Thanks for sharing that.

I&#039;ve also decided to create this for all the haters.  Now everyone can be happy:

					<description><![CDATA[This is too funny! All publicity is good publicity, for sure.  As always, I love your voice and think that it has broad appeal. If parents can’t handle a convo with their kids about this kind of stuff, they’re just lazy, IMO. I can understand shielding them from extreme violence and explicit sex (the former is more traumatic, if you ask me – our culture is messed up)! But if anyone actually READ your posts, they’d get the tongue and cheek references are not at all explicit. It’s just about being current and talking about normally dry subjects in a fun and engaging way. Keep on doing you, J. Money!]]></description>
