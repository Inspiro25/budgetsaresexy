Hey Pat! Unfortunately Pickpocket had to shut their doors as they couldn&#039;t get enough funding, but I love the idea of helping your child pay down their loans like that :) I&#039;m sure there are other tools out there where you could do that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What if a parent wanted to help start paying off a student loan in their child&#039;s name while their child was still in college and not paying back the loan yet? Can a service like Pickpocket help with that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, student loans. Bane of my existence right now.  When I started, I had about $72,000 worth of them. Today, I have just under $40,000 left and if everything goes as planned, they&#039;ll be gone in a year and a half! It&#039;s taking over $2,000/month just to do it! Can&#039;t wait to see what it will feel like to save that money instead of use it to pay off debt.]]></description>

OMG I thought I was the only one on Planet Earth without a FacePlant page...I mean Facebook. No twitter, no SnapChat, no MyOuterSpace either LOL. I think we&#039;re of a dying breed! It&#039;s liberating not being joined at the hip with these distractions. Keeping in touch with family/friends via phone/text or email works for me. I&#039;m in the minority when I go away &#038; leave my computer at home. WiFi? What&#039;s that? Who cares? Not me! I think our catering neighbors are cousins. Too bad my house is on Decatur Rd, LOL have a great Wednesday!]]></description>

We must live in the same neighborhood..ha!  123 Anystreet USA. We have a lady who does catering in ours as well, meals and homemade pies.  Very nice, not pushy or anything but offers the same service.  Not sure if she still does because she would advertise on the neighborhood Facebook page, which I have since Terminated as well.  Terminating all social media...ahhh what a great feeling.  Instead I check in with J and the crew each morning, chat with like minded people like yourself and read off of actual paper bound into a books.  Ah, sweet knowledge.  Have a great day!]]></description>

Had to turn down the Joneses 2 weeks ago. Neighbor caters meals. $12 each. Other neighbors order from her daily/weekly. She kept emailing me. Instead of making an excuse, I told her it&#039;s not in our budget as our 2018 piggy bank is going towards new plumbing in the house (true!), some electrical work &#038; a partial bathroom upgrade (we&#039;re the only ones here that do all the work ourselves). We budget groceries which do NOT include $12 daily catered meals. Will have to check out your recommendation &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot;. Sounds like our current situation. Thanx again for sharing!]]></description>
