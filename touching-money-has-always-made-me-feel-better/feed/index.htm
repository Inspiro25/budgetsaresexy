					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, that sounds like FUN!!!  I can see it now - J the &quot;Vault guy&quot; Money! haha...I could see how it would get old after a while though.  Unless it was your OWN money, of course ;)

I like the way you think about spending cash too.  It doesn&#039;t work for me that way all the time, but I enjoy hearing how people manage their money so differently, and the reasons behind it.  So thx for sharing!

@Kevin@OutOfYourRut - &quot;Maybe it’s that in a cyber/virtual world, anything real, anything tangible, anything with physical substance, seems almost novel.&quot;  Totally!  That&#039;s a great point actually, hadn&#039;t ever thought about that before... physical IS more &quot;real&quot; in that way.  I dig it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a bank teller for years and when I was at work, it had no affect on me.  I was even the vault teller for awhile and was in charge of $300,000 in cash on any given day.  You do grow immune to it when you work with hundreds of thousands of dollars every day, it almost becomes like Monopoly money.

However, the money in my own wallet is a different story.  I feel SO much better when I make a purchase with cash versus when I make a purchase with my debit card or a credit card.  I have no idea why, but it&#039;s nice knowing that I bought it with cold hard cash and it&#039;s 100% paid off, no worrying about it clearing my bank account or God forbid they accidentally charge me twice for the purchase.  No need to worry about getting that credit card paid off in full by the due date.  Cash is just very... liberating.  No strings attached.  You paid for it, it&#039;s yours, no plastic involved.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a solid argument for transacting at least some of your business in cash!

Maybe it&#039;s that in a cyber/virtual world, anything real, anything tangible, anything with physical substance, seems almost novel.  Think back to when you were a kid, and coins felt more like money than dollar bills; why? To a kid, coins are real, and paper money is just paper!  You can stack coins, flip them or play heads or tails--you can&#039;t do any of that with paper bills.

A couple of years ago when the banking situation was looking less than solid, how many adults pulled some money out of the bank and held it in cash?  There were posts about it all over the web and even in the MSM.  There&#039;s something about being able to see it, feel it and even smell it that seems more real than numbers on a computer screen or on a bank statment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;David&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah dude. I get a nice warm feeling when I&#039;m handling other people&#039;s money too!  Very interesting study for sure - glad you enjoy this stuff :) Gets us to think for a bit, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt; - Really?  That Scrooge must be a popular guy ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Keith @ LifeTuner&lt;/b&gt; - I bet if we all pull our money together we could make this vault happen?!
@&lt;b&gt;Brandi&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahaha....indeed my friend.
@&lt;b&gt;whitney&lt;/b&gt; - OH yeah, how does this affect bank tellers? That&#039;s a good one...I wonder if all of your teller friends feel the same way too?  I guess unless they&#039;re smiling and happy all the time this doesn&#039;t work ;)  And I&#039;ve been to a lot of banks this week - they didn&#039;t seem so excited.
@&lt;b&gt;lenciB&lt;/b&gt; - They&#039;re on fire today :)
@&lt;b&gt;Young Mogul&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you&#039;ve gotta spice it up every now and then, right?  Esp when it comes to finance...usually a pretty bland topic.
@&lt;b&gt;Stella&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD POINT!!!  *that* study is freakin&#039; crazy too...imagine that?  the odds that a bill in your pocket right now has traces of cocaine on it?  insane...if it&#039;s true.  Kinda hard to believe there are that many druggies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I get happy looking at a large balance in my checking or savings account, but I can&#039;t say that a wad of bills does much for me.  I usually have as little cash as possible on me--it&#039;s just not very convenient.

(As for wallowing around in a pile of it, J. Money--just remember that recent study that showed 4 out of 5 bills had traces of cocaine on it...and keep in mind where the other end of the bill has been.  Yikes!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm...that&#039;s a really weird study. The only pain I&#039;ve ever associated with money is the physical pain it causes me to give it to someone else :)]]></description>
