Dang, that&#039;s harsh - sorry to hear :( You guys are on the right track now researching and reading $$$ blogs though! This stuff takes a lot of time and patience, but it&#039;s definitely worth the pay off so I hope you guys keep on going. (And hopefully she&#039;s off the utility bill now!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My sister was screwed when she was kicked out of an apartment but they didn&#039;t take her name off of one of the utility bills. She looked at her credit score a year later, never having heard anything about still being on the bill (I know it&#039;s her fault but that&#039;s not at issue here) and her credit score was at rock bottom. (and this has been 5 years ago so I assume all statutes of limitations have lapsed) Her credit is so bad she can&#039;t even get approval to take out a credit card, so there&#039;s no way for her to build it back up. I&#039;m going to help her set one of these up, unless another reader has a better idea for her. Anybody?]]></description>

Damn, sorry to hear that man. I feel like there has to be other stuff going on for that to happen? Have you reached out to them and inquired (and also paid everything on time?)

I wouldn&#039;t lead with the &quot;sue these bastards&quot; part though - probably won&#039;t get them to want to help you ;)

PS: I left this comment in so others can see and decide for themselves if it&#039;s worth researching or not, so thanks for stopping by!, but I had to delete all the others where you were saying the same thing and blowing up the thread here.. I think one comment gets your point across just fine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you have any money saved you can do this yourself through a bank.  When I thought I wanted to buy a new house, my credit score was zero but I had money in the bank.  So, put some money in a savings account and borrowed from myself with a secured loan using the savings account as collateral.  Costs were around $50 for an 18-month loan but it helped me get a credit score.  When it was all said and done, I decided not to go in debt and I had paid myself a nice little chunk of change.  This might be a handy tool for &quot;tricking&quot; yourself into saving.]]></description>

I agree it&#039;s overblown, but unfort if you have bad credit or even no credit it&#039;ll still hurt you for the times you DO need it :( And mostly in the beginning stages of your life before you finally master it all (hopefully!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The most terrifying thing to me is the interest rate. I don&#039;t even want to pay 1%, let alone 10 to 15%. I also believe the whole concept of credit is overblown in our society. It is not something that is really needed and it should be rarely used. Only in the last 50 or so years has it been used on a massive scale. Before that we paid cash for everything unless an extreme emergency came around. Now a days we use if for everything, hence why the world is now 150 trillion in debt. Moral of the story is, it seems like extreme measures for something you don&#039;t even need.]]></description>
