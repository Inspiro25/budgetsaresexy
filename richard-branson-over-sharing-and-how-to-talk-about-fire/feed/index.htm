					<description><![CDATA[I have definitely overshared on more than one occasion.  After decades of grinding along financially, I&#039;m finally hitting some big milestones and it&#039;s way too easy to get overly enthusiastic and want to share it with others.

Around Christmas, I was telling one of my neighbors about my recent successes and I realized by the look on his face that he wasn&#039;t doing so well.  This really bummed me out, because I&#039;m trying to encourage people to get ahead, not make them feel bad for slipping behind.  I&#039;m sure it seems like bragging to others, as well.

I learned my lesson and I now try to keep my celebrations to myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I&#039;ve found is that if people think you have money they will not be interested in your opinions about how they should handle their money.  Because you are &quot;rich&quot; you can&#039;t possibly relate to those who are struggling.  And in fact if you continue to try you&#039;ll come across as patronizing them.  Maybe if you&#039;ve pulled off the stealth wealth thing you still could share some information, but it was out of the question for me because I was the big boss of the biggest employer in the region and so naturally everyone knew I was &quot;rich&quot;.  Its more fun now as an anonymous blogger because nobody knows who I am and its OK for me to have an opinion.  But in my real life if I shared even a little of my financial dreams it was always TMI!]]></description>

What a weird question for them to ask! I would have told them I had 6 wives, and also a few husbands. You know, just to confuse them. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stories to learn from. I had no idea Branson had botched a deal that way. In the end, I mean, the investors lost out BIG TIME by passing on the opportunity to work with an amazing genius like Richard Branson. 


I usually dislike giving more information than necessary. I remember my insurance company would ask me all sorts of nosy questions like &quot;do you have a gf?&quot; etc. I promptly ended the call and went with their competitor.]]></description>

Sometimes the best interviews are when you keep your mouth shut the whole time (and ask THEM questions). Cheers Jason, have a great week my friend!]]></description>

Haha! Yep, a blog is a good place to ramble, rant, and organize your thoughts. Also it&#039;s helping people out there that are seeking the knowledge, vs. don&#039;t want to learn.

Ps. you don&#039;t need to ask your co-workers what their NW is. Just look at their eating/driving/dressing habits and you might be able to guess :)]]></description>

That&#039;s awesome! Thank you for what you do! My wife also is an educator (high school) and stuffs in little money lessons and things into her math and science classes. It&#039;s definitely easier to teach when people are already in a learning environment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Never give people more information than what they ask for.&quot; 

Joel -- what a great topic and mantra here. And another critical situation this couldn&#039;t be more true for is during job interviews -- I&#039;ve learned this the hard way. When you are asked a question in a job interview just be brief and to the point -- no need to regurgitate your entire LinkedIn profile! 

Thanks for this blog -- such a valuable reminder that this advice can be used in many different situations in our lives.
