					<description><![CDATA[98% - we live in NYC, so it doesn&#039;t feel like much at all.  We don&#039;t live extravagantly and live below our means (most of the time).  Only debt we have is our primary home&#039;s mortgage, an investment property&#039;s mortgage &#038; a couple thousand left for my student loan.  

Our earning power will continue to grow, but since my husband is in the entertainment biz, his income fluctuates and is undependable.  We&#039;re not strapped, but still think several times before laying down $ for anything substantial.  For example, we finally got a new coffee table...took us 3 years!  Before this, we were using a slab of old pine resting unsteadily on top of some rusted metal thingy....don&#039;t even remember where we found it....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[According to the Motley Fool, most of us in the United States ARE in the top 1%...of the world. You only need an income of $34,000 or so to qualify. It&#039;s all relative!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;too funny&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah I&#039;m super curious too :)  Maybe he&#039;ll stop on back and share?  I was gonna guess startup or full-time blogger (hah!) but he said he was an employee... though some of my blogger friends have employees too. It&#039;s a riddle wrapped in a conundrum!
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah - there&#039;s a lot of junk out there.  Is Craigslist big in your area?  I used to find some pretty interesting gigs in their &quot;etc&quot; section.  It, too, is filled with 99% junk, but every now and then you find a gem and can&#039;t believe someone would pay you for whatever they&#039;re asking of you. Though mainly they&#039;re one-offs.  Maybe check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ways-to-make-money/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Side Hustle Series&lt;/a&gt;!  In particular, the one that&#039;s about to drop tomorrow ;)  You&#039;ll get a kick out of it... and you can DEF do that at home, though probably not with your children listening.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eh, we&#039;re hoping for #2 and as someone already mentioned the outrageous daycare costs, there&#039;s no way we could afford daycare for 2.  So I&#039;ll stay home, my salary wouldn&#039;t even cover daycare for 2!  Right now my son is in 3 days a week part-time and it&#039;s costing us nearly $1000/month.  I looked at those work-at-home jobs, but damn, most are just scams and pyramid schemes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious what 99 (and wife) do. I don&#039;t know of many non-executive level, non-finance, positions that pay that well at companies (usually it is corp development/executive positions that pay well). And you aren&#039;t in medicine or law (based on your educations). Consulting with MBA&#039;s? Even my friends that work at MBB with HWS MBA&#039;s don&#039;t make that much. I&#039;m guessing sales. 

My wife is a teacher at 74th percentile herself. Between we each have two master&#039;s degrees and two unfinished doctorates.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;ll be interesting to see how long it&#039;ll go, tha&#039;s for sure.  And even moreso if anything POSITIVE comes out of it!  While I&#039;m still pretty hesitant to choose a side, I do wish there to be a good outcome from it all.  Guess we&#039;ll find out soon :)  Or never.
@&lt;b&gt;99&lt;/b&gt; - Nope!  I would personally like to shake your hands and tell you face-to-face how AWESOME that is! :)  You&#039;re taking advantage of what America offers us: freedom. Freedom to work however much, or litle, you&#039;d like according to what outcome you&#039;re shooting for.  Congrats on all your success so far!
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Right?
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - I think that&#039;s the other 99%&#039;s dreams too to be honest with you ;)  The 1%, as many have already voiced, is NOT only corporations or their CEOS.
@&lt;b&gt;iwantmyhdbflat&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Really? That&#039;s interesting where these things are popping up :) Thanks for sharing.
@&lt;b&gt;Linsey Knerl&lt;/b&gt; - WOWWWWW  I think my DOOR cost $80,000! haha... good for you :)  You def. know how to put priorities first - I just bought on a whim.
@&lt;b&gt;FB&lt;/b&gt; - Man, those daycare costs are off the chain.  I wonder if it&#039;s that expensive all over the place, or just your area for some reason?  I&#039;m guessing all over, but I don&#039;t have kids so who knows ;) That IS gonna be a great bump once that&#039;s cut out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[81% between the wife and I. We have no debt minus the house. We both contribute our company match to our 401k. Our biggest expense is actually daycare for 2 at 750 a month more than our house payment. Once that is gone in a couple years our savings should take off. Honestly it feels kind of weird to have only 19% of Americans make more. I expected us to be lower in the chain.]]></description>
