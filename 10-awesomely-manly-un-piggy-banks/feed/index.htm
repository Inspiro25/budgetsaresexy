					<description><![CDATA[I think the coolest &quot;piggy bank&quot; I have seen is an antique brass cash register.  I imagine looking forward to the the ca-ching every time I added to my stash would be incentive to skip that trinket or &quot;drink-it&quot; and save my money instead. :)

My kids each have a bank that displays an increasing digital total as coins are added in the lid.  Not very sexy looking, but they have fun with it.
