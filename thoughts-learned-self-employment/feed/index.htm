Hey Katherine :) I&#039;ve actually tried it once before, but only lasted a couple of months... mainly because I had to commute a little to get there and didn&#039;t like waiting to work in the mornings. I&#039;d be up for trying again if it were somewhere close by, like walking distance, but currently no places like that around here.  Excellent idea though! Thanks for stopping by :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this! My husband is self-employed, and sometimes I get really jealous of him, because he works way fewer hours than me, and can go snowboarding whenever he wants. But, I also like the stability of my boring 9-5 job, and would probably be an anxious nutcase if I were self-employed. Your reflections tell both sides of the story! Good luck to you in 2014! :)]]></description>

Wow... thats an interesting link J!
I&#039;ve had pangs of that over the years... how weird that there is a syndrome named after it (although I guess there is one for everything nowadays!)

Looking at your list, I would definitely take the rough on there to get the smooth, so hopefully I&#039;ll be somewhere, anywhere near where you are in 3 years also! You are right though it&#039;s clearly not for everyone!

Good luck for future learnings!]]></description>
