					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Haha, I asked about the iPod too... and &quot;unauthorized racing&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
Here&#039;s what she sent back :)

Unauthorized pacing is when someone not in the race is riding/running next to you.  Generally speaking, they usually are a safety hazard.  You know, the significant other with the camera phone that knocks another racer over. 

Ipods?  As handy as they are, they are a HUGE safety hazard.  You can&#039;t hear someone saying on your left with the Thump-thump-thump going.  Can&#039;t hear ambulances, can&#039;t here peeps calling you.  So they are a no no on the course....

&lt;strong&gt;As for pay, here&#039;s what she told me:&lt;/strong&gt;

Once you get promoted to Cat 3 (with approval) base for a regular official, not head referee, pay is $90 per event. Then add in mileage which is about .51 a mile.  And a hotel if you need it....]]></description>
