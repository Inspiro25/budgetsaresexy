glad you&#039;re enjoying the site! I haven&#039;t blogged about the market crash specifically, I just know it&#039;ll come and at that point we all gotta be prepared :) we don&#039;t do many case studies on the site, but if you wanna share it in our forums I&#039;m sure people will chime in with thoughts?

					<description><![CDATA[I love seeing graphs up and to the right, and that&#039;s exactly what a net worth calculation should look like.

But I&#039;m glad you&#039;re always mentally prepared for a market crash. As I tell friends and family, the p/e ratio of the market right now is nuts. Companies are returning about 2-3% of their capital in returns right now, which is super low. Honestly I&#039;m not sure if the market will correct itself for awhile. Everyone is told to pump their money into the S&#038;P500, which means they aren&#039;t looking at metrics like p/e while investing. The only criteria is &quot;big&quot;. If something comes along and causes people to divest in their 401ks, like job shortages or housing market crashes or something, then we might start to see a dip and a panic as a result.]]></description>

Hope to see you back soon! Definitely subscribing to your site as well. As J mentioned, you do pair nicely as one of you has hit your early retirement goal and the other is on the way.]]></description>

I have nooooooooo idea what an IPS is, but as of now I still plan on sticking 100% into the total index fund w/ VTSAX regardless of what the market does. Then maybe in a decade (or two?) as I get older, diversifying more and picking up bond and/or international indexes as well.

I do like a lot of the 3-fund portfolio options people do with Vanguard indexes, just right now trying to be as aggressive as possible since I don&#039;t plan on touch it for many years to come.]]></description>
