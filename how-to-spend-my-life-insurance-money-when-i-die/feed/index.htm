					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s awesome how you make even morbid subjects like death and well, life insurance so funny, witty and interesting that reading through your posts becomes a breeze. No, I am not ass-licking but I really was smiling through it.
I wish I could do it but in all probability the husband will either get emotional or not take it seriously so maybe later. Thanks for the idea though :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Courageous and genius!

We brefily talked about which family members we would want to raise our kids if something were to happened to both of us. You make a good case about sorting out the financial part when I go or both of us. 

I think it&#039;s time we make our plans clear. This was worth the read. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why did this make me cry???? 

This is definitely a great thing to do for sure but I&#039;d be crying the entire time I write my letter. I am an emotional wreck of a person. LOL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great financial activity to do and worth it, but you&#039;ll never know if she will actually do those things, but you gotta have faith(like George Michael.) If it were me I would bump it up or get supplemental insurance cause 300K cant really replace much income, its only like 12K a year investment income. I would tell her to place all of it in a brokerage, with a checking account feature attached to it. If your a PF household you already have an emergency account. Plus I thought simple is best. Once the whole chunk grows, you can allocate it in the future to kids or to whomever. No need to separate it out, as long as she is aware a specific amount is going to kids. Eventually it will all go to kids too( not being morbid, you started it J.)]]></description>
