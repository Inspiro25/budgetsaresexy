I like that a lot :) So very true - lots of this stuff just needs *time*. You implement the game plan and then let time take care of the rest! Easier said than done, but still very much true :) Thanks for sharing, my friend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When i start feeling like I&#039;m not getting anywhere and everything takes too long, i stop focusing on my finances and just live my life. If it&#039;s going to take a long time, I&#039;ll just leave it to do it&#039;s thing for a while. This only works because my budget and income and expenses are pretty steady. As long as i keep track of my fun money and don&#039;t eat out too much, everything just takes care of itself, except a couple bills once a month. Took me many years before i could do that, but it&#039;s nice to not worry so much about it for a while.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your suggestions to break bigger financial goals into smaller pieces and to reward yourself for financial accomplishments are golden. It may seem like basic advice, but it usually does the trick for my motivation. Sometimes if the grind gets really tough, I consider &quot;treating myself&quot; just because, obviously keeping within my budget.]]></description>
