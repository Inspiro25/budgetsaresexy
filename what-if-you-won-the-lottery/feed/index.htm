					<description><![CDATA[Would You Still Work? Yes. I would finish out my government career.  I wouldn&#039;t throw that away. I work home a few days, so it wouldn&#039;t make a difference.

Would You Care What People Think? No.  

Would You Share With Your Family? Mom and niece and two cousins only.  Everyone else will be on a case by case basis. Anyone else with their hands out will get their hands slapped.

Would You Still Live on a Budget? Of course. It could all go if I didn&#039;t.  People need to be careful about that stuff because it adds up.

Would You Splurge? Yes.  I would buy me, my mother and my niece houses if the amount was high enough.  I&#039;m keeping my car.

*BONUS* Would you take it over time, or in one lump sum?  Let’s say either $200 Mil over 30 years, or $100 Mil (taxes out and everything) all at once in one lump sum? Lump sum.  The interest alone on the amount could make it grow depending on how it is invested.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I like it.  That Audi R8 is hot!!  I love the idea of being a TV/Movie extra too - it&#039;s one of the jobs I&#039;ve always wanted to try too, esp when I was living in NYC for a couple of years.  It&#039;s perfect for those who a) don&#039;t really desire to be a huge movie star and b) don&#039;t need the money, haha...  if you ever strike it big, I want to go with you on one of the movie sets!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) Would I still work...Maybe part time, but I would definitely do volunteer work, missionary work, and some work as a TV/movie extra or commercials because I like acting and voice- over.

2) Would I care what other people think....NO! 

3) Would I share with my family....Of course I would share with my family; my mom, dad, brother, and my kids. They all would be well taken care of. 

4) Would I still live on a budget....Yes I would live on a budget, but a larger one obviously. We are talking about $100 million! I would seek guidance from the very best financial consultants.

5) Would I splurge....Yes indeed! I would buy a 2 bdrm condo ($350K) in the city and a 4 bdrm gated luxury home ($900K) in the suburbs. I live in Texas so I get more for my money here. I would also payoff mortgages or buy houses for my mom, dad, and brother. I would then buy an Audi R8 V10 and SUV for myself and cars for my parents and brother. Of course I would set up college funds for my kids&#039; education, but taking them on fabulous vacations at least twice a year would be a priority as well...

6) Bonus....I would take the lump sum in a heartbeat! Life is too short...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, exactly!  No winning w/out playing :)  And I love your lingerie idea too, though I&#039;m kinda skewed being a guy and all ;)  And I agree w/ feeling awkward, but I don&#039;t think you can keep it a secret anyways since it goes public and you have to have your picture taken, and name out there, and everything w/ one of those big fake checks ;)  Probably to prove to the public that Yes, people DO actually win.
@&lt;b&gt;threadbndr&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, that&#039;s so nice of you!  1 year? That&#039;s a LONG time! Haha... good for you though, we need more like you in this world :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would You Still Work? - yes, but only until my manager could get a replacement in and I could get them trained, a year would be good.
Would You Care What People Think? - I&#039;d worry about being taken advantage of or threatened
Would You Share With Your Family? - of course.  I&#039;d set up a charitable foundation with my son and my sister to figure out ways to invest and share it, but reserve enough to pay us each a nice salary from here on out.  If we are careful, nobody should have to do more than they want to.
Would You Still Live on a Budget? - have to, just with a lot more zeros on the end, and a good advisor instead of going it alone
Would You Splurge? - a bit - some house upgrades for sure.
*BONUS* Would you take it over time, or in one lump sum?  Let’s say either $200 Mil over 30 years, or $100 Mil (taxes out and everything) all at once in one lump sum? - torn on this one - I&#039;d have the advisor run the numbers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d also like to add that I&#039;ve had this discussion with my husband numerous times.  I think I&#039;d feel very uncomfortable with everyone knowing I have so much money.  I&#039;d feel very awkward.  I think I&#039;d try to keep it a secret for awhile, but even that would be hard.  How do you explain that you can suddenly quit your job and travel all over the world and buy a new house and cars?  Like Melissa said up above, she&#039;d be afraid people would take advantage and always expect her to pay for stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would You Still Work?  I would start my own business.  I want to own an upscale lingerie boutique.  I&#039;d have the finances to make that a reality.  I&#039;d quit my regular 8-6 job.  I also would like to go to school to learn French and Italian in my spare time.
Would You Care What People Think?  People I love, yes.  
Would You Share With Your Family?  Of course.  I&#039;d pay off my parents and my in-laws mortgages and cars and give them enough cash to sit on for awhile.  I&#039;d help my brother-in-laws with their student loans and what not.  I&#039;d also pay for my younger sister&#039;s college education.
Would You Still Live on a Budget? Of course!  I&#039;d hire a financial advisor as well.
Would You Splurge? Yes.  I want a Louis Vuitton handbag and some kind of luxury car (BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, or Audi).  I wouldn&#039;t go Ferrari or anything crazy.  I&#039;d buy a large comfortable home, but nothing extreme like 12 bedrooms or 15 bathrooms.  I want something with a big fenced backyard so I can foster animals that have been abused and abandoned.  I&#039;d also TRAVEL all over the world and take my friends and family with me on one big awesome European vacation.  And I&#039;d buy my husband the Cadillac of his dreams.  
*BONUS* Would you take it over time, or in one lump sum?   One lump sum.  I heard that if you take it over time you have to pay income tax on that money every year.  I think I&#039;d rather take the taxes on it once and minimize the headache.

This reminds me that maybe I need to start playing the lottery.  Lol.  Can&#039;t win if you don&#039;t play!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, you win for the most creative answers ;)  Love &#039;em.   Especially that fake company route!  I&#039;m gonna have to remember that one.

					<description><![CDATA[Would You Still Work?
Hell yeah! I&#039;d just work on projects that interest me. Maybe fork over some cash to worthwhile causes like supporting our troops.

Would You Care What People Think?
I&#039;m sorry, I wasn&#039;t paying attention. What did you just mutter something under breath?

Would You Share With Your Family?
Yes. I would create a fake company that miraculously chose them to win some big-ticket items and AMC theatre gift cards. I like movies.

Would You Still Live on a Budget?
I&#039;d keep it under 200 million minus taxes. I may set aside 1 million dollars for the each offspring I have officially acknowledged. I might put some random chunks of cash in stable countries. Are there any left?

Would You Splurge?
Rule of thumb: when you get a cash windfall, take 10% from the top and put into a &quot;splurge&quot; account. That&#039;s what I&#039;d do. I am saving the rest for prime real estate in Cuba when Fidel loses all his lives. He&#039;d probably give Mario and Luigi a challenge in 1-ups. B@stard.

*BONUS* 
Lump it like a Krab meat patty. Time value of money means a dollar is worth more today than tomorrow. Do you really want politicians and government &quot;managing&quot; your winnings? Besides, I don&#039;t want any weird economic ideas involving my &quot;winning&quot;(Charlie Sheen voice activated) being created for paying back China all the money we owe them. I&#039;m just saying.

Great post man!]]></description>
