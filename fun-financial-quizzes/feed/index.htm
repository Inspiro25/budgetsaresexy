					<description><![CDATA[Does the fact I am doing this in 2018 tell anyone something? 52 and while I am not in TOO much debt (car loan),,, IF something happened, it would pretty much all end.. IF I died, my wife and kids will be living high on the hog.. I have so much life insurance for them it is unreal.. HOwever, if I am only hurt for awhile, we could potentially lose everything.. I DO play reseller, so there is that and I do very well with it along with full time job.. I just have a bad habit of spending everything I make. or let bills go until I get the threat and then I pay them..which kills the &quot;savings&quot; I thought I had!! So yeah Mcaulay  Culkin away..(Although I do check my credit score as often as I need to)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MC Hammer here! Does this mean I get to rock the shiny pants? I don&#039;t check my credit score ever, because it&#039;s always good. Does that make me a Warren Buffet in Hammer pants? BTW still love the blog! Thanks for keeping it real and being real in the struggle!]]></description>
