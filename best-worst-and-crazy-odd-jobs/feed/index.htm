That&#039;s pretty interesting actually. I guess like other professions too like being an executive assistant to a mom and pop business vs mogul or something.]]></description>

I think CE&#039;s who work in the oil industry drive that number up. There&#039;s a huge difference between water resources/transportation engineers and structural engineers. 

All the same degree.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$200 a day for being a Saddam Hussein look-alike? Yep, that&#039;s officially the craziest job that I&#039;ve ever read about. .... I&#039;m surprised that veteranians have such a tough time paying back student loans. Because they have doctor-level training, I imagined that they&#039;d enjoy higher pay. Like you, I once used to think that I wanted to be a vet ... but it turns out that I just enjoy playing with dogs and cats, not operating on them. :-)]]></description>

The numbers came from an article on Yahoo Finance:

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-worst-careers-debt-172829721.html

I, too, stopped following my dream of going into advertising shortly after college ;) Granted it was only a half-baked dream of mine (I thought I&#039;d roll up into NYC and snag a (paying) job 1-2-3. Hah!), but it was a fun one while it lasted. Ended up working for the airlines and traveling the world instead for a year or so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woooooffff (pun intended) 28 yrs to pay off Vet school, holy cow would have never thought it would be that bad. Where did you get that advertising figure btw? I graduated with an advertising degree, and that certainly seems way higher then the figures we were quoted. (note I didn&#039;t follow my dreams and ended up working for the man at a cubicled government job)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder how loosely they&#039;re defining &quot;economist&quot; there. From my interaction with them, many of the people who carry that title have PhD&#039;s. Not that there is anything wrong with getting a PhD, but you better want more than to pay off loans quickly if you&#039;re going to put that much effort into it.]]></description>
