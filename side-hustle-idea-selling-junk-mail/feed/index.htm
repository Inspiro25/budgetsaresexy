Rock on! Just don&#039;t forget to START any of them once you figure out which are the most promising! Researching is great, but just jumping in could be even better :) Specifically w/ the dog sitting one - plenty of people do those on the fly! Throw up a few ads and try landing your 1st client and then see how it goes from there...

RE: Signing up to the site here, yup! You can get my blog posts emailed to you if you&#039;d like:&lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/subscribe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/subscribe/&lt;/a&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-idea-selling-junk-mail/#comment-234537&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the reply J$!  I know your busy with managing this site, doing side hustles and answering questions like mine, but I really appreciate your time spent on me.  Thank you so much and sorry for the late reply!  I&#039;ll do better next time  :)

I&#039;m actually one step ahead of you there, I read through your entire list in 1 day, coffee&#039;s my friend.  So far I&#039;m looking into developing a Junk mail business, SIM card business, Pet sitting business and a yoga instructor profession for now.  

Junk mail:  trail and error with random stores and restaurants

SIM cards:  still trying to understand what the heck a SIM card is and how figuring out location specifics.  I&#039;ve found SIM card wholesalers who&#039;s willing to sell for $3 and less, but again, still in the research/learn stage.

Pet Sitting:  Developing business model, business plan and understanding the legalities of starting up a business in general.  I don&#039;t know if I can just come up with a random name, and put myself on Kijiji offering my services.  Probably not that simple, but advice from anyone with experience is welcomed.

Yoga instructor:  I know a woman who&#039;s very well known in my area and going to attend one of her classes for the sole purpose of asking her questions on what companies have legit certifications, go to them, research, save money, and sign up for their classes/courses.

That&#039;s all I got for now.  I&#039;ll update somehow as time goes on.  

Again, thanks for creating that article series J$, never would of developed the money-making/business mindset otherwise.  Is there a way to sign up on this website?  I see people with pictures, while mine is blank.  Anyway, keep up the great work!]]></description>

Haha.... glad you liked it man :) Will try and ping my old friend here and see if she&#039;s still around - haven&#039;t chatted with her in quite some time!

Regardless, def. sounds like you have the energy and passion to rock some side hustle action over there... Here&#039;s a list of 60+ others you can look into as well if you haven&#039;t seen already - no one way to make that $$!

					<description><![CDATA[THANK YOU J. Money and Lil Vee!

Like everyone, I&#039;ve never seen such a creative idea of making money.  I definitely am going to use this method for my future endeavors, and it never would of been possible if J. Money didn&#039;t create this website and Lil Vee never stumbled upon it.  For such a near impossible coincidence to occur, that eventually was made possible, is amazing in itself.  You guys are awesome, pat yourselves on the back, you&#039;ve earned it!  :)

In regards to this method, I was wondering how do you get gift card coupons in your mailbox in the first place?  The only junk mail I&#039;ve ever had was magazines, so I am unfamiliar with such things.  Is going to stores like Home Depot, Rona, etc, and signing up for an account, while wanting to receive promotions, all it takes to receives these coupons?  

Can someone explain how to do this please?

I want to take this to the next level and mold this method into a business.  Like you said J. Money, getting barraged with junk mail, BUT, with the addition of Virtual Assistants and Assistants, or heck, a local high school student.  Pay them a certain amount of money, either per hour or per card, to take each coupon gift card, make pictures, write descriptions, and setup it all up on Ebay.  Repeat the process till every card is uploaded, and wait once I get more for them to do.  Then develop a software or something(I&#039;m unfamiliar with Ebay, so if Ebay has this already, disregard this), to send you daily notifications and notifications a few hours before the auction closes.  Watch the money flowing in.

I&#039;m probably ranting around here, but I think this would work with some minor tweakings here and there.  Can someone explain how to first get these gift card coupons coming to your mailbox?  Thanks in advance!]]></description>
