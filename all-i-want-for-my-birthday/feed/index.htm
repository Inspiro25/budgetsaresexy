					<description><![CDATA[It has kept me entertained these past two weeks or so reading almost every single post since day one!  And it has kick started some debt pay down that I have told myself I had to get to for a very long time now.  I like seeing all the bumps and bruises along with the wins.  Congrats on having such a long running and informative blog.]]></description>

That post was one of my all-time favorite posts to write on this site in 7 years. So I&#039;m glad it resonated with you as it&#039;s helped me big time too! And it really is true - any of us can afford fancy cool stuff (or at least throw it on a credit card/take out a loan), but if it&#039;s not our top priorities in life, well, it&#039;ll just have to wait until we&#039;re wealthy enough to have it all :)

And well done with your savings and credit card goals/successes too. Imagine when both have been hit? The opportunities are endless!]]></description>

Wow - what a testimonial, thank you!! That makes me so happy!

The color is actually my favorite thing about it personally :) Well, that and the &quot;net worth&quot; area that I included over time... It&#039;s actually based on another spreadsheet I came across 7 years ago but I couldn&#039;t ever go back and find it to properly give credit... I&#039;ve pretty much changed the entire thing since then, but it was the colors of it that gave me the idea!

Anyways, I&#039;m glad you took the time to leave a comment. It really does mean a lot.]]></description>

YAY!!!!! 

Keep going friend - you&#039;re doing so good!! (And I get inspired just by seeing your smiley face icon, haha... I know I&#039;ve told you that before, but it brightens my day so easily! And then your words just add to it :))

Here&#039;s to a successful new year for both of us!]]></description>

Awwww, well thank you Tyler - that really means a lot :) And I&#039;m glad you&#039;re hustling through and pushing yourself to get rid of that debt! It&#039;s not an easy thing to do, but you&#039;ll be out of it one day and then IT&#039;S ON!

I&#039;m so glad you like the tips/humor on the site - I do my best to spice it up :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Anyone Can Buy That article you wrote really struck a chord with me. It has really helped me with that devil Envy and the wanting of things that I feel too often. I liked what you blogged about a few weeks ago, too, about people wanting money or things. Right now I want to keep the money so that eventually I can have things that I actually need or care about, like travel and a decent standard of living when I&#039;m old, as opposed to &#039;stuff&#039; now. Anyway, often when I see something I&#039;d like, I just say to myself that I could buy it or afford it if I wanted to, but then couldn&#039;t do other things that I&#039;ve decided are more important, and BOOM! I don&#039;t feel that desire anymore. We have an emergency fund ($4700), are saving cash to pay for our son&#039;s braces, and then will come paying down the credit card ($6000), increasing the emergency fund to $10,000, and then taking the money we&#039;ve been using for that and doing the 401K thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your particular budget spreadsheet has helped me so much! Thank you! The top reason it has been more useful than the other budgets I have tried or use is because it: 1)easily adjusts for variations in income 2)is easy on the eyes because the particular tracking areas are separated nicely and 3) it also has space for the actual figures. I have tried various budgeting mechanisms and yours has helped me far more than any other. I don&#039;t usually write many online comments but than you again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy belated birthday J$! I hope you and the $ family had a wonderful Christmas and Happy New year. I posted before but it looks like the internet happened. :) You have made me think, made me laugh and then think some more. I truly enjoy your &quot;voice,&quot; and have learned the importance of being true to it and I am working on letting mine show through. You have inspired and motivated me to move...not just my stuff (think ebay and craigslist) but with my dreams. Thank you. 2015 is gonna rock! It already is. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J$! 

I am a graduate student, saddled with quite a bit of debt from my private undergraduate education and I am working hard to pay it off while getting more knowledge. I&#039;ve felt a lot of stress and pressure because of my immense student loan debt burden, but I have found hope and joy (lots o&#039; laughs) from your blog, learning about how to change my outlook on the blessings I have and the opportunities that are in front of me.

I love your optimism and faith, and I really love how you keep it real and fresh. You share tips I&#039;ve never heard of, and I have become pretty well-versed in personal finance in the last few years. 

Thanks for being awesome :D]]></description>
