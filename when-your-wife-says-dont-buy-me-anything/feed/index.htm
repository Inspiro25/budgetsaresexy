That&#039;s a cool idea with taking turns covering the bill! I have an aunt who takes us all out to a new &quot;experience&quot; every year (museum, play, tour), and then another aunt who will cover lunch for everyone after that experience every year. It&#039;s been a pretty cool 1-2 punch that also gets us all hanging out together and doing something new :) We&#039;re on like year #7 or 8 now - love it.]]></description>

I haven&#039;t seen that one, haha, but now I want to :) I feel bad throwing them away right away too, so I typically wait a week or so until finally sending them to their resting place... I don&#039;t know why that changes anything, but it does.]]></description>

Remember the Seinfeld episode where he threw away a card minutes after reading it? I at least wait a year before throwing them out ;) I agree, no need to keep them forever, and it&#039;s not like throwing the card out says that I no longer want the card giver in my life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I almost don&#039;t want to receive gifts because when I look at the stuff I have I am overwhelmed with where to store stuff, and we don&#039;t even have that many things at home compared to some people we know, definitely not hoarders by any means. So I told hubby if he&#039;s gonna give me gifts I only want stuff that can be consumed such as toiletries and food (he bought me this cake from South Carolina from an online retailer and it was YUM!!!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My partner and I don&#039;t give gifts to each other because we already have everything we need. All year long we remind each other how lucky we are to have found each other (in midlife) and how happy we are together. 

(Yep, he&#039;s a dude but every day he says stuff like, &quot;Thank you for sharing your life with me&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m so lucky&quot; and &quot;You make my life new again.&quot; Top THAT, all you retailers.)

The only time a gift can show up under the tree* is if there is a stirring tale of thrift attached. 

&quot;That book? It came from the &#039;free&#039; box at the library.&quot;

&quot;That Clark Howard hat? Given to us at the Financial Blogger Conference.&quot;

&quot;That whatever-it-is? It was a quarter at a yard sale.&quot;

And so on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a newer husband, I read the title of this post and three words leapt to mind (in a voice you&#039;ll know): &quot;It&#039;s a trap!&quot;  (It&#039;s too bad I can&#039;t post the Admiral Akbar gif here, because that&#039;s what comes to mind.) 

I&#039;m glad it has worked out for you!]]></description>
