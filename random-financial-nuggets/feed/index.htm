					<description><![CDATA[Random but halfway similar to your currency gift: I was at a gas station and instead of a 75 cent candy/gumball/toy dispenser, it was an old coin dispenser - pretty cool! But unfortunately I didn&#039;t have any change :/ Never seen one like it before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Melissa @ Little House in the Valley&lt;/b&gt; - You got it.  Will post up once it&#039;s in it&#039;s rightful home! :)  Though the only sucky part is we didn&#039;t get to test out the actual sleeper part itself, so I&#039;m PRAYING that part is indeed comfy too.  Though anything is better than our current futon - bleh.
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Good to know!!  Thank you so much, I think we&#039;re gonna seriously look at Amazon too here shortly :)  We&#039;ll probably test one out first in-store, but I like the idea of having it delvered right to your home which is nice. We don&#039;t have a truck or anything which makes all that stuff hard.  Glad you like it so much!!
@&lt;b&gt;Patrice C. Washington&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!!  We need to get some Swarovski crystals all up on it, right? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - I like them a lot - much more cleaner and friendly than the other discount furniture stores we&#039;ve been to.  Only part that sucks at all these places are the crazy pushy salesman.  Our guy wasn&#039;t too bad, but when we went out looking on our own, some other reps tried snatching us up and had to tell them to leave us a lone on many occasions.  But when you find the item you really want, it&#039;s all worth it! :)  Give &#039;em a shot.]]></description>
