Yes, I use the opportunity cost to motivate both my clients and myself! Right now, my hubby and I are super focused on paying off the mortgage. So every time I think about spending money, I ask, &quot;Do I want this more than be mortgage free?&quot; It&#039;s definitely motivating!]]></description>

Yes, pick whichever debt method is most emotionally motivating for you! And isn&#039;t it funny that they are all meteorological terms (snowball, avalanche, volcano)? Maybe we can invent some new ones (tsunami? tornado?), lol!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can also train your self to work up emotions in a beneficial way. I do this by really thinking through the opportunity cost of spending. It helps me to stop enjoying consumption.  when it’s not fun you lose that desire to do it, which makes prudent financial decisions easier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the term and attitude involved in the Volcano method--eliminate the debt that angers you the most. Brilliant. Then again, I love all those cheeky debt terms (https://impersonalfinances.com/debt-avalanche-or-debt-snowball/) haha. Makes a ton of sense from a psychological standpoint, while accomplishing goals financially. There&#039;s a lot of discussion about which debt payment strategy is best, but the real answer is that the best method is whichever one will motivate you to actually pay if off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your volcano method, but I try to apply that to everything. 

I tell people to think of someone coming into your home and your life and ruining the lives of yourself and your loved ones. To think that the person will force you and your loved ones to work and do things they would rather not do. It would be hard not to be angry at that person.

Then I tell those people. &quot;Now imagine that person is a piece of paper, a debt that says you have to pay a certain amount.&quot; Then I say &quot;does that debt deserve any less than your full fury?&quot;

I know that sounds intense, but it works. Plus you were writing about using emotions for finances, you all but invited someone to talk with this intensity.

My wife and I used this to pay off our federal student loans in little more than a year. Then the government told us we still had around $15,000 in student state loans. Do you have any idea of how angry we were about that? To give you an idea, that debt lasted months after we heard of its existence. Not a little more than a year, not a year, just months.

And just fyi I was a PhD student at the time making $27,000 a year before taxes and health insurance. Granted my wife was working too, but for about the same as what I was making.]]></description>
