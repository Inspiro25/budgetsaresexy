					<description><![CDATA[Unbelievable that 1) they would even try to buy a new house, 2) that the bank would consider lending to them, 3) that they have a baby and are that messed up (yet, you need a license to get a dog?), and 4) that there is absolutely no insurance that they won&#039;t do the exact same thing.  In fact, it&#039;s a pretty darn good bet that this situation will lead to a catastrophe!

@&lt;b&gt;Tom&lt;/b&gt; - Haven&#039;t even heard of Real Estate Intervention - is something wrong with me?  LOVE HGTV though....Have seen Home Rules or whatever that&#039;s called - usually it&#039;s a guy who promised his wife he could do something and then quits in the middle of it :) haha... not unlike myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kinda like Real Estate Intervention for finances.

Ever watch that show?!  Freakin awesome!  The people are so taken aback by Mike Aubrey&#039;s assessment of their house value it creates some very awkward and funny situations.

This one couple almost quit mid way through the show.  Actually kick the cameras out, but the mics were still on.  Mike had to say, &quot;well why did you even come on the show?&quot;.

I saw a similar show on either HGTV or DIY TV where they come in and help a family who was in the middle of remodeling, but had to quit due to financial issues.  They most often find that they could actually afford to finish, but are terrible at managing money.  So they help them finish the remodel and make them completly reevaluate their finances.  I think it&#039;s called Home Rules.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup, Gail Vaz-Oxlade is JAMAICAN BAYBEE!  She moved to Canada 3 decades ago, but still goes home.  I can hear it in her accent.  At first it was throwing me off because she sounded so familiar but I just couldn&#039;t figure it out.  Then I could take it anymore because there were words that were unmistakable as a Jamaican accent (money, body, about, dollar) so I had to google her to confirm.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Julie&lt;/b&gt; - Really?  I shall look for it on the ol&#039; On Demand then, thanks!  Seems terribly awesome :)
@&lt;b&gt;Tea&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...you crack me up dude.  And yes you are probably right...
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - Sydney Morning Herald? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Abigail&lt;/b&gt; - I would pay good money to watch that.  As long as the parents weren&#039;t on drugs while the bitch slapping were ocurring ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Falling Into Favor&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...who knows anymore.  It seems common sense &amp; banking has gone amuck.
@&lt;b&gt;Mysti&lt;/b&gt; - That is a brilliant idea!  Everyone would WANT to be there so they get all that money we vote over to them :)  Genius.
@&lt;b&gt;Shelley&lt;/b&gt; - What? She is? That is awesome if you are telling me the truth :)  I should email her and ask...but then again, I don&#039;t want to ruin my chances of her doing a Blogger Showdown here... THAT should be a good one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seriously?  I have no idea how any responsible financial institution would allow such a thing.  

I would watch Financial Intervention, the reality show.  We can combine it with Survivor....the reward challenges can be extra money toward debt.  Tribes vote out the most fiscally irresponsible.  Works for me.

As for the Canadian show, Til Debt Do Us Part.....I do watch that.  I am amazed at some of those people, but I am really doubtful any of them really truly change their ways.  I like Gail though.  She calls them as she sees them.....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You gotta be kidding me! I&#039;m wondering do the banks check on things like that? My ex-boyfriend was scared to get a cell phone since he had defaulted on paying his Verizon bill when he was 16! I&#039;d be scared to submit paperwork for another house!]]></description>
