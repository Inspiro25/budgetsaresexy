					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - SXSW is really cool in that there are TONS of stuff going every hour, so you can pick the ones that relate to you the most, or just depending on your mood ;)  I think everyone should try it out at least once to experience it - kinda inspirational.

@&lt;b&gt;Jason L&lt;/b&gt; - I think you can get one free of their site now! I used it once already and it was pretty cool - emailed me a receipt right after too :)  Gonna blog about it soon...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Talk about timing - I just got off the phone laughing, because of the conversation I had with the gentleman who I *will* be purchasing my oxygen regulator from (for my glass torch) - besides oxygen tanks, regulators, flashback arrestors, hoses and torches, we discussed journalism &#038; the AP style manual, and then got into music - turns out he&#039;s also a jazz musician, and we compared notes on the technical complexity and commercial viability of jazz &#038; classical music versus that of mainstream rock, blues, and C&#038;W. I am still smiling (despite the stress and strain of this past week), and I look forward to spending my money with this person. I *hate* the N-word (net-working - it sounds nasty and impersonal to me, and the visual I have is of a computer network diagram), but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the C-word (connections - building and nurturing human connections - my visual for that is people, holding hands and smiling).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I only came back with one thing - something I thought was damn cool, and that I could potentially use (I had my minimalism hat on the entire trip -- and good thing too cuz crap was flying all over!). I took home one of those Square credit card gadgets that you connect to your iPhone with so you can take your own credit card payments!  SOOOOOOOO coool.  I&#039;m gonna blog about it soon, but here&#039;s the link for anyone interested in getting one too:

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like an amazing time! Tell us about your free swag!

I totally agree on getting to know a person and if you click, the business is that much easier to endorse/support. I hate when people are all sales pitch with little sincerity.]]></description>
