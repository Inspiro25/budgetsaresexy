					<description><![CDATA[not something I would usually post for, but since I have noticed all the people in my gym displaying there&#039;s, I thought I would drop my thought on them.  I have one.  It&#039;s small, not for show and has a personal meaning.  I know that cannot be said about the popular fad that has everyone running off to mark themselves up.  Tattoos are NOT art.  Expressive- yes, Creative-maybe, Art-NO.  If skin made such a great canvas there would be a lot of very expensive, well preserved dead people hanging in museums.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOOK AT ALL YOU TATTOO PEOPLE!! YES! Wow I&#039;m surprised how many of you have commented so far, this is awesome :)

@&lt;b&gt;Shovellicious&lt;/b&gt; - No savings while paying off debt? Bah humbug. Everyone&#039;s different so you gotta go with what works with your personality. And if tattoos are on the important list, then so be it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! Always been a fan of family crests myself. Hadn&#039;t ever thought about it as a tattoo though, that&#039;s kinda cool.
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - What? Really? Now THAT is insane.
@&lt;b&gt;Call Me What You Want Even Cheap&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I think stuff you like in high school can def. be different than when you&#039;re an adult. Not sure about once you&#039;re an adult though and then an *older* adult - maybe your interests don&#039;t change as drastically?
@&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt; - Yay! I like hearing about bonding over tattoos - have always wanted to dothe same one day but sadly don&#039;t have any takers :(
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, had to look up that Ogham Tree Alphabet but that&#039;s pretty cool! Never seen or heard of before.
@&lt;b&gt;Renee S&lt;/b&gt; - There&#039;s Groupons for tattoos?? I WANT!!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww very cool! I wonder what the grand total would be?? If you see this later, will you ask him to guestimate? I find that all kinds of fascinating... I&#039;m getting my future tattoos around the same area myself just in case I want a sleeve down the road. I&#039;d totally do it if I already knew the designs and had a trusted artist. I don&#039;t know anyone anymore :(
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... out of everyone I could have SWORN you&#039;d be up for it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Milah Bee&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh a constellation of stars - that&#039;s sexy!
@&lt;b&gt;Terah@The Credit Report Chick&lt;/b&gt; - The half sleeve only cost $150?? That is an incredible deal!
@&lt;b&gt;Eric J. Nisall - DollarVersity&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, true that... You and my wife would get along well - she&#039;s always saying the new cool thing is to NOT get tattooed :) But you can&#039;t help it if you like it anyways!
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - YEAH! That would be awesome to see him in tattoo form, haha... also like the old school roses too - that&#039;s something that&#039;s been growing on me lately. I like seeing them on people :) Didn&#039;t realize you had so many!
@&lt;b&gt;Leah&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! If you ever make it to the DC area maybe we&#039;ll get one together :)
@&lt;b&gt;Beckey&lt;/b&gt; - Love that!! The name idea - we&#039;ll be name twins ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Catherine&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that&#039;s too funny about the spinal block show.. that thing freaked me out when I watched the Mrs. get one too!
@&lt;b&gt;uncc901&lt;/b&gt; - Holy moley you&#039;re hardcore, haha... good for you on rockin&#039; it though!
@&lt;b&gt;Alexa @ travelmiamor&lt;/b&gt; - Placement IS key! Which makes me a tad bit nervous about my hand heart, cuz the only thing that could cover that up is a band-aid, ugh... I have to think on that one a lot still. But yay for all those stars of yours!
@&lt;b&gt;Emily @ evolvingPF&lt;/b&gt; - No shame in that, my friend! Clean = sexy as well ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Becky&lt;/b&gt; - My wife would freak the hell out if I got a skull, haha... She hates seeing them on my t-shirts!
@&lt;b&gt;Leland&lt;/b&gt; - GO FOR THE MERMAID STUFF!! They&#039;re my latest obession too - I swear they&#039;re real! Haha... but I also love how majestic they are too. Reminds me that anything&#039;s possible :) Promise me you&#039;ll send a pic if you end up getting them?? Palease!
@&lt;b&gt;Grayson @ Debt Roundup&lt;/b&gt; - That is the tricky part if you&#039;re unsure... Probably best you stay away until something pops 100%!
@&lt;b&gt;Mistress Susan&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... pretty cool you&#039;ve gotten them across the entire nation like that though! :)
@&lt;b&gt;L Bee and the Money Tree&lt;/b&gt; - YAY! Marker it up, baby! I hope you end up falling in love with it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... right on.
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - I can understand that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Johnny @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - Sweet! Cat all the way!
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - When we get older there will probably be a lot of permanent things on our body we won&#039;t like ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ally&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh now you&#039;re speaking my language. Names and sailor art - my faves.
@&lt;b&gt;Diane @ marriageindebt&lt;/b&gt; - She&#039;s not the first one, I can tell you that! :) I never quite did understand why women put them in that area?
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - It can be painful depending on where you get it. Luckily the only spot I chose so far had some cushion so it was just like someone writing hard on my skin :) Not like that when done on the ribs though, ouch!
@&lt;b&gt;Christine&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! Those are beautiful :)
@&lt;b&gt;MissAmanda&lt;/b&gt; - $5 - nice! I like the idea of a &quot;&amp;&quot; too.
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Really??? I&#039;ve never heard of that! Man... talk about unforeseen side affects, eh? It&#039;s nice of the artist to at least not get pissed at you - no pun intended! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @My Multiple Streams&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah dude, thanks for sending over pics of them too - that was cool to see :) I still find that gig of yours incredibly fascinating... def. not sore on the eyes!
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I love that you budget for them :) We went to an alien museum in Roswell a year or so ago - you should check it out if you haven&#039;t already!
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - I wonder what you would have got back in the day :)
@&lt;b&gt;John S @ Frugal Rules&lt;/b&gt; - A perfect bonding experience! I like your wife :) I try to convince mine of the same but so far I get the evil stare in return, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;daydream kate&lt;/b&gt; - Oh really?? One for the two of you to get at the same time?? I wanna see once it&#039;s designed out!
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!! I saw them, thanks for that :) Very cool to see... sad about your husband too :(
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - I feel like everyone with at least 1 knows they&#039;re gonna get another one one day... I like that, even if it never happens.
@&lt;b&gt;Dave Holm&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... at least you weren&#039;t the only one w/ those bands back then ;) Even rock stars fell for it!
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah I was gonna ask how large that one was - it&#039;s a lot of words! But cool you found something you enjoy so much :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brittany&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh the finger ones sound awesome!! I just saw a girl with a heart on her finger, but I&#039;ve never heard of the small diamond one - I dig that... and the pinecone idea, haha... that&#039;s a first!
@&lt;b&gt;laura / no more spending&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! And you&#039;re not gonna tell us what it is, are you? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica O.&lt;/b&gt; - Ballsy! But also super cute :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha... def. not good ;) I hear ya on the donating too - I was alway moving around the world and I&#039;d have to wait years to donate again as well. And then after the tattoo too.
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - The feather idea is cool - haven&#039;t seen many people with that really, esp on the ribs (ouch).
@&lt;b&gt;Jane Savers @ The Money Puzzle&lt;/b&gt; - Haha no problem at all! Everyone&#039;s welcome here of course :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sandi&lt;/b&gt; - I like your dad&#039;s initials one - that&#039;s cute :)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - VERY nice of your mom, wow... Mine isn&#039;t much of a fan of them I&#039;m afraid.
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Fair enough.
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly, my star tattoo twin :) Money is made for spending!
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Thata girl! I bet it helped a lot too seeing those colors in action, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;rosie&lt;/b&gt; - You win the most tattoo award here! WOOHOOO! Love it that you have those sparrows too, you&#039;re ahead of the game! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not sure exactly how many tattoos i have, so we will just call it a buttload. Approx 35 hours worth.

I have almost a full sleeve on my right arm, a few on my left, my ribs (front and side), stomach, back, tops of feet, and several on my calves. Including two bad ass sparrows :)

Figure at about 100 an hour, i am in for about 3500, give or take, to figure in tips and such

I was not as stable as i was then, but did not have to sacrifice to get them either

I plan on finishing my left sleeve, with an old school]]></description>

<p>I was not as stable as i was then, but did not have to sacrifice to get them either</p>
<p>I plan on finishing my left sleeve, with an old school</p>

					<description><![CDATA[1.How many tattoos do you have? Two
2.If more than 0, what are they and where? (If none – why?) Multi-colored turtle on back (not in tramp stamp position!) and celtic band on ankle
3.How much did they cost in total? $275 (we&#039;re supposed to tip? oops! :( )
4.Were you financially stable when getting them? ;) Wasn&#039;t really financially stable, but had saved for them so...kinda?
5.Do you plan on getting any more? If so, what’s next? If I saw something that I had to have, maybe. Right now no plans.

J - for my color tat, I bought magic markers in the colors I thought I wanted and drew on myself to make sure I liked it and could live with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have 3 tattoos - a star on my toe, the kanji symbol for beauty on my back, and the infinity symbol behind my ear.  They cost probably about $300 total (but part of that was paying for half of a tattoo for a friend for a gift).  I am started when I was 19 or 20 and I&#039;m 29 now and don&#039;t regret them at all!  They each mean something special to me, and I definitely want more!  I would say I was sort of financially stable at the time I got them, I saved for them and they never went on credit cards, but the money probably could&#039;ve been used for something else...but if you can&#039;t live a little with your money, what&#039;s the point?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little late to this, but ya&#039; know family comes first...

1) One
2)  I have a Rose on my ankle
3) My mom paid for it so free for me, $50 for my mom
4) Yes, I was 17 and it was a graduation gift.  That was an awesome gift with more to follow soon after. :)
5) I debate it at times, but if I got something I might get a tiny Siamese cat or a paw print.  Might just get a paw print in piercings on my ear instead, because I am totally non-committal to more tattoos at this point.]]></description>
