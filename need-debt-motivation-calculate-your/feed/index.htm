					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I could see that.  My Heloc variable is at 2%-something (CRAZY!) but will go up as soon as the Fed starts raising rates again....but my 1st mortgage is @ 6.9% locked in so hard to determine which to pay first ;) As long as we&#039;re all paying something off though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazingly, only $21/day.  Two dollars is my car loan, two dollars for credit cards, $17 for student loans.  I say amazingly since I owe close to $190k in student loans, half federal and half private.  Interest rates are so low right now that my highest student loan rate is only 3.3%.  This reinforces my idea that, because the rates are low now, it makes sense to make off as much principal as I can, because the private rates are variable, and I do foresee them going back up before long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for this post.  It led to a great discussion with my hubby last night.  Another way to look at it and see how gross mortgage interest can be is to see how much you are paying over the course of a year.  $10,811.30 for us.  Gross!  Then to think that the life of the loan is 30 years...yikes.  We are currently paying an extra grand a month and plan to have it paid off in 10 years...just before our 40th birthdays:)&lt;br /&gt;Also, got the Sammy cd.  We love it!  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Trina]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;fallingintofavor&lt;/b&gt; - Not too bad, you&#039;ll be done with it in no time my friend.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Anonymous&lt;/b&gt; - Paying *anything* a day towards debt is no fun, totally understandable ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;WellHeeledBlog&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! You gamed the system ;)  It looks like you have no debt with these calculations, but in fact you do - interesting. If only you could swap it out for a mortgage/car/etc. haha....thanks for sharing!&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Jackie&lt;/b&gt; - You could use it to get 2 coffees at Starbucks every day! haha..&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Trina&lt;/b&gt; - Blows.  But good that you only have mortgage!&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;RainyDaySaver&lt;/b&gt; - Definitely good points....we go back and forth on paying some off every month or so ($50 here, $150 there) but then we also like seeing the additional savings in our accounts too.  But maybe tracking this daily interest paid will get me to work harder at it?!  at least in theory it should ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;April B&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch.  I wish I had a prize for ya!&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Michele&lt;/b&gt; - What, you are?!  I had nooooo idea!  I thought you were in your 20s ;)  that&#039;s a compliment, right?&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Jamel Rose&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m glad!  Not fun thinking about debt, but it is thinking about the money you could be using it for INSTEAD.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Money Reasons&lt;/b&gt; - Enjoy it while it lasts ;)  I want to downsize our house, but I could go for a newer car here once mine dies.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;youngandthrifty&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, PLEASE whatever you do, make sure you&#039;re 100% comfortable with your mortgage and monthly payments.  Having &#034;more&#034; room and house is good in theory, but it also adds to things like debt, maintenance, more &#034;stuff&#034; to fill up that room, etc etc.  That&#039;s not to say it can&#039;t be worth it, just consider it all before you sign ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;jdgreene&lt;/b&gt; - Should be decent rates if it&#039;s school stuff at least.  Much better than auto/home/etc rates.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Anonymous&lt;/b&gt; - WOW, good for you!  that is inspiring...honestly, very impressive!]]></description>
