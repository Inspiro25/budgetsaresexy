Yup, pretty much!!

And ironically enough, sharing blogrolls also happens to help with traffic too! Because while you&#039;re sharing other blogs, their sharing you and the circle of blog love flows throughout :)

Perhaps if enough of us rock them again we can bring them back?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Staying patient with investments through your retirement account is a winning formula J$!! I love individual stocks, but I also love the research and analysis that goes along with it - and I&#039;m certainly hoping it pays off in the long run.

And although I&#039;ve just started this whole blogging thing for fun, and to hopefully share some good ideas with people, I have taken your advice and submitted my blog to the Directory :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the person with a student loan of $12,000 and cc. debt of $10,000, Jay is right: pay off that cc debt like it&#039;s the most important thing you could do with your money - because it is! I hope that you never become comfortable with your debts just because it&#039;s &quot;normal&quot; to be in the red. My husband and I had that false comfort for many years, but then when the unexpected happened (in our case, job loss), it wasn&#039;t so comfortable anymore. Make your paradigm shift happen now instead of later, and watch that $10,000 go down!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish having a blogroll was still a &quot;thing&quot; too. I had a personal blog before blogging was all about how much traffic you could get, and one of my favorite parts of it was discovering new blogs from the people that I already followed. Sigh.
