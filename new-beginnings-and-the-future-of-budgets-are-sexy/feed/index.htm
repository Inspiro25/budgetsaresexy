Yup - I could have monetized it a lot more, but I didn&#039;t like how it intrudes the user experience so I opted purposely not to :) And I also don&#039;t like blogging specifically *to make* money as it&#039;s not as authentic or transparent, so they were all calls I made early on and had to be okay with the consequences... which didn&#039;t turn out too badly in the least ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started reading your blog years ago. I&#039;m wondering... if the financials were appealing to you in selling your site, why not just monetize it? The alternative is leaving it after 6 months, and it is clear you will be missed. It looks like you have huge traffic here and could have made a lot from monetizing and perhaps selling at a much higher price down the road.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. Congrats on the move/decision. It&#039;s been fun knowing ya and having you as a blogging buddy back in the day. I&#039;ve been taking &#039;sabbaticals&#039; on my blog too due to life (grad school, moving, new tenure track job) so I get what it is like to feel like you need a change. All the best and keep making those sexy budgets!]]></description>

Yeah - plus the values can fluctuate so much so I just went the super conservative route of leaving out knowing that one day later it would (probably) be accounted for :)

As for history of blog sales - you&#039;re absolutely right! In fact, I literally told the Fool that I&#039;ve never seen a site *get better* after it was sold, to which they replied &quot;that&#039;s why we need YOU to help us set a better example!&quot; So that&#039;s actually part of my &quot;job&quot; over there with them now - to do things in a way that keeps the community and sites nice and healthy as they continue to acquire more :) So if anything goes down, you can put the blame on me! Haha...

I also have it in the contract to be able to write on whatever I please and in my same style here too or else there&#039;s no point! And they 100% agreed with it! So I&#039;d say we&#039;re off to a great start so far?]]></description>
