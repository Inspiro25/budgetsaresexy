This article is old, sorry :(

(but not sure what category tennis lessons would fall under anyways tax-wise? so my guess would be that it&#039;s not applicable, unless you guys are running some sort of business around tennis and can count it as an &quot;expense?&quot;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over this past year I have spent more than 5,000 dollars on tennis lessons for my 2 daughters, should I ask the club for a receipt of said expenses, to take with me when getting my taxes done, or is it not even worth my time?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently moved to California for an internship from Massachusetts and have a full time paying job as well (still enrolled full time cause internship is 12 credits). I realized for the first time that I may be able to file exempt and 1 for the rest of 2015 and get all my taxes back? Is this true? Cause online it states no matter what I would have to pay every cent back if I claim exempt. Don&#039;t get my first paycheck for 2 more weeks so I still have time to re-submit the paperwork. But I&#039;m an independent and I recently filed exempt-1...so can someone please tell me if I did the right thing as a college student? I don&#039;t want to owe the IRS any money if I claim exempt-1 =(]]></description>
