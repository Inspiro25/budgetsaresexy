					<description><![CDATA[I hardly ever do sodas anymore.  I just decided I did not want to drink my calories.  Occasionall (like once a month), I will get a hankering for a Coke and pay 75 cents at a vending machine because if I buy them, I will drink them.  lol :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the biggest money wasters of all time didn&#039;t make the list! DVD&#039;s! People waste so much money on buying movies they may watch a few times, just because they loved it the first time. I admit I have my classics that I can, and have, watched many times, but for the most part it is a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have to come up with my own list of money wasters for EOD!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My solution to the soda cost problem was to invest in a SodaStream.  Mixing my own soda has seriously cut down on the cost and now everyone at work thinks I&#039;m oh-so eccentric with my homemade soda.  Plus, I&#039;ve actually cut down on my caffeine intake.  (By the way, I love orange mixed with cream soda best.)]]></description>

Fun to see how different/similar we all are :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, good point....maybe I&#039;ll create the next one and include all the &#034;partying&#034; vices - cigs, alcohol, bar covers, haha... good idea ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - No way, I LOVE my magazines in &#034;real life!&#034;  Much better on my eyes and I like pretty pictures and being able to store them in my Blog Lair. haha....&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Matt Jabs &lt;/b&gt; - ING is awesome no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Ariella&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, when I used to  have ATM fees (yearrrrrrs ago) I&#039;d take out big chunks at a time or it just wasn&#039;t worth it (like $60-$100)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Patrenia&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah Bloggers!!!  We *need* the iphon, haha...and LOVE your quote - &#034;I&#039;m part of a credit union.

I always fall for their direct-mail trap cuz I never want them to run out!&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;LindyMint&lt;/b&gt; - Haha....indeed.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;ctreit&lt;/b&gt; - For sure, changing around some of this stuff is a pretty big hassle....guess we pay for that ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;TP&lt;/b&gt; - LOVE twizzlers!  I always forget about them for some reason though?&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - WOW - $30 total for all phones????  Your are pimpin&#039; those savings!  Multiply that by 4 for just MY phone! haha...&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;fallingintofavor&lt;/b&gt; - Marketers get us every time ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I don&#039;t blame you when it&#039;s cold though, only when it&#039;s nice and sunny out ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Anonymous&lt;/b&gt; - You don&#039;t have a bank account?  OR credit card? wow I thought your kinds were extinct! haha.....if you ever see this message, shoot me an email - would love to hear your perspective on things :)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;thoughtsonthereallife &lt;/b&gt; - Hey that&#039;s what I&#039;m hear for!  The &#034;personal&#034; part of finances, right? :)  Love your Pay At The Pump idea, so very true.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, used to be sucked into Diet Coke like crazy....i think it still does have some trace of crack in it!&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;youngandthrifty&lt;/b&gt; - You know, hadn&#039;t thought about it like that.  I wonder if I could deduct portions of it because of the blog?  (writing this down to ask my accountant!) thanks.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;donkee&lt;/b&gt; - I had to force my wife too :)  But now she loves it!  Saves her lots of time.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;MD @ Studenomics&lt;/b&gt; - Mmmm...I could go for some rum and cokes right now actually....it&#039;s almost noon!&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Look at you rockin&#039; it ;)  Gotta love USAA, right?&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Abigail&lt;/b&gt; - 2 Liters!!!  Danggg....that&#039;s quite an accomplishment, well done.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Jason @ MyMoneyMinute&lt;/b&gt; - That is hard to do :)  I&#039;m getting better at ordering water, but when I&#039;m in the mood for something I go to the ol&#039; Iced Tea which still costs the same as soda.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Simple in France&lt;/b&gt; - Have to disagree with you on the magazine front, but I see your point.  Whenever you can get something for free instead of paying it doesn&#039;t make financial sense.  We pay for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Clark&lt;/b&gt; - You know, I actually skimmed that but I never believe any of those stock picks anyways...i don&#039; t think anyone knows what&#039;s gonna be good and when ;)  Might as well have fun picking them myself!&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Forest Parks&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man I haven&#039;t had a candy bar in ages...used to be so addicted to them! now all that sweetness hurts my mouth?  i think i&#039;m getting old...&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Money Reasons&lt;/b&gt; - Nice analyzations :)  Whatever works!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#3, Soft Drinks use to be a big expense for me, until I started buying the lipton tea single packets (10 in a box for $2.00) and Wyler lemonade packets ($1.00 for 8)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wyler is cheaper, but the Lipton tea has health benefits!  So I drink more Lipton than Wyler...  I blogged about it on my site...  But honestly, what I&#039;ve said summarized most of what was on my blog about this topic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even economize further by splitting the packet content in half per glass of water.  I think I figured it run me between .06 to .10 cents per glass, much cheaper than the vending machine pop I was buying at work a few years back (what is that now .75 to 1.10?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would argue that junk food of any kind is a big fat waste.  And magazine subscriptions too--you are basically paying for the advertising you&#039;re consuming when you read the magazine.  Crazy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And annual credit card fees are a waste of money, but even worse is running a balance on your card and paying interest.]]></description>
