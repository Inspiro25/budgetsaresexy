Amazing, I&#039;ve felt changes happening since I started it.  It&#039;s interesting to figure out what you would spend money on if you had a lot of it free and clear and could buy anything.

I&#039;ve never been a huge spender--I bought my first pair of jeans in three years earlier this year, and that was because I needed them.  I haven&#039;t had cable since I moved out on my own.  A lot of times, I really don&#039;t know what to do with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My personal experience has been that, while I was dealing with depression, it was difficult to care for myself in any way, whether it be eating right, exercising, saving money, caring for personal relationships, housework. (I had the insidious apathetic don&#039;t-care-much-about-anything type of depression rather than the very sad, need-to-get-help-now type.)

Now that my health is so much better (resistant starch+probiotics FTW!), I&#039;m so much more interested in traveling, learning to invest, pursuing a side hustle, volunteering, etc. I really believe that if you don&#039;t have a decent degree of health, then it will be difficult to have other things that rely on the energy and desire that come naturally with being healthy. 

I hope I never recover from this addiction to your blog though!]]></description>

Fascinating problem indeed... do you ever read early retirement blogs? I feel like they would help out A LOT. Especially in the &quot;what to do&quot; department as they&#039;re always sharing the projects and ideas they&#039;re working on (much to the jealousy of us still working - hah).

Here&#039;s a list of my favorites if you want to give them a shot - I highly advise it:

It&#039;s not an unsolvable problem so long as you actually want to solve it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was enjoying the post until you got to the part about pretending you&#039;ve got $2 million in the bank. That is exactly what I have saved for retirement during my career.  Plus another million I inherited last year. Yet I&#039;m still working a demanding job well over 40 hours a week. I have hundreds of employees and dozens of daily problems and opportunities at a job that swings wildly from being terrifically entertaining to being downright unpleasant. I&#039;m in my very late 50&#039;s and don&#039;t need a salary to live well the rest of my life, but I am not sure I know how to do retirement. Yeah, its a first world problem of the highest order, but I&#039;m guessing I&#039;m not alone.]]></description>
