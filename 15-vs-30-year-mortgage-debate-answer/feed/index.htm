					<description><![CDATA[Looks good to me. 

You have definitely done your homework. Putting down 20% makes all the difference. NO PMI!!! Put that money towards paying off the principal instead of paying mortgage insurance. That&#039;s the way to go for sure. 

Navy Federal also has loans with NO PMI just an FYI

					<description><![CDATA[When we owned our last home, one of us wanted to get a $100k heloc (in case kids wanted loans for down payments - which they did - and paid back!), and it took a while to convince the other. When we retired and bought a condo that needed a total upgrade, we maxed out the heloc and were able to rehab the condo before moving in. (Of course, we got less cash when the house sold!) We now have a 30 year mortgage on which we pay extra every month - and we are very happy!]]></description>
