					<description><![CDATA[Vehicles. They terrify me. I mean... If the danger aspect doesn&#039;t catch my interest, how big of a liability they can be most certainly will!

Most people need them though. For commuting, which is explainable. I have doubts if I could see myself picking up a car though. :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WOW. 4 Tickets all in a row like that?  Freaky man....can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever experienced that one!  But it does remind me of a time when my brother once got arrested for &quot;driving drunk.&quot;  Only he had never even drove off the parking lot!  Or even a foot for that matter.  He WAS drunk, but he knew better not to drive so he decided to sleep it off in the car until the morning.  But since it was winter, he had to turn on the car to get the heat going and a good 5 mins after that the cops started knocking on his door and questioning him.  2 hours later he was in the drunk tank.  Apparently if you have the keys in the ignition you can get nailed for all sorts of things - so be aware! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a line item in my budget for &quot;The Man&quot;. Car registrations fall into that and so do speeding tickets. I had never had a speeding ticket in my life, my wife hadn&#039;t either, worst I got was a written warning many years back. But then our state had a budget shortfall and my wife and I were pulled over FOUR TIMES in one week between the two of us. She got warnings, I got tickets. They&#039;d nab me right where the speed limit dropped while I was doing 5 over the original limit and slowing down for the new one. It sucked. Old financial me would have panicked. New financial me was thankful for the budget item and the emergency fund!

This may be a line of bs I feel for (totally possible!) or vary state to state, but I was told that when you get your car inspected at a private place they aren&#039;t required to run all the same checks as the public inspection stations (on the first run, if you fail and then take it to them they have to run you for what you failed on). I was told that after failing the public inspection a bunch one year for emissions related stuff. The private inspection set me back about $60 bucks or so though (Also out of &quot;The Man&quot; budget) this year when I was nervous the car was going to fail. Could be a trick but if it isn&#039;t I&#039;d rather pay the $60 some bucks then chase down a huge repair.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, it&#039;s not really a problem per se, it&#039;s just annoying.  You&#039;re right though - having a side maintenance fund would def. keep me more sane.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see how the registration should even me a problem. Since you know it is coming you should be ready for it. A little over $10 bucks a month into a car maintenance fund kills that problem. 

It sucks about the ticket and emissions though]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Everyday Tips&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...I like the way you think!  I don&#039;t, actually, do that but consider it a deal ;)  She&#039;s been workin&#039; smoothly for a few months now!
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @ sustainablelifeblog&lt;/b&gt; - Does that stuff really work?  I&#039;d try everything at this point :)  My fear is that the catalytic converter is gone.  It passed 2 years ago so not sure why it&#039;s not now... should be getting that call anytime tho!
@&lt;b&gt;Impulse Magazine&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, same with old beat down cars ;)  My caddy gets a silky 13 miles per hour, baby.
@&lt;b&gt;Karmella&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting.  Considering I&#039;ve been going under 15 all these years and this is the FIRST time I&#039;ve got caught, I would say your nugget of info there is correct.  I doubt I&#039;d have triggered it at 9 over...unless it&#039;s a neighborhood thing?  Def. not on the highway though.
@&lt;b&gt;Young Mogul&lt;/b&gt; - What? You DO?  Are you in another country? haha....actually, I do kinda recall that our registrations here in MD are a bit more expensive.  I think it&#039;s cuz titles and tags are cheap as balls (at least from what I remember)...it was like the opposite of Virginia.
@&lt;b&gt;Christine&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  You&#039;re right on that one, I def. hit my 3.  Let&#039;s hope it ends!  If not I&#039;m gonna get even MORE tempted to pick up that Benz I&#039;ve been eying ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  The old me would have been screwed.
@&lt;b&gt;Favor&lt;/b&gt; - Really?  How much?!  Young Mogul up there thinks $128 is crazy high!  Would be interesting to see where you two live :)]]></description>
