Really impressive investing that early AND getting out of stocks and into index funds...also love the 401(k) story...as an HR professional, it is shocking how few people have a good grasp of tax advantaged investment vehicles and investing for the long term.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations! I&#039;m just a bit older, with a NW approx. 10% of that so far. So iI look up, I guess?
#1 is bygones be bygones for many of us, but #6 can be used by anyone anywhere anytime. I also try to put a ceiling on my spending, like your $2,250 (but mine is still too high for my taste...)
Btw I checked the link about the portfolio and it made me interested in reading more, so I may comment again there ;)]]></description>

Thanks Joe! So true about getting the mistakes out of the way early. I&#039;m definitely glad I made those when it cost me a few thousand instead of a few hundred thousand.]]></description>

Wow! Those are some crazy similarities! And even more impressive with the student loans. 

Congrats on killing it! Keep it up! Like you said, it makes a huge difference and is totally worth it.]]></description>

Haha! Definitely something I should write up a full post for.

Basically I&#039;d snatch up bats whenever I found them at a great price, then would resell them for their usual going rate. I had a lot of luck shopping the online sales and then reselling the bats at their &quot;MSRP&quot; locally, either through craigslist or to other players at the fields. Also found some great deals at garage sales and used sporting goods stores. 

It was all about knowing the most popular bats and how much the market was willing to pay for them.]]></description>
