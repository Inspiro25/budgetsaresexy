Haha yeah - the childcare alone already makes it a splurge! :) But awesome you guys still treat yourselves like that... Sometimes I dream of just getting a babysitter and then staying in my room for hours and just reading in peace and quiet, lol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would guess some of this depends on tastes and circumstances. We don&#039;t go out to fancy dinners often because we have a kid and no reliable childcare, so when we do its a no brainer to live it up and order what we want. We dropped over $100 on dinner this past Saturday but the last time we went to a fancy restaurant before that was... October? Otherwise we go to cheap, family-friendly places and no matter what we order, we come in under our $50 budget. 
Same with travel, we prioritize visiting family so don&#039;t typically have big hotel, rental car, or food costs, just plane tickets. But when we do travel for pleasure, we&#039;ll splurge on the nicer hotel, entertainment etc]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are of retirement age, but not “retired”, as we want to continue to contribute, through either paid or unpaid work.
We are at but not interested in # 4 as we help out with grandchildren and are home bodies.  We are at but not interested in #5 because we are perfectly content with how well the house we have now functions for us.  We are at and thoroughly enjoying #6.... we have an account for that and receive much pleasure from giving from it.]]></description>

Well done staying in one place like that!!! That&#039;s hard to do for most of us!

I agree w/ the nice refunds too, so long as you&#039;re consciously doing it like you are and you don&#039;t end up just blowign it on stuff you don&#039;t really care about.]]></description>

You&#039;d rather not reach level 3 or not care about restaurant prices? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not above a good vacation now, but I still put a lot of consideration in it. So, one good vacation a year isn&#039;t out of the question but planning and budgeting must be done to make sure it doesn&#039;t hinder everything else for the year. Have to maintain investing, and make sure quality of life though frugal is maintained and not wrecked by a vacation. So maybe the vacation no problem is more around the 3-8 million mark.]]></description>
