					<description><![CDATA[We just used USAA&#039;s car buying service to get a 3-row suv (hello babies! hubby wouldn&#039;t do the mini van). We got their 1.99% financing deal right now, which is awesome. As others noted their insurance prices are high so we switched to Liberty Mutual. We have always bought used cars. The last 3 were through Carmax due to convenience and lack of car knowledge. I&#039;m glad we did it on our own this time, but it took about 60 hours of research, phone calls, dealership visits, negotiations, being annoyed at the used car salesman, and then repairs to said used car, etc. It was a good experience for us to go through.]]></description>

Tell me that Lebaron was a convertible too? I used to love riding around in those when my dad would get rental cars!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The newest car I&#039;ve ever owned is my 2013. My first car was a 87 Lebaron  and they only went up incrementally after that.Now my 2013 is like a spaceship compared to what I&#039;m used to with seat warmers, a USB for my phone, and... something I need desperately in the snow here, 4 wheel drive. 
Also, who hates USAA?! My 3 siblings who are/were in the Navy swear/swore by it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;neon yellow was in fashion (it *was* in fashion, wasn’t it&quot;

haha... when I bought my first sport bike I knew that I wanted the Kawasaki Ninja 250 because of its size. But, I really wanted the &quot;Kawasaki Green&quot;... i.e. the signature neon green... but couldn&#039;t find a used one for sale, so I ended up with the shiny red one. Probably for the best. :)]]></description>

Yes... during my stint as a Sustainability Professional, I got to learn all about the toxins in our environment. The &quot;new car smell&quot; is from VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). These are also in sooooo many other things like paint, mattresses, couches, flooring/carpet, shower curtains... etc.... I could go on. I participated in a sustainability fellowship program that had required reading, and one book in particular I found to be a very important read: &quot;What&#039;s Gotten Into Us. Staying Healthy in a Toxic World&quot;, by Mckay Jenkins.]]></description>
