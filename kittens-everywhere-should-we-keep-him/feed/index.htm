Well we definitely have cat insurance on our other cats and will be adding it on him asap. It&#039;s something to think about.]]></description>

Awww so cool of y&#039;all to keep him! Especially with all those problems the poor guy had :( Def. something in the back of our minds too - as much as I&#039;d like to think we could spend the money on a cat, we really REALLY have to be better about watching stuff over here... the perfect storm we&#039;ve hit needs to clear up more for us to drop that kinda money :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Augh, I would have the worst time giving up the kitten .. but PiC&#039;s allergic so that&#039;s a definite no. Perhaps the shelter will do a discounted &quot;rescue&quot; neuter? It would kind of be hilarious to have everyone pitch in a few bucks to make this happen - after all, we all want YOU to keep it :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We dealt with this same issue this summer. Unfortunately for us, we found a kitten that was near death and had loads of things wrong with it! Two intestinal parasites, ear mites, a crazy awful upper respiratory infection (that we are still seeing remnants of) and was so malnourished he was half the weight he should&#039;ve been for his age (8 weeks). We had some interest on FB about adopting him out, but we had to put so much money into getting him well (probably close to $1,000 at this point 6 weeks later) that we need to get a return on this kid! So we are keeping him. 

I am sure your kitten doesn&#039;t have all these issues, so I would say keep him and consider yourself lucky that your little dude is pretty healthy. Where with our brood of three other cats that we got suckered in to keeping over the last five does the madness stop!? Ours fit right in... after one cat, what&#039;s two? After two, what&#039;s three? After three, what&#039;s four? Lol, they are all great and now that we are expecting our first child, I&#039;m sure they&#039;re going to get along just fine! It&#039;s like one big happy family over here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keep the Cat!!!!

Call shelters, and charities etc, sometimes they do neutering drives where it&#039;s $20 or something to de-sex.  A de-sex-athon or something.

					<description><![CDATA[How adorable! If a little one happened to wander to our home it would be really hard for me not to let him in. We ended up with two cats because I saw a post on petfinder that broke my heart (aunt died, nieces&#039; house got foreclosed on, she and the cats didn&#039;t have a place to go). If I could have taken her and the cats I would have. But we ended up just with the cats. Bf is allergic so I told him I&#039;d re-home them. 4 years later bf loves them (allergies and all).]]></description>
