What?? Haha... that is both weird and awesome at the same time! RE: your IRA - maybe you can just auto. transfer the money to a different savings account each month, and then at the end of the year go in and invest it all in one swoop and work your IRA that way? That would kinda sorta automate it more for ya.]]></description>

YES! Brilliant! A lot easier to pay off smaller chunks than large ass ones - good for you on figuring that out and rolling with it... Gotta do whatever you can to stay motivated!]]></description>

Disagree...I think they have cheapened the mag and there is no thought behind it. May just have been when the swapped out management a few years back... How about an article on who is gonna benefit from the move toward electric cars...battery makers...electronic component makers...the guys that make the high speed chargers....and who is gonna be the loser...Exon/Chevron....Jiffy lube? They used to write just such articles..that took thought and would &quot;look&quot; for what was around the curve. Now ...not so much...I subscribed for over 25 years...truly sad...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the though of saving as a bill. I love my 401(k), since it comes right out of my paycheck, I don&#039;t even register that the money is &quot;spendable&quot; to me. My income is the number that turns up in the checking account every other month. I wish I could do the same with IRA, but I haven&#039;t figured out how. 

I can&#039;t even imagine the crap I would put in an email to my future self. :oP Although I did read some study once where people who saw photos of themselves aged to their 60s/70s had notably better retirement accounts after a few years compared to the control group that did not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a big reason why intermediate goals are so important to me. Paying off $100,000 in debt or saving up millions for retirement both sound ridiculous when I look at them as long-term goals.

But paying off a little bit here or saving a little bit there are both easier goals to grasp and easier goals to achieve :)]]></description>

I didn&#039;t particularly mind it too much (of course, or else this post wouldn&#039;t exist! haha...), but I do feel like it&#039;s lost its edge for sure... Seems to only take me 30 mins or so to get through each month&#039;s edition vs hours like it used to since I was so into the articles... Maybe it&#039;s just us and we&#039;ve outgrown it?]]></description>
