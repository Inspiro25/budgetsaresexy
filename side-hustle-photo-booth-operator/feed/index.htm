					<description><![CDATA[Photo booth rentals are an excellent side hustle!   I started as a DJ playing music for weddings and special events, and added photo booths to my service offerings.

The cool part about photo booths is the different ways they can be used, whether for private events like weddings and company parties, or for corporate events where you are doing large scale brand activations.

As a data collection tool, they are incredible... people use your photo booth and when they text/email the photo to themselves, you collect that data and can follow up and market to them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greetings!

Hi, J. Money, man from Manila, Philippines here.  I just stumble on this article in your Side Hustle site and I find it very useful.  I have a Photo Booth business which I myself run.  The thing is, there are lots of competitors here.  It&#039;s up to you how to get clients.  I market my services by mouth, by advertisement (like using a tarpaulin in your front gate), sharing it on social media like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram and the cheapest way by flyers.  I usually leave flyers by the gate of villages or convenient store (711, Easy Mart &#038; Mini Stop).  But the thing is clients want the best for their events.

That&#039;s the reason why I made a letter to showcase my services and show my hardware to prospective clients.  Anyway, thank you very much for this site.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! Awesome article. Thanks for shedding some light into the phot booth business. I am considering opening a photo booth of my own and was wondering if you could tell me the average cost of printing per event. I saw on a previous article of yours that it would cost approx. $200 for 4 events (paper and ink included). How many strips do you typically print per event?  Thanks!]]></description>
