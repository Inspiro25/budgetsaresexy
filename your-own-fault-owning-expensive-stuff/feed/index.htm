Nice!! I&#039;ve used OfferUp before (they just raised $100 Million btw - they&#039;re blowing up!) but never heard of the others... Feels great getting rid of stuff and bringing home $$$ instead! You don&#039;t ever need to declutter that! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our society has become really materialistic. After getting married and moving to another country, I now realize how hard it is to earn money and how much we need to save in order to retire and live well. We have learned not to buy things that we not need (i.e. clothes, purses, makeup, shoes, etc.). I don&#039;t even buy brands anymore. I go to the thrift store. My husband is kind of icky about this, but I am slowly showing him the way.

I have also become a great salesperson. I am slowly decluttering our home. Part of my success is GREAT mobile apps! OfferUP, LetGo and Wallapop are all great! I use all three to sale our stuff. It&#039;s really easy to post our things. On average I make at least 50$ per month (last month 100$+, so far this month 33$!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I learned the hard way that i really dont care about stuff. I lost everything in an apt fire now 2 years ago and i live much more simple now because of that. I buy quality over quantity and I shop for almost everything second hand. There is a lot less stress now about losing it all. And a lot less clutter!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just last year, someone broke into our house and took expensive stuff such as laptop and my computer consoles. It was really hard to accept the truth that these things I worked for were gone. But, I gotta move on and learn something from that incident. Now, it kinda affected the things I buy nowadays. I rarely buy expensive stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m missing the full context of your conversation with the wise older gentleman, but I take his wonderful comment a little differently.  

So many people complain and worry about their financial obligations, or they are weighed down by them or can&#039;t save because of them - the car payment, the electricity bill, the credit card that&#039;s due, etc.  But the simple truth of that man&#039;s statement is that it&#039;s no one&#039;s fault but your own.  

You bought whatever home you now have to heat, cool, furnish and insure.  You chose the car, boat, bike, or RV that is dragging down your budget.  If you don&#039;t have enough left to give generously, or if you cling to your possessions jealously, or if you feel trapped instead of free as a result - it&#039;s really due to the stuff that YOU chose to buy/keep.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I think most burglars would be disappointed if they broke into our home as we have nothing of any real value. We have stocks, but they&#039;re on a computer somewhere and we have the house, but that&#039;s a bit difficult to steal :)

One great thing about having nothing expensive in the house is that we also have the cheapest insurance :-)]]></description>
