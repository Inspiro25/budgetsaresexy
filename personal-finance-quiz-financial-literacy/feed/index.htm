					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s too US-centric. I got a poor score, but all the questions I got wrong had to do with laws and types of accounts that we don&#039;t have where I am...like, I sort of know what an IRA and a 401(k) are from reading blogs, but we don&#039;t have them, so I&#039;m not totally solid on it! And I don&#039;t know what different bankruptcy processes and codes are in the US. No idea.

Also, @ Mikayla...I assumed as well that you&#039;d get sued, lose and be jailed for non-compliance as well. You can only not pay for so long before there are more serious consequences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aaarrgh! Curse you semantics and implicature! Smart people would infer from the silly jail question that the result would be: you don&#039;t pay your bills - you get sued and lose - you don&#039;t pay that money owed either - you get arrested based on that non compliance... on the other hand really smart people answer quiz questions exactly as written I guess :P

@Fifi - Wow I have had a hard enough time disputing a negative item that was never mine, I can&#039;t imagine how long it took you to get a factual one removed! We are soooo going shopping haha.
@Jerry - I do too, more money than sense right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice to see y&#039;all enjoyed this as much as I did - good job!! Lots of high scores here :)  I agree some of them are super tricky too - I missed the Bankruptcy one as well (arghhh).  The &quot;going to jail&quot; one I feel like is technically true, but you can still go to jail as a result of not paying certain bills through other measures, just not as directly... kinda like what Crystal from Go Banking Rates down below mentioned.  Still though - you avoid everything if you just pay them! :)

@&lt;b&gt;Ron @ Fringe Village&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, can&#039;t believe you went through them all, well done!  I starred it to go back one day when I&#039;m REALLY bored, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jon B&lt;/b&gt; - I like it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Fifi&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ve got it wiped away?? Even though it was true?  Never heard of that before, but good for you!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie @ PoorerThanYou&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah you do, haha... haven&#039;t seen you around much my friend, hope things are well!
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That&#039;s what you get for reading ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Casey&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that def. makes sense! Have to think about that one for a bit before answering it so fast ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I&#039;m so impressed by all these high scores!

I know there&#039;s a lot of confusion around the jail questions, and I just want to point out that you can&#039;t be arrested for not paying your bills...However, committing a crime related to that debt, like not showing up for court if you&#039;re sued, will definitely land you some time in the big house!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m arguing with the one I missed.  You technically can&#039;t go to debtor&#039;s prison anymore, but I read about this (http://www.npr.org/2011/12/12/143274773/unpaid-bills-land-some-debtors-behind-bars) a couple of months before taking the quiz...it colored my answer, lol.]]></description>
