					<description><![CDATA[Good to see you got a conventional loan.  The past two times I&#039;ve refinanced have been 100% free!  I had called Wells Fargo, and never got a call back.  Then one day they called me and asked if I would like to refinance and they would pick up the tab.  

I had always heard that if you refinance, it should be for at least 2% less.  So that it can pay for itself in the long run.

We hope to pay off our house next year. I&#039;m still 20 years away from retirement.  So we can sock away some cash, hopefully without having a mortgage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yikes!  Sorry about that - Adsense throws up some rando&#039;s sometimes :)  I try and nix the horrible ones but then new ones pop up! haha... usually they&#039;re decent though.

RE: Refinancing - that&#039;s GREAT!! I just read about someone else&#039;s mortgage in Canada and was blown away at the terms - so good!  Y&#039;all are smart too not having interest-only and the rest of our cazy concoctions ;)  I actually didn&#039;t mind ours at first, but over the last two years it started irking me.  But not anymore!!! Yay!!!

Good luck on your refi - and congrats to you too! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[by the way some of those ads popping up on the top right are... errr. I got a fake Facebook type ad with a girl &#039;want to meet me&#039; accept or ignore. Kinda tacky but I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t quite control the contents of every ad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude you must be thrilled... also pretty nerve wracking though right? I&#039;m refi&#039;ing this week and reading your post makes me realize how fortunate I am in Canada where things have been a bit more regulated. A 30year interest ONLY mortgage? Man, I&#039;m so baffled at that idea I don&#039;t even know what to say... you know, I now they exist and I&#039;ve read about them but to really read a personal story. Crazy.

I&#039;m refi&#039;ing from 5.35% to 4.something, no penalties, funny thing is that as i was about to call my branch to make an appointment to talk things through, they also asked me &#039;Hey have we talked about your mortgage with you lately?&#039; pretty sweet, I&#039;m waiting on the final paperwork, hopefully get the call tomorrow. saaaweet! Congrats again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Definite improvement with the refi. Congrats! I&#039;m with Joe Taxpayer -- I wish Chase had skipped the closing costs (especially since your original mortgage was through them), and I agree on holding off on paying extra and padding your &#039;oh shit&#039; fund instead.

We got a sweet 5% interest rate on our 30-year mortgage two years ago, but we also did a 20% down payment.]]></description>
