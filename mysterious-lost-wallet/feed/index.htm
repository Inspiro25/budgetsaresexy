					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you made it out okay :)  I probably would have called the police and dropped it off there.  I found a driver&#039;s license one day while I was walking the dog, brought it home with me, and then called the police station.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, nice.  I&#039;d be more excited about the $2 bill - I collect all the ones I find even though I know they&#039;re not worth much more than that (although I do have some REALLY old ones).  So if you ever get tired of looking at it, you know where to send it ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The two dollar bill and wallet are in my girlfriend&#039;s car. We couldn&#039;t figure out what else to do with it so we held onto it. It is actually a decent leather wallet. When mine wears out I might use it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOL I thought I had an imagination...how strange would it have been if when you went to the door the hottie flung the door open screaming &quot;OMMIGOD that&#039;s his wallet, the FBI are inside right now looking for leads to his kidnapping!!&quot;... glad it didn&#039;t play out like that, but you&#039;d have been like a psychic superhero or something... good on you for returning it, in the end when facing a tough decision you sleep a lot better if you do whatever it is you would want someone to do to you/for you..... good lesson to pass on to the kiddo as well =)

Raise your hand if you&#039;re glad she didn&#039;t have a gun!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would have just left it at their door with a sign saying &quot;stop leaving your crap around!&quot; with the wallet on the ground. You never know what people are capable these days...they will sue for anything...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s a nice trade-off right? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;David Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  I felt like I was writing one!  It only took me 4 hours!!! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, there you go!  So I guess it&#039;s kinda like that scene from Dumb &amp; Dumber, eh?  I always thought I&#039;d lost my stuff in there too if I were a paper reader like that :)
@&lt;b&gt;B. (Below Her Means)&lt;/b&gt; - You know how we do!
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - I really REALLY wanted to read the love notes too!!  It took everything in me to leave them alone, haha... another good reason I offloaded that thing as soon as I could ;)  I&#039;m glad someone did it for you too last year!  How wonderful.
@&lt;b&gt;Darlene&lt;/b&gt; - Woahh, now THAT&#039;s an awesome idea!! Wouldn&#039;t have ever thought of that, but yes - totally makes sense! You all know all kinds of things about your residents on your routes. Thanks for the insight!  And if you could answer one other question for me, I&#039;d be delighted: Where do mailmen/women pee? They&#039;re out there all day! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a letter carrier at the Post Office and people toss lost wallets in mailboxes all the time.  We look at the ID for an address (like on the driver&#039;s license) and return it to the person.  Once they brought me a wallet that had an address on my route, and the family had moved (and hadn&#039;t updated the address on their license) but I happened to know their new address and we were able to return it to them at their new place. 

Some other items I&#039;ve returned to people: work IDs, school IDs, car registration, envelope of grocery money accidentally dropped in with the bills, and a debit card]]></description>
