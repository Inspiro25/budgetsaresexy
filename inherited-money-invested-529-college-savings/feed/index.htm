Not sure how I missed this reply, but anyway - that is hilarious! If I have kids, I think I will try to delay the obsession with electronics like you are. Let the kids live! They are already going to have a humpback by the age of 40 from looking down so often, let&#039;s not make the situation any worse. :)

I completely agree about the use of iPads for autism and similar disabilities. They are life changing and give many non-verbal folks a &quot;voice&quot; for the first time. They are definitely useful pieces of technology, but I wouldn&#039;t practically force it on the babies while they are learning to use the loo. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the time has come when I have to distribute my savings and property to my children (I hope I have enough then), I&#039;d make sure their education is settled until college and distribute mine evenly and fairly to avoid this (I am now thinking of drama series where characters fight to get more of what they deserve).

No, I don&#039;t even bother with trying to guess as it&#039;s too depressing :) Everyone says something different too (and the calculators as well) so I figured we&#039;d just put in as much as we can over time and pray it&#039;s enough.. And then as we get closer sit down and run more estimated numbers. Maybe when we&#039;re 5 years out?]]></description>

That&#039;s an interesting idea w/ the Roth... though you can only tap contributions and not all the growth until retirement age, which would be a con. Still, could work :)]]></description>

No, no other options came close to being picked because of the crazy tax benefits w/ the 529. But that&#039;s also because it had similar funds to what I would pick *anyways* regardless of what account it&#039;s in. So I&#039;d check with your state&#039;s 529 first and see if a) they offer tax benefits and then b) if the funds align okay with you, and if either of those are a no, well, sure - maybe other accounts could be better. 

But really what other accounts allow the $$ to grow tax free though outside of your personal retirement accounts? You don&#039;t want to pull from those to fund college later, right? So there&#039;s more than just the initial tax stuff to consider too. But any option of saving money for college later is better than not doing it, so at least you&#039;re covered in the grand scheme of things ;)

UPDATE: Just read the comment below yours - that&#039;s an interesting idea, getting the twins their own Roth IRA :) Though you&#039;d only be able to tap the contributions and not all that&#039;s grown over the years since it&#039;s again meant for retirement.]]></description>
