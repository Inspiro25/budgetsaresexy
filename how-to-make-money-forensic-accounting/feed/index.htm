					<description><![CDATA[Wow! I love this article! It sounds very interesting and fun honestly. I ended up running across this while looking up ways to make extra money because being a household of 6 on 1 income just doesn&#039;t seem to be working. I wish I were able to understand and figure all this out. I live in a super small town (but bigger cities are within 30min driving distance) and I could almost bet there have been people who have passed away here that have just been forgotten about. I think it would be an amazing feeling to find some money for someone who didn&#039;t even realize there was money out there for them. Again on the other hand weeding through someone&#039;s bs and numbers mess of their business just to discover someone from the inside is sucking them blind would feel liberating. Awesome work! You help karma come to those who deserve.]]></description>

HAH! I agree w/ the aimless Facebook stuff - that&#039;s what prompted me to start this blog all those years ago - to do something more productive with my time! :)

I&#039;ll let Keith answer your certification question here since he wrote this post up, but my impression was that anyone can do it as long as they have the skills?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome post. I work in EMS and have copious amounts of down time and want something to do that makes me money on the side rather than scrolling Facebook...although that&#039;s what led me to this site.

Does one have to be a CPA to venture into this? Or can I get mega smart with the resources you&#039;ve provided?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Keith! Fellow Wisconsinite here — I&#039;m a journalist and I feel like there&#039;s a lot I could probably learn from you and your blog/book. I&#039;m going to start following you for sure! I&#039;ve gotten pretty good at tracking information over the years but forensic accounting might make a nice addition to the toolbox. (I have used LexisNexis before — a paper I worked for gave it a trial run and boy was it useful! Then they cheaped out and canceled it...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m ready to hustle. I agree with @Dads Dollars debts--sounds easier than medicine!

Looks like they teach it here online: http://www.algonquincollege.com/ccol/program/forensic-accounting-and-fraud-investigations/part-time-online/

Much cleaner than becoming a coroner. I wonder...has anyone made the leap from outside the field?]]></description>
