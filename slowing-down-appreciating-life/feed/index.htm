					<description><![CDATA[For sure, that&#039;s a good point. I get depressed here and there too when I&#039;m alone and without anything to work on, at least pre-baby. Guess it&#039;s always about finding that happy medium, eh?  Thanks for stopping by today :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Depends on your situation I guess.  For you, with a wife and child it would be smart to slow down and enjoy the little things.  I&#039;m a little younger and single.

					<description><![CDATA[Hope you guys enjoyed your holiday yesterday :)

@&lt;b&gt;Ginger @ Girls Just Wanna Have Funds&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Exactly!  I like that &quot;no opening laptop&quot; rule a lot too - that really is the key. When I can shut it off for the day and not check stuff throughout the evening (or worse - right before going to bed!) I consider it a win ;)  And all the iPhones and newer technology just make it harder with all their tempting! Haha...  hope you guys have fun out there!
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Woahh cool!  Do you live near the beach then?  Or you on vacay like our friend Ginger up there? Either way, good job on soaking in life yesterday :) I did end up working more than I wanted to myself, but once I was off the computer that was that for the rest of the day, and we all hung out with family and had some nice dinner at the end - it was awesome.  And I did my best to turn off my brain ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Trevor @ FN&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha...  well it&#039;s nice to see your name pop up here at least - it&#039;s been a while! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Wow really?  Man, I can&#039;t ever sit still long enough to try meditation, nonetheless jump into the woods in the middle of a project ;) Pretty awesome that you can do that though.
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s true too about some of us - we like staying busy all the time :) I guess it&#039;s just a matter of staying busy w/ work stuff vs. non work stuff, yeah?  It&#039;s that latter part I need to continue working to be better at.
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a good idea - keeping Saturday a non work day, I like that :)  Then gives you something to look forward to also since you know it ahead of time.
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!!  Did you go w/ family or kids by chance, or just you and the lady? Haha....
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - CONGRATS!!! That is awesome!! I&#039;d drop everything too for a huge opportunity like that, so way to say YES and go after it :)  That&#039;s so exciting!
@&lt;b&gt;DC @ Young Adult Money&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, yeah - I was even WORSE then! Haha... that was non stop from 6am to 2am every day w/ no sleep and no life ;)  So thank YOU for reminding me of that actually - I feel like I&#039;ve come pretty far since then!
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Crazy, right? Our boy&#039;s already 8 weeks old and sleeping in his own room now - a far cry from just 2 weeks ago when he wouldn&#039;t sleep past 3 hours in a row, and always had to be near us... next up, college! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MakintheBacon$&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, you said it perfectly: &quot;I feel sometimes I have to work, work, work while I’m young, so I can enjoy life later on. And then it’ll get the point where I’m burnt out, veg for a bit, get bored and the whole vicious cycle begins all over again. &quot;  That&#039;s me to a T.  I can go hardcore into work, then hardcore into relaxing and then feel bad for not working and get right back to hardcore work again ;)  I do think there&#039;s a lot to be said for working our asses off now though for a better tomorrow, I just don&#039;t know &quot;how much&quot; is appropriate.  I guess when we don&#039;t feel guilty in any aspects of life?
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that&#039;s the silver lining with all our &quot;work&quot; stuff that happens to be &quot;blog&quot; stuff - we enjoy it a lot!  It&#039;s only when we&#039;re forced to write or do something with them (maintenance, for ex) that it gets into &quot;errand&quot; time.... at least for me.
@&lt;b&gt;Country Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh that sounds cozy! Only thing that sucks about winter is not being able to take (comfortable) walks whenever you want to :( The one favorite thing in the world for me - I hate it...
@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... a man who always has a way with words, I love it :)  And excited to meet you in real life this week too - so make sure to say hi to me if I happen to walk past you!  I don&#039;t know how many bloggers will be there with mohawks ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are times when slow is good, and there are times when busy is good. I want neither one all the time. It&#039;s like chocolate: it tastes really good when you haven&#039;t had it in a while (like a few hours or so!) but if that&#039;s all you eat, it loses a lot of its attraction.

After a lazy 4 day Labor Day weekend (we cheat, what can I say?) I&#039;m looking forward to doing a few things again... like getting ready for Fincon12 this week! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love me some slow time. I find summer is just so busy, it&#039;s really hard to find time to slow down, but thankfully, now that it&#039;s Labour Day, I&#039;m preparing myself for my winter hibernation. Fewer things to do, forced to be inside, and more time to just take it easy and relax with a big mug of tea and a good book/movie.]]></description>
