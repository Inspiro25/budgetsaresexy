					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Serenity&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, thanks!  And yes you should TOTALLY write out that letter!  And totally NOT send it ;)  I&#039;m also super jealous you work at a bank, that&#039;s on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/10-awesome-jobs-to-try-some-day/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;list of jobs to try&lt;/a&gt; one day!  Woohoo!
@&lt;b&gt;Eugene Breacan&lt;/b&gt; - Do you wanna know a secret too?  I WAS blogging in my underwear!  (shhh....)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, dude - that&#039;s amazing!  After just 1 week???? I think it took me like 1 whole month, if not two, to get to 1,000 hits! Congrats! :)  Keep up the passion, my friend!
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahahhaa... that last line was the best: &quot;Thanks for lowering the bar so much that leaving made sense&quot; -- nice one, homegirl ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Drew&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Great calculations - hadn&#039;t seen that one before :)
@&lt;b&gt;thefrugallery&lt;/b&gt; - For real!  I mean, it still sucks and def. scary of course for that initial week or two losing a job (that&#039;s just human nature, right?) but as long as you can remain positive and focused there after, it&#039;s all down hill from there! :)  Thanks for stopping by - gonna go check out your site once I post this (love the name btw).
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, whatever you do DO NOT send it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, very cool!  Will you send me the link once it&#039;s up?  I wanna see what&#039;s brewing in that head of yours :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right? The &quot;lazy&quot; part was awesome.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - You got it!
@&lt;b&gt;Lisa @ Thriftability&lt;/b&gt; - Awww thanks so much! That means a lot :) And I&#039;m SO HAPPY (and PROUD) of you for dusting your shoulders off and getting back out there to kill it!  You&#039;re totally right - we all need to realize how much awesomeness we have within to offer people or jobs or whatever, and sometimes it takes a little motivation or pick me up from a friend to get us going.  I&#039;m so glad things are on the right track for you now, and looking forward to checking out your site! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Molly&lt;/b&gt; - WOWWW, I&#039;m glad it resonated then!  And also that you mentioned my turkey -- I did it like 2 weeks ago but no one has mentioned anything yet, haha... I thought it was fun ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Chris C&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez!  That&#039;s crazy!  But I hear ya on not giving up that good money -- a lot of people would stay till the bitter end too, and pocket as much as they can before they move onto Phase 2.  $hit, I did that as well for as long as I could, but the smart way to do it is to make sure you have that next plan in the works so you&#039;re not thrown for a loop the second they give you that pink slip. Until then, though, just keep banking that money!
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - That was my favorite part too, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;David&lt;/b&gt; - YAY!  Thanks man!  You&#039;re right -- it will be 1 year in about a month!  Thanks for always supporting me brotha, means a lot :) Both here, and on Twitter.
@&lt;b&gt;PKamp3&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahaha.... YES! That would be hilarious ;)  Though let&#039;s just pray they never come across it, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;KC @ PsychoMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Damn straight!  That&#039;s an excellent way to think about it my friend, and I&#039;m glad you&#039;re no longer doing &#039;em anymore too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That works too :)  &quot;I bought a house while you were still living with your mother.&quot;  haha, you&#039;re crazy, I love it.  Keep on killin&#039; it yo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You could combine this post to the one about spending being like a one-night stand (or exboyfriend, in my case).

Thank you for cheating on me.
I lost weight.
I enrolled in grad school and got my MBA.
I saved money (since you were unemployed and I was always paying for you)
I got back in touch with my real friends whom I neglected while we were dating.
I got a few nice promotions because my head was more at work when there.
I bought a house while you were still living with your mother.
I laugh when you text me that you miss me and you made a mistake!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This really does make me think.  I hated the jobs I had out of college, they really sucked.  But I do think I have to thank them and there suckyness.  If it wasn&#039;t for them I don&#039;t think I would have had as much drive to start something else on the side.  These horrible jobs are what pushed me to become what I am now. 

Great post]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been following you since well before you got laid off, and I have to say it&#039;s encouraging to see how much you have been able to accomplish through hard work and motivation.  Almost at your 1 year anniversary!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WOW!!!  Today I almost got the chance to write this very letter, skirted by another close call.  Details not important but I work a very mundane, micro-managed job for very good coin.  I am not ready to give up the coin end of the bargain just yet even though it will result in a 1000x happier me.  :-(

I will have to revisit this post in the coming months (SPOILER ALERT!)]]></description>
