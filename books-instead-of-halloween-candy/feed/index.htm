					<description><![CDATA[We’ve been doing this for 5 years. 
Diamond (one of the main comic book distributors) puts out special Halloween mini comics that are geared towards kids. We have a sign in our window that’s says we have “Comics Not Candy.” Parents love it, kids love it, and the ones that just want candy skip our house. 

This year we are switching it up a bit. We’re doing sheets of stickers (because our local shop ran out of the Halloween comic packs early). The sign will probably say something about sticky fingers.]]></description>

Hahaha...

Those $1 coins would be perfect for Halloween :) And for the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy too!! You might even turn them into coin collectors which of course trumps everything!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was a kid, there was a lady that gave out comic books. Loved that.

I&#039;ve been known to save the toys/books from cereal boxes and hand them out as my kids ate a ton of cereal but didn&#039;t want the prize.

I thought I was being smart by going to the bank to get those $1 golden coins to hand out. The neighbors&#039; grandkids loved them. One little boy refused to leave my porch until I gave him candy. I said, &quot;Where&#039;s your mother?!&quot; I finally shut the door on him because he kept arguing for candy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great idea....I got another one for you...different angle obviously!

My friends started this a few years ago and it&#039;s become a fun tradition.  They call it Sugar &#038; Shots and there is  the traditional bowl of candy for the kiddos but we also set up a table and firepit in the driveway and have a couple pitchers of premade Halloween themed cocktails, and a couple beer/wine selections available for the adults.  In just the 3 years I&#039;ve been participating, it&#039;s incredible to see the neighbors who plan their routes around our house (I have no doubt there are probably some that plan their route away from us too - that&#039;s ok). 

Apart from the tiny drinks, it&#039;s fun to see the community built.  Sure, the kids are eager to move to the next house, but this simple act, even for those who stop by but opt out of the adult treat, will linger an extra few minutes just to chat a little.]]></description>
