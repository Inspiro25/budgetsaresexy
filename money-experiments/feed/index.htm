Haha yeah, we like to have fun here :)

Totally try out a lottery experiment and then post about it! People love this stuff, and especially slamming tickets, haha... it&#039;s a sure way to get comments on your blog.

In fact, maybe I need to do another one too? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The no spending tracker is something alot of folks need to do! I am quite aware or my spending...I will put back a pack of gum if there are mints in my purse!  I try to get my fiance to do the same. A red bull or 2 in the morning=$7.00, asking his nine year old daughter if she wanted anything &quot;special&quot; from the gas station or store every time he went!!! $$$$$ on candy she didn&#039;t earn or appreciate. Of course it&#039;s not her fault, she&#039;s 9! I pointed out to him that there were  7 milkshakes 3/4&#039;s full in the freezer that he had gotten for his little girl, hmm let&#039;s say five bucks a shake and the fact she didn&#039;t truly want them and definitely didn&#039;t need them! Walking through every isle in Walmart...Just to &quot;look&quot; I was ready to kill him! Lol then I did exactly what you said and had him write down every dime he spent, and on what...He was even shocked and is so much better about impulse and convenience spending!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I did something similar with our mortgage.  For about 10 months, we tripled our mortgage payments so that we could extinguish our mortgage.  But, then my wife got prego, quit her job, and we had to go back to the way things were.  But, then we went to refinance.  And because we had paid off so much of the principle, our monthly mortgage payment was knocked down by 20%!  So although we weren&#039;t able to get rid of the mortgage, we were able to reduce it significantly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok...really enjoyed the list of experiments.  Some your still doing, some that you know longer do and always your results.  One of the many things I enjoy about your blog is your honesty....what you&#039;ve tried, what worked, what didn&#039;t, money saved, etc.  We are doing quite a few of these experiments currently....and the one that we have decided to kick into high gear is the mortgage payoff.  I have calculated by paying this sucker off in 5 years, we will save $235k in interest that we will invest elsewhere and set us up for early retirement.  Seeing those numbers is great motivation for us.... $336,161.06 is the current payoff as of today...everything extra will be thrown at this beast, including selling off a property with a substantial amount of equity.  So, that will be a huge help.  I&#039;ll keep you posted on this journey....this will help keep us accountable.  
Keep keepin&#039; on!!  You rock!]]></description>
