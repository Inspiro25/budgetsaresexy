					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Squeezer @Personal Finance Success&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah that&#039;s no good either!
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @My Multiple Streams&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch, sorry to hear!  But also, congrats on making lots of money! :)  My accountant told me I HAD to file quarterly unless I liked paying fees for not doing so, haha... so that&#039;s why I started doing it ;)  It&#039;s not as bad as it was last year when I was getting used to it, but it&#039;s never fun manually cutting checks for that stuff either.  I liked having it automated at my 9-5!
@&lt;b&gt;GB @ In Budgets We Trust&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! As if I needed even more reasons to like Hooters and Cinnabon ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I would be interested in learning more about VAT too - it def. makes sense on the surface.  I know I&#039;d cut back a bit if that were the case! :)
@&lt;b&gt;This Aggie Saves&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes!  Sorry to hear about your loss too, that&#039;s never fun :( We lost our last grandparents the past couple years too, I miss &#039;em!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhh good job!  I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d want to go into surgery to get around it, but way to go! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LifeInTransition&lt;/b&gt; - One of my faves too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha... you are good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was expecting to pay in so I did a lot of advance planning with donations and such.  Thank goodness for my surgery and retirement fund, because I squeaked out a nice $1000 refund instead of owing around $4000]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t believe my parents have filed yet, while I filed way back in early February.  They have some pretty complex estate stuff they&#039;re working through with the death of my grandparents.  I just hope they filed an extension!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m totally against getting refunds back (even though I screwed up somehow with my w/h and got some back this year) because of the way our society blows the money when they get that check back.  &quot;I was 2 months late paying my ::insert necessity here::, but look at this ah-mazing flat screen TV I got back wtih my refund!   Cha-ching!&quot;  

I&#039;m totally pro-VAT tax system and wish our country could adapt it.  You&#039;re taxed on your what you consume not what you earn.  I think paying 15-20% in taxes on your purchases would help people realize if they really NEED something or not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Taxes filed!  Yes!  I just heard that a lot of restaurants are having tax deadline specials, like two free Cinnabon bites at Cinnabon and 20 boneless wings for $10 at Hooters.

haha.  The jock tax and beard tax are totally unfair and crack me up.  Good list!]]></description>
