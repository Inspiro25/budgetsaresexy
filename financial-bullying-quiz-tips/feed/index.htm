					<description><![CDATA[My husband is a classic financial bully and it appears at this point he is also a thief. I’ve made about twice what he has over our 20 year marriage and he’s handled the money through most of those years. I became disabled 4 years ago and all of a sudden it’s dawned on me  now that the amount I was “paying” him is about 90% of my benefits that whoaaaa! How much have I “overpaid” you!?! This is the first month he is getting nothing and I don’t know how to go about this but it’s not going to be pretty. Thank you for validating the fact that it’s not just money trouble.]]></description>

Glad you enjoyed it ;) There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with one person managing the money of the household completely of course, but if there&#039;s anything against their will going on, or other non-niceties, then yeah - bullying is coming into play!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Super super interesting!
I often think specifically about couples where one person hands over their paycheque to the other person and I could never understand that has being a part of a healthy relationship but could never find the right words to describe it. Financial bullying is a really good start! And this simple quiz is so interesting and great to get people thinking!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I come across as a bit of a purchase checker sometimes when going through our budget but have eased off of that over the last few months. Hopefully I was never in the bullying category! I can think of a few couples I know where one person does fall into it unfortunately. I&#039;m talking about, no you can&#039;t buy that for £50 but I&#039;m buying this for £500 type stuff. Pretty extreme! It&#039;s tough to see but there isn&#039;t much you can do but offer some well intended advice and support if needed.]]></description>
