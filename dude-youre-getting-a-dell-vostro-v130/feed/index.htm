					<description><![CDATA[How do you make a good impression? Here is one way which is guaranteed to work. Do this and people will have excellent first thoughts about you! This is the key:

 When you meet someone (friend or new contact), greet them on the phone, or pass them on the street, act ENTHUSED to meet them! 

 ·Give them a &quot;winning&quot; smile. 

 ·Cheerfully greet them with &quot;hello (name)&quot;. Let your voice show that you are glad to see them! 

 ·Act like you are greeting a best friend who has been gone for awhile.

 ·If you walk into a group, greet or acknowledge every person. Look them in the eye. Either verbally greet them or at least make eye contact and acknowledge every single person.

 ·Greet your friends, contacts, and family the same way.

 ·When someone calls, say a professional &quot;hello&quot;. When you find out who is calling, act glad to hear their voice.]]></description>
