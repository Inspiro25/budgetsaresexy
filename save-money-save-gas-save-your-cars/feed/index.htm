					<description><![CDATA[This is one I definitely have to disagree with. In fact, highly disagree with. Research has shown that the time your engine receives the most wear is when starting the engine. This is why cars with highway miles are better off than cars that are used for alot of short trips. Turning your car on and off wears your engine out! I remember reading somewhere that each time you turn your car on, it is equivalent to driving 200 miles, in terms to the amount of wear on your engine. I think this is hardly worth the couple cents you save in gas!]]></description>
