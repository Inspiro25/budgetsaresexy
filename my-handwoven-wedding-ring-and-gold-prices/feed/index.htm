					<description><![CDATA[As I stood there with my mother, waiting for the jeweler to come to discuss my ring again, I was driven to answer the question...&quot;What are we going to do...?&quot; with, &quot;...gonna go through da clapper, crunch &#039;er up till she&#039;s a single piece o&#039; metal. Then we&#039;re gonna put &#039;er through the furnace, and melt her down till she&#039;s liquid iron! That&#039;s what!&quot;]]></description>

I&#039;m so sorry to hear that :( Since posting this I&#039;ve heard from a handful of others now too experiencing similar problems, so the makers of them have to pay attention sooner than later! Just crazy how they hardly last in the real world... Especially since we&#039;re not doing anything out of normal day-to-day use.

I hope your story turns out well as it did for us. My new ring has some scratches now, but is as solid as can be... no more fancy weaving for us :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I got very pretty, braided tri color gold rings when we got married 7 years ago. A couple years ago my husband started noticing broken strands of the braided gold sticking up and before he knew it a whole segment had fallen out. We chalked it up to his job (firefighter) and being generally rough on jewelry and I replaced it for him with a tungsten carbide ring so it would be virtually indestructible. But not too long after I developed the same problem so I would file down the burrs that were sticking up so they didn&#039;t get snagged on anything. Then one day the whole thing just came off. The braided strands were set into a gold band, very similar to yours, and the braided circle just came off the inner band. Now I&#039;m tearing the house apart trying to find the receipts because I ordered them online. My job involves a lot of hand washing but nothing else particularly grueling, although I did wear it 24/7. I&#039;m bummed and pretty annoyed. I can&#039;t imagine this hasn&#039;t happened to anyone else, but you&#039;re the only other one I&#039;ve found so far with a similar story. WTF?!]]></description>

I actually didn&#039;t explain it too well in this post, but the ring was physically falling a part. As in, pieces of it would literally fall off my finger and onto the floor. That still might make me a bitch as you&#039;ve keenly observed, but at the end of the day both the wife and I agreed it was the best move to resolve a shitty situation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow you are a bitch.  4 years and you replace your wedding ring?  with what? a cabana boy?  So you ring got funky after only 4 years.  Go get it cleaned.  You should be proud of the time that shows on that ring. 

Your ring is a symbol of you marriage and if you are getting it replaced every 4 years, what kind of symbolism is that?  You don&#039;t like it because with age it started to look funky.  I bet you look way more funky with age.  Some things in this world aren&#039;t just for decoration or show.  Some things in this world have meaning.

As a man if I came home and found out my wife replaced the ring I got her, the ring to the woman I gave up a bachelors life for,  The ring to the woman I grew up for, the ring for the woman that changed my life....I&#039;d be pissed.  And if I wasn&#039;t upset I guess that would mean that I&#039;m in a &quot;trophy wife&quot; marriage and I dont really care about her anyway.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love how a blog post can just get the ball rolling and make things happen! :) I hope they get everything figured out, you should never have to replace your wedding band if you don&#039;t have to. 
Someone (ok me) had a  brilliant idea to get platinum bands when we got married 10 years ago. My daughter found them on my night stand and wanted to wear them. When I found her, she had my diamond ring and earrings on the platform of the bed.  When I asked her where the other ring (wedding band) was, she told me it was in the bed (she was about 2).  We tore that bed apart and didn&#039;t find it. When I finally gave up on the idea of finding it, we went in to see what a replacement would cost from a chain store because we got it from Robbin&#039;s in the Philly area and we were living in MI at the time. Turns out the cost tripled in the 10 years we&#039;ve been married! I have an extremely small, thin band and it was going to cost more than the two bands and engagement ring costs us all together. Luckily, months and months later when we moved out of the house, my husband found the ring, wedged down between two beams of the bed when he took it apart, and it was right where my daughter said it was all along! Happy ending! :)]]></description>
