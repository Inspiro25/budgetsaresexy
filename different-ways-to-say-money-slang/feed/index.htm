					<description><![CDATA[A &quot;Shinplaster&quot; was a 25 cent fractional paper currency bill in Canada. It was issued in 1923. When I was a kid in the &#039;50s there were still some around at coin dealers.

But when I was growing up in Montreal, the 0.25 cent coin was commonly referred to as &quot;two bits.&quot; 

And in local French Québécois slang back at mid-twentieth century, a Dollar was often referred to as a Piastre.]]></description>

Same :)

In fact, I didn&#039;t even know it was another term for money until hearing the backstory!

Got a win right off the bat before even jumping into the blog and falling in love with it, haha...]]></description>

There must be a generational component to this vocabulary-- I immediately thought of fins, sawbucks, and double sawbucks.

Of course Generation Z would need a double sawbuck to have the same buying power as our generation&#039;s fins...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always been partial to doubloons, which sounds cooler out loud than it looks in print. It technically refers to Spanish gold coins but for real it&#039;s the money language of pirates and buccaneers! 

Another fun side note - I used to listen to this video game show on the college radio station and any time they would talk about money they would say &quot;fun dollars&quot; - I think for some reason never made clear they weren&#039;t allowed to talk about money so they would say fun dollars instead. Of course they always said it with the knowing sarcasm of college students haha]]></description>
