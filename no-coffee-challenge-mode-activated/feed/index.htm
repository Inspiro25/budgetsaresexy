Hahahaha... that was one of my favorite comments of late, appreciate that :) I&#039;m not always so positive, but the more I practice the easier it seems to be! And being stubborn helps out as well, lol... (you can be stubborn with positive traits just as you can be with negative ones! It&#039;s like interest! It compounds in both directions!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, I&#039;ve been following you and enjoying your posts for sometime now.  As much as I appreciate your posts I usually shake my head upon reading them muttering something like, &quot;This guy lives on the upper tail of the Bell Curve!  His attitude is positive beyond measure!&quot;  It&#039;s like you&#039;re an Olympic athlete speaking to other Olympians while I barely make it to the gym once a month, if that.  I&#039;ve yet to figure out how to join your exclusive club but I&#039;m not going to give up just yet.  Wishing you and your family all the best.]]></description>

you got that right! the motivation can work both ways - towards the positive or towards destruction. I much prefer the positive (though I&#039;ll admit a little destructive can be fun here and there too, lol...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What? I don&#039;t know what is more surprising that you were able to go so long without coffee or that you found over $20 in change on the ground! LOL. I agree though that good choices make more good choices easier. It is kind of like hanging out with the smart kids helps you make smart choices too. If you start having a positive attitude all of your choices will become more positive and sometimes that may take a lot of work when we have negative things going on in our lives but it is worth the effort.]]></description>

you can try the 100-day pushup challenge in between writing - that&#039;ll get you nice and wiggly again! &#128514;]]></description>

It&#039;s so silly honestly. I tend to sit way too still when I&#039;m at the computer and I feel like I&#039;m literally fossilizing. 
So yeah, writing is not an easy chore for me these days, nothing health-related, but I just have to get creative and take little breaks here and there. First world early-retiree problems ya know??
(and yes, thank you for the little nudge to get my butt back in gear!!)]]></description>
