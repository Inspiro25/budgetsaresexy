I&#039;m not opposed to leveraging debt for growth - I did it for 3 years while growing my old blog empire! (well, not debt, but scooping up online properties for better returns) - just don&#039;t have any decent opps to take advantage of it right now... Always have my eyes open if you want to pass something interesting my way? :)]]></description>

I would if the stars aligned, sure. I&#039;ve learned over the years never to say never :) (Or to block out any opportunities even if you weren&#039;t on the hunt for them!)

The biggest factor in it all will honestly be my wife and kids... it can very easily be 3 against 1 so might not matter what I want deep down anyways, haha... And if we&#039;re staying in one spot for the long term? Sure - might make sense. But as of right now I&#039;d rather punch myself in the face than get another commitment going like that, ugh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t help myself from checking in every now and then to see how you&#039;re progressing. There&#039;s something compulsive about progress reports. I don&#039;t know how you can resist having zero liabilities. I&#039;m always looking to increasing our leveraging and loans. Not to extreme levels but to comfortable levels. The greater the gross amount of assets you have working for you, the great the potential returns. Has worked amazingly for us so I hope you&#039;ll do something too and then I can see in a few months or a couple of years time that your net assets are at $1m. That would be cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweet post buddy! Thanks for sharing so much info. 

Do you think you&#039;ll ever own another house? Or are you a renter from now on? 

I&#039;ve owned a couple of houses but currently rent. I&#039;m torn on whether or not to ever own again. I&#039;ve seen some pretty compelling arguments for renting vs. owning. 

Thanks!]]></description>

Interesting! As odd as it sounds, I rarely pay attention to that part? But you&#039;re right - it&#039;s sexy as hell and I should! :)]]></description>

Congrats Alain! So glad you&#039;re enjoying the podcast too!

Way to go man! Love hearing about cash infusions into Vanguard - one of the best feelings there is :)

Totally hear you on the house stuff too, obviously. You&#039;re definitely right on the opportunity cost part, though mainly for me it was more about cutting off the responsibility and mental attachment of something I no longer cared about. It would be an even bigger win coming away with $$$ or even downsizing and saving $$ there too! So of course count me in on the side of you making moves :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like your monthly net worth reports, particularly that screen from Vanguard that shows how your capital values fluctuate like crazy, while your total dividend income is just super chill and stable, and just keeps accumulating..

Would you be interested in sharing your quarterly dividend income from now on? ( since your VTI pays quarterly dividends, it may make sense to do so). You may find that income stream to be super stable relative to the stock prices ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m constantly being tempted to seriously look into selling our house and investing the revenue from the sale (we have a nice buffer of equity) All the reading on opportunity cost has me running the numbers constantly plus I think either buying a smaller home or renting a home will cut my housing expenses significantly. My largest dilemma right now 

As for the Vanguards on &quot;fire sale&quot; , I transferred all my cash holdings and allowable transfers over from other RRSP accounts into my Vanguard ETFs over the last month plus buying extra for the end of my tax season. So with the shuffle and dumping my savings into the account I just added nearly $89K with the good people at Vanguard. Of that $65k was moved that took me from a 1.45 MER to the vanguard 0.19 !! That alone show net me 1% growth this year and love the projection of now of $4400 in yearly dividends to reinvest as the year grows. 

Let&#039;s wait and see how the world oil markets perform and of course the US election can always play with the numbers too.

Great job on your part J and look forward to seeing the changes in your assets now that your liability side is offset]]></description>
