&lt;strong&gt;@ The Roamer&lt;/strong&gt; -- Yup! We gotta keep on recycling it too - the world needs to see this :)

&lt;strong&gt;@ Master Nerd&lt;/strong&gt; -- That&#039;s a great question about underage taxes! I wanna say it *all* needs to be reported but I&#039;m no expert and I guarantee a huge % of the population doesn&#039;t do it... Keep in mind too that even when you report stuff it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean you&#039;re gonna owe any taxes. I think the gov&#039;t just wants to know?]]></description>

I remember seeing this when it came out, but it&#039;s still such an incredibly inspirational story. I think as we get older we become too paralyzed by fear to follow our dreams. I have aspirations to start a business eventually, so hopefully I will be able to realize that some day. Caine is a good reminder that success is all a mental game. If you can get past fear and be persistent, you can accomplish incredible things. It will be interesting to see where his career goes in the long run.]]></description>

LOL! Better crack the whip! Very impressive he was able to save so much and had the foresight to invest it (no doubt thanks to you). Random question, how does that work with taxes for someone underage? Do you have to pay them?]]></description>

Yeah, I&#039;m sure lots of kids are born with it but still doesn&#039;t mean others can&#039;t go out and rock it. I think MOST kids come up with business ideas at some point, but then it&#039;s up to their surroundings to help push them one way or the other. Namely parents and family. You could tell this dude&#039;s dad was super encouraging and helping him go, whereas others might not have been so attentive to such things. You can bet your sweet ass I&#039;ll be to my boys! I&#039;ve already got them counting and playing with coins at 11 mos and 2 1/2 - haha...

Hadn&#039;t heard of Super Business Girl before but totally clicking over to check out! Sounds intriguing!]]></description>

$1k - bad ass!

I recently read that most self-made millionaires have at least 3 streams of income:
