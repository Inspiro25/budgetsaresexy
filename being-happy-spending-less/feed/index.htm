Very fun!! A lot of good chatting and quality time too vs hitting a restaurant where you&#039;re stuck in your seats!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had more fun hosting a £50 BBQ on Sunday for 6 adults, a 10 day old baby, and a 9 month old dog as I would have had we all gone to a gastro pub and paid 3 -4 times that. Also, the baby and the puppy were probably happier! We played out own music, the guests only had to walk upstairs to get home (BLOCK PARTY!), and we had enough leftovers for two al desko lunches today.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing I find enjoyment in is going different places or areas and just walking around and checking out the different houses and business that are there. Or traveling some country roads and taking in the sights or maybe a beach area near the water. Pack a lunch or stop at a take-out sandwich/ pizza shop for lunch. Doesnt cost much and its fun to see other areas and how people live.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of a short conversation I had with my brother-in-law.  I was talking about the PPC websites that we use to make a few extra dollars.  He asked, &quot;do you pick up change on the street?&quot;  I never used to stop to pick up the pennies, but since I&#039;m putting in effort to earn pennies online, it really didn&#039;t make much sense.  Now, I take the time to grab change off the street, because every little bit does count towards paying off our debt and, eventually, building wealth.  

I wish I had learned about being &quot;just as happy&quot; years ago - guess I just need to be thankful that the epiphany didn&#039;t take any longer!]]></description>

I love your husband! And not just cuz he reads my blog :) Been checking out his blog now that it&#039;s out the door and think he&#039;s on to something good over there. We need more killer bloggers out there to better spread the word! So you give him a pat on the ass for me, if you will, and tell him J$ approves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a first time reader, but wife of dannymorebucks.com, a long time reader, and I&#039;m happy to see he&#039;s reading some great stuff over here! I 100% agree with the idea that simple/cheaper things really can make us just as happy and the big, elaborate and expensive stuff. And being happy is certainly the goal to this business of life. Very well put and a great reminder for me. Keep up the good work, my husband will be reading:)]]></description>

Rock on man! Never thought about the &quot;art&quot; of it all, but you&#039;re totally right. Though It is nice to dress up every now and then and feel sexy :) Reminds me that I still want to dress up in tuxes one day and just walk around the town one evening pretending I just got married or something, haha... I bet you&#039;d have some good fun doing that!

(and next time I&#039;m in your area, wherever that may be, I&#039;m totally coming over to snatch some of those beers off ya... gotta make sure they&#039;re safe to drink, right? :))]]></description>

HAH! That is awesome!! 

Never thought to withdraw it just to touch it, but I can totally see how that can lift your spirits! I used to get paid all in cash back in the day (story for another day) and was always able to save more of it since I could feel and understand how MUCH it was there in my hands... When everything&#039;s electronic it&#039;s hard to keep in mind just how real it is sometimes.]]></description>
