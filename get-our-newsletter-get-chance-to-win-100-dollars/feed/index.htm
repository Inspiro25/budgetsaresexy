I&#039;d treat myself to a haircut because I am on a new direction in life, one decided by myself when I endured major surgery 2/28 and developed a complication that meant 4 extra weeks off work, 10 instead of expected 6 wks. I haven&#039;t had a haircut,  not even a from in 14 months. I deserve it don&#039;t I? It would mean so much. This surgery was hard on me. I was scared. My boyfriend of 11 years lives 1 mie from hospital but didn&#039;t come visit me. I was heartbroken. I need a change and a haircut is the best way to show an outward sign of the inner me that overcame the operation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loving this giveaway idea, and the blog in general. Lurked for a long time, but this was just too good not to subscribe to the newsletter.

This $100 would definitely go towards the mortgage. My wife and I actively set aside lump sum payments towards the principal which. It feels good not only to see the principal drop drastically, but the impact it has on the principal:interest ratio is also encouraging to keep chipping away.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would use it to defray the cost of the trip I&#039;m currently on: a visit to my dad in Florida. He&#039;s 81 and I&#039;d rather go for a visit than a funeral. Used frequent flier miles on the way down but didn&#039;t have enough for a round-trip ticket -- and any ticket from Alaska is gonna be a spendy one.

Bonus: My sister arrives tomorrow and my brother the day after that. One-stop-shopping!]]></description>
