					<description><![CDATA[Also, if I absolutely have to get my nails done (for a wedding for instance) I use the Kiss press on nails. I&#039;ve made believers of friends after they&#039;ve seen me wearing them. They are cheaper than a regular manicure, stay on really well - I haven&#039;t had one fall off yet - and they don&#039;t damage the nails like regular acrylic nails do. Just soak in warm water and remove.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can make microwave popcorn bags yourself using kernels, brown paper lunch bags, and some vegetable oil. Put some kernels in a bag with about a teaspoon of oil, fold the bag opening up a few times, and put it in the microwave for 2-5 minutes. When it&#039;s popped, add your own seasonings. This is much cheaper than store brand microwave popcorn, much healthier due to not having the nasty chemicals, and not nearly as much work as making it on the stove. 

Other cheap things I do:

$1 movies (rental or $1 theater) - I can usually wait to see a movie. If it&#039;s good it&#039;s worth the wait. If it&#039;s not good then I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t spend $10+ to see it. Plus, if it&#039;s a rental then I can make &#038; eat my own homemade microwave popcorn - cheaper, healthier, better tasting. 

I stay at hostels when traveling. I prefer to eat out instead of making meals at the hotel, so I save on lodging instead. The exception is that I&#039;ll pack sandwiches if it&#039;s a road trip.

10 or 50 cent cards at the dollar store instead of $1-7

I get gallons of shampoo at Sally&#039;s. They last forever and are very cheap per use. 

Something I plan to do: Grow some flowers in a &quot;cutting garden&quot;. I love having fresh flowers, but don&#039;t buy them that often because even $10 bouquets add up. However, I can afford some pots and wildflower seeds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[YES! Well said.  Having that end goal in mind for what all this frugality means to you is important - and I must admit it&#039;s not easy...sometimes I save-save-save and then wonder after a few weeks WHY?!  I mean, I always understand the full picture of it all, but *stating* where this saved money is going is much better and motivational than just saving for the sake of it.  At least for me.  I&#039;m still not doing this as much as I should, but I&#039;m working on it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When we built our house 16yrs ago we put in central vaccuum. When the giant canister/tank in the basement is full we dump it. Does that count as 1 bag for 16yrs?!  At the time the system was a bit more than a really good regular vaccuum (maybe $700 vs $500?) but I think we&#039;re actually way ahead on saved bags and no wear and tear on the house. A fabric covered hose does no damage being dragged across hardwood and pulled past wood trim. In our previous house most of our baseboards and furniture had dents from being hit by the canister part being dragged around.

On an everyday basis we&#039;re so used to the frugal things we do that we&#039;ve stopped seeing them that way, until I see someone else doing something I&#039;d never consider doing, or someone notices and makes a comment.
We haven&#039;t had cable in nearly 20yrs, we buy used cars with cash and drive them until they die. We all pack our lunches and eat in restaurants only on special occasions (about 4-6 times a year). When we drive to visit relatives (6hrs each way) we pack a picnic lunch and drinks - no roadside fast food required. Most of our clothes come from thrift stores and we only buy when things are actually worn out or the kids have out grown something. We repair most things ourselves and only pay for a professional on a very rare occasion.  Nobody in the house gets perms, highlights, acrylic nails, heck I&#039;ve never even colored my hair.

Living as we do now seems normal and it&#039;s only when we pause to look at how others do things that we realize how differently we&#039;ve chosen to spend or more likely not spend our money.  I think the important thing is to keep focused on the big picture. Why are you living frugally? What will you do with the money you&#039;ve saved. Saving with no purpose or goal seems pointless to me. We travel with our children now and plan to retire early. Others might trade frugal choices in order to fund expensive cars, or other toys. They&#039;re not the choices I&#039;d make but that&#039;s kind of the point of frugal living to me. Know what YOUR priorities and passions are and don&#039;t mindlessly spend on the things your neighbours do. Most of us will never have enough money to have everything we want all at the same time, so you have to prioritize. And once you have, feel good about it and don&#039;t feel you need to justify to anyone why you choose not to have or do the same as them. I sometimes think others try to get you to spend just to validate the choices they&#039;ve made.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have reused vacuum cleaner bags too. It had nothing to do with frugality and everything to do with laziness though!

I reuse Vitamin Water bottles (ha, not frugal to buy that in the first place!) for regular water, but that&#039;s really just because I like those bottles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My mother once won a vacuam cleaner in an auction that she entered.  It was a super duper expensive and sexy vacuam cleaner. However, the bags was super duper expensive too!   Her solution was soe reuse the bags!

It was so strange.  She manually emptied out the bag by sticking her hand into that little opening at the top. She would take out all the grit and cr*p that she vacaumed up.  The odd part was that she was really proud of what she did. She&#039;d say &quot;look, this is the 8th time i emptied this bag!&quot;. 


She also used to make split pea soup for less than $2.00. Then she would say (as we were eating) &quot;this whole pot was less than $2.00! &quot;

Can she get the prize?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I guess I&#039;m not even close to being that frugal. And there are probably a few areas I could cut expenses in but at the same time--there&#039;s this thing called &quot;sanity&quot; and just &quot;living,&quot; right? I think that point of frugality could actually increase stress.

I agree w/ Megan and Lulu....it&#039;s pretty ridiculous. ;-) But to each his own!]]></description>
