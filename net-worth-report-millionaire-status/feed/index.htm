True true, if you end up *selling* it that is :)

I only like to count the things that are accurate *today* since I never really know what the future will hold, but I&#039;ve seen others adjust things like that to be more on the conservative side. Really just depends on your personality and what you&#039;re trying to get out of it all. 

There are some other things along those lines that I don&#039;t include in my net worth either that I&#039;ve seen others do, such as stock options or pensions or any other future income streams/investments. I figure they&#039;ll be incorporated just fine whenever the day comes when they start hitting the bank account, and for those that don&#039;t end up panning out, well, I was never counting on them anyways! Hard to tell exactly what the future will bring...]]></description>

Thanks G!

I started my journey towards the beginning of the last downturn, so shouldn&#039;t be anything too out of the ordinary for the next one :) Lots of good opportunities to be had if you&#039;re poised to take advantage!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[congratulations, J! That must be so exciting for you. I can’t wait until I join the club but might not be for a few years, sadly... it would be great to follow what happens during the downturn, I know someone’s already suggested it up here somewhere, too. I’m very helpful for you and the fam! Keep up the great work :)]]></description>

It&#039;s felt a bit icky at times to share the higher it gets, and sometimes it&#039;s embarrassing when things don&#039;t go as good (there was a 2-3 year stretch when I was leaking a lot of cash!), but outside of that no :) You get used to it over time and it&#039;s great for accountability!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Huge congrats! This is such an awesome post because it represents the endgame that all of us are trying to achieve - and you&#039;re there!

Stoked to dig into more of your content as I push forward on my journey. Have you noticed any cons to publishing income/net worth reports over the last 139 months other than the nervousness from your family?]]></description>
