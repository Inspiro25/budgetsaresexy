DAMN GOOD INSIGHT!!!

And scary too, but  yes - that can be one helluva hack from consuming so much for sure if made a point to remember with each shopping trip...

Really like this a lot and adding to my list to share later on the blog - thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a little flip to the financial empowerment game. Last year I walked in to a Fred Meyer department store and looked out over a sea of dresses, shoes, belts, hats, bathing suits, appliances, lawn furniture, outdoor games... you get the picture. And suddenly, I realized that it was all destined for a landfill eventually. All. Of. It. 
And just like that, I didn&#039;t want to buy anything.]]></description>

Oh man, I was afraid I&#039;d be a big softy around this myself when I found out we were having kids... But nope! Turns out it&#039;s not too hard to say NO to them :) At least at this age (5 and under)... Let&#039;s see what happens as they get older and more convincing - hah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great advice....my Dad was wise...he knew how to say NO, and I have appreciated that response so much through the years.  No is easy to say, but most parents can&#039;t handle saying it to their kids (then they wouldn&#039;t be Bestest friends)..Respect for your parents because of their wise decisions is much more admirable than being bestest friends &#038; being given stuff or $.]]></description>

I think that&#039;s the key right there - you have to be open and *ready* for something like this to really do the trick. Not unlike wanting to get your $$$ straight or lose weight/stop smoking/etc :) Gotta really WANT it bad enough and be ready to make moves or all the reading is pointless!]]></description>

Yes, J, yesss! Great taste and excellent write-up. I’ve been telling everybody and their mama about this book. I had heard about it before, but it really hit home for me this year. I bought it on the spot when it came to my attention again last month.]]></description>
