					<description><![CDATA[That is a good point, there is a correlation between financial discipline and the discipline required to keep in shape is pretty strong.  I have been trying to boost my discipline on both over the past year!

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic point Christine!  It really is true though and it would be a great investment.  I focused on the issue of &quot;fat&quot; weight for this article.  I know plenty of skinny people that weigh less than a feather yet are some of the most ragged people I know!  Everyone should be doing cardio and lifting some type of weights on a regular basis.  But, if you are trying to lose fat, it is true about the scale, it never lies!  I&#039;m in the process of shedding 25 lbs. myself and it&#039;s encouraging to see the numbers fall each week :) 

At the end of the day though, the purpose is to take care of your body for the long term, just like investments.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with most of your article. I have one quibble about the scale not lying. Sure if you&#039;re overweight and need to bring your weight down, it&#039;s a great tool. However, some people are skinny but with no muscle. Unless you have a special scale that measures body fat vs muscles, this skinny person is thinking that they are in good health because their weight is low. I think that a scale that measures body fat vs muscle is a great investment. It gives you an accurate picture of your overall fitness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jason- Yah, it really is!  At the end of the day, successful people know how to manage their time very well.  I bet most millionaires don&#039;t even watch tv.  I know I don&#039;t, partly because it&#039;s how I&#039;m wired haha.  In every situation I ask myself if it&#039;s growing me.  If it&#039;s not, I refuse to do it.  I never understood how short a 24 hour day is until just recently.  Time is a precious asset, use it wisely!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is anecdotal evidence for sure, but most of the successful people I know work out regularly.  I always marvel at how they have time to run multi million dollar companies, yet hit the gym regularly 5 times a week.  It&#039;s actually pretty inspiring.]]></description>
