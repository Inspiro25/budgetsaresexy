					<description><![CDATA[what was not mentioned... 
there is/are a smart phone app that will scan the ISBN of a book and research its price on-line. So I see several people at book fairs, thrift stores, yard sales, used book stores, and when libraries sell off their unwanted books using their smart phones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your side hustle with us, Kylie!  Helped out a lot while I was away on vacay :)  And all *great* info to know for anyone trying to get in the game!  I&#039;m too lazy myself (and just not all that interested), but it seems like you could really kill it once you got up and running smoothly.  Congrats on workin&#039; it!

@&lt;b&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s hot, man!  Wow, good hustlin&#039; over there.  Love that you made it a blogging experiment too - those are the best :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too am selling books. I have made several hundred dollars in the past couple of months as part of a blog experiment.
I&#039;ve mainly subscribed to those &quot;Book of the Month&quot; clubs. 
The most lucrative has been INSIGHT OUT.  You buy 4 books for $1 each, plus shipping and handling.
Then you are on the hook for two additional books, before you can cancel. 
For the $1 books, I purchased expensive photography books, which re-sold on Amazon for $70 each.  70 x 4 = $280. 
Then, I fulfilled the purchase committment, buying two $10.95 books.  They resold too.]]></description>
