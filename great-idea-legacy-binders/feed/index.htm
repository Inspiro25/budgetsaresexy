					<description><![CDATA[Hi J,

Thought you might be interested in this new &#039;Quarantine Project&#039; I&#039;ve been working on: https://www.freelegacybinder.com/

I&#039;ve been editing it for a couple years along with some financial coaches and FIRE folk, and I finally decided it needs its own site. Would love feedback from you or anyone else reading this.

PS - Funny story, because this was being worked on by only financially savvy people, it took several edits before anyone though to add a car loan!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Several years ago, I saw this concept come up and put together my &quot;Binder of Information&quot;.  I had printouts of my password spreadsheet, printouts of Doctor&#039;s bios, copies of insurance cards, Life ins docs, bank accounts and regular bills. I managed almost all of the finances. Last Fall the husband decided he was through with the marriage and I had the luxury of being able to move out first. I&#039;d get texts/calls asking about this or that and I kept referring him back to the binder. I was able to easily remove pages that concerned my assets and find the file on my car and left the rest for him. When I built the binder, I made sure not not only tell the Husband about it, but our 2 boys. I figured the one who woudl remember it would be the older son who is already out of the house. 

No I have a 3-pronged folder with page protectors where I keep all of my account and such. I was a cheap solution when I was unemployed. As it is, it will fit in my fire proof suitcase safe. I tried to regularly remind my 17YO who spends part of his time living with me. 

I also put the log in to my PC and my phone pin # in my password spreadsheet. I keep a copy on a cloud storage. Not account number, just a brief description of the account/website, userid and password.  I accidentally erased my latest version, so I am rebuilding it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post!

When my Dad passed in &#039;97, we had to hunt for everything. My mom said that she was going to have everything in order. Nope, that didn&#039;t happen. We had to hunt through her stuff too.

I have a Legacy Box, but I REALLY need to update it. Thanks for the reminder!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used the downloadable documents from that book to make a spreadsheet.  That is more my style than a binder.  But,  I have to say, this book needs a serious update, not just another publication year with virtually no changes.  It really has not kept up with the changing world.]]></description>
