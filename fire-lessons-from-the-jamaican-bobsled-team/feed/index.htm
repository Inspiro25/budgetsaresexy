Hey Fiona. Being a blogger i&#039;m sure you get a lot of laughs and judgement. But keep doing what you&#039;re doing my friend. And keep enjoying the process. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved the headline! :D 

And the mindset about buying a 5000 $ is spot on. 

I have just bought a tiny boat myself, and they are ridiculous cheap compared to just slightly bigger boats. Both in maintenance, insurance and so on. 

Really good article, will read it again some day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool Runnings is one of my all time favorite movies! The last time I saw it, was a few years ago, and I honestly never thought of the many lessons, as you listed here - which is awesome! The moral that resonates with me most is that people are going to judge you, laugh at you and make fun of you no matter what you do - whether you do something or whether you do nothing - you&#039;ll always be judged. So, just keep doing your thing anyway and make sure you love the journey. 

In the end, the journey really is the destination. 

Thanks for sharing!

Cheers,

Fiona]]></description>

Yep! No matter how well you plan, some things will take you by surprise. You can either spend your life complaining about it, or adapt and figure out how to move on another way.  Try bobsledding! haha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome:

&quot;Before the movie characters became bobsledders, they wanted to compete as professional sprinters. They trained tirelessly to become the fastest runners in Jamaica and believed their destiny was sprinting.

Then one swift accident outside their control shattered their dreams. They all tripped during the qualifying race and didn’t make the Olympic running team.

Instead of moping and feeling sorry for themselves, they rallied behind a new goal. They found a different route to the Olympics — bobsledding. They made lemonade out of lemons.&quot;

Sometimes unexpected challenges can cause you to pivot and try new things - which in the end, results in you going further than you ever thought possible.  Great lesson!]]></description>
