					<description><![CDATA[In my opinion, you&#039;re not crazy.  Look at other &quot;for profits acting like non-profits&quot; like TOMS shoes--for each shoe purchased here, they give one away in 3rd world countries.  Think of it as a &quot;not only for profit&quot;--you don&#039;t have to be a non-profit to do good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, not that I&#039;m aware of!  But you better believe I&#039;m going to mention it to him ;)  And actually, you&#039;d be surprised how many people think we&#039;re crazy doing this... (although way more are in favor, thank goodness!). We&#039;re creating something that doesn&#039;t really go together - a for profit business who acts like a non-profit - and it&#039;s interesting to hear the things that have come up so far. Overall though, things are looking pretty good and we&#039;re beyond excited to see what all these people can come together and do :)  So thanks for the love, brotha. Gonna go and check out your blog now...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there anyone that wouldn&#039;t love this. This is amazing! As soon as I get some income coming through I&#039;m definitely joining in. Who knew there are so many people out here that really want to make a difference. I am glad I got into personal development blogging. It has restored my faith in Humanity.
P.S. Anyone ever tell your partner he looks like George St. Pierre (the UFC Fighter)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s looking amazing J, (and totally stoked about being on the front page (an honour).

I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a million more hours gone into this thing than anyone might guess but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s fulfilling the soul -man, even I feel a buzz from it and I haven&#039;t pulled any all-nighters!]]></description>
