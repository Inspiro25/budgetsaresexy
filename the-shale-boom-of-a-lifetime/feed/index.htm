					<description><![CDATA[I agree with a lot of the comments on this thread.  I am a huge advocate for an anti-fracking bill in my state.  Just because you can afford to move away if they decide to pay you big $$$, does not mean that the damages aren&#039;t being done to the environment.  So, what...because you have money to move away, its ok to compromise the aquifers that your neighbors use for drinking water?  Money does not solve all problems - in fact it creates more than it solves at times.  People, especially in the mid-west, whom may believe that fracking their land for $$$ is their &#039;saving grace&#039; for more $$$ in their pockets have had nothing but problems and I am sure to this day, regret every second of it.  The consequences FAR outweigh the $$$.  Greed = no good and this fracking issue has a lot to do with that 5 letter word.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;jesse.anne.o&lt;/b&gt; - I bring it up for more of a dicussion piece than a journalistic one ;)  Which I love doing because people like you who are *smart* on the subject chime in and share! So really appreciate the links and strong advice, it def. helps w/ putting things in perspective.
@&lt;b&gt;Corie&lt;/b&gt; - Very interesting indeed!  Thanks SO MUCH for the long comment, that was awesome to read! It&#039;s crazy the amount of effects that occur when something huge like this comes into town... wouldn&#039;t have ever thought about traffic and full bars, etc.  Very fascinating!
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Wowww, it&#039;s def. changing things up!  I can&#039;t even imagine how drastic that would feel living in a smaller town like that.  Guess that&#039;s how older coal mining/gold rush towns must have gone through too eh?
@&lt;b&gt;jen&lt;/b&gt; - You got it :)  I love watching vids about stuff like this - it totally piques my interest. And I obviously have a lot more learning to do! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[sorry J$, I will have to disagree with you on this one.  not only is fracking a horrible, major damage to the environment, but it also is only a temporary fix for our energy consumption.  

the areas of northern PA where my friend&#039;s family owns lots of land - well it&#039;s gorgeous, untouched, and a last bit of beauty.  however, they&#039;ve been approached to lease their land for fracking, and while it hasn&#039;t been touched yet, they will lose their vacation home where their families grew up, all the memories, trees, houses, animals, all GONE when fracking starts.  all for a few hundred bucks a month?  not worth it.  maybe for the people who live there and earn very little.

please do yourself a favor and watch Gasland.  yes, it&#039;s quite biased, but it also gives a lot of great information that will open up your eyes.

xoxo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Stephanie

I too wonder what will happen to my town.  I imagine almost like a mini Detroit, just a disaster.

We also had an energy boom in the 80s that went bust.  My parents said their were pickup trucks for sale on every corner becuase people could no longer afford the gas.  People lost their houses, many sat vacant for years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Be careful what you wish for:

We Currently have a huge energy boom going on in Western North Dakota (Bakken Formation) right now.  The town I live in was about 15,000 pre-boom, now I would guess 25,000.  We simply don&#039;t have the proper infrastructure in place right now, it all just happened so fast.

Housing Prices have more than doubled in the last 5 years.  One bedroom no frills apartment that used to rent for $500 is now going for $1300.  Even if you are willing to shell out a large amount of cash for rent each month it is very unlikely you will find a place to live.  Many people are so desperate for housing that they are living in their cars.  

Our help wanted section in the newspaper takes up 3 full pages. Fast food places are so desperate that many are starting at $15 an hour.  These restraunts are having to reduce their operating hours becasue there is no one to staff them.

I don&#039;t know how people who lived on a fixed income are getting by.  Many are being forced to leave this town that they have called their home for decades because they simply can not afford to live here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Stephanie - From what I know, which unfortunately isn&#039;t too much, about the entire situation is that at this point there is not enough research and evidence to support what is actually happening to the water. My father in law, and a handful of others who live in their town, have land that the gas companies &quot;want&quot; and have been offered quite a bit of money for but they are afraid of the environmental impacts and the unknown. The majority of this town does rely on well water and as far as I know there are specific clauses in their contracts and leases holding them exempt from repercussions of the drilling. Could this change in the future if the leasees from the town come together as a whole to sue/take action if they find out their water has been contaminated? I&#039;m really not sure. I find it hard to believe that it&#039;s 2012 and there isn&#039;t enough evidence to support the damage that is being done (if the damage is as severe as some may think, again I unfortunately do not have any research to back up anything). 

I live in the Poconos and many people/companies/etc have been offered money and have signed contracts/leases with gas companies. Other people I know were in negotiation to sign contracts and the gas companies backed out because they found out that there were more deposits of shale in Western PA and the companies moved there instead. I guess this just goes to show that these small towns don&#039;t know when everything will &quot;dry&quot; up and like I said before I am interested in what, if anything, these people are doing to prepare for the inevitable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Corie - I, for one, appreciate the crazy long comment.  Like I said in my previous comment, I&#039;m not close enough to be directly impacted by this, I&#039;m just east of the Lehigh Valley area, so presumably I won&#039;t see any of the money directly.  But I&#039;m close enough that I might see some of the economic and environmental impacts, and I hadn&#039;t thought about what would happen to an individual town when the shale (and therefore the money) is gone.  

And I have to wonder if an accident related to fracking could result in a similar situation to what happened in Centralia.  Probably not exactly the same, with the underground fires (I don&#039;t know that much about the details of fracking though, so maybe?), but widespread contamination of the water could conceivably render an entire town unliveable, particularly if the majority of the town relies on well water, which seems to be common in a lot of the rural areas near me.  Are these companies willing to pay to relocate the residents of an entire town should this happen??]]></description>
