No, haha...

I want to be able to enjoy the things money brings instead of chasing it my whole life :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[to be honest, I have no plans of retiring. The side hustle millionaire mentality has me wanting to work until I get old and gray. The side hustle millionaire mindset keeps me going online because there&#039;s too many millions of dollars in long $ gUaP $ to be made in silence. Agree?]]></description>

I don&#039;t actually listen to podcasts much, but I&#039;m partial to Paula Pant&#039;s &quot;Afford Anything&quot; since I used to co-host it with her, and then there&#039;s also the SUPER popular (and for good measure) - &quot;Choose FI&quot; show.

Here&#039;s also a list of them when we polled the blogging community a couple years back:

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Cancel that, long-term, health-care policy. If you haven&#039;t needed it yet you probably never will.&quot;

Reminds me of our past situation. I was retiring in June. We had health insurance for 25 years. We would have no health insurance for July, but pick it up again in August. What could possibly happen in 30 days? Nothing major happened in 25 years! I wasn&#039;t able to retire in June. Good thing! In June my wife went in just to have an old lump looked at.  No big deal. That small lump had been there for 20 years. The lump was malignant and she had three surgeries in 10 days. You never know what will happen and when it will happen. Just like older cars, older humans also break down. Unlike older cars repair on older humans is very expensive!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha ha, a couple of these were totally me first starting out on my first &quot;real&quot; job post-college (as a teacher). The State was phasing out pensions and gave me 3 options for retirement, and I just picked one without knowing *too* much about it (although I got lucky and ended up picking the best one, even though I wouldn&#039;t really know that until years later!). I also just chose my index/stock ratios based on something I&#039;d heard Dave Ramsey stuff, and while there are definitely worse ways to go, I still could have been much smarter about things...as I learned when we got our retirement portfolios looked at by a professional last year :) Always stuff to learn!]]></description>
