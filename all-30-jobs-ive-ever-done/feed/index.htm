So fascinating to read!!!

Love seeing this stuff, and how different all our experiences are

You&#039;re definitely right - never know what life has in store for us! Even when we do our best to hustle and focus/etc.

Thanks for putting all this out there - was fun to read :)]]></description>

I think you&#039;d be better off hustling online ;) It&#039;s an open world of interesting possibilities, and if you can figure it out you&#039;d make much more $$$ than you can on the streets. And you don&#039;t have to worry about getting locked up!

					<description><![CDATA[I too have had over 30 jobs and just walked out on my last job a few hours ago, I have liked about 1/4 of the jobs I have had. I am thinking maybe drug dealer sounds good or perhaps call girl, something simple that I can make my own hours doing. The thing is, is that I hate boring jobs and people, so I am limited]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I&#039;ve come across this post several times over the years, and I finally decided to follow in your footsteps and create my own list! It&#039;s at a mere 28, but I&#039;m gaining on you! :)

Hopefully now that I&#039;m on to the writing/blogging/entrepreneur thing my list won&#039;t grow as quickly (this is a great way to do things). But we&#039;ll see! 

Thanks for your inspiration and I continue to enjoy your content.]]></description>
