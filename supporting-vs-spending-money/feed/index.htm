Weird!

The site is the same and nothing&#039;s changed, at least to my knowledge. I just went over and was able to click around to most of the pages, but you&#039;re right that some of them did not work - namely the &quot;donate&quot; page and the &quot;get involved&quot; pages. But I was eventually able to find a working get involved page if you want to ping them directly and go from there? They&#039;d LOVE new volunteers!!

http://sundarafund.org/?page_id=1054

You can also try them on Twitter which is where I ended up connecting with them:

https://twitter.com/sundarafund

Hope this helps!! Glad you like the blog! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there - 
LOVE LOVE LOVE your blog. Thanks for all you do.
I realize this is an old post, but am wondering about the Sundara organization. I love the idea. I have always saved the little soaps and shampoos from hotels when I travel and donate them to places that make hygiene KITS for people. But I love what Sundara is doing. I have a young friend serving a mission in Myanmar - and Sundara worked out there. 
My problem is nothing I click on on their site goes anywhere! Am I doing something wrong? Is there a new link you could point me to since this was an old post? 
Thank you so very much,
Allison]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely think this way. My area of town is pretty anti-development and was aghast when a Starbucks went in. I saw 20+ jobs for people and the ability to walk in to a lit building later at night if I felt that a person following me was a little too interested in me. I&#039;ll gladly pay my $2.15 for that privilege.]]></description>

Coin clubs are monthly meet-ups in your area where coin/currency collectors (known as &quot;Numismatists&quot;) come together and hang out :) Usually includes a presentation of some sort or an auction that benefits the club and the members buying/selling their coins.

If you&#039;re at all interested in coin collecting I highly advise you check to see where the closest one in your area is! It&#039;s pretty fun (and a nice break from the hustle and bustle of life too...)

There&#039;s also some coin blogs and forums online as well where you can learn a lot - here&#039;s mine though I&#039;m bad at updating it: http://cointhrill.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s truly important for us to drive our hard-earned money through channels that help us and others in various ways. We can&#039;t just donate and sit back.

					<description><![CDATA[Just remember to do a bit of research on any charities.

I need to be better about that with tipping. I ALWAYS look at it as an expense-expense, and tend to forget about who it&#039;s actually going to at the end of the day. Thanks for the reminder!]]></description>
