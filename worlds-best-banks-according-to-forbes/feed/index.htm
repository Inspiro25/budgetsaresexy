					<description><![CDATA[We use Chase, I remember signing up when I was 17 and got $200 for opening a checking and a savings account. I thought &quot;Wow! $200! I&#039;m rich!&quot; lol I&#039;m 30 now and still use them. Sure they do shady crap as do most of the big banks and corporations but I haven&#039;t had any issues other than them charging $12 when we made too many transfers from our savings one month.]]></description>

I think there&#039;s now one or two brick and mortars in the country (maybe more?), but I&#039;ve always done things online or over the phone/mobile app over the past 20 years...The only time it gets tricky is if you come across large wads of cash you need to deposit :)]]></description>

Dang - sorry to hear you&#039;ve had such $hitty experiences with them! I suppose all banks are bound to screw up a times though... although I can&#039;t imagine that&#039;s correct about the power of attorney thing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, I have access to USAA thanks to my Dad too. I&#039;ve only ever considered their car insurance but obviously, I need to consider their banking. Do you actually have a brick and mortar USAA bank in your area? Or is it solely online?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, USAA - really?  They used to be good - now I stay as far away from them as I can.  I&#039;ve left one acct just so I can pay one recurring bill that I want to keep separate from all my other accounts.  Their interest rate is awful.  Like all the other banks, they seem mainly interested in seeing how much they can get from you.  Oh, and power of attorney - forget it.  They will only accept it if it is on their form.  Stay away from them!  I have found them annoying to work with, which fortunately isn&#039;t often.  Don&#039;t believe the hype  - they have gone downhill A LOT!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hear ya on the investment side. It was convenient to use because it was all right there when you logged into your account. At $8.95 per buy or sell on individual stocks, I hated having to wait to save enough money to justify the transaction. Luckily, I found M1 Finance. Which I just wrote an article on  and why I’ll never invest with anyone else but M1.]]></description>
