					<description><![CDATA[Great examples of why it is so important to live in the moment and take care that you enjoy every single day. Do what you can to prepare for the future but also be sure to see and do as much as you can. 

That last comment on preparing for the future though, it is one to consider. I often think about how hard it would be to run my wife&#039;s business, I have no idea how to do any of the accounting she does or run her systems. Even something like that is important to think about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn’t agree more with that last comment! My husband (retired at 47) handles all the money and investing and though he keeps me in the loop about what he’s doing I haven’t made the effort (yet) to totally understand the ins and outs of investing. I turned 50 this year and all I asked for my birthday was a homemade version of the ICE binder. I now have a folder with all of our accounts - passwords are in an encrypted folder on the computer and detailed instructions on the hows and whys for each investment. Every minute detail he could add is in this folder. While it won’t replace him it will be a huge help to me and the kids if something should happen. It was absolutely the best present he could have given me. The trip to Portugal didn’t hurt either!! Oh and our dream is to live abroad somewhere before we die. We could go now but we made a promise to our kids we would not move until they finish high school so 4 years, 8 months, 3 weeks and 2 days but who’s counting!]]></description>
