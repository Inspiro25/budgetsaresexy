					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not mad at you JM but reading some of these comments just irritated me about certain people getting ready to yell at reps, sheesh. I appreciate  your wife trying to keep it classy. I&#039;m sorry for getting all emotional on your blog. I don&#039;t work for the airline or anything, just had too many of those types of jobs and its a sore subject for me. Anyway thanks for hearing me out J. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha --&gt; &quot;most corporations don’t have souls, they have rules and red tape.&quot;  i think they just like money :)  but yeah i&#039;m totally with you on not bitching out company reps and making it personal when it&#039;s most def. far from it.  you always get much farther being nice and calm than just straight up rude. 

although I&#039;ll also say that as a representative for your company, you&#039;ve also got to suck it all up and actually TRY to help the situation out -- even if it&#039;s your company&#039;s fault or not, cuz that&#039;s what your mission is there (and why they pay you the big bucks! haha...).  

at the end of the day we&#039;re all people trying to accomplish one thing or another, and if both sides can be respected and talk in a calm manner life would be a much better place :)  so if you catch yourself getting fired up like I did this weekend, be ready to step away and take a breather so you don&#039;t make the situation worse!  or better yet, as many of you have mentioned, find yourself your own Mrs. J$ ;)

					<description><![CDATA[First of all Customer Reps are disconnected A LOT from the way managers do business, so its not always their fault. What are they going to do? They&#039;re low on the totem pole. I hate jerks who call up and yell at us, we didn&#039;t do anything to them and its not my fault that the company changed things. Its a corporation and its not alive, most corporations don&#039;t have souls, they have rules and red tape.

I don&#039;t want to help the jerk that yells at me on the phone or in person. To all of you whom yell at lowly CSRs give them a break, they don&#039;t live to make your life miserable. We just want to go to a job and collect our paychecks. Its not like I woke up and said &quot;wow I really want to be a minimum wage CSR.&quot; 

I&#039;m only at that job because I NEED MONEY FOR COLLEGE. I&#039;m paying my own way through college. Oh and btw I&#039;m majoring in Accounting. I do have ambition. Anyway I appreciate your wife for acting nice even though I&#039;m sure she was far from happy. 

At EVERY CSR job that I&#039;ve ever had I was treated lowly by the managers, and they always act like we&#039;re dumb for asking simple questions about how the company works. Please give CSRs a break. At the end of the dead they&#039;re people too.

And is it a wonder that a lot of customer servicey stuff is becoming more computerized and electronic? I don&#039;t think so. People leave these jobs ASAP and companies replaced them with machines. Whenever I call Capital One I get an machine. I&#039;ve changed jobs recently and I go to a nice healthcare company who realizes we&#039;re humans and treats us with respect.

Even people who make minimum wage need that human respect. Luckily most customers we deal with are nice, we get some psychos but not often thankfully. Also these people are trained for maybe 2-5 days, they don&#039;t know everything about a company, most of them are students in h.s. or college. Older people don&#039;t usually have to take these jobs unless they have to. 

How do you expect someone who just got trained on 2-5 days work to know the ins and outs of a company? I&#039;d like for you people whom are rude to customers to go to one of these jobs and work at them for at least a year, then see what its like. You would be frustrated too. 

Once when I was at JCPenney during the holidays I got yelled by a customer because we got sold out and the JCPenney truck wouldn&#039;t arrive with more until next week. She was mad because if we advertised something on the paper we should have been selling it, but stuff during the holidays tends to get sold out. It was out of my hands. I seriously wanted to quit and walk out. 

I really wish people would realize that its not always the CSRs fault.]]></description>
