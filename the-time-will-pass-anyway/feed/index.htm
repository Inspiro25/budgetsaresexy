					<description><![CDATA[Great advice!! I started to get back into programming last summer after 15 years of switching my major to get out of CIS.  I thought that I would be too old to get back in there but with so many online coding schools out there and companies still having a high demand for programmers, it shows that it&#039;s never too late to start on something no matter your age.  Hopefully I can switch careers to a programmer this year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent timing on today&#039;s post along with &quot;Make an investment&quot; :D I&#039;d set a limit order almost 2 months ago, and have been not at all patiently waiting for the price to drop to my set purchase price. It did this morning! 

So my next investment thing was to move some more cash into our brokerage to make our next index fund purchase in a few weeks. 

Keep doing small things to set up the next days and weeks!]]></description>

Yup - that&#039;s because you&#039;ve probably lost interest! We change SO MUCH as humans over the years, so if you don&#039;t strike when the excitement is hot it&#039;s much harder to do later... I used to obsess about going to McDonalds every day when I was younger, but by the time I finally got my license to be able to do it I no longer cared anymore! Probably a GOOD thing in that case, but you get the point ;)]]></description>
