					<description><![CDATA[I think it may depend on the age of the kids too - I drive carpool and i am constantly telling the girls to buckle up - they are all around 15yrs old so I&#039;ve also warned them that if we ever get stopped and they aren&#039;t wearing their seatbelts they are paying the bill - as I would expect to my daughter to pay if she was the one not wearing her seatbelt in someone elses car - by that age they should be taking responsibility since they will be driving soon themselves]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The driver is responsible for the safety of her passengers. I don&#039;t put my car in gear until I know that everyone is buckled up, including adult passengers who say they never use seat belts.

Neighbor A (the driver) should have checked to see that all the kids were properly buckled in. That was her legal and moral responsibility. If I were Neighbor B, I&#039;d be upset that Neighbor A allowed my kid to ride while unbuckled. I certainly wouldn&#039;t agree to pay any or all of the fine, and I would not let my kid ride with Neighbor A for quite a while.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I were Neighbor A, I would:
-Tell Neighbor B what happened, but pay the ticket and not ask for money.  
-Tell Neighbor B (and the other parents) that if this happens again, their kid won&#039;t be allowed in the car
-Periodically check the kids&#039; seat belts from now on 

If I were Neighbor B, I would:
-Make my kid pay for the ticket, either with money or with chores
-Periodically check seat belts when it&#039;s my turn to drive]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the driver should take full responsibility here. The driver broke the law that made them get pulled over in the first place. It&#039;s a kid. They forget things and often don&#039;t listen. If I were the driver I would suck it up, pay the ticket and trust that next time my kid did something stupid my neighbor would do the same.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If it were my kid who caused the driver to get the ticket, i&#039;d offer to pay for the ticket and make that rugrat work it off in chores!  My kid would also be in BIG trouble--I&#039;m a firm believer in seatbelts.  And doing what you&#039;re told--it was how I was raised, a good, polite Southern girl. 

But if I had gotten the ticket, NO WAY would I ask for half from my neighbor.  I would probably stop driving that kid to school, though.  Little troublemaker...

I guess I blame the kid for not following directions, plain and simple.  :)  Can you tell I don&#039;t want any (for the moment)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think there should be much of a debate here. The child&#039;s safety became the responsibility of the driver the moment the child was inside the car. It is her responsibility to check if her passengers are all buckled up for safety.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OH SHELL NO!  Sorry, but the driver of the vehicle without a doubt should pay.  I remember as a kid my friends parents would not drive until they saw all of the passengers (my fellow loud and annoying friends) buckled.  Like you said, the choice is CA-LEAR!]]></description>
