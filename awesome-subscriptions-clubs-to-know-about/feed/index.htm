					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jeremiah Brown&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, go for it!  Glad you enjoy the site my man, means a lot :)  I think they DO actually have some sort of an affiliate program  (I forgot to sign up to it), so you def. should if you write up the post :)  Def. fair to get paid for spreading the good word!
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Oh for sure, when it comes to music any money spent is worth it, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love my subscription music from Rdio. I pay a whopping $5.64CDN a month  (which is about a whopping $5.65US) and I get the choice of streaming millions of tunes. I like it cause I&#039;ll have a music craving and I don&#039;t have to pay a buck or whatever it costs to buy a song. I am quite happy to streaming music for a flat rate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the dollar shave video, wow. I&#039;m gonna have to sign up for that one myself. I usually use an electric razor, however, once or twice a month I have to use a real one to trim around the edges a bit. My wife would probably use them as well. Thanks for the post, love your style of writing and am going to follow. Maybe I&#039;ll make a post on my blog about those as well. Do you get any affiliate commissions from any of them?

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Beating Broke&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhh really?  NO scratch tickets there?  AND a lottery subscription?? I have a new respect for ND now! Haha... (well, regarding the latter part of course. No scratchers is a no-no in my books ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Megan Cassidy&lt;/b&gt; - YES!!! I&#039;ve heard about that before actually - women love it!  And you just gave me a DAMN good idea for a future present for someone ;)  Haha... THANK YOU!!
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s the downfall of all this stuff - that it&#039;s recurring.  But a lot of it is already recurring anyways if you manually have to go out and get anyways every month ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt; - Crackers?? Haha... you crack me up :)  Awesome you got the razors going now!
@&lt;b&gt;Sandi&lt;/b&gt; - Woahh really??? Man - they ARE on to something!  Let us know how they are when you get them :)  It&#039;ll be a while &#039;till I shave my beard off probably...
@&lt;b&gt;Sam&lt;/b&gt; - COOL!!  I&#039;d love that gift so much :)  I&#039;ll have to check and see if we have one here in our state, but I&#039;m also afriad of it all cuz I know I&#039;d sign up to them all!
@&lt;b&gt;Squeezer&lt;/b&gt; - Hmmm.... good point.  I know when I bought that crazy $40 bottle of Bling H20 water a while back, they shipped it mid-winter and it froze and then broke in transit, and they had to ship me another one.  I think they quickly figured out they needed to tweak something, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Money Infant&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Yes, go for it :)  Never even knew they had a cheese or olive oil subscription, amazing what I&#039;m learning about this week!
@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, you&#039;re not joking. My wife got Prime for free cuz of school or something, and she&#039;s alwayyyyyys using it and telling me how awesome it is.  If I could xfer over all my credit to her account I would have done it forever ago!  But they don&#039;t allow it :(  Probably for reasons like this ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know Amazon Prime doesn&#039;t exactly fit with the rest of these subscription clubs, unless you want to call it the get whatever you want online and ship it in 2 days for free (even for huge / heavy items!!) club, but that&#039;s the only one I&#039;m a part of now. Subscribe and Save was awesome while it lasted, but it&#039;s been taken away from everything I used it for, too.

I tried to get signed up with a grocery service, but couldn&#039;t find one in my area.. hopefully some are coming to the rescue soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been on a cheese subscription before as well as an olive oil subscription.  Wow that was good eating times!  Nothing like that going on here in Thailand so maybe I&#039;ve just found a niche business opportunity?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a lottery subscription! I got it as a gift a few years ago. I live in Vermont and I was able to choose the numbers I wanted and every week those numbers were my numbers for the megabucks. If I won less than $5 or some nominal amount my subscription would be extended for another week or whatever, and if I won anything over $5 I would get a check in the mail. I never won much, but I got a few free tickets/subscription extensions. I dont really gamble, so its nothing I would have ever bought for myself, but it was a neat gift.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We signed up for the razor one which are supposed to ship 3/21. We also have a few things on regular delivery through amazon (arnold palmer mix, beef jerky, facewash that i cant find local, and crackers). We also do prescriptions just because its required. I like that we dont have to think about those things.]]></description>
