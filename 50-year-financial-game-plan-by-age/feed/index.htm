					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - Goooood luck!!! You can do it!! And I LOVE those 3 goals btw, they&#039;re 3 that are on our master list too, hehe... great minds ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Against the rat race&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.... so you&#039;re saying you can&#039;t meet any of these goals up there and still live a nice life?  I might have to disagree with you there ;)  But I do see your point - no use in saving and getting hardcore about money for 60 years only to spend the last part of your life enjoying it.  I think there&#039;s def. a happy medium there that can be done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[24..... This article PROMOTES the so called rat race!! This financial life seems extremely boring &#038; stressful. We should NOT strive to live like mediocre people, just seeing each &#038; every day pass us by. I see 0 dreams, ambition, passion, hard work, risks (and rewards), creativity, experience. I am aware that it is a &quot;budget&quot; article and not a life story one but still, come on! Live a little!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a few days behind on commenting but wanted to jump in the conversation regardless! I&#039;m 26 and I&#039;m in way better shape financially than many people I know -- I&#039;m contributing 10% of my salary to my 403(b) and putting away around $200/month into savings. What&#039;s frustrating to me is that my husband and I live pretty frugally and we really only have a few big life goals -- adopting kids, buying land, and building our own house. But I feel like we are still WAY far away from being able to afford those things, partly because we both work in low-paying fields (education and food service). We are both going to ask for raises this year, so wish us luck! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re def. on track now :)  So awesome if you can pay off that card this year and snowball that $$ into the other departments! I&#039;ll send over some happy thoughts that nothing too major blows up beforehand for ya ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MoneySmartGuides&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, you&#039;re right on that one!  Only problem is you usually get your first real apartment and bills then too - which sucks out a major part right from the beginning.  But if you can work it and slowly easy more into that, then yeah - you&#039;d def. be better off (financially) in the long run.
@&lt;b&gt;Laura&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats on being a new parent soon!  When is he/she due?  We&#039;re super excited for ours to come out in July, but man - have no idea what to expect in the money dept there, hehe... I&#039;m glad your husband found something he really enjoys! A lot of people can&#039;t say that :)
@&lt;b&gt;rae&lt;/b&gt; - Hey Rae :)  Sure, I can tell you that it&#039;s a lot easier financially to start having a family later in life than before, that&#039;s for sure - at least in our cases. 4-5 years ago we were just doing enough to get by and not really paying attention much to our finances, which would have made things a bit more scary for us in that case.  On the other hand, I feel like the longer you wait, the more you get INTO your career and are really taking off, so the idea of stopping or pausing for a bit while you have a kid, and then easing back into it gets a bit trickier.  At least those are the thoughts going on in my head right now... like, better to be a workaholic later in life than earlier while trying to raise your kids :)  I also must add that as a guy, in his 30s, I&#039;m a LOT more reserved than I was in my 20s - esp with going out and partying and all that kinda stuff, so that prob. makes it easier/better to have kids too, haha... but I&#039;m sure I would have curbed my ways had we got pregnant much earlier on ;)
@&lt;b&gt;C The Writer&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes - sorry! Not sure what happened to it - I checked spam and other folders but wasn&#039;t there either :(  Thanks for trying again!  And you&#039;re right, this timeline doesn&#039;t really address those who are making the same, and at a lower rate, the entire time.  But I think that&#039;s also the point -- people always need to be striving to improve and learn/make more so that they CAN end up saving more and paying off debt/etc etc.  Although I will say this - If you&#039;ve managed to get by on $8/hour your entire life, then you obvoiusly don&#039;t NEED a ton more to survive since you&#039;ve mastered it at that point ;)  Barring any major catastrophies really.  But in my honest opinion, I&#039;d do whatever it took to bring in more money as the years go by so you can live a much more free and stressless life - even if it&#039;s hard as hell to get started on that.
@&lt;b&gt;Chris from DC&lt;/b&gt; - Go for it brotha!  And I wave hi to you here in the DC area too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just turned 24 and I&#039;m already accomplishing the yr. 25 milestone.

Technically I&#039;m 2/3 of the way into the 27 yr step as well since my former company got bought out at almost exactly my 1 year point at company 1....now everything is changing over. 

Guess I&#039;ll start working on 30 ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you were 30 in 2009, your profile page is a little outdated (states you are late 20s...)
Also, sounds like you are around 33-ish, care to post your thoughts on starting a family &quot;later&quot; in life.
I&#039;m 27, way above where I should be now according to this magazine&#039;s post, hubby is still growing his career so we have options for a family in the next 3 years. 
What are your thoughts of starting after 30? Any suggestions about the trials and pain that come with trying to start a family and how that relates to your financial planning?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kinda love and hate articles like this :)

My husband and I are NO WHERE near where it says we should be at 30 &#038; 31. We have had our share of situations that maybe kept us from being where many people our age our (husband is on his second post-doc and our 3rd move) on top of that we are about to be parents so its not likely there will be dramatic changes for us in the near future. Well not dramatic POSITIVE money changes, ha! One thing about our situation that might be a bit different is that I know my husband LOVES what he does and with that comes the fact that it isn&#039;t because of what he gets paid to do it. I know he would pick passion for his work over a bigger paycheck every time and I support that. I kinda doubt that he would want to retire early so that is a good thing in our case :) With all that said, this is a good reminder for us to bump things up where we can and take it as some encouragement and not get down about not meeting some criteria.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m turning the big 4-0 this year, and my breakdown isn&#039;t quite on par with this...

Savings &#038; retirement plan: $60K 
IRA (from a previous job S&#038;R plan): $4K
(about $10K short of the 2x salary)

Refi&#039;d my mortgage to 20-year 4% interest last year, currently owe $77K. 
Used car loan at 2.9%, currently owe $9K
Student loans at 6.5%, currently owe $11K
Lingering credit card debt (boo) at 11%, currently owe $1,700. Tax refund went straight to this, and I&#039;m expecting some $$ to help bring this down further. It WILL be paid off this year!

And I&#039;m trying to save for a trip to the UK next April - $300/month, because the cost will run about $3K if I hit all 4 countries. 

I still worry that I won&#039;t be out of debt (literally all debt, including the mortgage) by the time I&#039;m 60. I should be if I stay on track, and I&#039;ve only improved every year since I got on the PF bandwagon...it&#039;s just discouraging when you think you&#039;re ahead, and the car gives up the ghost. Next up will probably be the fridge and/or the washer/dryer combo. *sigh*]]></description>
