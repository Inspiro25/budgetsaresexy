But seriously, I&#039;m proud to be your friend, man. We got this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again, Nate, for allowing me to spread your story around!

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Crystal.  There is a quiet intensity with you that can be intimidating at first. But this story...very inspirational.  I&#039;m constantly harping about poverty and escaping poverty on my blog.  With so many people now below the poverty line EVERYONE knows someone that is poor.  They just don&#039;t know it because these people struggle quietly.  Thanks for persevering.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@kody - Life-long learning is right. Sometimes I tell myself (somewhat trying to convince myself, ha) that there is no failure as long as you learn along the way. So you now have only two options: succeed . . . or learn.

@Sense - So many people have told me this - that you can&#039;t take care of others if you don&#039;t take care of yourself first. And after many years, I&#039;m finally learning. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great story! 

It&#039;s hard to take care of others to the best of your ability when you can&#039;t care of yourself. I very much admire people like yourself that are that self-less, but then again I worry about them because they are the ones that continually put themselves last. You can do more good when you aren&#039;t worried about where your next meal comes from or how you&#039;ll pay your bills.

It&#039;s hard to say that sometimes, though, because if you hadn&#039;t gone through what you did, you probably wouldn&#039;t be where you are right now. Good to hear you are back on track and working on the debt. You know you have a huge network of people that would be more than willing to help you out if you ever needed it again, right? :) I love that debt donation idea for you, too. You deserve a little karma kick-back, even though you probably would try to give it away again once you got it. Haha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love reading articles like this because they remind me how life is a non stop learning process. 

I appreciate you telling the world about the things you have learned in your adventure. Therefore, i really enjoyed the following. 

Always keep track of your finances - This seems like common sense but how many times do us Americans loose track? I see it all time. Including my own parents. its very sad but true. 

Continually build - In my opinion this is the most important thing you learned. Why? Because if you don&#039;t consistently build (no matter what it is in life) , you won&#039;t make progress. Therefore, if you don&#039;t make progress you&#039;ll obviously fail.  Plain and simple.

Follow your heart, even if you don&#039;t know where its going - This is very true. Following your heart is VERY important. This will not only help you make a run for money, but it will help money make a run for you as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Dr Dean - Haha, thanks man! And yeah, I&#039;ve had my fill of road trips with J$ this year . . . though I gotta tell ya that we love doing &#039;em!

@Hunter - Appreciate it, man!

@bethh - Yeah, it&#039;s not always peaches and gravy when you try to do your own thing . . . but there&#039;s always something good you can take away from the experience.

@eemusings - You know, there are plenty of days that I don&#039;t enjoy the hustle either, and it&#039;s hard work, but when it&#039;s all said and done I always feel like I need to be doing something . . . 

@Ashley - Thanks, girl!

@Lauryn - Thanks so much, Lauryn - I appreciate it. 12.5 hours straight, yuck! My head starts hurting after 9, usually. :-/

@Ms. S - Okay, thank you too, haha

@Crystal - And thank you for supporting Love Drop as well, you know we couldn&#039;t do any of the things we do without you guys!

@Sarah - Was it only a year ago? Feels like longer. I could use a Bombers burger right about now, too. Stuffed &#039;shroom, mmmm... :)]]></description>

Crazy things can happen in a year.  Gains, losses, new people, new experiences and new appreciation/gratitude.  :)  Hope you visit us back in the midwest soon]]></description>
