					<description><![CDATA[I’m just as happy…. watching a movie at home than going out to a disco
I’m just as happy…. taking my nieces/nephews to free museum days than showering them with presents
I’m just as happy…. decluttering unneeded stuff in the house than going shopping during sales season just because it&#039;s sales season
I’m just as happy…. travelling to cheaper underrated destinations with little tourism than expensive highly recommended destinations with lots of tourists
I’m just as happy…. staying on an simple Airbnb than a expensive hotel
I’m just as happy…. having friends over for dinner than all of us eating out
I’m just as happy…. doing regular exercise at home than paying for a gym
I’m just as happy…. going for walks wandering around unknown neighbourhoods near me than only waiting for me to be travelling abroad to do that
I’m just as happy…. enjoying the hammock in my sunny balcony at home than paying for an escape hotel retreat
I’m just as happy…. eating own-brand tasting desserts than going out for that same dessert
I’m just as happy…. spending holidays at home than going abroad for holidays]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A really good position to be in :)

Need to try that coffee in bed idea too! Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever done that?!

Last week I randomly started drinking BEER in bed while watching The Bachelor with my wife at night, so that was a new one for me, haha... Maybe coffee would be just as fun?]]></description>
