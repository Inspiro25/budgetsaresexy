					<description><![CDATA[I just went back, as I have saved this e-mail and on June 6th I posted my total was at around 120.00. Well it is only August 7th and I am 55.00 ahead of that. My new total is 177.00. I start mine on Jan 1st and end it on Dec. 31st. My husband tells me to get a &quot;HOBBY&quot; but this is the cheapest &quot;HOBBY&quot; i could find. LOL!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just came across this post and it has to be one of the best posts I&#039;ve seen in a long time. It reminds of &quot;The Office&quot; when Michael thinks he sees a quarter under Stanley&#039;s car and get gum in his hair. That scene makes me rethink what everyone is thinking around me when I see change on the ground.... but I still go for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG! My friend referred this to me. Twelve years ago my friends father told me he use to keep a change jar. He started it on Jan 1st and would keep it until Dec 31st and then count it. I loved the idea and every year I have found over 100 dollars. The best places are drive-thru&#039;s just pull a little away from the drive-thru so you can open your door and get it while they are completing your order. lol. I know this sounds crazy but one of the greatest places is at interestions there are so many accidents there and the police and ems dragged the injured out of their car while all along their change is falling out. Sounds Crazy but 20 of my friends are playing and I have yet to be beaten. It is now june 6th and I am already up to 120.00 call it OCD but I cant stand the kids at the school that i work at that just throw change in the hallway.Thank you so much for posting this article people just laugh but then again they are the ones asking to borrow money from me. LOL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was growing up, there was a nice old guy that lived right in town that always walked around looking for pennies. I used to throw some down on my walks so he could find them.
Now that I know he is long gone, my son &#038; I are always looking and finding change. It is amazing what you might see if you just look down!  

When I was in college, I could find enough money just walking across campus to buy a pop or candy bar by the time I got to the student union. And my roommate &#038; I would search the couches &#038; chairs in the student commuter lounge (when noone else was there) and always found money, lol.  

Not long ago my daughter lost her $10 bill in Walmart...she had traced back over her steps and was unable to find it. She was very upset about losing it. But I told her that I was sure that she made someone else&#039;s day...and maybe they really needed that money more than she did...Who knows?! But it nicer to think that you helped someone else out than to dwell on the fact that you were careless &#038; lost all your money ;)]]></description>
