3. What do you do there? (task-wise, or job title) - Architect (licensed and legal)

					<description><![CDATA[How long have you been at your current job? 4 years

    Are you happy?  Not really.

    What do you do there? (task-wise, or job title)  I am the Director of Public Relations &#038; marketing for a Chamber of Commerce - I do way too much - Chamber Marketing, PR, Advertising, Graphic Design, Website, Event Marketing, Writing, and Sales.

    How much do you get paid to do it? (feel free to be anonymous!) - I make $22,695.40 a year. Which is a great increase since I made 17K for the three years prior when I worked there, but honestly - it&#039;s still not enough

    What’s the craziest thing that’s ever happened there?  I&#039;d have to say nothing, we&#039;re pretty boring!

    *Extra Credit: A magical genie grants you 1 wish to change jobs – you can choose anything in the world. What would it be? (money is good regardless) - I wish I could answer this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I already posted, but I just wanted to say how awesome it is that there are a ton of women engineers posting here! It&#039;s soooo rare to find women in engineering in the working world - so all the smart ones must congregate here :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.  6 years.
2.  Nope, it is the definition of a dead end job.  That&#039;s why I am actively switching over to blogging full time by the end of this year.
3.  I am half customer service and half data entry.
4.  $35,500 a year before taxes and benefits and $25,500 after...but I am making an additional $1000-$3000 a month from blogging already...I am trying to grow that into a consistent $2500 a month or more.
5.  A hawk flew into our window and lived.  It is not an exciting job. 

*Extra Credit: My realistic dream job is to be successful at blogging from home as planned.  My if-I-had-a-genie dream job would be to be paid to volunteer with animals or the elderly.  I am starting to volunteer with Meals on Wheels and have volunteered with the Houston SPCA for 4 years now.  I was also a foster parent for Pugs for 2 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. 2 years and 3 months
2. I&#039;m happy most of the time. Unless the weather is bad or I have to stay late!
3. Walk around, take pictures, and write reports
4. My salary is $58,000 a year, with overtime last year I made almost $70,000
5. Crazy stuff happens all the time!  No one takes to job TOO too seriously.  Which is why I&#039;m happy about working here most of the time. 
6. I&#039;d like to have a farm that is as self sustaining as possible. I&#039;d have a lot to learn, but it&#039;d fill my days with joy for sure!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. How long have you been at your current job? 2 years, 2 months.

2. Are you happy? Yes and no. I work with great people who do amazing things, but I don’t excel because I’m bored. The job has a lot of opportunity, but it’s 160 miles away from my hometown and I hate living in Sacramento, where my job is located. I’m here because there isn’t much opportunity in my hometown. Also, I’m underpaid. 

3. What do you do there? (task-wise, or job title) I do administrative work to help surgeons do research, teach residents, write textbooks, and stay licensed. 

4. How much do you get paid to do it? (feel free to be anonymous!) $35,214.40 per year.

5. What’s the craziest thing that’s ever happened there? Some of the groundbreaking surgeries that I get to watch my surgeons perform. 

6. *Extra Credit: A magical genie grants you 1 wish to change jobs – you can choose anything in the world. What would it be? (money is good regardless) Owner and manager of a horse barn, or real estate investor with a substantial property portfolio. Both of those are part of my long term plan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww, that sounds absolutely horrible I&#039;m so sorry!  I agree that being nice and thanking the reps is VERY GOOD though.  I used to do calls too at my old gig and it makes things SO much worse when you call in yelling and screaming when you&#039;re asking for HELP!  It makes no sense really.  Why would you piss off the one person who can help you?  But yeah, good for you for applying to 3 jobs! I hope you really did it ;)  $39k does seem high for that role so a least that&#039;s something... fingers crossed you find a better one!!
@&lt;b&gt;blue&lt;/b&gt; - Ewwwww!!! haha... that is GREAT you weren&#039;t there for exploding toilets, haha... nasty.  I hear ya on the CEO spot, although I couldn&#039;t handle that pressure or stress.  I&#039;d rather just crash the parties as an internet mogul instead ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Steve&lt;/b&gt; - That is great, my man!  Nice salary and a nice life - congrats :)  Any tips for us youngin&#039; out there to reach the same level?  Have a great week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. How long have you been at your current job?  20.5 years.  I know because I get an additional company allotment to my 401K and after 20 years it goes from 5.5 to 6.5%.  Makes turning 50 easier if I am looking at retirement in the next decade.
   2. Are you happy?  YES.  Great wife, two great kids and a nice place to live.
   3. What do you do there? (task-wise, or job title)  Technical Project Manager
   4. How much do you get paid to do it? (feel free to be anonymous!) More than I thought that I would ever make...$145,000.
   5. What’s the craziest thing that’s ever happened there?  So many things.  Where shall I start!  As a government contractor, crazy and stupid go hand-in-hand.
   6. *Extra Credit: A magical genie grants you 1 wish to change jobs – you can choose anything in the world. What would it be? (money is good regardless) Money manager on Wall Street.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1- 5 years in october
2 - somewhere in between content and happy
3 - Application Developer / IT Specialist
4 - $72,000
5 - I work from home most of the time. But while I was working at home the toilets on the first floor of our office building exploded and crap was everywhere.
6 - CEO for multi billion dollar company. Why? because their job consists of spending little time in the office, traveling in style all over the world for work, attending high profile parties, power (who doesn&#039;t want a little of that), and even though they are rich and could retire at any time they continue to do it because the experience the job offers is engaging.]]></description>
