					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, all you have to do is earn a joint $177K without any student debt...hardly something that &quot;just anyone&quot; can do.  Oh, wait, I guess Canadians don&#039;t have student debt.

By the way, since neither of you has worked 10 years, neither of you will qualify for Social Security. 

If the Obamacare law goes away (the dream of the GOP), and if either of you gets a pre-existing condition, how will you get medical insurance?]]></description>

They seem to be doing well so far :) It&#039;s not like you can&#039;t change and adapt as time goes on either right? If you&#039;re smart enough to amass that much money and create freedom for yourself, you&#039;re smart enough to keep it going as the years change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am retired and have been for almost 2 years and I am 34 years old and have 4 kids so that makes travel more difficult but I am blessed to get to choose my life and even made it to where my husband doesn&#039;t have to work . Being able to make choices based on things other than how your going to pay the bills is such a huge relief that I hope everyone gets chance to live more free .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok J money, I have been were they&#039;re are &quot;vacationing&quot;, in Central America on &quot; assignment&quot;, beautiful , but extremely dangerous; Worries me about the cannabis thing, in that area. Is  naive to think they&#039;re not going unnoticed on a vehicle with foreign lic plates and  of course,  sharing their a complishments. Poverty and ignorance  flourishes everywhere down there and also  envy and violence. I wish them luck, for their car not to break in the wrong place, for them not have to be airlifted for proper medical care, for a ransom not to family, for.....
Amazing how a posting like this gets encouragement from complete strangers thinking their accomplishment is cool, lets see how they help when sh. hits the fan  if they still post their problems, wake up people, it&#039;s the journey, not the finish line.
Don&#039;t get me wrong, what they accomplished  is very  good, but the accomplishment is not to   get there, is how to stay there for the next 40-50 years. We are living longer than 60 years.  
Diversify in other things in property to produce an income, but your money somewhere being handled by who, , depending on what?  mmmmm, no thanks.]]></description>
