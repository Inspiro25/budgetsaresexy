					<description><![CDATA[#3 is such an awesome idea. I think we all get caught up in looking for a good deal, instead of buying what we really need. #3 really solves that urge and gets us to think about the real value of an item to us. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like all these questions and think their order of priority moves around for me at different stages of my life. Currently &quot;WHERE WILL I PUT IT?&quot; comes up as number one. I foolishly thought that moving from living alone in a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom apartment (with husband and dog!)would double my space. Huh?! So unless something is getting REPLACED then I&#039;m not buying it! Winter boots (in the end of winter sale!) can replace leaky boots, a new lipstick can replace a nearly fully used one and until I sell my mid-century style sideboard then country cottage style sideboard is staying in the Amazon wishlist!]]></description>

People like to forget about that &quot;after tax&quot; part too ;) Everything we buy cost so much more than we realize - it&#039;s crazy when you really think about it!]]></description>
