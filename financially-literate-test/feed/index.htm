Agreed. And this week was a perfect reminder of that too! I hope people bought, bought, bought during those crashes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a nice little brain exercise.  Pretty basic stuff for us financial nerds but I wonder how the general public would do?  I think question #5 is very important, especially for young people.  If you&#039;re saving for retirement and you&#039;re not almost entirely in stocks early in life, you&#039;re missing out on a whole lot of growth.  People are scared of stocks, but they shouldn&#039;t be because they almost always perform better than bonds and real estate in the long term.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Saw this test.  I guess it&#039;s a good generic article from Motely, but I have a feeling if you&#039;re reading Motley, or especially this blog, you have a pretty good feel on most of these.  Regarding Q2, it&#039;s not necessarily an all-or-nothing answer.  Obviously, 25% cc debt will kill you, but you also need to pay yourself first.  Lesson learned from &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; - he paid off his debtors with each payment he received, but he also put aside some money to work for him, as well!  Don&#039;t forget to pay yourself!

@ChrisMiller, historically real estate around the United States has grown around 3%, but as J. Money mentioned it all depends on the area you lived and time of purchase. NYC and Miami over the past 5 years could have doubled the money.]]></description>

yeah, I was gonna say - the company match changes the game completely. That&#039;s a 100% return and will kill any c/c rate (hopefully - hah!). Not to mention all that match is then growing on top and making even more investment babies while you sleep :)

But yeah, matches aside it does get a bit wonky tax-wise for sure. Which makes me love the &quot;do what makes you happiest&quot; route even more, since both are smart moves!]]></description>

yup, savings rates are important! I would have guessed expenses, but I guess they go hand-in-hand eh? and you can have expenses without any income which would put you in pretty dire straights, haha... so yeah - guess it is savings rate :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/financially-literate-test/#comment-203241&quot;&gt;The Professor&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh man, like you mean in a net worth?

I guess I&#039;d just leave it out as it seems more like an income stream than an asset (though of course it is). But in terms of the Early Retirement/Financially Free calculations, this would play a major role! That one line item will drastically affect your #&#039;s for sure - and most definitely needs to be included (provided it&#039;s a 100% fact).

I have similar problems with valuing my blog and other online projects. You can certainly put a # on it, but until it&#039;s time to sell you just really don&#039;t know what the market will provide. So for now I leave those out too, and when/if the day comes to offload the profits will then be calculated into the wealth #. 

Interesting question though for sure - I bet you&#039;re not alone in wondering :) I&#039;d google a little and see how others do it! Maybe it&#039;s a multiplier of the $ or something?]]></description>
