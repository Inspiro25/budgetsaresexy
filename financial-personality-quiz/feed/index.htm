					<description><![CDATA[What a great survey - bit late coming to this one but I got Adventurer!!!

Certainly some truths in this one:

Financial Habits of The Adventurer

Willing to try new, innovative financial tools
Seeks new ways to change habits and curb spending
Tends to make risky career and financial choices
Takes on new opportunities and tends to overspend on new experiences
Financial planning is not a priority and can easily stray from a budget
Stays calm when dealing with financial issues

except overspending on new experiences - i don&#039;t do that!! :) but i can definitely stray from a budget!!!

Thanks for the quiz - very interesting!

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/financial-personality-quiz/#comment-195101&quot;&gt;Christine @ The Pursuit of Green&lt;/a&gt;.

Me too, I&#039;m the Architect &#038; have a color coded wardrobe!  The hangers are all the same though (cedar). I put all the white shirts together, the blue together, the red together, etc. I&#039;m not a minimalist but have very little clutter. My pantry &#038; linen closet are completely organized too, LOL you can imagine the comments from friends. I&#039;ve no idea where this came from as no one else in my family is anything like this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just took the quiz. I&#039;m an Oasis, which seems pretty much dead-on! 
Doesn’t spend impulsively - TRUE
Doesn’t reach out to others for help or support for financial issues - TRUE
Thinks of creative ideas to solve financial issues - TRUE
Knows about their current finances, but won’t keep a budget - I&#039;m finally tracking my spending but I still don&#039;t maintain a budget.
Reads all the fine print - PRETTY MUCH TRUE 
Hunts down great deals - YES!]]></description>

Ditto on that. 

BTW: Based on J$&#039;s update, we&#039;re at at least 11% of the total, not the 7% Contrarian the result info suggests...hmmm. Oh, wait, am I displaying a contrarian trait?]]></description>
