					<description><![CDATA[Hell yeah, doggy!  I&#039;d totally shop at that yard sale too, if I lived closer ;)  Cannot WAIT until yard sale season!  Although it means I better be prepared to get RID of stuff too to make up the stuff I bring in...  I&#039;ll just &quot;upgrade&quot; things ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I did a lot of de-cluttering before we moved last month. We&#039;re in the process of buying a house and once we get moved in, we&#039;re planning a HUGE yard sale. Everything that doesn&#039;t sell will be donated. I want to simplify my life as much as possible. 

And I second the idea about digitizing music. I&#039;ve already imported everything into iTunes and I don&#039;t buy new CDs. So we&#039;ll sell all of those at the yard sale, then take the rest to a CD shop or used book store and see what we can get. 

Consolidation and simplification are good things. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Elle&lt;/b&gt; - Good idea :)  Receipts can be pretty important.
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s not a bad idea.  I think owning some that you WANT to actually use one day is okay, but the ones people try buying to sell and make tons of money later are the ones that usually don&#039;t make sense.  Unless you get super lucky or actively try selling them.
@&lt;b&gt;Catherine&lt;/b&gt; - What? NOTHING?  I don&#039;t believe you :)
@&lt;b&gt;JennyDee&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh yes - computer files/folders!!!  VERY good to stay on top of and label nicely so everything&#039;s neat.  I&#039;m one of those people who keep *everything* on my desktop in like 2-3 folders.  so i know anything I will ever need are in there somewhere :)   Hope you remember to contact your friend!!!  We all get bad at that sometimes :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My sister and I are gearing up for a yard sale in a few months, so I&#039;ve been sorting &#038; gathering the physical stuff for awhile. I&#039;ve been making some headway on the other stuff:

-Unsubbed from newsletters I no longer want at work &#038; at home
-Closed/deleted accounts on sites I no longer visit
-Going through the electronic files on the computer. I&#039;m super organized, but once everything was in folders and appropriately labeled, I never went back to see if I actually wanted or needed the files. Time to delete!
-Tax time means going through the (obsessively organized) folders and shredding the outdated/no longer need-to-keep information. 

I&#039;m very, very bad at keeping in touch with friends whom I only communicate with online. I have a note from a friend in January that I haven&#039;t answered. Will answer her tonight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went through a little phase where I bought a couple of domain names that were never put to use. So I decided to let them expire. Its funny how not only do we have to deal with physical clutter but digital clutter as well.

I&#039;ve kept two of them that I&#039;m doing something with right now but that&#039;s it. Those two are enough. I just think its sometimes better to experiment with a free hosting site like blogger and see if you&#039;re going anywhere with your blog before you invest the money in a domain name and paid hosting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been throwing away years and months worth of garbage. The only thing I didn&#039;t toss yet are about a year&#039;s worth of receipts... I obviously need every one I can get!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; -  Yeah, find out and then delete those guys too!
@&lt;b&gt;Shawanda&lt;/b&gt; - WOW.  Email is something I have to really stay on top of or else I just go mad.  I do my best to get most cleared out every other day or so.  It’s the starred ones that eat up all my time.
@&lt;b&gt;aj&lt;/b&gt; - Haha… well done!  I bet that feels damn good ;)
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  They get you every time…. Although if you didn’t subscribe to them all in the first place, you wouldn’t know which you actually ENJOY all the way – so we’ll all probably keep doing it and then deleting  ;)
@&lt;b&gt;HP @ Work At Home Market&lt;/b&gt; -  Fo sho.  Clean it all up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going through our house getting rid of anything, and everything that we really don&#039;t NEED or USE on a regular basis. Once I&#039;m done, it&#039;s gonna be a nice big yard sale to save up for...well I don&#039;t know what, but something. 

Simple lifestyles usually save us money, and time in the long run anyway. Right?]]></description>
