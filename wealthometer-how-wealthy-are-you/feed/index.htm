					<description><![CDATA[Why are  they asking about  taxing wealth?
 It takes a lot of effort and planing to accumalate wealth.
Why do I owe it  to anyone?
Taxing income from wealth is a different matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I estimated 10 because I figured, I don&#039;t have much saved other than my 401k and we just bought a house last year so I thought the mortgage would drag us down. Turns out, I am at 46%!!! Way better than I estimated!! That pretty much means I&#039;m literally in the middle, half have more than me, half has less. That makes me feel good, since I&#039;m usually struggling to make the budget work, that I am actually doing better than I thought compared to the rest of America. I was surprised to see that 10 means having -$564. Negative money! That means everyone under ten percent has more debt than money.....That makes me feel pretty good about where I&#039;m at :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, definitely gives some perspective. I guessed we would be around 58 percentile, but came back at 60 percentile. We are aggressively paying off our student loans and will be done with about 2 years. So once that is gone, it looks like we would move to the 71 percentile.]]></description>

Hah - yes, that works too. But for those who suck at 401k stuff, I doubt they even know you can do it online or what their passwords are/etc. Hopefully when they get to HR y&#039;all will school them so they don&#039;t need to come back! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$!! I work in HR and I can assure you we don&#039;t have time to be messing around with your 401(k) percentages. Act like a grownup and activate your 401(k) online account and fix your contribution percentages there. That way you can track your $ after each pay, too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article and thanks for sharing.  I love the direct action on how to increase your wealth.  You are absolutely right, if you brainstorm ways to make money, you will stumble on ways really fast.  Heck, that Xbox, etc. may look great on your shelf, but if it is collecting dust, then maybe it is time to move it along.  Turn that dust collector into cold hard cash which will eventually turn into an income producing asset.  

I agree with another point you made, there really isn&#039;t any point in comparing your results to others.  What benefit does that get you, none.  Seeing there rate sure as hell won&#039;t improve yours.  If you want to make the most of this tool, you compare your results against yourself and find ways to make yourself better.  Use your results, learn from them, and find ways to improve.  Pick up some ideas from others who are more successful and see if they will improve your wealth.  Sorry for the mini rant over here haha

Great post and hopefully others learn something new like I have today and find a new way to reach financial freedom sooner.  Have a great weekend!
