					<description><![CDATA[Gen Y here, $0 debt, renting primary residence. Although I&#039;m still single at the age of 27 without even a g/f :(

I was just thinking to myself yesterday, there are parts of the country where a small condo can be found that goes for $45,000. I have more than half of that in savings, so if I got married to someone in the same financial situation as myself, we could later find a job there and buy it without a mortgage.

But then it dawned on me, that those places have no decent public transit and I would have to buy a car! At any rate, I&#039;m still saving...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The stats are interesting. I wonder why Gen X and Gen Y are so different. It makes sense, as many commenters have noted, that many people in Gen Y haven&#039;t yet purchased houses and haven&#039;t yet gone to grad school, so it makes sense that their mortgage and student loan debt would be lower. (On the other hand, Gen Y has had LESS time to repay their student loans and mortgages, which is an argument for why those balances should be higher).

The real mystery is the credit-card debt. I can&#039;t figure out why Gen X&#039;s would be so much higher than Gen Y&#039;s, given that Gen X is, as an aggregate, presumably making a much higher income. (They&#039;ve had more time in the workforce). My only hypothesis is that Gen Y became financially conservative after witnessing the recession. They&#039;re also young enough that they didn&#039;t lose their home equity or their jobs during the recession (because they hadn&#039;t bought homes yet and they hadn&#039;t finished school yet). That&#039;s just a guess, though.]]></description>

I just can&#039;t believe someone who once loved and cherished you could be so mean. Kinda scary, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money--like you, I also have $0 student loans and $0 credit card debt. That stuff is for suckers. I do, though, have a very large mortgage. Iive in a tiny, 840 sq ft house, but I live in an expensive city. But, to tackle the mortage and reach financial independence asap, I&#039;m increasing my active and passive income. Thanks for the post!]]></description>
