					<description><![CDATA[Defenitely agree that most us can use time to our advantage in order to achieve financial freedom.  

Saving, however, is only one part of the equation.  I have realized that maximizing income is also important in accelerating growth of one&#039;s personal finances.  I hope to retire early and its going to take a lot of work to get there.  I&#039;m up for the challenge!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So many people want money to buy&quot; things&quot; and when they do not have the money, they buy &quot;things&quot; on credit. We buy &quot;things&quot; because we expect these &quot;things&quot; to bring us happiness, drown our grief, make us cool...because Madison Avenue does a great job brainwashing us. At the end of the day, we still are not cool, we are still sad and now we have a credit card to pay off.

Even if we are not aware of it, what we really long for is freedom. Freedom to chase our dreams, freedom to aid those around us, freedom from the world telling us what we have to do and freedom to kill the damn alarm clock. Freedom is the greatest use of our money. Other than the necessities, why spend one single dollar if it doesnot bring you closer to freedom.

Love your site,
David]]></description>

Enjoying your work is always a good thing :) I just read somewhere that 90-something percent of millionaires all love what they do (or what they &quot;did&quot; to get there) vs those who are poor or struggling (who hate their jobs). Kinda interesting to see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that early retirement is having enough money to live your days however you please. However, I would add that it also encompasses doing work you enjoy that still pays the bills. Meaning, I don&#039;t have to be independently wealthy, but I need to make enough working for myself to maintain a lifestyle I&#039;m comfortable with. We don&#039;t need to be millionaires to retire early, we just need to quit working for other people and start working for ourselves!]]></description>
