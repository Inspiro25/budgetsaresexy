Priorities, or budgeting problems :) I had to start putting a padding in my checking account that way it prevented me from playing that money xfering game anytime I got low on funds. Maybe that would work for ya?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a problem and this is my problem. Though my problem is more accurately defined as &quot;set up little BS savings accounts, fund them and then drain them for something different.&quot; 

Thankfully, my crappy savings account habits don&#039;t impact my retirement savings. Hopefully, when I shift to major savings like a down payment, that will be safe too. I know it&#039;s possible because I&#039;ve never dipped into my travel account! Priorities, I guess :)]]></description>

For sure! Perfect mindset to have right now, no doubt about it. Whatever gets you to actually SAVE IT and leave it alone is all you need in my books. Exactly why I pour our extra money into retirement accounts too - you can&#039;t dip your hands back in the cookie jar without a firm spanking!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Out of sight (and out of reach), out of mind. That &quot;saved&quot; me when my savings were automated by my employer (matching and share ownership top up program). If it weren&#039;t for those programs, I&#039;d be a lot poorer.

Now that we manage our own finances without the benefit of a benevolent employer (oh, wait, that&#039;s us now...), we put our savings into &quot;high penalty&quot; accounts, such as taxable accounts when we can -- and we reinvest the tax return...duh. I also move $$ from our savings to our investment accounts on a regular basis. Somehow, once it&#039;s in the investment accounts, it feels as though taking back out is just not &quot;allowed&quot;...I guess we&#039;ll have to change that mindset at some point ;).]]></description>
