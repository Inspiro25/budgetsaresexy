					<description><![CDATA[Man - what a fast week.  One day I&#039;m blogging about flying out there, and the next I&#039;m back at home with all the motivation (and hangovers) a guy can ask for ;)  Hope you all had a great weekend too!

@&lt;b&gt;jim&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well it was a good thing we had plenty of other free ones all weekend long then, eh?!
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - I hope you can too, bud! Will be nice to finally put a face with your icon :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lynn @ Broke-Ass Mommy&lt;/b&gt; - Too late ;)  And yup - TONS of microbrews!
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - That comment now explains why I ran into you now :)  I was like - &quot;Where did he come from? And how did he know about this?&quot; Was a pleasure chatting for a bit though, bud.  Sorry it couldn&#039;t have been longer.
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Me too!  Would have been fun!
@&lt;b&gt;Ferdinand&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll be one too soon :)
@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, thanks man! Appreciate it! SO COOL running into you too - just wish we had more time to chat... next time, eh? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... oh come on, blogging doesn&#039;t = true love? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephen H&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man!
@&lt;b&gt;shey&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I know, that amused me too ;)  Did you end up coming out and meeting me??  It was a blur by the end.  Too much beer at too high of an altitude ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kim Paone&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!! You too!  Let&#039;s do it all over again next year too, k? :)]]></description>
