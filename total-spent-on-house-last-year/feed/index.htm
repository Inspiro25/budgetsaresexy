WOW that&#039;s a lot of money! I def. hope you love your home, haha... I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get a chunk of it back when it&#039;s selling time, but yeah - houses suck up cash like no other.

Thanks for sharing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last year we had to replace our water heater, AC and just last month we had to get a new sump pump. $2,150 for those 3 things.  This year we have a few more projects which so far are totaling over $8,000.  This is after completing home renovations of $60,000 in 2012.   I often wonder if it will all be worth it.  We enjoy our house and all the upgrades we&#039;ve made but I&#039;m still not sure.  Will we ever see that money again when we decide to sell?  

I was looking at your home renovations.  You got a very good deal on renovating your kitchen.  We put tile in our basement.  It&#039;s not has expensive as hardwood floors which we put in our first floor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I lump stuff like Target runs into &quot;household purchases&quot;, so my number might be a bit inflated from others, but we spent just under $30k on house stuff last year. A pretty hefty number, but not particularly surprising. We bought the house right at the end of 2012, and it has a LOT of deferred maintenance, needs some updating, and it&#039;s our first house so we needed to buy a lot of stuff - lawn tractors and snow blowers and storage bins and pitchforks and whatnot. We just got stuff as we needed it and cash flowed everything, but it definitely adds up!

The total is pretty shocking to behold I&#039;ll admit. I&#039;m justifying the expense with how happy we are with our home (ridiculously so, unlike some people I could mention!) and the vast majority of that outflow is likely to be one time or rare purchases/repairs/updates. PITI comes to less than half our expenses and is less than your interest alone. I find your interest terrifying!

Also, plaster is expensive to get done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll take your 2 cents any day - you&#039;re a pro! Sucks to hear about that new oil furnace, jeez... perhaps now that you&#039;ve gotten the &quot;bad&quot; out of the way, you&#039;ll now have nothing but &quot;good&quot; for 2014? :)]]></description>

True... at least for the time we were living in before we moved. And oddly enough we rent for the same price in our new area as we&#039;re renting it out there! So kinda like the same thing, only we lose money every month on one ;)]]></description>

Hey, thx man! I like seeing hard numbers like that (your vacancy one and repairs/maintenance) - that helps put things in perspective. And you&#039;re right - I&#039;m not fretting all too much since most of it was my own doing and was planned for, but it&#039;s def. a crazy number to look at. This usually has a bigger affect on me than all the &quot;theory&quot; stuff that comes into play with real estate and being a landlord, so figured I&#039;d share and help wake others up too who may be interested in similar stuff. Or, even buying their 1st home to live in themselves. It&#039;s not cheap!]]></description>

Not bad at all, especially considering you included utilities in there! I left them out since I&#039;d have to pay roughly the same whether I was owning or renting, but it def. adds to the overall picture of what we TRULY spend on the roofs over our heads. Thanks for taking the time to break it down for us and share - I love this stuff :)]]></description>
