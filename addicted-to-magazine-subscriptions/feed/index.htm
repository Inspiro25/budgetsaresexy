					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;American Debt Project&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, there you go!  Definitely smart way to &quot;spend&quot; your miles in my book ;)  Haven&#039;t read much of New York magazine, but I&#039;d imagine I could get pretty addicted to that one too.  So I&#039;m not going to, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Kristin&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhh, yeah that makes sense.  I miss internships too, actually.  I think I&#039;m gonna find a field I really want to learn about, and then just see if I can make my own internship, haha... it&#039;s the best way to learn, right? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@BudgetsAreSexy No, I stayed in one house until I was 18. Then my parents moved right after I graduated HS and we were in a long-term stay hotel for a month before moving into the home they are in now. I was in 4 different dorm rooms over undergrad, 4 internship summer stays at various places (usually about 10 weeks each), a year with roommates after undergrad, and now a new place for grad school. Now granted I didn&#039;t change all my addresses for an internship program, but it didn&#039;t make sense to have a subscription forwarded to either my parents or a temporary address over the summers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m an addict too!! I have about 7-8 subscriptions I got all FREE when my US Airways miles were about to expire. I read INC, Fast Company, Harpers, Lucky, Outside, Economist, and New York magazine, which I LOVE even though I live in California. I really love Coastal Living for home inspiration, but it wasn&#039;t on the free list. I used to get Bon Appetit and I would make about one recipe every 3 months...I just like to see the food pictures, but now we have blogs for that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I of back &#038; forth.  It&#039;s a sine wave of many/few over a course of months or years.  

And don&#039;t even get me started on &quot;The Economist&quot;.  It comes every week.  The first few weeks of the subscription I&#039;m all happy, like a kid with unlimited candy.  Then it starts to backlog, and - well, I can&#039;t recycle it because there&#039;s all that international news I should be reading.  And it&#039;s well-written and all.  And important.  And not cheap. So I collect it and power through it on long business trips (reading a month at a time, like I did this past week flying X-country).  Eventually that doesn&#039;t even work.  And as it piles up I start to feel resentful.  Then I feel terrorized.  Eventually I cancel my subscription.  Relief!  Blessed relief!  Then six months or a year goes by and I am really missing it, so I sign up again.  I am at mid-point of that cycle now.

I&#039;m a medium-heavy magazine subscriber.  I get The New Yorker, The Economist, Dwell, Indian Currents, Sunset, and one trade journal. And I think I&#039;m about to sign up for Vanity Fair again.  At one point I had another 4 magazines on top of this, but I&#039;ve cut them out.  And yeah, The Economist&#039;s days are numbered...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Long&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, I didn&#039;t know you could do that?  And honestly - I&#039;m a slow reader too.  But mags make it much easier for me somehow :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice.  I went to 3 different high schools, and states/countries, during high school - it was wild :)  Def.  harder to stay still now that I&#039;m older though!
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, no - I did not use a coupon place though I did get some deals on Amazon ;) I give you permission to school me next time we re-unite.
@&lt;b&gt;too funny&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  At least you&#039;re honest w/ yourself ;)  Crazy about that number of books though - jeez.  That is awesome man.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Okay, I will. But you still can&#039;t rip out pages and or doodle on them ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a list to make me feel like an uptight, pretentious douche! I subscribe to the Economist, Atlantic Monthly, Harpers, N+1, Newsweek, Time, Entertainment Weekly, Wine Spectator, WSJ, Baltimore Sun, Entrepreneur (I actually don&#039;t like this magazine) and I still read 2-3 books a week, most of which are classics.]]></description>
