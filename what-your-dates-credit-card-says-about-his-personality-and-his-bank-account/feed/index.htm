					<description><![CDATA[The author clearly has no idea what the heck he&#039;s talking about. Like others have pointed out, seems like a jealousy thing - he couldn&#039;t qualify for the premium credit cards and/or can&#039;t afford it. AMEX Gold for example, is $250 annually. But the value you get out of it can be as high as $1,000 first year, you get 8% at restaurants, 6% at supermarkets, not to mention a host of other premium benefits, purchase protection, price protection, just to name a small fraction. The author clearly has no idea how credit cards work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOL. The only ones that would concern me are cards like the American Express Black or American Express Gold. If it works out and you end up getting married, you&#039;re going to be managing a house with someone who thinks looking cool is the most important thing. I wouldn&#039;t get along with someone like that.]]></description>

The Chase Freedom. It makes you look free spirited. How about the Discover IT. It means you&#039;re hoping she&#039;ll be open to discovering &quot;it&quot; pretty soon. Or maybe the Capital One Quicksilver meaning that the cardholder is quick. Or how about the Capital One Savor showing that you like to take your time and savor. Too many puns...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#1 IS SO STUPID

If you are a nice restaurant and your date sees you use plastic, it i ho-hum.   However, if you pay the exact $100 with cash a you pull a wad of greenbacks from your wallet or pocket, that &quot;flash money&quot; makes a subconscious impression on you date.   She is thinking you are a rich guy and that gets her all revved up for later.   

Cash makes an impression.   One that promotes horniness.]]></description>
