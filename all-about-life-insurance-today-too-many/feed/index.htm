Oh wow, you found an older post here!

I wish I was an expert in insurance so I could help you out, but I&#039;m not - I&#039;m sorry :( I know Term is def. good for the younger folks and everyone I know hates Whole, but not sure where the crossover is as age goes up. Do you have a financial advisor you can ask that you trust? Or can you ask around with your friends and see if anyone can recommend one? Fee-only advisors are typically best so you know they won&#039;t try to upsell you on stuff just to get big commissions - which insurance products are known for.

Here&#039;s a list of people in my community too that can help with this if you want to see if any stand out to you (most of them skew towards younger audience, but there are some who deal across the board):

Also keep on searching online for help! Tons of bloggers and sites that cover this in much more details out there - mine just doesn&#039;t :( Good luck!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J.Money,

In reading the above you are your wife are fairly young but as for me I am (young) 62 but have no life insurance and trying to debate on which to get. Term or whole life. I had term but as I get older the premium is outrageous and would be that of a car payment so I cancelled it.  I do have 50, 000 through work but should something happen to my position then I;m SOL if you get my drift.  The term life goes until 80 what the heck happens once you turn 80 when you need it the most?  Thoughts ideas I am open to suggestions.

Thanks, 
Susan]]></description>
