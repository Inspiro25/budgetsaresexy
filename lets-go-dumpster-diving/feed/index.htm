					<description><![CDATA[My best dives resulted in many used books.  These were being
thrown out by a famous used-book store.  They do it all the time.  Don&#039;t know
why they didn&#039;t donate them to charity, but they&#039;re mine now.  The ones I
didn&#039;t want went to thrift stores.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you haven&#039;t discovered already, Craigslist has a &quot;Free&quot; section.  Get the stuff before it hits the curb or dumpster!  I have picked up a nice refrigerator, love seat, and dressing this way.  .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, I can look around my tastefully decorated condo right now and see at least 90 percent of what I know own was either passed on to me by someone who no longer wanted it, or was dumpster-dived.  I cannot even fathom going someplace and actually &quot;buying&quot; a piece of furniture or pots, pans, dishes, curtains, etc.  for my house.  My last dive resulted in a really cool coffee table, and tons of art supplies for my kids.
Sooner or later, our king-sized mattress is going to have to be replaced, and that is definitely something we will purchase new and look for the best quality at the best price.  I can&#039;t skimp on a good nights sleep...... Might even splurge on new pillows too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh, J Money, how I love your posts! This is great! I need to do more diving. I&#039;ve found a few things but a friend of mine drives through rich neighborhoods on their large item trash days and has furnished her whole house with really nice furniture. 
Love the tips from previous posters! We&#039;re in a small townhouse now but hope to be in a house soon. When we do that I&#039;m going to try not to pay retail for any furniture. I also ran across a site recently where a lady picks up &quot;junk&quot; and paints or re-finishes it and sells  it on craigslist! 
Keep up the interesting posts!]]></description>
