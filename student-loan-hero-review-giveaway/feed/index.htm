					<description><![CDATA[So glad I stumbled on this post! I used to use tuition.io, however, they just switched it to businesses only helping their employees pay, so personal use isn&#039;t supported anymore. Boo! I just went to SLH, and the site seems a little glitch-y, but hopefully playing around more on it will help. Thanks for the recommendation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m late to the party and to the drawing, but wanted to weigh in on DRBank.

They have great rates and beat out SoFi, Earnest, Payoff and Credible for a fixed rate.  We just refi&#039;d about $30K in student loans through them and the process was long, but not painful.  

The application process is pretty much the same as the other lenders.  I was surprised they beat Earnest with their data-driven rate process (disclosure: I have an Earnest loan also).  

I highly recommend DRBank for student loans.

As an aside... I highly recommend Earnest for personal loans.  They did come in way under other lender&#039;s rates, so it worked for us there.]]></description>

Or better yet - do both! Consolidate to pay less (if it makes sense for peoples&#039; situations) and then HUSTLE HUSTLE HUSTLE and get it knocked out! It&#039;s kinda like when people say they saved money by using a coupon or something, only to then just go out and spend the difference anyways... gotta have both parts to count :)]]></description>
