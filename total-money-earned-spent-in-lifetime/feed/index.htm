					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jacob (hoping you&#039;ll respond lol). I am a 25 year-old female who is currently battling bouts of depression because I too, spent my inheritance of 100k in about 2 years with little to show for it. I read your reply to a comment saying &quot;don&#039;t get depressed, get motivated&quot;. Did you at any point get discouraged about your future? And if so, do you have any tips on getting past it? I know what&#039;s done in the past can not be changed but I&#039;m not looking to the future very brightly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am just like you Jacob.  Had I saved and lived within my means I would be a wealthy man today.  Sure I have been tracking things since I got out of college but when you don&#039;t pay yourself fist you end up with not much.  Now I have learned that lesson and am passing it onto my kids.  
Keep rockin,

					<description><![CDATA[I started a detailed budget program in 1998 as tool to reach a couple of goals.  For 16 years, I tracked every dollar that passed through my hands for a family of 4.
Why 1998?  That was the year I read &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;. It&#039;s when I officially took control of the spending side of my finances at age 37.

I wouldn&#039;t believe it if I didn&#039;t have the excel sheets and details from my budgets for my expense tracking.
$1,454,370 (that&#039;s right $1.45Million)

This is the expense side of our cash flow and defined as household operating expenses. It also includes capital expenditures including car purchases and home improvements.  
It does not include 7 years of college expenses which resides on separate ledger. (I have those figures if anyone is interested.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, it&#039;s a bummer to look back and wish you&#039;d done things differently. Alas, life shall go on! It&#039;s good to know that saving half your income has such a sweet return :-). We&#039;re currently saving a bit more than that and I love it. 
Nice post, Jacob.]]></description>

That would be another fun exercise, one I&#039;ve thought about doing. But I don&#039;t really want to. I have paid a LOT of interest on my mortgage, unfortunately. :\]]></description>

It&#039;s great to look at trends. It was a fun exercise to do, I suggest everyone give it a shot. And then do it again in 10 years and see how much better it looks :)]]></description>
