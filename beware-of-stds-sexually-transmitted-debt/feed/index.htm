There you are!! Was hoping you&#039;d come across this - totally meant to send you the link and must have forgot, sorry about that. At least it made for a nice surprise :) Glad you enjoyed reading, and even more so you&#039;re out of the grieving period and into the kicking ass one! I hope when your ex does contact you again he&#039;s astonished at how amazing you&#039;re doing without him :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[oh wow! Popped back on site and was so not expecting this!! And I do have something good to say - I am doing OK! Got over the grief cycle. Friends and meditation keep my head straight.
I have following this website for quite a few years - got a budget template and lots of motivation from you guys. Followed lots of the advice and ideas. This has been part of looking after myself and finding myself OK when the unexpected happened.
It has been 4 months now. I am still job hunting and doing part time contract work. So 
Still no contact from Mr. MIA. Still don&#039;t know why, or where he is. So - double check everything and go tell your loved one how much you love him/her. 

Reading all these beautiful / funny / sad / affirming comments is uplifting and reminds me to stay on task. SO COOL lovely people - THANK YOU for sharing your stories. THANK YOU J Money for giving us real life guidance and encouragement]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is something good: After 5 years of debt-reduction, my husband and I have paid off $180,000 and we have $77,000 to go. We&#039;re getting there! And this journey has made our relationship stronger. Warning taken though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This made me ask my husband if he loved me, while I looked deeply into his eye so I could see the truth. It also reaffirmed for me why having separate bank accounts is a good thing. We also have a combined account. I do feel like our conversations about stuff like this is much easier because we don&#039;t have kids...but that&#039;s based simply on experience with our familial and social circles.]]></description>
