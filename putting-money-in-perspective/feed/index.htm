@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... cookie dough.  You&#039;re funny :)  Good idea w/ doubling up the money in your mind too - that&#039;s a great way to keep yourself on track.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My yard stick varies.  The other day I was walking to work as usual but was tempted to take the bus and shave off some walking in the rain.  But then I realized that I could instead buy a package of cookie dough and walked.  Never did end up buying the cookie dough, the money worked but the calories didn&#039;t.  In the end I neither missed the cookie dough or minded walking in the rain so I guess it was a win-win.  

More commonly with potential student loans coming up I take all discretionary purchases and double their cost and ask if I would still want it since everything will end up costing twice as much if I use student loans to finance it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this way of looking at money and what you are going to spend it on. I think for me I would probably use how many hours I would need to work to purchase the item and then decide if it is worth that much of my time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a friend that always measured things in terms of iPods, since they always seemed to be about $200. Now he has an iPad (and he&#039;s no longer in undergrad, so he has a fellowship at least), so the iPad is the new unit of measurement.

It&#039;s kinda like using the state of Rhode Island to measure glaciers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this J... 

for me right now I think about our emergency fund. With the wedding taking all our cash we haven&#039;t been able to add much to it (but thankfully its staying in tact). For me its money that we can go towards making that goal...

I like the stock idea... maybe when I open that Roth IRA i&#039;ll try thinking in terms of shares then..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Margaritas!

My friends and I are going to Vegas in July. We&#039;ve been saving up money for awhile, so when something comes along tempting us to spend, I refer to it as the number of margaritas. There are two $1 margarita stands in Vegas that we know of, and it keeps in perspective what I&#039;m spending.]]></description>
