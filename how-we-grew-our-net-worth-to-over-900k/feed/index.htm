That would be interesting to know! 

I&#039;ve never tracked it so couldn&#039;t tell you for sure, but if I had to guess I&#039;d say maybe we invested $300k or so over the past 10+ years?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was curious if you&#039;ve considered adding another variable to your chart? I was wondering the amount you actually invested out of pocket throughout the years vs the return of compound interest (i.e the current graph).]]></description>

$50,000/year - baller!!!

You&#039;ll hit that $1,000,000 in no time at that rate - congrats! My dream world was to hit it by 40 too but don&#039;t think that&#039;s happening as I now only have 7 months left haha... So you need to do it for the both of us :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money - loved your summary!

Because of you I started tracking our net worth and we are at $ 750,000.

We got here through diligently saving $$$, and especially have ramped it up the past few years. My current employer matches 18 % of our salary/bonus which is incredible. We have T. Rowe Price and they consistently say we are the top company out of all their retirement plans. So, that has helped me bank away $ 50,000 into my retirement TAX-FREE each year.

I&#039;m hoping to hit $ 1,000,000 in net worth around 40 years old..... 2.5 years away! I love the articles and ideas they spur. Cheers!

Other details:

-We have $ 200,000 in home equity
- $100,000 in college savings
- $ 250,000 in retirement accounts
-$ 200,000 in other liquid savings (non-retirement)

I drive a 15 year old beater (paid off) and the wife a 7 year old minivan (paid off).]]></description>
