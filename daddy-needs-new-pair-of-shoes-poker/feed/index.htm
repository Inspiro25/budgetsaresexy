					<description><![CDATA[6-7 suited is my go-to.

In terms of hustlin&#039;...I frequently check out the recycling area of our apt complex (nicer apartment=nicer free stuff). This weekend we scored an almost new TV stand and wooden dresser. My GF kept the dresser while I flipped on the TV stand on craigslist for $40.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, it wasn&#039;t in the cards (bah dum ching)... we ended up not having our game :(  Hope it gets rescheduled soon though, now I&#039;m even more anxious!:)

@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - I used to be the same way, esp if I won a lot in the beginning - it&#039;s hard to just walk away when you&#039;re having fun and just got started! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Eddie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;d never fib about the numbers ;) Just wish I HAD some to report :(
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  It&#039;s too bad you don&#039;t live closer or you&#039;d always have yourself a seat here in our games :)
@&lt;b&gt;Craig&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man. Blackjack kicks my ass every damn time, no matter how hard I try - it sucks.  Some of my friends are great at it though and swear by it just like you do, so at least someone&#039;s winning! :)
@&lt;b&gt;DC&lt;/b&gt; - Woahh, that blows!!  You must be playing online then? Or you sneak out of the room to get on your computer now? haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!  We pay for the atmosphere and friendships too - it&#039;s all a part of the entertainment :)  But good for you for not gambling, it can be a horrible addiction for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you liked it!  It&#039;s one of my fave posts actually cuz it helps SO MUCH! :)  And I have to force myself to walk away sometimes too w/ gambling as I can get sucked right in and get hardcore too (really good I don&#039;t live near a casino!).  Junior is due in two weeks, it&#039;s getting closer!!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks!  I hope we get anther chance soon at it, I was really looking forward to playing :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have fun, J! I gave up on all gambling twenty years ago when I realised that my compulsion is so strong that I could have sold my (hypothetical at the time) children in slavery to continue playing. Good gambling is for controlled people - I have too much passion for that (ha! I knew I&#039;ll manage to twist this thing to my advantage).

More seriously, your post on linking spending to hustles was ace - I have been doing it and it works a dream. When is Junior coming?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I do not go for gambling. I think it is a waste of time and money. I would rather keep the money and spend it on food or SHOES (LOL!) than on poker or casino. But my view on gambling changed when some old friends and classmates invited me over for a night of chips and cards. Of course, I did not play with them but enjoying the night away and seeing them doing it for fun. Despite the loss, there was on amount of money that can equate the laughter that filled the house of our host and hostess.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love it, I&#039;m about to work on none other than blogging tonight!  Already mentioned it to you on twitter, but have a list of little design things I want to get done tonight as well as get another few posts written up...probably go live a week from Monday : 0

Speaking of poker, no joke, about 2 minutes ago my ace high straight got beat by a full house and I&#039;m out of the tourney I was in.  Looks like it was a sign I need to concentrate on one thing at a time!

Have fun playing tonight]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love a good game of poker, and more importantly if it has a purpose - like a new pair of shoes.
Good luck, and let us know how you make out. No fibbing on the numbers either...haha!
Have a great weekend J.]]></description>
