					<description><![CDATA[Yay! Congratulations to your mom! What a beautiful day and wonderful accomplishment. Not sure if this says anything positive about our society, but 59 actually IS super early for most people to retire. I hope you&#039;ll share more about how she&#039;s liking this new phase of her life and what she gets up to :)

Also, my absolute FAVORITE piece of advice from her is this: &quot;You’ll be able to afford more later – live each stage of your life.&quot;

This is SO important (and hard) for people in their 20&#039;s to remember (aka: ME, haha). Thanks for sharing all of her wisdom. It was a treat :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats to your mom! Reminds me a lot of my father&#039;s story. We were frugal growing up, we got our clothes at Kmart and hand-me-downs. Going out to eat was for special occasions. The credit card was for the occasional purchases that required one, and was paid off that month. We didn&#039;t go on many vacations, but we did go on some. Saving was always the first priority. He reached a point around 50 or so where he could retire at any time. He went to about 55, and when changes to state retirement funds were announced, he figured it was time to get out. Now he and my mom are living the good life - not the extreme early retirement of many of these blogs, but earlier than many. I&#039;m glad you shared this because I think your mom&#039;s scenario is probably a more realistic scenario for many. Thanks!]]></description>
