					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard that Mark Cuban quote before, and it&#039;s an awesome one. That piece of advice has stuck with me. Good opportunities present themselves to almost everyone, but lots of people don&#039;t capitalize on them, either because they mentally hold themselves back, or because they haven&#039;t set their lives up to a place in which they can logistically capitalize on it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Forced savings is how I see refunds. I have rental properties so I like to tell myself that I withhold far too much because my rental income and property repairs are unpredictable... but really, I could re-balance as often as every month if I wanted to. But yes, refunds are fun]]></description>

YUP! For both opportunities and expenses too - just good to know where you always stand at any given point in time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I did ours almost a month ago, but haven&#039;t submitted yet because we&#039;re waiting on one last form.  Hopefully it comes in the next week or so.  I really like what you said about being able to jump at an opportunity when it arises.  So many things in life are about timing and it would be nice to have money setting aside until that &quot;right time&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/dont-tax-me-bro/#comment-115801&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

Yeah J-my parents were the best role models I could have asked for!  The older I get, the more I realize the wonderful gifts they gave us.  While I say I miss them every day, I see so much of my parents in the things I do now, I&#039;m grateful for all those lessons they taught me.  Rocking parents all the way.  A mighty mighty blessing!]]></description>

Wow, that&#039;s so cool your family adopted so many siblings! What wonderful wonderful parents :) And that DOES suck about Cali screwing stuff up over there, I&#039;m sorry to hear :( It&#039;s always frustrating dealing with problems that shouldn&#039;t have even been brought up to begin with - ESP when it&#039;s someone else&#039;s fault! Good luck killing it once and for all! I think getting legal help might not be that bad of an idea.]]></description>

haha... no, I actually haven&#039;t heard &quot;the cobbler’s children go barefoot,&quot; haha... so random! But I like it :) And I agree it&#039;s hard to do things for yourself that you do all day long  non-stop. Reminds me of a friend who&#039;s a landscaper but who rarely works on his own yard :) You would never guess!]]></description>
