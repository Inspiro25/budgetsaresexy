Great question! I think he came out with a book about it all, so I&#039;m sure you can find it in there or somewhere online. Google him up - you&#039;ll find tons of awesome stuff he&#039;s producing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG, this is a great find! This is part of my whole financial goal is to be able to go ride my bike all over the world to explore. I really, really understand the traveling waking up the brain and routine makes life boring and dull. There is nothing better than traveling and seeing the world on a bike, to me at least in this point of time!

Is there anyway to get his routes and highlights?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing. Thank you for sharing this great find. That&#039;s my greatest fear...to let one day blend into the next and to stop being in awe of the world around me. Thankfully, new experiences inoculate us from that possibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I left my job last year to travel and looking back on the decision, it&#039;s probably one of the riskiest things I did in my life.  The uncertainty of where I&#039;ll end up excites me and scares me at the same time. I can resonate with some of his thoughts Jedihiah shares in his video.]]></description>

The action part is key! I&#039;m trying to harness it into something myself over here - even if just small - before I forget and go back to normalcy, haha... I really think I&#039;m going to make it a calendar item to watch once a month :)]]></description>
