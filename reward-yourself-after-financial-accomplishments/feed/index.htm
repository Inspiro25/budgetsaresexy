					<description><![CDATA[Wowww there you go!  I can&#039;t believe you paid off your mortgage??  I cannot WAIT until that fateful day.  And now we actually have &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/mortgage-payoff-plan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a plan in place&lt;/a&gt; for once!  We were like those people who always wish on hitting the lottery but never play - just for us, it was paying something off the mortgage :)  J. Money 2.0, baby!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is exactly what we did when we paid off our mortgage!  Well actually everything we paid off $10,000 (we called them milestones instead of accomplishments), we would go out to eat at a fancier (relatively) restaurant!  It was a nice little reward for a job well done :)

My rewards after accomplishing my milestones were cheap compared to the cost of the goal accomplished...

Now I would like to do the same, except with vacations instead of a dinner... ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaa.... I wouldn&#039;t know what to DO with myself with a &quot;free&quot; hour! :)  But I hear ya on the vacation stuff -- We hit up Greece a few years back, and Ireland is close to my next place too!!  How awesome would it be if we ran into each other there?  Hard to miss a blue-haired George Washington, eh? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;KZ&lt;/b&gt; - I can get down with that!. One of my fave aspects to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lovedrop.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Love Drop&lt;/a&gt; (and the reason we set it up that way - to travel somewhere new every month :)). Big fan of new experiences.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like that.  Esp ice cream over gym part ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Justin Wright&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  And remember, you don&#039;t only have to reward yourself by spending money either -- you can do something else like giving yourself more free time or something too.  Though money does open up a lot of excellent reward options ;)  Btw, just got back from reading your blog for the past 30 mins -- CONGRATS on hitting 3 years of self-employment my man!  Love your thoughts on it, and love going back and checking out your old stuff too - well done my man, well done.  And it just so happens I&#039;m still in my pajamas today, too ;)  Now back to responding to these comments.. 30 mins later, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie S&lt;/b&gt; - I like it!!! And could totally see that being a fun treat ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Dr Dean&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Really?  The night before?  I think you outbeat me in that department, I&#039;m impressed!  Even more so ;)  Well done good sir, your wifey would be proud.  Or is that where you met her?
@&lt;b&gt;David&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah - go for it! I&#039;ll take 20% commission too for giving you the idea ;)  Hope you win!!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for your smiley face! :)  Will I be honored to see you at BlogWorld in 2 weeks, my friend?  It&#039;s in your back yard!
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - I like it :)  Kinda like $5 for every A you get on a report card, yeah?
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ Debt-Tips&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s hard to keep on it sometimes, which is why I like to shoot out reminders here every now and then :)  For my readers AND for me!
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - 1) Haha... you crack me up, girl.
2) I love it!  I&#039;ve heard of a lot of different names for that account, but never &quot;I&#039;m So Worth it&quot; - I&#039;m gonna have to use that one later ;)  Or perhaps now, with a tweet?  Thanks for sharing!  Have a beautiful weekend!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good morning, J$ and friends. Interesting post, this one! I feel compelled (about this one later) to make two comments:

1) This is the blog I come to regularly - like the company. As to how sexy budgets are, I see it like this - budgets are like pin-ups. Richard Gere is fit (was fitter ten years ago) but John is my man. Richard Gere is the budget and John is the &#039;budgetting&#039;. Since I have passed the age of pin-ups, I have no budget but I do budgeting (norm vs. knowledge)

2) Rewards are wonderful things! What I found difficult when I started noticing money is not to reward myself but to have fun. Rewards are necessary when one does things from &#039;discipline&#039; not from &#039;motivation&#039;. I have been developing the motivation side of me for a long time (this is when it is not that you love doing things from the outset but learn to accept, and then like them; in such cases no need to force yourself and reward self for good behavious - the reward is the activity itself). The &#039;having fun&#039; aspect was solved by having an &#039;I am so worth it&#039; account - we put certain amount in that every month and the condition is that it has to be spent. Crazy, I know; but it feels so good to enjoy the finer things in life without guilt.]]></description>
