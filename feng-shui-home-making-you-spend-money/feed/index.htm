					<description><![CDATA[I want to thank everyone for taking the time to share your thoughts about Feng Shui and how it may or may not be related to money. I&#039;m not here to convince anyone that they should practice or embrace Feng Shui into their life. Just as you read your revenue and expenses, forecast budgets and make decisions based on patterns over the past, present and future, Feng Shui is about understanding the patterns that people have been learning and studying for the last 2,000 years. When you begin to recognize and understand the impacts of patterns is when you can begin to use that information to make informed decisions. 

Time and time again I see these patterns and work with individuals, businesses and corporations to achieve their goals and to live a more fulfilling life. I personally attribute Feng Shui to the many blessing that I have in my life today. I have seen my personal income (not from Feng Shui or Feng Shui Consulting) triple since I&#039;ve begun implementing it into my life. I&#039;ve become a much more grounded person, much more productive and healthier overall, which can attribute back to my growth in prosperity. It has also enabled me to not only see opportunities in different aspects of my life but to be able to have the strength, energy and right mindset but to actually act on these opportunities. One of the best lessons that I have learned from Feng Shui is to follow the Chi. Meaning, don&#039;t get in your own way when opportunities open up and present themselves to you.

Keep in mind there are many different tools, thoughts, processes, systems and approaches to help you achieve your goals and to live your dreams with Feng Shui being just one of those methods. You should do what you are drawn to and live out the plan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agreed.  No financial ideas are going to work for everyone - you gotta try out the ones you think will be good for YOU, and avoid the ones you think are a waste of time.  I don&#039;t necessarily believe a wind chime will bring me more money, but if you do and it helps you get your finances together that&#039;s wonderful! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now, I&#039;m one strong advocate to tell people that their personal home is a liability (unless they have it paid off outright, otherwise the debt is a different story) as a means of making people &quot;Spend money.&quot; But Feng Shui? That takes that whole philosophy to a level of detail even I don&#039;t have. XD

But a lot of general principles do make sense in a way. A poorly looked after home has a lot of... Psychological subtlety, for a lack of better wording.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aren&#039;t we all adults here?  If you don&#039;t agree with something, that is fine....but there isn&#039;t a good reason to make fun of it.

Personally, I thought it was a great post.  I have a stairway by my door, and I love the idea of getting windchimes. It isn&#039;t going to hurt anything....so why not try it?  I am still trying to figure out the wealth corner....I &quot;think&quot; mine would be by my back door, so a water feature there isn&#039;t practical.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow Brad, 

So if you are a &#039;believer&#039; of anything or in anything that makes you a fool?  I&#039;m sorry that you feel that way and thank God the rest of the world is not subscribing to that.

This country was built on the &#039;belief&#039; of people from the beginning of time.  Because you &#039;believe&#039; does not mean to sit back on your hands and wait for life to be handed to you.  It is all the things that you mentioned and more.  

To believe is to have &#039;faith&#039; in something.  You have the faith that if you are honest, work hard and are responsible then life will reciprocate occasionally (your words not mine).  That is not a fairytale nor fiction, that is merely life.  You will get out of it about as much as you are willing to put in.  

The day we all stop &#039;believing&#039; will be the day we will all start slowly dying.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Aren’t we taught from a very early age on that if you believe hard enough anything is possible.&quot;

Actually no, I was taught to be honest, work hard and be responsible and sometimes life will let something nice slip through to you.  Believing sounds like a fairy tale and is classified as fiction for a reason.

There was one good bit of financial advice woven in there; use your stove means cook at home and thats always practical.  If you have to wrap that up in a new package to get some people to swallow it, then so be it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[my roommate is super into new age-y stuff and angels and other things that i think are totally wacko but harmless.  my philosophy is live and let live--it doesn&#039;t hurt anyone and if it works for someone, so be it. anyway, my roommate has feng shui&#039;d our apartment to oblivion, and it looks amazing!  I don&#039;t believe in the money aspect of it, but my apartment looks nice now.  :)  

unfortunately, there&#039;s nothing she can do about the narrow, steep staircase leading up to our apartment (it is communal so NO windchimes allowed), the bathroom in full view of the entryway, the dirty, unused stove (neither of us cook much and HATE cleaning), or the wealth corner, which is in my bedroom (muahahahah) and where I stuck my junky nightstand with all my junk drawers.  how can that wealth corner be &#039;missing,&#039; anyway?  i don&#039;t get that part.

haha, fun post.  i didn&#039;t know this stuff.  i will talk to my roommate about it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What exactly is so shocking about Feng Shui being mentioned here?  Feng Shui works for people because they BELIEVE in it with their whole hearts and souls.   Isn&#039;t that what all this about anyway.  Aren&#039;t we taught from a very early age on that if you believe hard enough anything is possible.  We are reading this blog because we believe in so many areas and aspects of our financial lives and we want to learn more and share more with others.  I think Feng Shui is just another &#039;analogy&#039; of how we can be in control over our lives instead of our lives controlling us.  Plus its a great change from all the posts that are going around blogs now a days that are saying the same things over and over.  The first time you hear something, it&#039;s great..after that- it&#039;s just a bunch of echos...  Thanks for mixing it up today!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though some of it is a little kooky, I think over all Feng Shui serves as a subconscious reminder regarding money, success, career, etc.  I put a purple flowering plant in our wealth corner.  I have to water it in order for it to stay alive, and every time I do it is a reminder to tend to my money life too. I&#039;m all about subconscious reminders...Lord knows my conscious brain is full enough as it is.]]></description>
