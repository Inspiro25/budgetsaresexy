					<description><![CDATA[Love reading your article. I&#039;m having the same problem as others as I am on a limited budget and have to sacrifice a little budget for the food. That&#039;s why I cook instead of buying ready to eat foods as it is more budget friendly. Thank you for sharing this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am new to your website and I love it.  I laughed so hard I was in tears at this dad&#039;s very legitimate rant.  I have to read the links and rebuttals!  We have a high food budget ($900 per month) in comparison to many more frugal families.  

All I can say is...wait until you have a couple of teenage boys to feed!!  I used to buy a &quot;family pack&quot; of chicken breasts to feed the four of us (with some leftover) and now I buy 2 family packs for one meal and there are NO left overs.  I do garden, but try to get those teenagers to be full on &quot;rabbit&quot; food....not gonna happen.  Some days I am actually thankful that I have one kid who is lactose intolerant....keeps the dairy portion of our bill down!  But then non-dairy &quot;milks&quot; like almond are expensive and who can deny a hungry boy a bowl of cereal.  (Homemade granola - it&#039;s yummy!)  That&#039;s one thing I do....make lots of stuff homemade and that does help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I am late posting, but I have enjoyed reading all the comments.

We have two adults and one child that eats more than I do. Sometimes I spend $100 for the week, some times $40. I only shop sale items. I keep my fruits and vegetables to an average of $1.25 per pound. It Isn’t always perfect, and I don’t carry around paper tallying my every penny.  It I also don’t buy $4 raspberries in December. We eat a lot of kale at $1 pp, and cauliflower at $1.25 pp. 

I try to keep my meat average at $2 pp. Sometimes bone in chicken breast is .88 pp. I debone it, and with the 30% waste it is still just $1.17 pp. Then I throw all the scraps in a crock pot for hours to make stock that is better than what you get in the store. When this sale pops up I will borrow from another weeks cash and buy 100 pounds. We eat beef once or twice a week so this all balances the $2 pp.

We do cheese, butter, cream, but zero milk. It’s a sugar thing, milk is full of it. I keep cheese to $3 pp ($1.50 per block), butter at $2.50 pp, and cream to $2 per pint.

Typical dinner is one pound of meat, two pounds of vegetables. I got Italian sausages on sale for $1.25 for 17/18 ounces. Those were diced and stir fried with garden peppers, an onion, and a bag of frozen green beans. Under $3 for three pounds of food. 

The garden provides our cucumbers, tomatoes, and bell peppers for the year. For those who don’t think they can do it, you really can. If you have land, or someplace to hang planters, you can have a garden. Our 4 x 4 cucumber bed produced 65 pounds of cucumbers this year. Two tomato beds are still producing, and we are almost at 100 pounds. The peppers are in a two by two bed and I have picked thirty. Four small red lettuce plants in a planter provided two months of salads before they bolted.  

We are in the south, lower cost of living and great weather.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Think the easiest way to lower one&#039;s grocery bill is step away from packaged food.   I purchase real food which is fruits and vegetables that I have to do something with to eat.  Plus, the food is healthier that way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was so funny. I can feel his pain. We are a family of three with food allergies (gluten, dairy, soy, beans and some others) etc.. we do eat quailty (read grass feed, local, organic, whole food no processed box foods) most of the time. We cook 95% from scratch the other 5% is occasional restaurants. We have reduced our budget from 1200 to 900 and I am challenging us to get down to 750.00.  We are foodies but have had to let a lot of that go in order to decrease our budget. We have opted to eat more simply in an effort to decrease. Simply for us means roast chicken with potatoes and veggies, or using more harp burger less salmon fillets etc... instead of lamb chop or steak etc... portions do matter but I am overweight as well my husband and son are not but my 8year old eats like an adult. We have increased our veggies and decreased some of our other items as well to help. While we don&#039;t do many grains we have added rice back into the mix to help as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Property taxes on my underwater condo, healthcare penalty (punishment for being poor), groceries, insurance (home and auto), HOA fees, cost of living overall - everything has gone up except my salary.  It&#039;s just me and two cats, but I&#039;m now down to $40/month for the supermarket.  That&#039;s $40 for absolutely everything, including the likes of toilet paper, toothpaste and soap.  There&#039;s not much food anymore, period.  And what food there is isn&#039;t usually the good-for-you kind.  It&#039;s the how-far-can-I-stretch-this-so-I-don&#039;t-feel-sick-all-day kind.  I get no breakfast, no lunch, one meager dinner.  I&#039;m mixing sugar and water to keep my blood sugar from bottoming out during the day.  This sucks.  This is not living.  I work full time as a state employee in a rut job with a no-raise policy.  The only increase in pay is the state&#039;s periodic (and rare in the last 14 years) mandated across-the-board cost-of-living increase for all state employees - same work, done with greater and greater experience, and half the quality of life (no, not even that) than on day one.  At 49, my FOA (front-office appearance) days are behind me.  For several years, I&#039;ve tried to get another job and even a second job (seriously, scrubbing toilets would do), but no one will touch you past 40, not even a chance.  I have become a disposable, throw-away human.  I&#039;m not going to live much longer like this.  So much for all my effort and dreams.  I&#039;ve learned to hate America.  I won&#039;t miss it when I&#039;m gone.  My last misery will be leaving with the knowledge of all I still have in me to contribute.  Oh well, the rest of you, you get what you give.  Good luck with that.]]></description>
