					<description><![CDATA[Having just done this..  Be sure to negotiate the price on whichever ring you decide on, anything you save can go to the wedding and honeymoon.  I had been to many stores and always assumed the price on the tag was final, no sales person ever tried to negotiate with me.  It took a while till I found the perfect ring, a solitaire with red coral inlay on the band, but it was way beyond my budget and again the sales lady never wavered from the price on the tag.  When I started asking about some changes to the design and using different stones she fetched the jeweler/owner from the work shop who makes them all.  We discussed what changes I wanted and he drew a sketch with some notes on a pad and ran some numbers on a calculator and immediately threw out a price he could do this for that was $2000 less than the one on the tag. I was pretty shocked at how much he chopped off and the price difference of what it would have cost me had I not talked to the maker himself instead of just a sales person.

Also good advice getting the diamond from a wholesaler instead of through a jeweler who would mark it up.  I think in most cases the diamonds are the majority of the cost of the ring and would be a good place to look for savings, in our case most of the cost was in the band. I didn&#039;t save any using a wholesaler but was able to get a better quality and bigger one than I otherwise would have.

I paid cash in full for the engagement ring and thankfully she loves it so much she does not want a wedding band.  I did not like taking such a huge hit to my cash reserves to pay that all out at once though and the second time I went to him to have my ring done he offered to split it into 3 payments over 90 days same as cash.  I could have paid for my ring up front too but decided to spread it out this time, It takes him four to five weeks to finish a custom ring anyway so why not. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think a lot of what I would said has already been said and since you said no comments on spending that amount of money on a ring (even though I definitely have strong opinions on it lol). I&#039;m assuming based on what you&#039;ve said about going with industry driven things that you&#039;re looking for a diamond (which was a marketing campaign after there was an excess of diamonds, FYI, if you look into the history of diamonds) please at least try and find a conflict free diamond, especially since you&#039;re dropping so much money on it. If you&#039;re unaware of what they are, just google conflict diamonds and/or blood diamonds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not another ring at $7,000! ;)  I&#039;m all about winin&#039; and dinin&#039; my lady here and there - with jewelry and whatever, but she&#039;d KILL me if I dropped more than a few hundred on another piece of bling again - it&#039;s not her style.  We&#039;re all different though, eh?]]></description>

You are nuts if you don&#039;t think you have to buy another ring...  There are always rings for anniversaries and have you thought about the &quot;push&quot; present you are getting the mrs when the baby comes?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[10-15K is a LOT to spend on an engagement ring! Good for you that you have the cash to pay for that. If you&#039;re able to get rewards on a credit card I&#039;d do that. But if there&#039;s a cash discount that&#039;s greater than the rewards you&#039;d get, pay cash. Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You do not have to pay the full retail price-ever-at a jeweler.  First, ask if they offer discounts for your employer/industry.  Make an offer on a ring. Tell them what you can do. They may meet your offer or tell you what it would take to get there.  Smaller rock, different mounting, different metal, different brand of setting without a quality difference. Don&#039;t plan to buy the first trip.  Discuss your needs/limits/wants, etc.  Will you do a gift registry at the jewelry store?  Will you be buying your groomsmen or bridesmaid gifts there?   There are lots of discounts available-and lots of jewelers. The discounts on quality diamonds and mountings can be extensive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All, 

I appreciate your candid feedback. It sounds like the majority feel the same way I do - pick whichever option provides the most savings. I&#039;ll take a page out of J&#039;s book and spend some time responding to comments:

@J - I never thought about the option of cutting myself a cash advance check...interesting point! Only downside is that a lot of credit cards would charge an up front advance fee. I&#039;ll do some research.
@Amanda - Agree, I&#039;m avoiding all &quot;designer&quot; brands and buying wholesale to get the best value.
@Christopher/Mrs Money/Sean/others - Not to worry, I won&#039;t be adding any debt to our lives. If I use a cred card I&#039;ll be paying it off immediately.
@Tim Lindsay/MrsGreen - great points about sales tax, definitely something I&#039;ll consider.
@Kathryn C - no brothers, but several friends! :D
@This Aggie Saves/Cristina - Good point on the CC protection, I didn&#039;t think of that
@Sarah - I&#039;ll be sure to check the ring size TWICE
@Barb/Stephanie/Kacie - I&#039;m okay with spending excessively on a once-in-a-lifetime purchase. Personally preference though! I completely understand the argument against it. I will say that my spending habits in other categories are much less excessive (e.g. public transportation to work, max out 401k, save &#062;30% of monthly income). 
@Dollar D - I am fully aware that the 2/3 month salary &quot;guideline&quot; is driven by industry...just like Sweetest Day is...yet I still find myself celebrating a made up holiday every year :)  Oh well...happy wife happy life?

Thanks again everyone,

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the opinions everyone - I&#039;m sure it helps!  Good good stuff indeed :)

@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re funny :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - A ruby? Cool!! I want a pic! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - I LOVE THAT!!!  Jewels that have been passed down like that are amazingly awesome - I would have loved to given my wife one of those if it were a possibility :) Means so much!
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes!!  Am I right in assuming he wasn&#039;t good at paying attention to you? Like with details, your likes, dislikes, etc?  My wife used to get gold jewelry from her ex-boyfriends and she could never understand it as she always wore silver and told them she doesn&#039;t even LIKE gold! Haha...  so I guess they&#039;re chilling with your ex in the club too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MrsGreen&lt;/b&gt; - Good reminder!  Insure that bad boy ASAP just in case something crazy happens - that&#039;s a lot of $$ in play!]]></description>
