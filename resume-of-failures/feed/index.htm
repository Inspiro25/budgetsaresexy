Agreeing all the way, brother.

And sometimes it&#039;s great going into things naive as well, because you take risks that pay off whether accidental or not! I wouldn&#039;t do half the things I used to in my youth knowing what I know now haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;failure the greatest teacher is&quot; - quote by somebody in some movie

I honestly believe the first step to success is failure. It is extremely hard to succeed if you don&#039;t know how to fail. I&#039;ve made a ton of mistakes in my life, but am certainly better for it. It&#039;s gotten me to where I am now.

Love this post and the confessional aspect to it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loaned money to my first girlfriend. Waited to yell at her when she did not pay back according to our terms. Covered a month&#039;s rent in a fancy apartment for a different girlfriend when I had agreed to half. Had my business pay me before it was ready and subsequently had to re-loan my business the money plus some. 

Too much on alcohol when I was on a team sport.]]></description>

Well had I gotten the job I&#039;d be Jeff Bezos&#039; personal assistant now.  Maybe I would have gotten free Prime membership out of it - damn!]]></description>

Hah - thank you sir! Edited! And glad you liked my take on it all - that&#039;s what makes $$$ blogs so helpful in general in my opinion. Everyone&#039;s sharing their own views on a topic that&#039;s remained virtually the same for thousands of years, haha... And yet we still need to hear it in more ways for stuff to finally soak in :)]]></description>

Good!! And all of us bloggers think the same because there is ALWAYS someone doing something better or cooler or whatever than you are. But at the end of the day our jobs aren&#039;t to be the coolest or best around, it&#039;s to be US because that&#039;s why our readers are there on our sites to begin with :) Or else they&#039;d be on all the other blogs instead, right? Plus no one else has our &quot;story&quot; so as long as we try keeping as true to it as possible we should be headed in the right direction... Even though we&#039;ll still feel sucky because that&#039;s the nature of imposture syndrome, haha... But maybe if you type it out enough it incrementally gets better? :)]]></description>
