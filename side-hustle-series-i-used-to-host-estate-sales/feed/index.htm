					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-series-i-used-to-host-estate-sales/#comment-119556&quot;&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/a&gt;.

I love to haunt estate sales, garage sales and more. The way to get the best deals for resale is like this.  First day is usually full of other vendors trying to find that great deal to resale. It pays to show up the first day and look for priced right resale items. It is always better to buy in bulk and if you do you can ask for a bulk price which is usually lower than the listed price. 
Last day of the event and near closing they want to clear out as much as possible. There is the chance that you will still find great resale that vendors found too expensive the first day. Take what you can afford for a good discount on the last day and start your listing of items.... furniture is usually a hard sale and there is a lot left over on the last day. You can make good deals on furniture if you have the room to resale. Also open every box and check every nook for hidden treasures. It is amazing what you can find this way. I found hearing aids that I bought for ten dollars and resold for 200.  hope this helps out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article with good info. My husband and I are retiring soon and wondered if this would be a good source of income for us. I have worked in a consignment shop for years, done e-bay and rented vendor booths in antique stores to buy and resell. So I have quite a bit of knowledge and will certainly have the time. What do you think?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having my own estate sale soon. I have a fully furnished house that I&#039;m transitioning from an full time AirBNB to a 1 year lease. 
Great article, and I will use these tips to host it. 
Thanks!

					<description><![CDATA[Estate sales are the best. I&#039;ve not only found some really interesting items that were passed over by some of the other buyers, but it lets me check out the interior of the house when the house itself has been for sale, as has been the case in virtually all the estate sales I&#039;ve been to. That&#039;s a good way to look over a home if you&#039;re interested in moving to a particular area also.

Unfortunately, I work weekends, so I wouldn&#039;t have the time to try this, but I can stop by estate sales that others are conducting to find things to resell.]]></description>

Challenging!  And then the shipping costs factor in and everything! :) It&#039;s fun, I should just put a ban on buying things in general for awhile.]]></description>

Haha... Maybe you could implement a &quot;only spend the money you make off eBay&quot; type deal? that way you have a limit and you know 100% you&#039;re not going over :) (Would also make it challenging but even MORE worth a good deal when you find one!)]]></description>
