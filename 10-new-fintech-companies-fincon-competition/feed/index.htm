Sounds pretty similar indeed, and maybe that&#039;s the part that stands out w/ Birch? The matching against other cards available that you currently don&#039;t have?

Regardless, we&#039;ll have to meet up at next year&#039;s event :) Make sure to stop me when we cross paths!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money, I was Not able to attend his year&#039;s event but I look forward to 2018. I will definitely be checking out these apps. as for birch it sounds a lot like Wallaby so not sure if that&#039;s the one you were thinking of. I like the fact that Wallaby tells me which card to use based on all the benefits and I think it also suggests other cards in the market. However, I dont think it has the capability to do what if scenarios to show you what you missed had you use a different card. Anyways, appreciate all the info and perhaps I&#039;ll get to meet you and all the crazy millionaires while dancing on the floor next year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey - thanks for the shoutout!  It was so so great meeting you but much to my (and Nate&#039;s) disappointment we didn&#039;t get a whole lot of time to talk.  Not to worry, I plan to hunt you down and hold you hostage at FInCon18 for a full 5 minutes of conversation.  BE READY!!  ;)]]></description>

Haha yup - everyone does assume side hustles are steps to a larger hustle! Good for you for knowing what you want out of it and sticking to it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t do too much with credit card rewards, but Birch sounds very interesting and it could be beneficial to a lot of people. I liked Take Command Health but some others I talked to said there were some hiccups with the platform. 

It was great to meet you (and Jim$)! See you next year in Orlando!]]></description>
