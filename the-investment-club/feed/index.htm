					<description><![CDATA[I will also add that in starting an Investment Club the group would need to set a mindset as to whether they are going to act like a business or a club.  These are totally different mindsets and could lead to differing By-Laws and policies.

We started ours more like a business, but I think we act more &quot;club-like&quot;.  I think it would be beneficial to decide up front.

Lastly, in setting up an investment group, the members gain what it is like to start a business and what it is to maintain one.  GOOD skills to have in life!]]></description>

The whiskey could work for any type of meetings, really ;) Should be mandatory, in my book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this idea! I&#039;ve never thought about investing in a group before. I&#039;m sure it presents some unique challenges, but it seems like it would have way more pros than cons when considering the value of the &quot;mastermind&quot;.

I&#039;m also digging your idea about bringing a bottle of whiskey for post-meeting conversations :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing our story J. Money!

I&#039;m the &#039;J&#039; that Ugo mentioned in the story and just wanted to add that we started selecting our investments by using &quot;The Little Blue Book That Beats The Market&quot; by Joel Greenblatt.  It helped us to have a strategy that we all agreed to follow  before we started creating different portfolios with other strategies.  

Appreciate your content and feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic post J!  What a way to meet like-minded folks and grow a portfolio.  I often thought about doing this with young people to try to get them into investing at a young age, but haven&#039;t gotten that off the ground yet, maybe this will be my motivation.  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
