Interesting insight :)

And I hear ya on the credit score stuff... I pay attention, but don&#039;t go out of my way to improve it or anything unless a large purchase like a house is on its way as unfortunately creditors still care about it :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey all....as a manager of an office  and the hiring authority, I cannot tell you of how many times I have passed up a highly educated but totally-lacking common sense applicant who wants to start out at 50K per year because they have student debt. Super tragic. I am looking for someone that cares about the public and our clients, knows who they are, is motivated and wants to make a difference instead of having entitlement issues. Incredibly enough, I find that a lot of my scholastic achievers use up all their leave as soon as they earn it and am now convinced that a person&#039;s leave balance is a great predictor of their credit score....why? Because it comes down to immediate gratification and the kiss of death for those who have any available credit. Seems like they have to use it NOW. For the record, I rarely use credit anymore and don&#039;t care about my credit score because a great credit score means I am a properly trained generator of interest....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To everyone that would rather have 1 million and a bad credit score - go borrow a million and you&#039;ll most likely have what you said - a million and a bad credit score.  

Are you sure?

(Always remember that 76% of statistics are made up on the spot - including that one.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just being graduate from a good school is plus. And, I think experience and skills can set you apart from the rest and give you an edge. I know so many people who do not come from school belonging to ivy league, but they are now working with people from those ivy league schools. It&#039;s really about dedication and skills.]]></description>

hey!

I think you&#039;ve figured it out now since I see a pic of you here, but for any others reading this all you need to do is go to Gravatar.com and you can then attach any pics to any emails of yours which will then carry over whenever you leave comments around the web (or at least on WP blogs). Pretty cool!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was totally thinking &quot;why wouldnt people want good credit over money?&#039; and completely missed the point: When FI YOU DO NOT NEED CREDIT to pay for things, nor do you want to use credit therefore you do not need a credit score and so TAKE THE MILLION $$! Derp!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Give me the million dollars over the credit score anyday! I can rebuild a credit score with that much money! I can&#039;t believe some people. 

I&#039;m surprised at the secure check when shopping online, I would have guess like 90% of people don&#039;t check for that. I know I do only on occasion.]]></description>
