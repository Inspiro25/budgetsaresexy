I guess that&#039;s true, huh? I always think of things as &quot;all or nothing&quot; but the smart thing would have just had a nibble and then pushed away, haha... next time :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would have stayed I think. It would have been a bit of a pride thing for me. As far as eating the delicious but likely not healthy food, I would have done it regardless because I would have paid for it.

					<description><![CDATA[I would definitely have stayed to enjoy it.  If it was still a great deal, and you had always wanted to eat there, you&#039;re getting the experience for a good price.  As for the food, I know what you&#039;re talking about in terms of having to avoid things for your health.  I probably would have snuck a couple of bites, like a partial cheater.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This happened to us once at Disneyland at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  We were exhausted and hot and this place was close.  I don&#039;t remember the prices, but they seemed to be $30 a plate, we sipped on our waters for a minute than bolted.  Looking back we should have told the waiter our dilemma.  I&#039;m sure we were not the first folks to do this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny that your story comes right after an interesting experience I recently went through. As a travel writer, I try to find local and unique restaurants and experiences where ever I go. I did some research on &quot;where the locals eat&quot; in Buckhead Atlanta and found what looked like a divine, small, upscale place for dinner. I made reservations and there I was at 6pm for dinner. I was swept in and lead to my table and I looked around-yes, it was cozy, small, modern decor. &quot;Perfect&quot; I thought. A new person brought water and a menu. So okay, I don&#039;t really eat a &quot;fine dining&quot; establishments-too fancy-too fussy-too expensive. The menu had a 5-8 course vegetarian menu and a 5-8 course protein menu-with no prices. Oh no, I knew what that mean&#039;t, I couldn&#039;t afford to eat here!  I looked at the wine list and felt panicked-trying to decide should I embarrass myself and get up and leave or suck it up and have a &quot;fine dining experience&quot; at one of Buckhead&#039;s best restaurants. My pride got the better of me and I decided stay the course. My 5 course vegetarian meal was $85 and my glass of wine was $14. I nursed it the entire time, determined not to order another glass. 

Each course was brought out by a different person and each was beautiful, artfully designed, made of ingredients I had mostly never heard of and oh so small. I believe I might have insulted the chef as he sent me out a &quot;special&quot; treat- a raw egg yoke in the shell with creme and spices. Uh, no thanks. I tried to use the tiny spoon to eat the creme and move the yolk around but the waiter knew I didn&#039;t eat it. I said, &quot;please thank the chef.&quot; I felt so uncomfortable the entire meal that I didn&#039;t really enjoy the experience at all. You can imagine the final bill with tip was pretty hefty. I decided that next time I would embarrass myself, if necessary, and leave.

I think at $20 instead of $10, I would have stayed and enjoyed :)]]></description>

If it wasn&#039;t too long ago you should definitely contact Groupon and explain the situation and ask if you can get a refund. Never hurts to try and if you happen to be a frequent customer you&#039;ve got some advantage!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm interesting story. I think I would&#039;ve left if the price doubled. Plus $20 for lunch is more than I like to spend too! Hehe and I would&#039;ve eaten the dessert...I don&#039;t have much resistance towards sweets at all. 

I actually found myself in a similar situation once at Olive Garden on a weekend. I always enjoyed their $6.99 soup, salad and bread lunch and ordered that on a Saturday. They informed me that since on Saturdays it&#039;s dinner price only it would be $13.99. This was a change they had made recently. So I let him know my dissatisfaction, he talked to his manager, and told me that they would give me the $6.99 price. Otherwise I would&#039;ve walked out. Not paying $13.99 for soup, salad, and breadsticks!]]></description>
