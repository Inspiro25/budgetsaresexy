This year we&#039;ve done SAVOR and AMEX for cash back. And then we are doing Bank Account bonuses too so there&#039;s no credit implications.  I think we&#039;ll take it easy over the summer and maybe start up again later this year before the holiday season when our spending increases again :)]]></description>

CONGRATS!!!!!  Double comma club!!  Oaxaca was amazing, just got home late last night. I can see myself returning - next time for a much longer time. I think you could live there like a king for prob 2000-2500 per month, easy. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was wondering about your 401(k) -- seems like you just recently started contributing (but I guess that was a while ago now). Yikes! Glad you&#039;ve still got the gig, even if they switched your categorization. We throttled back our tax-advantaged plans a few months ago in favor of the after-tax brokerage too; our IRAs and 401(k) savings are kinda stacked already and annoying to access for the next eighteen years. 

We only maxed out our 401(k) plans for four years and our home equity is right around $265k, but somehow our net worth tripped seven figures in April. Absolutely nuts. I never expected to get there so quickly. Too bad we&#039;re about to drop a ton of cash on exterior painting and a new roof... but if the market keeps marketing that shouldn&#039;t be a concern. 

Color me envious of your Oaxaca trip. I think we&#039;ve got plans to return to Mérida for a couple weeks in January 2023 to escape mid-Atlantic winter. Kill some cervezas preparadas for me!]]></description>
