HAH! Love that!!! And funny you mention the lobsters in the tank - I&#039;m ALWAYS showing those to the wee one and he gets such a kick out of them. As do I :) Except for the parts they&#039;re about to be murdered and eaten *gasp*.

I&#039;ll have to keep my eyes open for those car cars though. I&#039;ve seen them around but never think to look for them while entering the store - great idea indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re good at NOT buying things in stores, look for ones that have what we call &quot;car carts&quot;: where the kids sit facing forward and each have a wheel to &quot;drive&quot; with. In Nova Scotia we have these at one local grocery store chain, and one of the home improvement stores. So stick the kid(s) in the car cart and go up and down every single aisle looking at things you don&#039;t usually look at. (e.g., the lobsters in the tank! whole fish staring at you with dead eyes at the fish counter! vegetables! cheeses! or at the home improvement store - every imaginable kind of nail! paintbrushes, mirrors, curtains, plumbing fittings, ride-on lawnmowers, Christmas lights, patio doors). Take your time. It&#039;s a great way to kill time on a rainy afternoon, and we get lots of those here... the cart is the main attraction for the kids anyway.]]></description>

I used to love ALIVE bugs a lot and would keep them in my lunchboxes to hang out with during lunch time as a kid, haha... Never got into the dead ones though, at least that I can remember (though unfortunately some of my alive ones turned south if I forgot about them :()]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t super into bugs as a little kid, but around middle school I did Science Olympiad and got really into identifying bugs/water species/tree species I made flashcards of all of the different bugs and then would go out and explore creeks to look for live bugs and identify all the trees. Bug hunting for nerds!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also used to be fond of collecting bugs. I didn&#039;t know why I did it but I was really excited about these bugs. It made me simply happy. Ow, that experience was really really awesome. Mom and dad were surely be contended because they wouldn&#039;t have to spend so much money for toys. :)]]></description>
