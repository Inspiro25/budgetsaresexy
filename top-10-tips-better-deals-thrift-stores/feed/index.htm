					<description><![CDATA[Oh no!!! Haha... that&#039;s the worst rule to break! ;)  I hope it&#039;s there for you, friend, that&#039;s one of the worst feelings with shopping.  And pretty crazy that he actually WANTED it too!  He&#039;s like my wife who gets nervous with what I&#039;m bringing home all the time - but since I do all the decorating, she only gets to say so much ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went this weekend too (actually lendingy services to help a friend find stuff!) and sadly I broke rule #10!! Gasp! I found a very very very cute desk, solid wood, clean, a few imperfections but nothing I couldn&#039;t fix.... And I walked away!! Only because I worried about hubby having my head if I shove one more piece of furniture in the garage! It was only $44!! And wouldn&#039;t you know I was telling hubby about it, and he said (get this), &quot;why didn&#039;t you buy it?? I want a really sturdy desk and not that Ikea table/desk I have been using.&quot; !! So I&#039;m going back tomorrow when it is 25% off Customer Appreciation Day and see if its still there. Wanna bet on whether it&#039;s there? :-/. Lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[TeacHer-- I&#039;m going to have to check that out! Have you heard about the other place in NY called called Film Biz Prop Shop? Supposedly it&#039;s a 2nd hand shop for props that have been in movies and what-not. I sooooo want to check it out! It looks totally cool! They&#039;re address is: 540 President Street Basement, Brooklyn, NY. If you happen to check it out, please let me know if it&#039;s worth the trip there :)

Aggie--Yes, give it a try! It can&#039;t hurt!

Cherleen -- A funny thought-- I can&#039;t imagine wearing anyone&#039;s used underwear and socks, but for some reason, I pass these things down from my 3 sons....?? LOL  BAD MOM!

Aunty Lou -- I agree. 50 cent bargaining is downright cheapskate-ish! I wonder who those people are??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article! I&#039;d add a caveat to the rule about always haggling, though: if you&#039;re in a charity shop arguing over 50 cents, just stop. Have some class. And yes, I&#039;ve seen people do it.]]></description>
