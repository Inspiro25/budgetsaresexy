					<description><![CDATA[Congrats!

Cool news.  One thing to consider if you haven&#039;t already...  Your wife should be eligible for a 457 retirement plan.  After taking full advantage of any match to a 403b, it can be a great option.  The money in the 457 isn&#039;t subject to any penalty if used before 59 1/2 (as long as you have separated service).  It&#039;s a good option for folks that want to retire in their 50&#039;s.  Just a thought.  Good luck with the new opportunity!]]></description>

Thanks so much!

We actually *just* found the place we&#039;ll now be living (more on the blog tomorrow), but we&#039;re pretty excited about it :) Ended up sticking close to where the actual job is (not in the city) so there&#039;s less commuting and more family time, but it def. wasn&#039;t cheap... 

Thankfully it&#039;s not permanent though :)]]></description>

That&#039;s what we keep hearing too! I think eventually we&#039;ll need/want one, but wondering if we can make it one last round until pulling the trigger ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But you can take the kids to the zoo for free. So that&#039;s like an extra $20 saved each year. =) Best place for writing: Botanical gardens in the winter. So that will save you like 4 bucks in Starbucks coffee. =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Depending on where her job actually is (feds work in many more places around DC than *just* &quot;the city&quot;), you might be better off living closer to that area.  We loved living in NoVA, and have seriously considered moving back, despite the cost of living (although, we pay more for a house in Pittsburgh than we did in Centreville because of the property taxes).  Housing prices near metro stations are high, but many of the outlying counties (like Leesburg and Frederick) offer commuter busses.  A friend living in Burke and a fed worker slugs in, or rides the bus.  There are a *lot* of carpool options, and there&#039;s a local program Guaranteed Ride Home that will pay for up to 4 &quot;emergencies&quot; per year to get home (like sick child needs picked up from daycare) if you normally take transit.  

Congrats to the Mrs on her job and good luck moving back!]]></description>
