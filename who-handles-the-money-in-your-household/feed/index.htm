That last list gives me a lot of hope for my own kids when they&#039;re old enough to take on some responsibility :)

And too funny about your husband not wanting to know when $$$ is down, haha... 

At least one of you will always be in the know!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the spin you take on your blog.  

This time around I have a good situation. My wife and I both have the same financial vision.  When we spend money, it&#039;s more on experiences and not stuff.  Both of us don&#039;t buy crap just for the sake of shopping and we have 7-year-old cars.   We&#039;re not into the shiny object syndrome. Although I have to say, it took me a while to figure out how to smart with money.]]></description>

Excellent idea!!!!!

Better yet, why not print it out and paste it on the mirror once a month for a not-so-subtle reminder, hmm....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in charge of all the long term investing/saving, what stocks to buy, which mutual funds in IRA/401K.  I also get to do all the big housework, floors, vacuum, change the bed sheets, and wash the cars every now and then.  (Wife had a major car accident a few years ago, so  can&#039;t do the heavy-lifting stuff anymore.

She is in charge of the smaller household chores and manages our day to day finances.  We have been doing this for most of our 38 years together and it seems to work out just fine.

I also had trouble with her not knowing where we were in net worth, so I put a spread sheet on the desktop of her computer so she can open it whenever she would like to see the numbers.  Seems to work mostly, I just have to remember to update it every few months.]]></description>
