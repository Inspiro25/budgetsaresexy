					<description><![CDATA[Heyyy! Sorry it’s been a while since I’ve been on your blog so I missed the fundraiser for Agatha. I can and will pray for her though. 

Puppy &#038; kids are adorable:). And yes ring around the rosey is awful! Let’s make up a new one for the coronavirus ;)

Noooooo, on your eventually not being on here. I know it’s coming and you’ll still be around but :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not sure how it works in the US, but here in the UK we could NOT do without Pet Insurance for our two fur babies. 

One developed seizures and is now on daily medication, the other has had two hip operations (she was a rescue dog) both of which were in the 5k region. 

I hope your dog never ever needs anything like that (what a gorgeous wee thing!) but then that&#039;s what insurance is based on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love your new puppy :) :) :) We got a rescue a few years ago named Yoda (who is a Yorkie/Mini-schnauzer mix).  A shelter rescued him from a kill-shelter :( I still can&#039;t believe the previous owners of such a sweet 5 mo. old puppy could do that.  

Your dog will bring you and your family so much joy!  So we actually have pet insurance for Yoda just because he suffers from allergies and goes to the vet every 4-6 weeks for a shot so for us it is worth it and makes financial sense.]]></description>

Ours is such a sweet dog and very good with our kids. We also rescued from a shelter along with his sister. The shelter was out of Radford, VA I believe and all they could definitively tell us was that it was a beagle mix. We&#039;re thinking the other half comes from some sort of hound. Either way, we&#039;ve had them since 2010 and love them both so much.]]></description>

We discovered that shopping around for a vet was a much bigger value than the pet insurance.  Sick visits with antibiotics where we go seem to be around 1/2 the cost of other nearby places and the vet is fantastic so it doesn&#039;t seem to be related to quality.   So we too are setting money aside, but the vet bills are pretty small so far (less than one months of pet insurance for a visit).]]></description>
