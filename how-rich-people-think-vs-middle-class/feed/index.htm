I believe to become rich, we must stop believing in the old ways. They are unconsciously  guiding us by the industrial ways of thinking, or even a primitive reptilian thinking. Our thought process is led by the Me generation. In order for us to reach great heights, we must first try things that we&#039;ve never done before, become risky, try to see from different perspectives. The  reason that we remain as we are, is simply that we played life safe. The rich are rich, because they never was scared, being scared to them never was a notion. They believed they could do anything and so they did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post should be a prerequisite that kids should have to read at a young age. It&#039;s simple enough anyone can understand and it&#039;s brief enough that a child can finish it before getting distracted. It&#039;s important for adults too. :) The fact is accomplishment in any field towards any intended goal is about becoming a certain person with certain values and certain habits. You do enough of the right things for a long enough period of time and the law of cause and effect will take over. If you live congruently with your values and habits and beliefs, and you do enough things right for long enough, I believe success is inevitable. Thanks for the insights, Steve Siebold is on my radar of authors to potentially read so it&#039;s a good reminder to put him on my list.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always new I will never be middle class
Coming from a family where every one was money saving mentality, I always loved to spend and look for opportunity to earn more.
Despite a fixed income jobs, I used to have extra side income in my early days doing deals.
Finally when I started business, I never kept and still never do budgets, spend as much as I feel am worthy of the product of my need.
A rich man mind believes he will always be winner and will always earn. He becomes more focused on his competencies which will result in performance and performance will ensure competitiveness which is a $ sign.
Good luck to all who wants to be millionaire and good luck to all who wish to sleep well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Best comment of the day, good sir. So very very true - I believe we all have the potential to do big things too! Even outside of the wealth we can all make a much bigger impact in this world if we align ourselves right and just kill it.

Thanks for stopping by, bro :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I so agree, J, what should really drive us is our dreams and what makes us happy. While I personally think most people have the capability of becoming rich, and while I even believe most would also enjoy both the effort and the end-result, for some reason only few do the necessary to really get there. Most people I know don&#039;t really dream of becoming wealthy and they don&#039;t believe it would even make them that happy. 

To me it seems that most people don&#039;t seriously believe they could ever become wealthy, so even the thought of actually taking specific steps towards this type of financial goals feels ridiculous, maybe even embarrassing. The &quot;it wouldn&#039;t make me happy&quot; part is probably then a good supporting justification to keep people from longing for something that they (think they can&#039;t) get anyhow.  

I&#039;d love everyone to see the potential they have in themselves, and maybe &quot;thinking like rich people&quot; can help in this. Yet, if you are driven by and dreaming of totally other things than financial success, then go for those - you only have one life to live so why not spend it doing things that make you happy!]]></description>

Hey J. Money! “A matter of changing your mentality,” reminded me of a book I just finished; Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. 

Hill advocates growing rich by purposefully changing your mindset, partially achieved through daily auto-suggestion and intense visualization of positive outcomes. 

Highly recommended for anyone interested in growing his or her wealth. :)]]></description>
