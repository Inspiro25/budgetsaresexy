No, not quite! We just stopped being as aggressive with it - wanted some more balance with liquidity and it got less scary as it got smaller (SO close to five figures now!!). We refinanced down to a 10 year term recently and plan to pay it off in five years by making double payments.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on number 3! Brings back memories 
We have 3. Back in 11/2014 when the first was just 2yo my twins were born. We waited on buying the minivan till they were born. The barely used odyssey popped up at a great price when they were 1 month old. They were exclusively breast fed at that time so the whole crew went to the dealership bc I couldn’t let the hubs do the negotiating alone. We were there 6 hours &#038; the twins were breast fed twice in an empty office 
Bottom line: the minivan is awesome for 3 kids!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a big jump for one month! Congrats and keep going! You&#039;re almost there! We&#039;ve seen a steady increase in net worth over months but no huge jumps like that. We&#039;re paying off our car this month though so thats an extra $450 each month!

That image of Personal Capital is super old! It looks a lot better than that. I&#039;m trying it out now versus Mint to see which one I like. Mint I&#039;ve used for a very long time, PC just half a year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hope the baby appears soon - must be so frustrating just waiting and waiting and waiting. And a healthy net worth increases all round as well.

It&#039;s a quasi-milestone for me - I hit $1m in net-worth, but I think I need £1m to be a real millionaire!]]></description>
