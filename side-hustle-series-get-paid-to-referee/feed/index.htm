I get paid like 35- 45$ a game as an AR for soccer. I might referee 4 games in a weekend. So, on a good weekend I make 180$]]></description>

I refereed soccer in Tucson for the club soccer leagues. The referees don&#039;t get paid. All are volunteers who do it for the love of the game or because their kid is a player. So I don&#039;t know for what organization your roommate is a ref but the club league that you see playing at Rillito Park on saturdays in Tucson are all Volunteers.]]></description>

What about registering with the AIA to do high school baseball? Even if you might not have the time to actually do high school baseball, you will still be able to get in contact with the local high school association, get training, and be able to work paid baseball in the spring, summer, and fall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-series-get-paid-to-referee/#comment-123794&quot;&gt;Brian @ Luke1428&lt;/a&gt;.

Especially if only working in a 2-person crew. A basketball official cannot see everything on the court, and that problem is made worse when there are only 2 officials present (the standard for any level below high school varsity), because there are blind spots in each official&#039;s designated primary area of responsibility (it is hard for the Lead to see across the lane, and impossible for the Trail to see what is happening near the sideline away from him). Transition coverage is also inconsistent in 2-person crews. I know this because I am a registered high school official in basketball (and baseball, football, and volleyball) in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia, and I have experience working in both 2 and 3 person crews for basketball. A 3-person crew has an easier time in these situations, because the outside officials (the Trail and Center) each are responsible for one sideline, and can see action on their side, and the Lead is free to move to the other side to provide assistance as needed (this is called a &quot;rotation&quot;). Transition is easier, because one official can concentrate on each wave of players moving down the court, as opposed to the Lead having to stay back in a 2-person game. The money might not be there for consistent 3-person games below the varsity level, but I think that competitive youth leagues (travel leagues), men&#039;s leagues, and tournaments should seriously consider contracting with local associations to provide 3 officials to each game to provide a superior quality of floor coverage, better game management, and a safer experience for the participants. With enough good will and flexibility (the association paying supplements to officials (Normal 2P fee is $30/official, if officials want $25 for a 3P game, league pays $20/official, association pays $5/official) , agreements to rotate pay among the 3 officials in a crew (A,B,C work together, each gets paid for 2 games while working 3), officials being assigned unpaid games on occasion, or splitting the normal 2-person fee in 3 instead (Normal 2P fee is $60 each, officials get paid $40 each)). 

It may seem that I am pushing for 3 person crews in basketball wherever possible because of my self-interest as an official. While that may be a factor, I want any readers to appreciate the hard work put in by basketball officials when they have to work games consistently shorthanded from a position of disadvantage.]]></description>

Ugh, that&#039;s lame... good for you for still doing it because you&#039;re so passionate. I&#039;d much rather be doing something I love for no pay than pay for something I hate!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I heard from the Umpire In Charge at the final championship game (after umpiring more than 30 games for the spring season), &quot;oh I found out Arizona is the only state that doesn&#039;t pay the Little league umpires.&quot; 
I thought it was less funny than he did. 
I continue to say, &quot;I&#039;m going to stop umpiring Little League&quot;, but I don&#039;t umpire selfishly. I do it for the kids. I end up doing it every year anyway. So call me a sucker. Because I&#039;ve seen the referees for soccer getting paid cash from under the picnic table. It just isn&#039;t fair. The soccer refs. complain they don&#039;t get paid enough? I wish I just got a gas card, I buy all my gear and learn more than 1700 rules for Little league. Soccer has 17 rules and they run around in shorts like a girl. I&#039;m really sick of it. These unpaid taxes the soccer refs are getting away from paying ends up being in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in Tucson Arizona.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been a volunteer Little League umpire for district 12 for 8 years. I have never gotten more than a drink and a hotdog. In Tucson, Az. I believe there is money, otherwise where does the money go. No different than soccer referees. But baseball little league umpires are not paid a penny unless you are a kid umpire, which the real umpires train. The kids get paid ~$15 a game. Adult real umpires, all that I know, don&#039;t get a penny. I suppose the UIC gets paid and the district manager gets money, but the person on the hot sun getting hit by bats and balls, don&#039;t get paid a penny.
Soccer referees are paid for less work, less time and less rules to remember than Baseball umpires. Then after the game a person comes from a bank or some resource and cash is given to every soccer referee. They don&#039;t pay taxes, no traceable money. 
Very unfair, unlawful when the soccer referees don&#039;t pay any taxes. Cash under the table. I have seen it. My roommate is a soccer ref. and laughs at me when I gear up to umpire home plate in &#062;105 degree weather. If I ask a upper little league umpire supervisor, they lie and tell me our league will get better. I don&#039;t like it and I don&#039;t like the continuous lying by Upper Level Supervisor Little League individuals. Someone tell the IRS. It is not right.]]></description>
