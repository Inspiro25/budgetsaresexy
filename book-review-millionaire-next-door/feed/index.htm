					<description><![CDATA[This is kind of late to respond but I want to say something.

I just read the book this weekend and I loved it. I think a million dollars in assets is better than nothing even with inflation and all. From my perspective it didn&#039;t seem to me like these millionaires were depriving themselves, although unfortunately that is what a lot of people seem to get from reading the book. 

Although at first they did have to make sacrifices especially when  starting out. It seems from every case that the authors talked to that the millionaires found a lifestyle they were comfortable with leading, while also making good money, saving and living below their means. I think why a lot of people don&#039;t like this book is because companies are good at marketing products to us and having us part with our money and many of us end up broke.

So it seems like becoming the millionaire next door is overwhelming and impossible. For example, I&#039;m in college, and the average college student doesn&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong with parting with $200-400 for a new smartphone. We just accept that&#039;s &quot;how it is&quot; and it&#039;s &quot;normal for everyone to have a smartphone.&quot;

So yes a million in the long run isn&#039;t anywhere near a billion, but when you&#039;re 65 would you rather be the person that has zero or the person with a million dollars in assets?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[keep working hard for that 1 million dollars. That is baby money these days. You should feel ashameed if you don&#039;t have 1 million dollars by the time you are 50. By the time you are 65, you should have at least 2 million dollars. Stop living below your means.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hell yeah - I&#039;d take a million dollars any day!  You could live off that for a while if you managed it well.  And if you *worked for it* you&#039;d have a much better appreciation too over winning it, say, in the lottery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yadgyu&#039;s comments are pretty dumb. Exactly the kind of person who would be an UAW in the book being reviewed. Granted, a million dollars isn&#039;t all that much, but it is still infinitely better than being in debt or having no money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, right?  Really really good book.... And one of the authors (Thomas J. Stanley) is on Twitter and really good at responding too!  So you should totally hit him up when you&#039;re done and let him know what you think ;)

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading the book right now and loving it. I plan to take the million and use it to make exponentially more money. 

Interestingly, the book says something about only 10% of millionaires receiving any inherited money, and they don&#039;t plan to leave their money to thier loved ones. They expect their children learn the value of money and build their wealth their damn selves. Sounds like a good idea to me!]]></description>
