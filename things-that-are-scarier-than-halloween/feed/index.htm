					<description><![CDATA[I spent about $120 on candy, pumpkins, costumes and a fall wreath.  Money well spent.  I hope as a parent I have given my child wonderful memories the way my parents gave me. How much is that worth? My heart literally skips a beat when I see the beautiful foliage and homes with pumpkins on the front stoops with fall wreathes and cornstalk decorations.  I remember the weekend trip of apple picking and choosing my pumpkin from a local farm.  The apple cider and apple cider donuts completed the day. The apple pies we baked from the fresh apples were amazing. I remember trick or treating with the neighborhood kids and my pillowcase stuffed with candy.  The chilled air, the leaves crackling underfoot, the pumpkins, the excitement etc.  Sometimes living a little and spending some money is so worth it. I got my $120 worth.  If my daughter is left with good childhood memories than my return on investment was priceless.]]></description>

Neither I nor my spouse drink, and never have.  I HATE splitting the check in situations like that.  I remember one time where I must&#039;ve thrown in ~$40 more that I needed to, only to be told that I was still too low.  That was the last time I ever spent any time with that group of people.]]></description>

This is too true! And then being grumpy the next day for not getting decent sleep because you were so worried about your alarm not going off!]]></description>

That little joker did not show up.  Cornered him at a soccer game last night to ask what happened?  He said his parents (blame it on the parents) took him to another neighborhood with more houses.  I did get four kids and one adult - yes the mother held out a bag for candy.]]></description>

Yes - it was an excellent clip!

And yes - they own a car too, he just prefers to bike as often as possible :) Although without a helmet apparently, and when people called him out on it he got pretty defensive. Guess safety isn&#039;t as cool as FIRE.]]></description>

100% on sleep walking through life.

It can pass you by so fast if you&#039;re not paying attention!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being 63 years old with NO retirement savings living paycheck to paycheck (family friend). Says he&#039;ll work till he dies or can&#039;t stand up anymore. *PS ALL retirement savings contribution limits are being increased in 2019 due to inflation! So check out the new increased limits for SEP, 529, IRA&#039;s, 401K, etc, etc.
We spent $5 on 2 huge pumpkins. Will toast the seeds. Spent $6.50 on 3 bags of candy (on sale plus used coupons). Only had 11 kids. Too much leftover candy!
PPS did you see Mr. Money Moustache did a segment on PBS last week? Nice to put a face to a name. He mentioned how costly it is to own a car &#038; he bikes everywhere. Not sure if that means he &#038; his wife don&#039;t own even one car?]]></description>
