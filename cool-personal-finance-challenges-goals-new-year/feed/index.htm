					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I think you&#039;ll be obsessing for the rest of your life then as there&#039;s *always* something financial you could be working on ;) At least it would be a lot more fun than debt though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, J. Money! Getting rid of my student loans are a bit of an obsession rather than a goal.. If there&#039;s something that I can do to knock the interest rate down or to pay them off faster, I will. I&#039;m honestly not sure what I&#039;m going to do with my time once all my debt is paid off! I guess then it&#039;ll be time to go looking for some more debt (a.k.a.) a mortgage! Or maybe I&#039;ll just obsess over saving and investing, probably smarter. =P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Nancy&lt;/b&gt; - Fun!!  I wish I could have you here to help with ours, we suck at cabinet stuff... will probably have to hire someone one day to do it :(  Congrats on the almost $1k E Fund - that&#039;s important! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey @ Zero to One Million Challenge&lt;/b&gt; - Now that&#039;s an interesting idea!  I&#039;d never even think about that. You&#039;re smart. Not that I ever doubted you ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money -- I ended up taking out a loan from Lending Club to pay off a big chunk of it. My original plan was to take out a loan to cover ALL of it, and I would have locked in the rate at around 7%. Unfortunately, after &quot;reviewing my credit&quot; they knocked down the loan amount to $8,000. But, at least now I can knock out the one loan that&#039;s 9.375%, and I&#039;m fairly sure I can knock out the rest of it within a year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are focusing on financial goals this year.  We are about a week away from our 1k emergency fund , our big hairy goal is paying off the rest of our debt this year and building our house saving fund.  Our DIY project will be our house though we&#039;ll technically start building next year.  We are going to start building cabinets and some furniture this year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to the credit union Saturday morning to set up my goal for the year: automatic transfer of $200 out of my direct deposited paycheck into savings. I don&#039;t know if I can live without $400/month in my checking/spending account, but I&#039;m going to try my darnedest! 

If I can make it work, I&#039;ll have just over $5,000 in savings on Dec 31, 2012. How sweet is that! Vacation for 2013, saved for!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So yeah - I accidentally called Kristina, &quot;Krystal,&quot; up there - oops.  KRISTINA is the one doing the &quot;no spend&quot; challenge ;)  Sorry!  Y&#039;all got the point though.

@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you - that&#039;s still a nice challenge!  Give it a shot :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Fun!  Maybe it&#039;ll make doing laundry more bearable? ;) We might try and do our own floors in one of our rooms first to see how it goes, but something tells me I wont&#039; have the patience either for it, haha... gotta give it a shot though!
@&lt;b&gt;Nate St. Pierre&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD!  I liked that they were steps you could (literally) check off too - the whole PDF turned me on to be honest with you ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brett&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you found some of these ideas helpful :)
@&lt;b&gt;Juan&lt;/b&gt; - Amen on that, brotha.
@&lt;b&gt;Megan Cassidy&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh that&#039;s kinda cool.  I like that :)  I&#039;d probably start with less cursing... which always makes me want to curse MORE since I can&#039;t do it, haha...	
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle @ Making Sense of Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Good luck!
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Damn, that&#039;s great!  $30k is nothing to sneeze at.  I hope you reach it!  It&#039;s an entry-level salary right there :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah you do!  Good for you on batting away the others and keeping your focus - that&#039;s the mark of a very smart person ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - I hear that. I&#039;m always trying to start a new blog on something cuz I have all these ideas and brain waves, but never know how to streamline it (besides this blog - which is def. hard to maintain at times - talking about money every day takes a lot outta you! haha...).  Let me know how Jobs&#039; bio goes too - it&#039;s on my &quot;maybe&quot; list to check out.
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - You can do it!!  That 10-1 isn&#039;t stupid if you can knock a lot of it out in time before it resets ;)  I don&#039;t know much about those, but I think you can do it?  Or refi once it gets closer?  (Easier said than done, I know).
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Good :)  Little goals = Larger results later.  Glad you found some you can try out!
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - You know it brother. If you can make $3k blogging, you can then make $6k and $12k etc etc.  It&#039;s figuring out *how* that&#039;s the hardest ;)
@&lt;b&gt;One Frugal Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, that is a LOT - jeez... I&#039;m sorry to hear that :(  I def. hope you hit $7k too then!  I have faith in you! :)
@&lt;b&gt;SimpleIslandLiving&lt;/b&gt; - I am in LOVE with your blog!!  I literally clicked over there to find out how you got unemployed, and been reading for the last 40 mins!  (Well, also cuz I&#039;m a slow reader, but still - very captivating and interesting!).  I&#039;m gonna link back to you later on my site - hang in there!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey @ Zero to One Million Challenge&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes, scary!  9% is no joke either, boy... I hope you can knock off a big chunk of it!  No shame in doing it in 2 years rather than 1 either, once it&#039;s gone it&#039;s gone, baby! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Megan H&lt;/b&gt; - I hope the move goes well! That&#039;s exciting :)  One of my favorite things to do growing up (we moved 17+ times due to dad being in the military - was so fun!)
@&lt;b&gt;brooklyn money&lt;/b&gt; - NICE!  That&#039;s no joke yo, I hope you hit it!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - I liked it too :)  Nice and simple point w/ the heart being the only thing in color.  Good luck on your no spend challenge!]]></description>
