					<description><![CDATA[infringing on others rights is plain wrong

if a person knows they are eating and drinking and living a negative unhealthy life they should have every freedom of right to do so
its a freedom of choice after all
why are people so hell bent on trying to decide whats best for others
right now my favorite ingredient is bvo and its being banned across the planet its no longer in my favorite drink mtn dew at least they&#039;re not labeling it anymore ive messaged the company asking if the ingredient is still in the drink but they ignore this question and wont answer it 

all companies have to do is properly label the products
 if the food contains unhealthy poison it should be labeled as such
 like we do with alcohol and tobacco 

this would help those who want to live a healthy lifestyle instead of complaining to get businesses to change the ingredients 
these people ether have chosen to ignore those who eat unhealthy and dont notice that they are ruining it for them
  or think they can demand to force the world to eat the same healthy way they do]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Valaa in hitting it from the insurance side.

					<description><![CDATA[Rather than hit it from the insurance side, a better thing would be to STOP subsidizing unhealthy things, and rather subsidizing healthy foods etc. 
&quot;Just 2.3 percent of subsidies go to nuts, legumes, fruits and vegetables while 84.5% goes to meat, dairy, sugar, oil, starch and alcohol. Is it any wonder that a salad often costs you more than a Big Mac?&quot; http://www.naturalnews.com/028817_food_subsidies.html

&quot;&#039;The Center for Science and Environment in India tried a few years ago to figure out the true cost of a hamburger. Assuming that it was raised on pasture that was once rainforest, the ecological services provided by that rainforest, the loss of diversity, carbon sequestration, water cycling, fuel and tropical product sources, among many other things, the cost would come to $200. The U.S. food industry has huge hidden costs, from the agricultural run-off that causes a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico to the cultural destruction wrought by the “Western” diet. There are also huge health costs associated with poor diet — in 2007, $174 billion was spent in the U.S. caring for people with diabetes — as well as the public funds that support the industrial food system.

Cheap food is “cheat food.” There are all kinds of costs that are externalized from the price we pay at the checkout. We pay those costs one way or another — but the food companies don’t. Merely having a system of free markets with accurate prices still doesn’t address the underlying issues of poverty and disenfranchisement.&#039;&quot;

I&#039;m vegan and doing my part to save the world ;)

Also to be clear, I&#039;m from Canada - but we still have insurance for costs that aren&#039;t covered... and I vote Green Party because I like what I read including what they say on focusing on preventative health care...  and covering proven alternative therapies etc. :)

I&#039;ve only been watching this website for a short time but it&#039;s giving me lots to think about. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Curt - People who make choices that are wrong for them/their health do not escape the consequences.  If the choices are wrong, the consequences are inherent.  We don&#039;t need to contrive them or suggest to know what is best for a person.  Besides that, results of behaviors depend upon the individual.  Statistics and science don&#039;t mean a lick to the 38-year-old clean living neurologist who dropped dead jogging, or the 89-year-old woman who has smoked for 60+ years.  You can call them freaks or exceptions, but there are many in both categories.  Health is something that is ridiculous to insure at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jersey Mom &#038; Healthy Amelia

-- I&#039;m not opposed to allowing people to make dumb mistakes (heaven knows I&#039;ve made some myself)...but if I&#039;m hearing you two correctly, where we differ is that you are advocating that people be allowed to make stupid choices AND not have to deal with the repercussions of those choices (or conversely, not be rewarded like those who make &#039;good&#039; choices, but same thing)...am I reading that wrong? If that&#039;s the case, would you care to elaborate why you feel this way? I&#039;m just trying to understand this way of thinking. 

I just think of this: if your unhealthy behaviors clearly make the overall medical expenses for the pool of insured higher (and they can without a doubt prove that a certain activity causes certain negative health consequences), the insurance company HAS to charge you more if they want to stay in business long-term...if they raise rates for the healthy and unhealthy alike, then the healthier people leave because they are the &#039;good risks&#039; and can get coverage cheaper elsewhere and then it just becomes a downward death spiral for the company stuck with the unhealthy. 

Great discussion J$ by the way...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, man, J. This subject gets me fired up. I know I’m late to the game but I have to chime in. I’m am 100% with Jersey Mom (go Jersey!) The problem comes up with who decides what’s healthy and how to incentivize “healthy” behaviors. When you bring up something like smoking, it’s seems easy and kind of clear cut. Smoking is indeed 100% a choice. It’s good to not smoke. However, something like obesity is much more nuanced. How are we going to police that and do we really want to? Do you really want to be turning in food diaries and tally sheets of your exercise to your employer or insurance company? As an individual, do you really want to give that much info and control over so that you can get a fair price for medical coverage? Should we really be penalizing those that need the most help? 

This turned into quite a long response so I decided to make a blog post of it instead of leaving a mega-comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s really, really easy to say people should be punished mistakes. But I don&#039;t really believe in the stick discipline for something that. Primarily because I strongly believe in freedom and people should have the right to make mistakes with their personal lives. If they want to be lazy, incompetent and poor, let them be and leave them be! Conversely, I do like your proposition of rewarding those with healthy habits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this problem somewhat demonstrates that the insurance model does not fit that well with health care. Insurance is pooling resources to deal with rare catastrophic events. Hence, if we stay with the car model ...

1) It should not pay for regular maintenance.
2) It can not take into account people who were born with crappy models so to speak.
3) It can not take into account people abusing their cars. 

At least I have not seen any policies which do that. 

A policy which would work would
1) Have a high deductible.
2) Take into account any and all genetically caused problems to the point where they are not made further problematic by lifestyle problems.]]></description>
