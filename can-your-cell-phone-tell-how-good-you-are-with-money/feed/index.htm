					<description><![CDATA[That is definitely interesting, and agree there is probably an inverse relationship with the amount of TV watched. Time of TV watching would be interesting as well, as a lot of informational historically came on in the late and very early hours of the night.

Financially wise that&#039;s probably accurate - they have a higher net worth than the average U.S. citizen who&#039;s riddled with debt - but not having access to credit in this specific case also means not having access to a host of OTHER - more important things - to live your life that we take for granted here too :( So def. a trade-off I&#039;m willing to bet people would swap for.]]></description>

HAH! I used to be infamous for flicking off the camera all the time... I don&#039;t know why we feel the need to do that, especially as a rather happy person, but I guess the alcohol does things to you :)

My beard waves hello.]]></description>

Hmmmm.....From what I understand J you choose to live life deliberately...to not &quot;go with the flow&quot;. History has shown me these folk tend to be my BEST tenants. They usually understand what is to be provided and what is expected. As for the &quot;hair-style&quot; ...  couldn&#039;t care less. My concerns would be your student loan debt and if you are current...Pulling up in the &quot;Franken-caddy&quot; would be viewed as a gift from the heavens....NO CAR PAYMENT. And if and when you pulled out your cell phone to take pics of the place and explained to me the &quot;stellar deal&quot; you have landed....I&#039;d know I had found my new tenant....Mohawk and all!]]></description>

What happens with cars I&#039;m told is that folks show up at the dealership ready to buy BUT their present car is worth less than what is owed against it...NO WORRIES....the dealer pays off the old car loan and then &quot;rolls the balance&quot; into the new car loan. After a couple of these you can see where it is headed....]]></description>

I hear you. Ms. Financial Slacker does work for a real estate guy who is worth $1 billion plus and drives a POS beaten-down old pick-up truck.

Be careful using outward appearance to judge financial worthiness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think, that not having access to debt by not having a credit score is actually a blessing in disguise. In most western countries, were we have access to more lending organisations that you can count, what do the majority of people do? Oh yes, hock themselves up to the eyeballs with debt from an early age, and then spend the rest of their lives paying it off. In fact, if you take a person living in a &#039;poor&#039; country with no debt, who works and lives within their means, however humble this may be, and compare that with Joe Average, living in a &#039;rich&#039; western country, who mounts up thousands of dollars worth of debt over his lifetime, who is better off? It&#039;s just a thought.]]></description>
