					<description><![CDATA[Ah, being sick and sappy. I&#039;ve been there. But what you say is absolutely true. You can certainly buy things to aide you in those categories-- herbs, medicines, education, and maybe a snazzy, tight pair of jeans or something; but when it comes down to it, money&#039;s just money. It&#039;s paper. Well, not even that so much these days. Like Adam said, it&#039;s numbers. Anyway, I hope you feel better soon! We just did a post at Mango Money on what to do when you&#039;re bored-- or sick in this case! Check it out, you&#039;ll have fun with some of these. And you don&#039;t even need to get out of bed for many of them! http://www.mangomoney.com/blog/cheap-fun/bored-bored-bored]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had a big health scare recently and I realised the very same thing. Money can buy me my health but fixing it up sure takes a lot out of my pocket!  Made me sit up and think about the things I take for granted... hope you are getting better by the day.. ;p]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Flax seeds?  Thanks? haha... and you&#039;re right - I&#039;m not that patient ;)  Though I am getting better as the years go by.
@&lt;b&gt;Cordelia&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s one of my faves!  Though I still don&#039;t know how to spell it properly :(  Google doesn&#039;t help much, either...
@&lt;b&gt;Christine Hansen&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  But I&#039;m too lazy to try that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;ShoeGal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... also, randomly enough, I&#039;d like to switch bodies w/ a woman for 24 hours too.  I think that would be fun :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mel @ Trailing After God&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Mel!  Sorry to hear about your condition, I can&#039;t even imagine :(
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch.  Yeah, kids always spread their little germs! haha... glad you guys are better now :)]]></description>
