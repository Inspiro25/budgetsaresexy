Correction: my fact checker (Richard Anthony) informs me that the 1960 U.S. population was closer to 180,000,000 (again, wikipedia), so apologies to Mr. McMichael for only being off by 20,000,000 . . .]]></description>

Funnee, Catina. Now you&#039;ve given me an earworm of the Hokey Pokey that&#039;ll probably nag me all day. But since it&#039;s pick on Mr. McMichael time, I&#039;ll jump in with a critique of his population prognostication on Page  33 of 160,000,000 by 1960 when it  actually zoomed to over 225,000,000 (so sez wikipedia). But wait, as J$ told us, he was just showing  the &quot;pretty pictures and graphs.&quot; No fair reading text;)]]></description>

Yeah! So fun! Even better is what you sometimes find INSIDE the book, like notes or old envelopes, etc :) In fact, I just picked up a few older books at yard sales this last weekend that had some notes in them. Perhaps I&#039;ll blog about them when I do my next &quot;yard sale tips&quot; post... Thx for the reminder!]]></description>

That IS interesting! You learn a lot when you&#039;re out there in &quot;the wild&quot; poking around, don&#039;t you? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yard sales are exciting -- but I do prefer to be the seller. It&#039;s fascinating in general how much of finance really just comes down to personal bias. What seems like a lot of money to me may not to another person or vice versa because of our specific upbringings. I appreciate that the value of a diamond is said to be expressed in desire. The general cost of diamonds seems so insanely inflated simply because of various monopolies in the industry, but I probably shouldn&#039;t get off on a tangent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As I learn more about real estate investing, I was struck by a strange phenomenon. Houses with up to 4 units in them are appraised at a value based on comparable houses in the area and what they have sold for recently. It is a bit of an estimate/guessing game, really.

However, if you have 5 or more units, the property is looked at as purely an investment and the value is based on how much income it generates.

I thought that was an interesting distinction (and potentially arbitrary)!]]></description>
