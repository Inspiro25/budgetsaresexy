I admire the hell out of you though for sticking to it! I&#039;ve tried here and there and always go back to nothing :( At least financially. I probably spend 5 hours every day helping people with their money in email or on this blog/etc, but have to constantly remind myself to look for people/orgs to help give actual money to too. I think I need to automate it and start small to get the habit down and then gradually move the needle upwards... I did have a good strand last year of doing back-to-back-to-back donations to small places I loved, so we&#039;re getting there! Felt super proud about that and felt like I magically grew my projects - and joy for that matter - a lot too in doing so. Maybe that&#039;s the power behind it all? Makes you feel better which in turns makes you more productive or just feeling like everything is better whether they are or not? Who knows... but in either case, you inspire me w/ the tithing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I still don&#039;t understand the whole generocity paradox but paying a full tithe all my life has consistantly been the best financial decision that I have ever made.

					<description><![CDATA[Great reminders!  I have actually been struggling the past week after coming back from vacation.  Instead of being well rested I kept focusing on what I didn&#039;t have (endless time and money to ski all the time) as I heading back to the real world and how much the rat race sucks.  I even had a conversation with my husband about how I really should be grateful for all that we do have because we are really fortunate to be where we are in our lives, including a great vacation we just had.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I liked the example you used with John D. Rockefeller, it really puts things into perspective, because it&#039;s strange to think about how he was one of the wealthiest people in the world, but all of us in modern society now live better lifestyles than he did.

This is a great post to remind all of us to be happy with what we have. Great article!]]></description>
