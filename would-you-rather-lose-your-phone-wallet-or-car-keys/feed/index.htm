Ah, sorry to hear that. I really hope future software security makes it hard for phone thieves to re-sell or reuse phones. If they were less valuable, there would be less theft.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I lost my phone this passed October.   Actually it was stolen out of my backpack while I was walking...  but anyway.   It actually took about 10 hours on the phone between the police and the service provider.    I did have a lease on mine, so that played in a bit to the longer time, but I would NEVER want to lose a phone EVER again.   It was a huge headache to deal with the repercussions and then having to change all the passwords that are stored on it as well was probably another couple hours of time.    I wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone!]]></description>
