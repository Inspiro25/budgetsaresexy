					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much Larry for sharing your life story! (and the update!). Decades of knowledge summarized for us &quot;younger&quot; folks in invaluable. 

And Thanks J$ for posting it. Hope you keep reposting it every few years so new generations can keep learning! I think this in itself is a great mini-legacy whether Larry wants to leave one behind or not!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing! YES, I would love to hear more personal money stories! 
I&#039;m going to hold on to this gem -&#062; WE ARE ALWAYS IN CHARGE!! It’s up to US to do the things we feel is best for us no matter what’s going on around us or what others are saying… It’s not always easy, but it’s incredibly important unless you like living with regrets.]]></description>

Yes, I liked the story from someone who is living in retirement and not a millionaire.  Would like to see more of these and how they are coping in retirement.  Maybe some with traditional retirements/SSA and living paycheck to paycheck. How they get from day to day.  Keep it up J$]]></description>

All good! And don&#039;t mind a lively debate anyways even if you were wanting to chat about anything :) Just wanted to make sure we were talking about *the same thing* as that makes it even more complicated conversing online! Haha...]]></description>

OK, I certainly don’t think I am qualified to give advice to the lovelorn but here are some comments.
The first marriage lasted 12 years.  It was to a high school sweetheart.  We shortly learned what you call a couple that uses rhythm for birth control = parents! And then again and then again.  She worked full time and came home to be a mother. There was no “wife” in sight.  And no female companionship to speak of. I should never have had children; parenting was not in my DNA.
The second was a lark and a “okay, why not?” in Mexico where I did not think it would be legal in the US.  Lasted less than a year.
And having revised my goals and values, I knew pretty much what I was looking for.  I had a “list” of required attributes in my next romantic quest.  And 45 years ago this week, she did NOT comply with anything on my list!!
I can only offer a suggestion somewhat analogous to my house hunting suggestions.  Know what is most important to you and conversely, those things that are not too important.  Keep in mind that people do change but NOT VERY MUCH.  Be sure that the “package” is what you want because core values do not change, IMO.]]></description>
