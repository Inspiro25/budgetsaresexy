You&#039;re a lot better at that stuff than I ;) I honestly don&#039;t touch the receipts unless something comes up - I only keep them on file in case I need them one day, not for recording purposes. Since I use my credit card for everything, I track it all online making it nice and easy for us (and I double check the receipts as I&#039;m in the store to make sure they&#039;re good right away).

Then again, we&#039;re also not tracking all the budget categories down to the penny either. We used to track it all pretty hardcore, but over the years we&#039;ve gotten good at hitting the numbers or coming in lower (for the most part), so we don&#039;t worry about it too much. We usually only get hit when bigger, more random, things occur over the every day stuff. But I don&#039;t recommend that for everyone :) If your system&#039;s working well, stick to it!]]></description>

Don&#039;t all the receipts go directly to wherever you record your spending?
If I need to keep a receipt for warranty purposes I scan it as a back up, then staple it to the manual/warranty info and toss it in a box we keep for all household manuals/warranty info. Otherwise, any purchase needs to be recorded on the spending plan - typically within 24hrs. If it was a planned expense I replace the estimated placeholder number in the spreadsheet with the actual number. If it was an unplanned expense I add a row and have that much less than expected on Friday when I&#039;ll transfer the weekly excess out of the account and either make an extra mortgage payment or contribute to our retirement accounts. Just can&#039;t imagine tossing receipts in a box to be dealt with some day. How would I know on Friday exactly how much has been spent and what is truly &quot;excess&quot;? A delay in getting that recorded means a delay in getting the excess out and workng for me somewhere else.  Our normal weekly spending is gas and groceries. So even if I only updated monthly rather than weekly, that would only be 8 receipts.  Last week there were also a couple of hair cuts and dog food from the pet store, but that happens only every few months.]]></description>

Nice. I tried a business card case for a few months myself (one of those old vintage-y ones) but it looked much cooler than it worked. And was also a lot more bulkier so I had to give it up... I&#039;d be down with trying another slimmer one though - I love the idea of it.]]></description>

Thanks J$ and Lynn! 
I should do the shoebox idea, and I&#039;ll be definitely looking into those options! Getting some good rewards for paying my mortgage sounds AMAZING!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t really call it a wallet - I use an old metal business card case with:

DC driver&#039;s license
USAA credit card (spreadin&#039; the love!)
USAA debit card (turned upside down because the thicker/numbers part of the two cards together wouldn&#039;t fit...)
A couple of business card.
If I have any cash (which is rare), it&#039;s folded together and loose next to the &quot;wallet&quot;.  Currently that&#039;s one whole Washington.]]></description>

LOL, nope.  It seems like it takes too much time and stress.  I&#039;m full on things to remember, hahaha.  I always have my trusty Discover and a Visa of some sort...I just left PenFed because they started a $25 annual fee (bye-bye to my gas 5% cash back).  Now it&#039;s a Chase Freedom (hello to all of the same benefits as Discover plus a 10% bonus at the end of the year for having a Chase checking account).  :-)]]></description>
