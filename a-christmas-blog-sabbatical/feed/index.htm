That would be AMAZING! It has been a whirlwind journey and we would be more than happy (and honored!) to share our story. 

We have been MIA the past two weeks because we were dealing with a crazy situation in Hanoi, Vietnam... where my husband ended up in the ER several times! We are currently recovering from our crazy Vietnam experience (safely in Chiang Mai, Thailand). Yowza. For someone who enjoys stability, this certainly is a life full of never-ending surprises! haha

Let me know when you&#039;re back and we&#039;d love to do a guest post - it is definitely an interesting take on how to achieve a different kind of FI. :) :)]]></description>

Yeah dude, it can def. be scary at first! 

I find doing it incrementally helps a lot with getting more comfortable with things though and realizing the world doesn&#039;t revolve around us :) I started cutting back weekend work over a year ago, and then moved to not opening up the laptop in the evenings either, and so far with each step it&#039;s helped put things in better perspective and ironically made me even more productive! So lots of things we can tweak in our daily routines to improve our lives/careers for sure if a sabbatical isn&#039;t in the cards.]]></description>
