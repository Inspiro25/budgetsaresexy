					<description><![CDATA[For anyone that is skeptical about this program, I would like to suggest that, with considerable effort, you can make it a huge success. I have been a member since February 2003 (that&#039;s 12 years) and have saved almost $8000. That money has compounded in the 529 savings account that it dumps into and now totals over $15,000. That&#039;s pretty good for just swiping your credit card. My keys to success are using the Upromise CC, registering all friends and family (and getting them to also use the Upromise CC), and frequenting restaurants that kickpack through the program.]]></description>

I think that&#039;s the key right there - using it for EVERYTHING. I get cash back on our credit cards we use for everything, but not $1300 worth! :) Maybe we don&#039;t spend enough - hah.]]></description>

Was just looking at my total Upromise earnings and thought of you. As of today&#039;s date: $3,322.22 with $52.51 pending. :) I used the Upromise CC for a LOT of work expenses this year so that made part of the difference. It will probably drop off some this year because we&#039;re now using the Citi 1%+1% card for a lot of our day to day but I&#039;ll still use the Upromise for anything I can buy online and get a higher percentage back. Also, I don&#039;t remember if it was mentioned earlier but your earnings do not necessarily have to go to education or student loans. We have another loan (I married into it!) at a higher interest rate than the student loans so I always withdraw credit card rewards to use for extra payments. Finally, while I&#039;m at it, I just wanted to say thanks. I&#039;ve learned a lot from you and it helps me stay engaged and keep my head in the game. Happy 2015!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had Upromise for years but didn&#039;t really focus on it until the last couple years. Since I started focusing on it and got the credit card, I&#039;m up to $1750 towards my loans. 

With the credit card, you get 1% on everything. So I paid for as much of our wedding expenses as possible with the credit card. I&#039;ve also used it quite a bit for work expenses that I&#039;ll be reimbursed for - plane tickets, hotels, etc. Between the 1% and whatever I get from the travel sites, it&#039;s totally free money. It also often gets you an additional 5% for Upromise online shopping. 

I don&#039;t use it much for restaurant rewards. There just aren&#039;t many places in my area that are in the program. The ones that are aren&#039;t places that I often go to. However, I have managed to use it twice for business dinners (20-30 people) that I was reimbursed for. The last one made me something like $60 in the end. 

As for people who say that they don&#039;t buy much that qualifies, I think they would be surprised check. Just search for whatever you&#039;re thinking about buying - cast iron pan for brother in law for Christmas? Found it at Chefs.com through Upromise, scored free shipping and got $6 back. Flea medication and glucosamine for the dog? PetFoodDirect.com often has free shipping offers and is at 5% + 5% (1-800-Pet-Meds is 7% + 5% but is often more expensive for what we buy). Look at stores that have an option to buy online and pick up in store. We just bought a new computer (mine was circa 2004 and had 45GB of memory - that&#039;s no typo) at Best Buy and picked up in store. 5% cash back plus 5% more for using the card. 

True, I get very little from groceries - I don&#039;t buy enough packaged food to benefit - and I think people have to be careful not to get into a mindset where getting money back for school gives them permission to buy things they shouldn&#039;t. I also still use other credit cards where I can save more through their benefits but I think Upromise is great once you get engaged with it.  

Bottom line: it&#039;s a little extra work for some solid free money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a Upromise credit card, and it has made a serious difference in my kids&#039; 529s. Over the past 9 years or so, I have made more than $2000 from them, between using my registered cards for grocery shopping and gas, and shopping online. This last quarter my kids each got $116.48 transferred into their accounts! That&#039;s an additional 13% of what we were able to contribute out of our pockets. So, go for it!]]></description>
