I do similar with coffee -- &quot;You can have it, but first you must down a glass of water!!&quot;

Helps lessen the caffeine hangover later :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also stole this idea from Atomic Habits and mostly use it as a form of healthy self-punishment. Want another beer? Gotta pay the beer tax of 20 push ups!]]></description>

Rock on! I think *cutting out* one or two of the less valuable things you&#039;ve said &quot;yes&quot; to in life will help slow things down and better stack more naturally too :) Gotta remain sane and healthy so the rest of the clan/projects remain so too!  Only one Ashley in this world - you got this!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is a very simple way to remember to attend to the litter box: Scoop it on days with a &quot;T&quot; in them, i.e., Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. 

Unless of course you decide to do it daily.

We definitely don&#039;t want our kittehs thinking outside the box, if you know what I mean...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As soon as I started reading this today, my mind went straight to Atomic Habits.  I highly recommend this book to literally everyone I speak to.  I&#039;m on my third read-through (although I&#039;m listening while I drive.)  Thanks for posting this, because I hadn&#039;t realized all the ways that I&#039;m already implementing habit stacking, without much thinking.  That gives me a little boost!  Have a great day; so glad you&#039;re back!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey!
So, this article SPOKE directly to me. I’ve been feeling loads of guilt for not getting to the cat’s litter as much as I should. I also have a shit ton that I’ve signed up for in my life - new mom, full time job, side business, volunteering - it’s to the point now where my bodily functions get in my way  (I don’t have time to sneeze!!) I’ve even read Atomic Habits and must’ve missed the part from where the picture was painted of a step-by-step process. Alas, kitty litter caught my attention in your post  -and I thank you for painting the picture - step-by-step process that you do. My husband is genius at habit stacking, too. He does dishes, cleans, prepares for the mornings by getting the coffee (&#038;more!) ALL while cooking dinner for everyone. 
GOALS!
Thanks for reminding me to slow down and think strategically with these tiny, but huge time saving, steps!
