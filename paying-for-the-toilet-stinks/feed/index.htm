					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Yeah it would... but I&#039;m starting to get that way too actually.  Having traveled at LEAST twice every single month this year so far, and staying everywhere from couches to fancy hotel rooms, I&#039;m starting to really appreciate the nicer ones more and more ;)  On our trip out to LA two weeks ago, Nate made us stay at a place where the reviews had said there were scabies!! ewwww!!!  Even though our room seemed fine, i could def. see where that&#039;s possible... I&#039;m sure all hotels deal with their own problems here and there, but at least the nicer ones FEEL better sleeping in, haha... worth the money to more more now than back in the poorer days ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Marcus&lt;/b&gt; - What?? Ketchup??? no way!!!!  haha... *that* is crazy!
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, no - I have not seen or heard of Urinetown ;)  Seems like something I&#039;d watch though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money nice post you&#039;re right.  Every now again you have to splurge for the simple pleasures.  When I had to pay to use a bathroom the first time in Europe I was mad!  And then don&#039;t get me started on paying for each ketchup packet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;m gonna have to add that into our budget for our trip to Italy next year, I totally forgot about it.

I&#039;m a chick who like nice hotel rooms, I can&#039;t help it. The suites w/ jacuzzi tubs are my weakness and big comfy beds. ;-) Hopefully I can find something nice but not too expensive next year---we&#039;re hoping to spend 2 weeks in Europe. That would be super-expensive if we stayed in posh suites every night.]]></description>

@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - AGREED!  I mean, I make coffee when I&#039;m at home and all that, but if I&#039;m out and about - or ESP going to a meeting/event - I&#039;m allllll about that Starbucks coffee.  Or any place, really, that can whip it up for me good and has a nice atmosphere.
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I hear that. I was just out in your Texas (San Antonio) and everyone said we were lucky that the heat wave subsided a bit.  It was &quot;only&quot; 90 out, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Stephen&lt;/b&gt; - Good point ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - I want to go to Oktoberfest sooooo bad!  That&#039;s awesome you got to go there man, good for you.
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo!  I get the &quot;funniest post&quot; award! :)  Totally get the coffee addiction, you&#039;re not alone my friend!
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Now THAT may be the smartest thing you&#039;ve ever said, good sir.  I always feel bad too!!  And then end up buying something like a chocolate bar or something... haha, actually, more like a lottery ticket ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - I can see that.  Esp when it&#039;s hot and sticky out, bleh.  And most DEF at 2 am!!  Even me, a guy - people are nutso out there.
@&lt;b&gt;Kymm Richmond&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed 100% - ya gotta feel safe! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kimberly&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Your son probably appreciated it too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;kody @ financial money tips&lt;/b&gt; - cuz it tastes wayyyy better! and you can throw them away (recycle, actually) super easily. believe me, I&#039;m the same way.  not sure if you saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/im-a-bottled-water-drinker-im-not-afraid-to-admit-it/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; or not of mine, but just be careful of the haters! :)  
@&lt;b&gt;Angie&lt;/b&gt; - Sometimes it most definitely is ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Bryan at Pinch that Penny!&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, that sounds hilarious!  Privilege to Pee? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Always!  Big fan of nice (and clean) underwear just in case... never know what the day could bring ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Azra Panjwani&lt;/b&gt; - So glad you liked it!  I found the pic on Flickr (Creative Commons 2.0 where you can use them as long as you attribute them properly :))
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager/b&gt; - No doubt.
@&lt;b&gt;Debra F&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re in Australia?? Awesome!  One of the top 3 places in the world I really want to see :)  I wonder if your bananas taste different than our bananas?
@&lt;b&gt;K&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, really?  KMart??  Oh man - haven&#039;t been in one of those in yearssssss.  Used to be the hottest place though for sure.  Bathrooms, aside ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ralph&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  Or at least have a pocket full of change just in case ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Paul&lt;/b&gt; - AGREED!!!  It&#039;s all about the atmosphere, my man.  No doubt about it - good one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember as a kid they used to charge a dime to use the restroom  at K-Mart and my mom having me crawl under the door...GROSS!  To me it would have been worth the dime and I was thankful when they finally stopped charging.   I think stores and places of business shouldn&#039;t ever charge as it should be provided as a courtesy to their patrons, but I wouldn&#039;t have a problem having to pay a 25-50 cents to use a restroom at a rest stop on the highway to pay to have someone keep it clean, stocked with toilet paper and everything in good working order.

I have to admit I am guilty of choosing convenience and being willing to pay a little more for it, especially if it saves time in the long run.  The gas station closes to where I live run about 5 cents more a gallon, but it was more convenient as it used to be on the way home from work.]]></description>
