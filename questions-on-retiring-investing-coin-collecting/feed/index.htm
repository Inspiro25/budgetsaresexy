					<description><![CDATA[Serious coin collectors don&#039;t plug coins into boards, though it&#039;s a good way for a kid to start.  You shouldn&#039;t touch the coins at all they should be in holders so your body oils won&#039;t degrade the coin.  Also one should read about how coins are graded to understand what makes coins more or less valuable and also just hang out with a serious collector for a few hours.  That&#039;s also more fun, they can actually show you what&#039;s in their collection and why they like it.  I intellectually understand why people collect coins, but personally it bores me to tears, but someone I was in a relationship with was very into it and some of it rubbed off.  Don&#039;t think you will make money from it.  You WILL spend more money to reach your particular holy grail and then the market could tank and you are sitting on devalued old pieces of metal.]]></description>
