Haha, yeah - we used to have that but it kept breaking the site so we took it off and then like a lame blogger I never found a replacement ;)

Now that I have a team working on the site though let me pass it over to them and see if we can get something up! And congrats on being able to max out your 401k - one of the best things you can do for your money!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I know I&#039;m like super late to this post (doing my once or twice a month catch-up), but just had to throw it out there that I actually DID listen to my dad&#039;s advice he gave me throughout college - &#039;once you get your first real job, sign up for 15% towards 401k from day one. if you never see the money, you&#039;ll never miss it&#039; That was 6 years ago. Last year i maxed out my 401k for the first time (contributing more than 15%..). Thanks Dad!

p.s. can we get an email notification for replies to our comments by any chance? :p I&#039;ll unfortunately probably never see a reply if you happen to leave one here]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First off, J. Money - congrats on selling the website!!! So happy for you, and I only hope you keep posting at least a few time s a week :-)

Second, my Dad has given me a lot of advice that he learned from making mistakes:

1.) Don&#039;t buy a new car every year. I know this sounds funny, but we have a paid off minivan that is 7 years old and I drive a 15.5 year old Honda Accord. My Dad used to buy a new car every year.

2.)  When I was 14 and had my first job Dad told me to put my savings into an IRA, which I did. I think that $ 4,000 has grown to about $ 18,000 over the past 24 years as I had it invested in Vanguard&#039;s Total Stock Market INdex Fund

3.) Dad told me to buy some gold (American Eagle) to diversify in the 90s. That gold has gone from $ 320/ounce to $ 1,550 an ounce.

4.) Dad told me to not invest in individual stocks as you never know what will happen to an individual company. Boy was he right as we have seen so many companies collapse over the past 25 years.

5.) Dad (and Mom) gave me one of the best books EVER. It is called Debt Free Living by Larry Burkett. It was an eye opener to 18 year old me..... it showed me how Debt in most cases is very dangerous, taught me to be frugal and live within my means. Now 20 years later we have a net worth of $ 700,000.

Above all I would say Dad told me to live humbly and righteously. Do unto others. Live at peace with neighbors and Tithe (Donate 10 %) of earnings to Church and Charity. I do sometimes struggle to give away 10 %, but I can with confidence say God has abundantly blessed us. So, I am very grateful to Dad.]]></description>

He did *create* you, though.

That&#039;s gotta be at least worth, 1 million baht, yeah? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He told me to invest in my 401k and I did! 
Should have listened to dad? I don&#039;t know? Too numerous to count and I forgot all of them. hahaha! 
Oh here, the most recent one. He wants 2 million baht to buy a property in the countryside close to Chiang Mai. That&#039;s about $70,000. Are you kidding? I&#039;m not going to sell stocks to help him buy that. Forget it. He always has some kind of scheme up his sleeve.]]></description>

No advice ever! I just made it up as I went along. When I bought my first apartment I called the local government ON A LANDLINE and they sent me, IN THE MAIL, a little booklet called &quot;how to buy your first property&quot;. The early Noughties were a different time!]]></description>

YES!! Very smart of your father, and now you! When people really want something they figure out a way to make it happen within their means. And if they don&#039;t figure it out it&#039;s usually because they didn&#039;t want it enough ;) (Or are lazy - and an even better reason not to co-sign! Haha...)]]></description>
