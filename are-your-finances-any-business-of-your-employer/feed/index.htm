					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m amazed how many commenters are okay with employer credit checks.  I can understand it being needed for certain jobs; but not in general. 

I read somewhere a few months ago that long-term unemployment had left some people with bad credit reports and it impacted their ability to find new jobs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had my credit checked for two jobs: one is my &quot;career,&quot; where I work in a county government position. The other is for a side teaching job. I understand the credit check for the county job was part of my background investigation, and I was prepared for that. I don&#039;t think the credit check for my teaching position was any of their business, whatsoever. Criminal background, yes, but credit, no.

And when THEY are the ones paying ME, really does it matter what kind of credit I have? If I&#039;M the one paying THEM, yes, I think it&#039;s important for them to establish my credit history. But otherwise, no.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interestingly enough, you can&#039;t get federal grant funding for research if you&#039;ve defaulted on a federal student loan.  I see the rationale behind this.  Federal student loans are funded by taxes, as are federal grants, so if you&#039;re not putting back, you shouldn&#039;t be able to take out.

That being said, I don&#039;t see the rationale of companies running credit checks on potential employees.  I think someone&#039;s personal life can look much different from someone&#039;s professional life.  There are people who might be quite good at creating and keeping corporate budgets, but can&#039;t manage their own money.  The difference between the two is that *it&#039;s your job* to create and stick to corporate budgets, but no one pays you to keep track of your own finances.

I think it&#039;s a form of discrimination, especially during these difficult times.  I&#039;m sure there are people who had great credit at one time, but all it takes is a cancer diagnosis, a pink slip, and/or suddenly becoming sole caregiver to an aging parent to tank your credit.  Even the best budget keepers can&#039;t pay $1500 in medical bills per month if they&#039;re only pulling in $30,000 per year.  And considering that I think it&#039;s illegal for employers to ask someone their age, health status, or anything else about their personal life, the employers have no way of knowing that tanked credit has to do with the fact that the potential employee&#039;s child needed radiation therapy for a full year.  And I don&#039;t think potential employees should be forced to disclose that information, either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It definitely depends on the type of company that you work for, but I don&#039;t see a huge issue if  company is doing credit checks on potential employees.  Knowing something like that can give an insight into the person no differently than checking the potential employees facebook page (that they probably dont have privatized).

If I&#039;m running a small company, I want to know how a potential coworker handles their cash.  Are they casual with it or a frugal mofo?  It all plays in evaluating how a person fits into a specific company.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To me, it&#039;s one of those &quot;nothing to hide&quot; arguments. &quot;If you haven&#039;t committed a crime, you shouldn&#039;t worry about police scrutiny&quot; &quot;If you&#039;re not a terrorist, you shouldn&#039;t be worried about TSA screenings.&quot;  Just because I don&#039;t have a bomb doesn&#039;t mean that I want somebody copping a feel.

And personally, I don&#039;t see the connection between your personal financial health and your professional performance.  I made a LOT of financial mistakes in college and graduated with over $15k in credit card debt and a credit score of 500.  But that doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;ve ever stolen from an employer, not even paper clips. I&#039;ve paid off 2/3 of that debt and brought my credit score up by 100 points.

I have three acquaintances who have worked in the financial sector.  #1 is a CFO, makes $125k/year and deals with multi-million dollar budgets.  He is a recovering gambling addict and used to take between $1000-$5000 to Atlantic City EVERY week. He never touched company money for his gambling but when he sought help, he had $100,000 in credit card debt. (yikes!)
#2 sold pot in college and was arrested in college for possession. He went through pre-trial intervention and got the charges dropped. Now he&#039;s a manager dealing with annuities for one of the big banks and is working on his MBA.
#3 was an accountant with a perfect credit score and a volunteer with her local PTA until she embezzled $17,000 to take her kids to Disney World.

Who do you think would have gotten weeded out of their job by checking background and finances?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I work in a situation where I get to - have to, actually, look at the tax returns of some extremely high profile people.  The company I work for does NOT want someone who isn&#039;t stable in EVERY way doing this job.  If I were in trouble and thought for half a second that I could find a way to convince some of these people to &quot;assist&quot; me in getting out of debt (if I had any debt, for example), that would be extremely embarrassing for the company, and, while I wouldn&#039;t last long on the job, I could do a lot of damage in that short time.

I also know that at any time, my phone calls can be recorded and I always just assume that my email is monitored while I am at work, whether it is personal or company-related.  That&#039;s the price for having a well-paid, stable job that I worked hard to get.  No hard feelings - it&#039;s what I expected would be required of me, and if I were the client, I would also expect no less of the company I hired to work with my taxes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an issue I truly see both sides of. I think that on the one hand it is an invasion of privacy to pull someone&#039;s financials when considering him or her for a non-financial job, but on the other hand it&#039;s unrealistic that a company wouldn&#039;t use that information as part of the hiring process if they have access to it. Maybe it should be the kind of thing where the company can look at your finances, but cannot discriminate against hiring based on them. Like, if someone was going to hire me, they can plainly see I&#039;m a woman (thus, the information is available) but it&#039;s illegal to discriminate against me in the hiring process because of my gender.

But on the other hand, we all have a much larger degree over our finances than we do over our gender, ethnicity, etc....ahh! Such a tricky issue!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely not.  I believe in financial privacy, and privacy in general for that matter.  I&#039;ll disclose what I want to and to whom I want to disclose it; otherwise, it&#039;s none of your business.  As far as an employer for whom one already works, it should be apparent whether the employee is irresponsible - financially and otherwise, at least to the extent necessary to determine relevance or suitability for the job.  I don&#039;t think there should be any such thing as credit reporting agencies, unless those agencies are required by law to perform a job - not just collect information without verifying it.  And people should be able to opt out of being part of those agencies records.  Obviously those who want debt would want to opt in, but there are people who don&#039;t play that game.  Personally, the only way I can access our household credit information is through Credit Karma, because the agencies will not give us our reports without us giving &quot;proof&quot; of address - even though they sent reports years ago to the same address, and even though they send the denial of our credit reports to our address.  I refuse to give them the proof they want, because it violates my financial privacy and could give them information they don&#039;t already have - and don&#039;t need to have.

Another thing is IRS records and tax returns.  One thing I highly disapprove of is the aspect of health care reform related to IRS records and tax returns.  I don&#039;t want a health care provider to have any connection to those private records of ours.  The health care system is the biggest scam in America already, and inviting them to access our tax returns is a horrible invasion.]]></description>
