I like the creativity there, but if cash loses value I&#039;m pretty sure most businesses and their gift cards will also be in trouble as well :) They still make for great gift ideas though! (I LOVE getting gift cards, no matter how faux pas it may be, haha...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Canadian government tracks all cash deposits and bill payments at banks, so it is extremly difficult to live on the proceeds of illegal business and avoid paying taxes.  We are very close to living cashless like Sweden does.  However, this results in higher bank fees for people. Japanese on the other hand rarely use plastic despite being a technology superpower, maybe for a few that exactly reason?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also, it is important to have small denominations in case of emergencies. If that $500 bill is all you have and you need a tank of gas to get your family to safety, well... If power is out for a few days, there won&#039;t be ATMs. Enough around to cover anything that absolutely must be purchased in that time will give you peace of mind. Or just always have enough food in your house to be able to shelter in place for awhile. A pantry is a good investment. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Years ago we had a deadly F4 tornado go through our area. In many spots power was out for over a week. What we learned from that is how important it is to also keep small denominations and change on hand. You need dollar bills to purchase some small items because change for larger bills quickly ran out at the stores and they couldn&#039;t take credit cards. I try to keep at least $500 in singles stocked away and at least $100 in change. They take up more space but they can come in handy during natural disasters.]]></description>
