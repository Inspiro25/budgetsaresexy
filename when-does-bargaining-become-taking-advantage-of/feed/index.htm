					<description><![CDATA[I personally believe that transparency is best.  To make a nice amount of money off of something, such a drastic amount, I would give some back to the other party if I felt I made far more than I earned.

					<description><![CDATA[I just realized that this lady was trying to sell me a $1.00 coin for 25 cents!!! hahaha... why am I just thinking about this now? Been so caught up in the $15-$20 pricepoint that I missed the funniness about it all :)  Not that I knew it was a silver dollar in the beginning anyways... but still - $1.00 coin for 25 cents! hahahahaa...

@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, she didn&#039;t seem to really care all that much, but then again I didn&#039;t really go out of my way to excite her ;)
@&lt;b&gt;sarah oneill&lt;/b&gt; - haha, thanks. all good points!
@&lt;b&gt;Niki&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s right next to me as I type! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Well, after I wrote all this I started feeling MUCH much better about it, haha... like I &quot;got it all out there&quot; or something, not that I have been dwelling over it or anything.  Oh, and I just told her I thought it was worth more than 25 cents but wasn&#039;t sure how much.  Which I honestly didn&#039;t, even though I was secretly hoping for a million dollars ;) Imagine how bad I&#039;d have felt THEN?!
@&lt;b&gt;Steph&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahhahahahaa... I&#039;m not that nice ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah that&#039;s true.  I do the same thing with some things like old records and other antique-like things that I genuinely don&#039;t care about.  It&#039;s very possible she just thought it was ugly and wanted it out!
@&lt;b&gt;Tea&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! I totally agree.  And I def. don&#039;t think this lady was hard up for cash, although looks can certainly be deceiving (aka people who &quot;look&quot; like millionaires but are actually the opposite).
@&lt;b&gt;kh&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, looking back I should have made more of an effort. We grow every week!
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like your analysis ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Robert Muir	&lt;/b&gt; - Well, I def. speak up in terms of getting more money by accident in stores (which happens all the time to me for some reason), but I guess it&#039;s harder for me to categorize this same situation in there.  Good things to think about though.
@&lt;b&gt;slug&lt;/b&gt; - I wonder what I would have done if I found a gold bar? haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - haha, yeah - and actually 99.9% of the times it really ISN&#039;T worth anything.  which could have been the case for me here too, but luckily it wasn&#039;t ;) and also I would have only lost a dollar. meh.
@&lt;b&gt;Emily D.&lt;/b&gt; - Either that or she didn&#039;t care as others mentioned :)
@&lt;b&gt;Leslie&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!!!  Well, he could have been making fake OLD coins, right? and then who&#039;d be the chump! (me)
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - Well, not sure I agree with that 100% of the way, but I do see what you&#039;re saying :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - done and done!
@&lt;b&gt;BoomChakaLaka&lt;/b&gt; - haahahaa... man, you all are funny today!
@&lt;b&gt;Jon &#124; Free Money Wisdom&lt;/b&gt; - Still not sure it&#039;s the &quot;nice&quot; thing to do though :)  I feel like people always have to come first over business, which is why I was upset with myself for a bit.
@&lt;b&gt;Beth&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, if she was a little girl?  I think I&#039;d be going to hell, haha... she was an older lady though.
@&lt;b&gt;Sassy&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, me too!  But this was a case where it was lower because she didn&#039;t realize (i don&#039;t think anyways) what she was selling.  I didn&#039;t get her down from $10 to $1 ;)
@&lt;b&gt;wldflr&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting!   Man, what a bargain too - good for you.  And yet I don&#039;t think you did anything wrong at all here.  How weird is that?  Maybe cuz it was books and not actual MONEY you were buying? haha... i mean think about it, she tried to sell me a $1.00 coin for 25 cents! hahahaahaha.... why I&#039;m just now thinking this I don&#039;t know.
@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - True dat.  Although I didn&#039;t pay $1.00 cuz it was face value, I paid it cuz I felt bad :)
@&lt;b&gt;Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m slowly feeling less guilty - woo!
@&lt;b&gt;L.G.&lt;/b&gt; - hahahhahaha... I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re being funny or serious, but that cracked me up like crazy.  haha..
@&lt;b&gt;Rafiki&lt;/b&gt; - awwwwww, I don&#039;t remember Toy Story II all that well but I&#039;m envisioning it :)
@&lt;b&gt;becky&lt;/b&gt; - Man! What a find!!  Wow. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d have the balls to do that one actually... although I could see me offering like $20 for it to ease my guilt ;)  but that&#039;s the old me now... haha...
@&lt;b&gt;mike&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, that is a most wonderful woman indeed.  And I agree - I&#039;d pick &quot;good&quot; too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bryan&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, in theory at least.	
@&lt;b&gt;Amy Saves&lt;/b&gt; - I did get a nice post out of it, huh? :)  thanks!
@&lt;b&gt;Dr Dean&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;m already better!  posting about this cured me up just fine :) and beer always helps too.
@&lt;b&gt;Andrea @ NickelByNickel.com&lt;/b&gt; - oooh la la!  that would be nice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It really doesn&#039;t matter what any of us think, although you did ask.  It matters what your complex tangled web of neurons chemically come up with in the middle of the night...

What will you do to calm them down-make restitution, give a little extra this week, or have a beer???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I honor your questioning what happened.

What is most important in a person--being smart, hard-working or good? I want to be a good person.

On the other side of the coin, years ago I went to a garage sale to get clothes for my baby. I (being extremely poor at the time) asked the lady how much for the socks--&quot;Oh, they&#039;re free&quot;. How much for the pants-&quot;Oh, they&#039;re free too&quot;. Of course she was a special woman, and dumb me, it took me awhile to realize the kindness this lady showed me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My tag is a master of yard sales and has his own philosophy on your situation. He figures if they don&#039;t know what they are selling, then it is their own stupid fault!

A few years ago he went to a yard sale held by a man who was moving into a retirement home because he could no longer take care of himself (his kid&#039;s were running the yard sale). My dad was flipping through a basically worthless book of stamps and came across an autographed picture of babe ruth. 

My dad flipped shut the book, paid the 2-3 bucks they were asking for, and that was that. He then went home, sent the picture off for authentication (it was legit) and sold it on ebay for a couple hundred dollars. 

So I think my dad woke up 8 months later quite smug in how observant he was. But I also know he wakes up in fear because he knows that someday his kids (that would be me!) will just sell all his &#039;junk&#039; for a couple of bucks at a yard sale and someone ELSE will be getting the good deal. 

I consider it the vicious circle of life in the yard sale world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is a tough one. On one hand, I to would feel like I kind of ripped her off but on the other hand it is a yard sale. Maybe you should have informed her, maybe you could just consider it a deal, maybe someday you may see her again and if it makes you feel better you can offer her some more cash. I wouldn&#039;t like if that had happen to me..... This story reminds me of toy story 2 when that chicken guy found woody in the yard sale lol]]></description>
