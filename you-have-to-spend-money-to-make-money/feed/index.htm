Oh wow, your husband&#039;s a pimp! And even more so for not keeping it for himself - that can be hard to do :)  Happy Easter my friend!]]></description>

I soooooo want one of those zombie apocalypse survival shelves! You guys are definitely way ahead of us in that department. We usually only have 1 week&#039;s worth of food in the house, if that. Though now we&#039;re pretty good on diapers :) (not that that&#039;s food, but you get the point)]]></description>

Love hearing that! Well, the 401k part - not the tax man ;) Although that usually means you&#039;re doing pretty damn well in the income department Mr! So I tip my hat to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your wife did well at Target! that was an awesome deal to take advantage of. It&#039;s always good to be on the lookout for ways to save money in bulk and to make money off things that are on sale!

This isn&#039;t to my credit...technically my husband&#039;s...but he wouldn&#039;t have been able to score this if I hadn&#039;t dragged him there. Thrift store where he spied an Oakley watch originally retailed for $1300...selling for $70! Snatched it up, put it on Ebay, and made $200 after taxes and fees. Potentially could&#039;ve gotten more but for something unexpected pretty darn good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So first off, your wife sounds like my wife.

We actually have, what I call, our &quot;zombie apocalypse survival shelf&quot;.  Basically a stockpile of stuff that she paid little or nothing for...have you seen Extreme Couponers?  Yeah, that&#039;s her...and I&#039;m thankful for that!

As far as spending money to make money, like you mentioned, that applies heavily to my blog.  I wouldn&#039;t buy things for a few bucks, because I didn&#039;t want to spend the money.  Now, after I research something for my blog, I am always glad I bought the things that I have bought.  Sometimes it&#039;s worth it to pay for premium versions and spend a few bucks on tools!]]></description>
