Cheers Steve. Yeah I think many homeowners have emergency funds for their mortgage payments, but don&#039;t set aside much more than that. It&#039;s smart to have a maintenance fund that is automated and continues to grow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great concept. It helps you to think as a landlord and live as a renter. I know my wife and I call on our landlord for a couple of things every now and then, and that extra money put aside for maintence is something everyone should do. Thank you Jessi for making things easier and a better way to look at the numbers when buying a house. Great article and great advice. Thanks to Jessi.]]></description>

I&#039;m very interested in the comments on HCOL places, because having grown up in a very (as per most people&#039;s criteria) LCOL, moved to a medium COL, and now live in Chicago, I&#039;ve experienced them all.

I feel like people still don&#039;t REALLY look at cost.  And I say this because affordability of a house is not as simple as percentage of income.  For example, my LCOL rent was only 180 for a house (rents for 400 now).  Sounds great.  But my utilities were more than 200 percent higher than I pay here in Chicago, my internet was stupid expensive, and thanks to lack of competition, I was facing expensive groceries with a complete lack of variety.  I drove my car over 25,000 miles year just to work, groceries and regular driving because I had to drive EVERYWHERE.  I had to buy a different car much much sooner.

If I add those REAL costs up, I live on less here in the city.  I still have a car- but I drive it 7000 miles a year, and if my goal to get a walkable job pans out, I won&#039;t have one at all.  My utilities are included in rent and we have low-cost internet options.  My grocery store is 100 feet from my door and the prices are much lower and variety enticing.  I walk everywhere and don&#039;t even pay a gym membership, now that I don&#039;t have to dodge country people thinking I&#039;m a target on the side of the road when I try to get exercise.  How can we not count the car costs in to the affordability equation??  It&#039;s a huge huge difference!  I figured out once I had to budget 300-400 a month to take care of my aging car.  I know that seems high, but when single and absolutely dependent on it to get to work,  an unreliable beater just is not an option.

And quality of life?  VERY different.  Much better.   Real estate is expensive, but once I hunkered down and got one property paid for, the costs of real estate is relative because it&#039;s an asset.  The rent on my one paid off unit pays my rent, phone, cable, and small gas bill every month.  So... it doesn&#039;t really matter anymore how much that place cost, because it will always have the power to pay my rent.  I just don&#039;t like living in the area of my condo, so I rent a smaller place in a better hood.

I get the school situation; however there are good schools hidden in neighborhoods here that are reasonable.  You just have to do a LOT of research.  I say that as a teacher:-)  Some move to the burbs for]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And one of the neatest things about being your own landlord/renter??? .....The rent won&#039;t be surprisingly jacked up on you when your lease is up!!  Yeah, taxes &#038; other home costs are constantly creeping up, but you&#039;ll *probably* have a fixed mortgage (that you&#039;ll pay down early, of course!). Imagine that.......&quot;rent&quot; at a fixed rate for 15/30 years.........and then FREE rent!  Ahhhhh......living the dream.......!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The house is 120 years old, and we plan to do a lot of work (like the addition - $80k, landscaping - $10k, fancy woodwork -???) so I&#039;m DEFINITELY saving more than someone would have to for a newer, updated home that might only worry about a new furnace or something in the next few years. I&#039;m also way more into a &quot;project house&quot; than someone with little kids might be. ;) Everyone&#039;s number will be different.

Dayyyyyyum!!! All of this sounds amazing! Especially that rent your son pays, haha... I&#039;d love to live back w/ my parents for a year or two and bank mad $$$$ but so far haven&#039;t been able to convince the wife ;) (the kids are on board though - it would be a paradise to live with Grandma!). Congrats on paying off that mortgage - that right there is the game changer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure the cost of repairs correlate a lot to how old the house is.  Our house is approximately 20 years old.  We bought it at about 1-2 years old.  The heating pump was a dud and we had to repair it a lot and finally replaced it.  We replaced our roof once.  But we really haven&#039;t had too much to do, just little odds and ends.  It has been paid off now for nearly 12 years.  Our taxes and insurance are around $250 a month and our adult son (20&#039;s) still lives at home and pays rent $200, which goes up $50 a month per year).  (He works, invests in 401K, buys stock, and pays all his own bills - we don&#039;t support him).  Sometimes I have thought that maybe renting would be cheaper but we can do whatever we want with our house, we own several acres in the country at the end of a dead-end road, so we absolutely love it!  Plus, we live in a low cost area of the country - our first home was less than $30,000 and we paid it off in 3-1/2 years.]]></description>
