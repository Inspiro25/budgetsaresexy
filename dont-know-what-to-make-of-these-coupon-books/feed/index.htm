That&#039;s good to know! We don&#039;t eat out as much as we used to (we can thank our kids for that ;)) but seems like a deal so long as you actually take advantage of them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every year I say that I am not going to buy a book.
Then I end up buying one.

For $30  if you use just the Subway Coupons - you just about got your money&#039;s worth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Entertainment sent an email out Aug 4, 2015 stating they started a new program Annual Renewal Membership. I skipped over the email thinking more junk mail, bad idea.  Now I am getting books costing $30 every year, and I only stay in that region for 2 months of the year.  Be careful they don&#039;t enroll you automatically.  I see no way to cancel account or change information (like credit card), on the new webpage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are planning on staying in a hotel anytime soon they are definitely worth. My girlfriend and I got a hotel in Pittsburgh that was normally $299/night for $170/night. we would normally never stay at such a nice place, but with that price it was worth it to splurge a little bit :) Also, if you are thinking well they must have &quot;jacked up the price&quot;, you are wrong. I called the hotel and asked what their nightly rate was first and then after she told me $299 I asked her what the entertainment discount was and that is when I was blown away. We are also staying at the Quality Suites this December in Pittsburgh and for 4 nights it is only $390. Without the entertainment book it was $598!!! And this specific Quality Suites has a full kitchen with dishwasher and a steam shower. VERY NICE place which we have stayed before and I would recommend to anyone staying in Pittsburgh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Someone gave us one when we lived in a large metropolitan area.  We didn&#039;t use it much.  There were SO many coupons in there and it wasn&#039;t organized by suburbs well - it mostly split the areas into the major cities/suburbs, so finding things close to us was a real pain.

We now live in a much, much, much smaller town.  Someone gave us a coupon book as a housewarming gift and we use it quite often.  There are a number of free offers in there - for things like pizzas, coffee, desserts at assorted restaurants, etc.  We&#039;ve had a number of free dinners with those coupons.  There are also &quot;free X when you buy Y&quot; and buy-one-get-one coupons.  I keep the book in my car so we always have it.]]></description>
