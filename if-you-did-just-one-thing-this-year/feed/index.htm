					<description><![CDATA[Ahhhh, I gotcha.  Man, 6 months doesn&#039;t seem like a lot of grace period, but I guess it gets you to hurry up and start paying it off!  Probably good motivation to go out and get a job fast too ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I could only make one big financial move this year, it would be to pay off 15% of my mortgage.  That&#039;s $60k!  I&#039;m halfway there so far, just have to stay the course.  It will be a little bit difficult considering I&#039;m due to give birth any day now, but I think I can do it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The one thing I want to do is find the right balance month to month between spending vs saving/paying down student loans.  The last few months have been a struggle trying to get a grip on things.  But when I take a look from 40,000 feet in the air I see the issue is in my hands.  Gotta get a grip, and a consistent one!  

P.S.  I was so much better with money when I blogged about it daily and was constantly mindful of every aspect.  Just goes to show you pf bloggers know what they are talking about, when they are doing it!

P.S.S  - J$ , I&#039;ve been M.I.A. figuring life out but I got back on my reading game. Glad to see you flourishing more and more everyday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My one major goal this year was to pay off my credit cards before my Birthday in August.  And thanks to the IRS finally giving me my first time homebuyer credit I am going to be able to pay them off this month!  (Now I just need to get the check into my bank account!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just paid off one of our cars, and for the rest of the year we plan on continuing our IRA contributions (not maxing for 2011) and paying off one student loan in full, as well as half of the last student loan on the list. Then we will start saving like crazy, hopefully by April 2012.]]></description>
