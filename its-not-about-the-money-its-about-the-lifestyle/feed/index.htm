					<description><![CDATA[Yesss!! We cannot put off living today for a tomorrow that may never come. I mean don&#039;t go out and start making poor financial choices just to live it up today. Do start taking time each day to enjoy the beautiful world around us. Nature is basically free. 

Great stuff here, J $.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just the tonic I needed at the start of another workaday week. Thank you! (and thanks, Cait!) Love the premise of Adventure Tuesdays. And you&#039;re right J., the million bucks of net worth is a worthy goal, but so much of how your life is fashioned today has little to do with your bank roll.]]></description>

I&#039;ll agree with that! Super easy to say vs DO too - so good for you for actually pulling the trigger on it!]]></description>

Yayyy!!! Excellent way to spend time with the kids! We used to go to Costco all the time too, mainly for the free samples and then going into &quot;the cold place&quot; (aka huge freezer) and see how long we can stay in there until having to run out :) It really is the small things that kids love so much, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is why I&#039;m moving to a 36 hour workweek. Yes, I&#039;ll lose about 10% income which is significant especially over time if it was invested, but not being stuck in the office from 8.30 to 17.00 every Monday to Friday is worth it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I often say I hate money, largely because of how it controls people. But when we control it and look past it, then we can find where our true priorities sit.

Money is simply a means to an end. This end is what 99% spend 99% of their lives chasing. Not for me though. Thank you for sharing the &quot;end&quot; part of it J. This is the stuff that really matters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this! I&#039;m about to leave work a little early to take my kids on a Friday adventure. We are making a tradition of going to the library every 3 weeks (when books are due) to return books and pick up some more. My young kids love the library and love that they get new books every few weeks. Then we&#039;ll head to Costco, because that zoo is always an adventure! Thanks for the reminder to build in fun along the way to FIRE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s all about having choices.

There&#039;s nothing worse than having no choices, or two bad choices, because of a lack of money.  This hits every area of life.  

It&#039;s about not being bound to anyone else&#039;s meager offerings because there are no other options.  I equate this to being told what to do everyday of my life when growing up.  My life drastically changed when I had my own money and could make my own decisions, whether someone else liked it or not.]]></description>
