Yeah, and from what I hear even the mega-successful feel like impostors too. I remember talking to a NY Times columnist and author (and speaker), and he asked me if I ever felt like a fraud cuz he does. And I was like &quot;whaa????? you??&quot; so it def. made me feel better :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite post was #3.  Although #9 was close behind.  I&#039;ve worked as an accountant and financial analyst for over 15 years now and I still feel like an impostor and the label of expert is somewhat terrifying to me.  My wife and I were talking about this last night and she thought I was being too hard on myself.  I know Malcolm Gladwell says it takes 10,000 hours to become world class but I feel like there is always more to learn.  Anyway thanks for sharing!!!]]></description>

Haha yeah me neither! Making it even weirder cuz I&#039;m not even sure how they&#039;re supposed to sound or be made, etc, etc... I don&#039;t even listen to the ones that I&#039;m interviewed on :) But boy... they sure have taken off, and I did get a lot of comments and emails from those who DO prefer it so it was nice for a while hitting all angles like that... I remember we had to curb the cursing though cuz people would be listening in the cars as their kids were in the back seat - hah!]]></description>

I have my moments :)

But as it&#039;s happened over the long term and not all at once, it hasn&#039;t been *as* scary? Except that I&#039;m a personal finance blogger and it surely doesn&#039;t look good - hah. (Though of course there are reasons for it all)]]></description>
