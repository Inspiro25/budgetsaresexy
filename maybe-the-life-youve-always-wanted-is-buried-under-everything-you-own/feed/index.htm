I had almost the same experience. My parents threw nothing away. When my Dad died and I cleaned out the garage and basement, my mother cried. I finally asked her, &quot;name 3 things that were in the basement and garage&quot;. She couldn&#039;t do it. BTW, she fished stuff out of the garbage so we had to take everything to the dump.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is definitely a balancing act. I try to only keep what I really need and use. Fishing is my hobbie. It is easy to keep buying and buying more tackle. When in reality I just need one box and a few rods. At one point I had 15. I ended up selling 10 on eBay. Now I just try to not go to sporting good stores. But it is easy to get crazy with any hobbie. It is good to be aware of this.]]></description>

If you didn&#039;t get all that e-mail, how would you know how popular you were? ;)

I&#039;m pretty ruthless with e-mail subscriptions, but I totally feel unloved sometimes. It&#039;s scary how those stupid e-mails trying to sell me something affect me like that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate the idea of leaving a bunch of junk for my heirs to handle when I pass. For me, the hardest thing to part with has been books; a few moves helped there since they reminded me of their weight.  I&#039;m also a big fan of less stuff to maintain; the time and money involved in taking care of stuff could be spent petting a puppy.]]></description>

The beauty of Minimalism is that, like our finances, we all have our own path.

If there is something in your life that brings you value, then by no means should you get rid of it, even if that means keeping a garage full of tools. There are always going to be extreme minimalists that live out of a backpack, but for the vast majority of us, we have families, hobbies, or jobs that require us to own significantly more. 

Minimalism is not deprivation. It&#039;s about living a more meaningful life.]]></description>

Sounds like the perfect time ;) Especially if you&#039;re moving in with your finance and will be combining their stuff too! (And congrats!)]]></description>

I would say a definite YES if we had to *make* it ourselves :) I&#039;d be nearly naked every day of the week! Haha...]]></description>
