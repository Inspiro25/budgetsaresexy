					<description><![CDATA[Seems more like a post saying all the possible options rather than discussing how to save money.  With a purchase like an instrument I&#039;d buy used starting out until I know if I, or whoever was going to play it, was actually going to stick with it, then upgrade in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree with renting, esp. if you&#039;re not sure you&#039;re going to stick with it! When I was at school, most of us rented instruments like saxes and trombones (all those massive, bulky, PRICEY ones.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks James, you are so right.  I forgot about my own experience!  I had 4 siblings.  Of the 5, 4 of us shared 2 clarinets.  My sister played trumpet.  I actually still play in a summer municipal band (for money, yeah) and for local musicals (some paid, some free).  I enjoy playing and I am blessed to be able to still do it.  Thanks for jogging my memory.  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man - one of my boys bought this $600 guitar once, learned how to play, then left it alone for 3 years...but the worst part was that he threw the whole thing on a credit card and it turned into $700 then $800 and then I think $900+ until he paid it off.  Maybe even more cuz I remember him saying it almost doubled.

So I&#039;m all about renting first to see if you enjoy it before buying :)  Although, I paid $150 for an acoustic-electric myself years back that still sits there....I never said I listened to my own advice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are some music stores that will let you Rent-to-Own, which is a great option if you can find a store that offers these plans.  This gives the flexibility of renting so that you can switch instruments, pay incrementally, etc., but if you end up sticking with that instrument, all those rental payments will eventually gain you ownership!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great post! Good advice all around :)

I sold my guitar (it still hurts...) when I needed to earn a bunch of money fast to get my E.F. built up. I promised myself then that when I was debt free and could commit to actually becoming proficient at playing it, I would once again buy an amazing guitar. 

Only 1 more year!!!]]></description>
