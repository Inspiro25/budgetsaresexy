					<description><![CDATA[Such a timely post! I just deleted Facebook from my phone PRECISELY because I hated the content and the way I felt when I scrolled through. This is my test run for deleting it completely. After a week, so far so good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking a lot about this lately as a result of being around a very unpleasant, unkind relative. The more I am around that person the more I realize I NEVER want to behave the same way. Instead I want to focus on spreading kindness, compassion and lending a hand rather than just complaining about all that&#039;s wrong with the world. Sometimes I find myself changing my life in the tiniest ways. For example, rather than rushing into a store and picking up my groceries, I deliberately walk just a little bit slower. Just slowing down I&#039;ve noticed older men and women who have trouble separating the grocery carts. If I happen to be standing near the carts I make a point to give them one. That change in my behavior takes just a minute or two, but it makes their lives easier and it makes me feel good about helping. Why am I in such a hurry anyway? I definitely need to ask myself this question more often. It&#039;s such an important question to ask!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is truly a great question to ask and a perfect reframe. There are a lot of hard things I do, like working out that don’t necessarily feel good in the moment but when I do them I feel great about myself. Thanks for giving us the litmus test for life. I am eager to read David’s post.]]></description>
