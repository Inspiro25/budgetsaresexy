make it your mission to just write 1 blog post a week - that&#039;s it! you can always do more later, but once you get into the habit it&#039;s much much easier. You can do it!!]]></description>

Hah! Awesome - you are my new hero :) I LOVE that you got yourself out of bed during those times - something I&#039;d totally do myself if I caught it that late.

So far I&#039;m 6 out of the last 7 days doing this. With that one day missed being after the first day when I over did it and felt it was best to not strain my body for a day, haha... I go on daily walks every morning anyways, which counts for something, but trying to raise that heart rate more when possible. So needless to say I&#039;ve been spending quite a lot of time on Youtube looking for better and better vids :) Helps w/ A.D.D. too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just want to say I&#039;m a HUGE fan of the 30 minutes a day exercise plan.  I just passed 7 years without missing a day (excepting two short breaks for c-sections) and I love it. I think it&#039;s a fabulous habit to make sure you&#039;re active SOMEHOW every day without making wild promises that are so easy to break. There have been times in my life where 30 minutes was a laughable bare minimum when I was running 5 or 8 miles a day, there have been days where I&#039;ve had to get out of bed at 11pm after realizing I didn&#039;t do any exercise, days when walking around campus at work adds up to 30 minutes and I count that, and days where I&#039;m sick enough that a 15-minute stretching routine and a trudge around the block is all I can manage. I love having a baseline amount of physical activity that stays consistent through all of that.  All that to say, congrats on making a great choice of exercise plans!]]></description>

COOL!!! Especially #5 :) Please do start that blog - it&#039;s not only good for holding yourself accountable, but you never know what else can come of it! It&#039;s totally changed my life completely. And it doesn&#039;t cost anything to start! (if you use wordpress or another blogging service)]]></description>

Start searching for videos! I put &#039;em full screen on my computer and then turn it so I can watch (and follow along) while I do the exercises :) There&#039;s some really good ones out there so you don&#039;t get bored!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love New Year Resolutions -- I always make a whole bunch and then forget about them *sigh* so this year I&#039;m going to take a page out of your book and start a blog so I can keep myself accountable!

I have a few ...

1] exercise &quot;outside&quot; three times a week [my housemate thinks exercising in the gym isn&#039;t as healthy, and he is really persistent and vocal about his thoughts].
2] eat a piece of fruit every day [again with the housemate].
3] read a book every week [must be fiction] - but this one can be caught up on later, I&#039;m not going to be too hard on myself because I know there will be times when I am busier than other times.
4] grow my garden to between 10-15 edible plants [currently at 5].
5] live on 50% of my income [this is the bit where YOU inspired me!].
6] and, of course, keep myself accountable!

Good luck to us all!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on the blood pressure thing.  I&#039;m a 28 year old woman with decent BMI and my blood pressure is borderline.  I know it&#039;s partially genetic as my dad has been taking pills since I can remember but I&#039;m too damn young for this.
