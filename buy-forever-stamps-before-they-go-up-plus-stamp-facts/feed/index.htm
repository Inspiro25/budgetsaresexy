Well, I wouldn&#039;t go that far haha...

They&#039;ll def. be *worth* more, but not as a &quot;collectible&quot; with how many billions they make every year!]]></description>

Haha... I&#039;m just going to assume you&#039;re right, and continue laughing for the fact you actually tried to annualize it like that (did I use that term right? :)). Something to note though would be that at least these are *guaranteed* returns for the near future vs the stock market (that 7% is better for longer-term), so me thinks this FSH would still yield excellent returns as a shorter term hustle (Forever Stamp Hack).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If my calculations are right, it wouldn&#039;t be much of a side hustle, but more lucrative than I thought. Taking the rate from 2011, when stamps were $0.44, and 2019, when stamps will become $0.55, over the eight year period that translates to 3.1% a year. Assuming the general stock market index average of 7%, and considering that there is no compounding interest (your interest isn&#039;t calculated and awarded to you every year, you don&#039;t redeem value until you sell the stamps), it doesn&#039;t seem like the best side hustle. 

On the other hand, selling stamps at a premium for those cool collectible stamps (my hand shakes every time I have to part with another Captain Kirk stamp to pay my mortgage), might prove more lucrative. 

Also I suck at math though the exception always seems to be in FIRE math, so I think I got it right! There is a reason I write for a living instead of accounting, though...]]></description>
