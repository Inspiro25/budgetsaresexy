Haha, well good! And the odds you have coins that are worth more than just the silver content is big too - especially if they&#039;ve been kept in pretty good condition :) Some years are crazy valuable, especially the farther you go back in time. You&#039;ll have to let me know the status when you get them checked out! You could always hit up any coin dealer and ask them too, just don&#039;t *sell* anything to them as you&#039;ll always get way less for &#039;em...

Yay for coins!]]></description>

cool!! that&#039;s the best way to grow your collection - by working with the money all day at a job :) you learn a lot about the history of currency too!

See you at FINCON again this year, my friend?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your bank is cray cray, lol.  We never find coolness from our normal change.  Although this does remind me to go get some gold coins for gifts coming up...little kids LOVE those gold dollars (who am I kidding...so far everybody thinks they&#039;re cool)...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holy bitches Batman, I mean JMoney-Man!  I had no idea those $1 silver coins are worth that kind of money-thank you so much for the advice.  I will definitely get the right person to take a look at them.  Damn-I usually get all excited when I find a couple pennies on the ground, or a quarter.  Right now you could literally knock me over with a feather...thanks a million!!!!]]></description>
