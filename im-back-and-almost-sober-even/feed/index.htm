					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Sausage or pickles?  What do you take me for? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Serendipity&lt;/b&gt; - Could be true!
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @ Sustainable Life Blog&lt;/b&gt; - Good to be back... kinda ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Accountability&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, thx!  You probably spent way more time in AZ though too.
@&lt;b&gt;Karoline&lt;/b&gt; - So cool!  Haven&#039;t heard of that town before, but we did pass a lot of quaint ones on our way to our wedding.  Visiting other countries is really just so amazing to me - such different culture happening every day that most of us will never see!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I only really know one small town and that&#039;s Rdzawka. My cousin just got married there, and I wish with all my heart that I couldve been there to visit with my beautiful family. We drank some champagne here in their honor but it wouldve been way cooler to be there ;) Glad you got to go and visit. *envious* :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I may be a bit out-of-touch with international travel, but I dont think you spent all that much, considering your ticket was around 80% of your total cost.  
Glad to see you back J dollaz]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes!  Back in action and reallyyyyyy not feeling the excitement here in the &quot;real world&quot; ;)  Thanks for all the well wishes my friends!  Some responses:

@&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt;  - Yeah, I was pissed for a good 24 hours straight, and then realized I had to just forgive and move on or else I&#039;d keep dwelling on it.  It was actually a REALLY refreshing experience getting it over with so fast!  I felt this wave of calm come over me, gonna try doing this in the future :)
@&lt;b&gt;Doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man :)  You know I would have gladly welcomed your visit too!  I&#039;m serious man, we really need to get together sometime in the near future.  I think there is just way too much fun we&#039;re missing!  Glad you enjoyed the post, and my kinda-but-not-really slip up.
@&lt;b&gt;Cameron H. Lebedinsky&lt;/b&gt; - Oh okay, I&#039;ll check it out!  Although I don&#039;t need much more convincing to know that US weddings aren&#039;t nearly as extravagant ;)  At least in the time department.  A whole weekend of celebrating is just amazing.  So much time to spend with family and friends on such a big day - I love it.
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Samurai&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks mate.  My friend married a Polish chick :)  I was gonna post the pictures but too many with me in them! haha.... figured I&#039;d spare everyone the random building and drunk pics.
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - It would def. be hard to not travel, but good for you in managing your money like that!  Not *as fun* traveling when you know it&#039;s adding to your debt pile, so I don&#039;t blame you.  I never traveled this crazily when I had no money... not that I wouldn&#039;t if I ever went back in time, but still ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brandon&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.... let it all out bro, let it all out.
@&lt;b&gt;Wojo&lt;/b&gt; - Oh really?  Interesting....maybe I ended up getting lucky then?  And maybe next time I&#039;ll go back to Poland with you! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah Smith&lt;/b&gt; - Ooh la la very nice!  And you better remember ME when you&#039;re back in DC crazy girl - all the coffee or beer or both on me!  You and your celebrity husband ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMan&lt;/b&gt; - Amen to that!
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - I know, I just about lost my $hit when I found out how cheap the hotel was!   I&#039;ve spent more than that in ONE night in NYC before - haha...  just goes to show how different other cultures and parts of the country are.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Maybe it was better than I thought ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m beginning to sense that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Karoline&lt;/b&gt; - I would have loved to visit Krakow!  Esp. considering Prague is my new all-time favorite city :)  But just means another reason to go back one day, eh?  (I went to a really tiny village in Poland, you probably haven&#039;t heard of it)
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Haha....  dude, lots of hot chicks reading this blog, believe me :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jim Juber&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, but I bet your Vegas trip consists of a lot more adventure ;)  Unless you just lose it in Hold &#039;em, in that case no fun.]]></description>
