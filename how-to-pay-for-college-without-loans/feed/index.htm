					<description><![CDATA[My parents supported me in college but I also did many of the things that you mention on this list!  Great round up, it brought back college memories of eating hot pockets and cup o noodles to save money!  Yes student loans are crippling and it’s so sad that our society normalized them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an awesome read! It seems like so many people think college = debt, but it definitely doesn&#039;t have to. I love how you laid out exactly how you did it. I hope we can see a generation of people with debt-free degrees. Great job, Jason!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My three millennial kids all went to college for free.  Merit based scholarships covered their tuition, fees, books and room and board.  In fact they had to turn money back because they were provided too much. And that was with millionaire parents and zero financial need.  We found that by picking STEM majors at a public university desperate to hang on to the best and brightest in-state students full scholarships were not that hard to obtain. They worked their way through grad school on their own and graduated without any loans.  Only the one who went to medical school years after his four year degree took out student loans for that.]]></description>

Excellent advice David and this is exactly what I&#039;m going to be preaching to my kids when they get older. When I worked in higher education I was completely astonished at how much scholarship money went unclaimed each year. For example I worked in the continuing and professional education college and we had hundreds of thousands of dollars just sitting in an account for scholarships that was never used. The application requirement was to write a 250 word summary on how you would use the scholarship and how it would help you. Definitely didn&#039;t seem like too big of a time commitment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish I spent more time applying to scholarships rather than applying and working at jobs. It&#039;s a guaranteed payout vs a risk but the risk has no downsides but has unlimited upsides. 

You can actually increase your pay by applying to a lot of scholarships. That&#039;s one of my biggest regrets when I was in college.]]></description>

I believe in furthering one&#039;s education.  You don&#039;t have to go to college to do this.  Do you know how many college graduates I know that have never read a book once they leave school?  That&#039;s so sad.

And....just because something is being taught in college doesn&#039;t mean its correct information.  You can get a 4 year degree in theology and come out not knowing God.  You can get a degree in med school and still not know very little about health (I&#039;ve met many doctors where i had more knowledge on health than they did).  

There is also a liberal agenda at most schools.

A major reformation is coming in the area of education.  It will look radically different in 15-20 years.]]></description>

Hey Joel, 

I’m with you. College isn’t for everyone. There’s a long list of very successful people who never earned a college degree. And today, we are blessed with a multitude of ways to continue our education without taking the traditional 4-year college route. In researching this blog feature I discovered some interesting statistics that were somewhat surprising to me:

Nearly 40% of high school graduates will never attend college. 

The United States has the worst college dropout rate (40%) of any developed country. Only 60% of people who start college will finish. 

Only about 30% of Americans have a bachelor’s degree and only 13% have a master’s or doctorate degree.  

Everyone learns differently. It will certainly be interesting to see what the concept of college looks like when my 5-year-old and 1-year-old sons are of age.]]></description>

I never went to college, but that was a bit more common in Australia when I was growing up. It&#039;ll be interesting to see what happens over the next few decades. I don&#039;t have kids (yet) but if/when I do I&#039;ll probably encourage them to continue education in the areas they are interested in, regardless of whether it&#039;s a lucrative career path or not.]]></description>

You are 100% right Angie! I will say, that even though I had the financial burden removed to attend college for my master&#039;s I still spent an entire year deciding if I could do it for two reasons: 1) the time commitment; and 2) is it worth it? What would the value of my degree be in the job marketplace? In the end I decided that I would have more regret not at least trying. 

And more to your point Angie, in researching all this ,some of the statistics that I found most interesting were that 41% of recent college graduates work in job not requiring a degree; and that only 27% of college grads actually work a field related to their major.]]></description>
