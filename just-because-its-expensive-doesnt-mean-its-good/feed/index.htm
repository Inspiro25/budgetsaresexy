					<description><![CDATA[so true, marketing and society makes many of us think a certain good is worth teh markup, perfect example, any apple product. while they are sexy, easy to use, and reliable, the huge difference in price is not indicative of a much better product. but, the apple marketing machine is very good at making people believe that an apple product is a lot better]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny you mentioned liquor. Expensive vodkas are a waste. All vodkas as supposed to be odorless, colorless, and TASTELESS. So why are there so many vodkas that expensive?! Even if you can tell a difference, if you&#039;re gonna mix it, don&#039;t mix the expensive stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Thanks everyone!&lt;/b&gt;  I&#039;ll admit a little piece of me wanted the meeting of the Bobs to go sour too ;)  BUT all that means is now I get to  leave on my OWN terms.  And I&#039;m starting to put together a 4-6 month plan to make this happen so I&#039;m 100% ready to roll... all this thinking and wondering makes me just want to DO.  I&#039;ll grow the balls soon enough, don&#039;t you worry.  And it&#039;ll be a lot easier knowing I&#039;ve got you all backing me up too! haha....you guys are awesome.

Be sure to enjoy yourselves this weekend, okay?  I&#039;m off to Jersey for a wedding and some relaxing....all this job talk has worn a brother out.

@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, I pitched myself to the Bobs (well, actually there was only one) and it worked out really good.  I don&#039;t think  I&#039;ll be able to do the financial stuff I wanted to get my hands on, but I&#039;m def. going to be busy with other fun projects!
@&lt;b&gt;Laura&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s pretty $hitty! haha....sorry, couldn&#039;t resist ;)
@&lt;b&gt;FB @ FabulouslyBroke.com&lt;/b&gt; - No, never heard of that but you&#039;ve got me sold! haha....and i&#039;m afraid I would also try that $100 burger too ;)  Not the $5,000 one, but perhaps when I actually win the lottery for once....although i&#039;ve played enough to have gotten to $5,000 I&#039;m sure!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just don&#039;t understand why people pay to go eat a steak. It is not terribly hard to cook with a bit of practice and you can buy it easily and costs a heck of a lot less. You can buy kobe for around 30-40$ a lb on sale. I did try it once, but did not think it was worth the cost. I would rather pay the 4-5$ for Ribeye or the occasional 9$ for Tenderloin and have it wrapped and cut for free of course I am in Texas.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J have you ever heard of that super expensive coffee called Kopi Luwak (Kopi = Coffee) where they make civets eat coffee beans and then they collect the..er..fecal remains and sell THAT to consumers to drink? :P

For big bucks too apparently. It&#039;s super expensive civet crap. Literally.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak

What I wouldn&#039;t mind trying is the $100 truffle burger. But I heard there&#039;s a $5000 burger out there as well, except I couldn&#039;t afford to drop more than $100 on a burger, so that&#039;ll remain a mystery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this applies especially to food, which only get to enjoy once.  It&#039;s amazing how much money gets spent on food and beverages.  

Buying quality products that will last for many years can pay huge dividends in the long run.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J-so glad to hear the blessing of job keeping!  Yeah!!!!    As for the other, are you kidding me?  I have never had that kind of money to spend like that and, considering where I have come from, I don&#039;t think I could do it.  I believe in personal choice.  As for me, I choose to live simply, give all I can and spend my time with family.  In the end, isn&#039;t that what it is really about?  Give me a use gas grill, yard sale finds and the pleasure of a warm spring day on the porch swing with my mate . . . . . . that&#039;s heaven to me.  :-)]]></description>
