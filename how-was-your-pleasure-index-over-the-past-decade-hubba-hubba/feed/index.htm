					<description><![CDATA[Investments: 10 - have you SEEN the market over the last ten years holy cow
Financial Outlook: 10 - our jobs are secure, so if the bottom drops out we can just buy low
Home Equity: 10 - refi&#039;d in 2015. We owe $128k on a place valued at almost 3x that
Employment Status: 5 - my job is a black hole of turn-off-my-brain-and-grind for 40h a week, but I&#039;m probably paid more than I should be
Personal Inflation: 8 - we dedicated frivolous spending to 401(k) plans and regret nothing... but own a house and all associated nuisances
Personal Taxes: 8 - tax rates are at all-time lows; frankly at our income we should be paying more
Debts Owed: 9 - mortgage will be done in ten years! 
Career Potential: 2 - I have lost all interest in working for a living. Thanks, FIRE. :P 

PFSiONE Total Score: 62

...I&#039;ll take it!]]></description>

I feel like you need to add a 5 or so even for renting (we&#039;re pro renters here!), and maybe even a 5 or 6 to debts owed too. $27k is a lot, but low interest and going towards something IMPORTANT is def better than nonsense out there...

But yes - very good to hear from people in the trenches more for sure :) thanks for sharing!]]></description>
