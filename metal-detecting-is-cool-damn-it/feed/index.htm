					<description><![CDATA[You should try detecting in Thailand - people here have absoultely no idea what I am doing.  Most think I am out there picking up the trash or looking for fish.  I not only get states, I get stalked.  people have been know to follow me for almost one mile never more than a foot or two away watching my every move.  But, I don&#039;t care.  I love to detect and would go out to the beach and hunt every day if I could.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw someone doing this last weekend and thought the same thing. Are we back in the early 90s? Wife and I had a good laugh.

I just saw a news story where someone found a senior ring from the 60s and reunited with the guy. Pretty cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, what DO you do about that?  I feel like the first thing is to get outta there right?  Not sure how dangerous it actually is, but you&#039;d think safety would have to come first on top of anything else.  Then again if it meant moving out of your childhood home or something it would be tough as hell...still, better to be alive and real estate-poor than dead :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of KaBOOM - a whole neighborhood in the central Florida was found to be build on AN OLD BOMB RANGE!! The houses there have dropped to in value to practically nothing for the poor people who live there and they are constantly finding old bombs that they have to blow up on the grade schools grounds! There is a big stink about what exactly is to be done considering these people were lied to about where their homes were built - but the guy who did the lying was like a seller of the land about 10 transactions back or something. It&#039;s just a huge mess!]]></description>
