					<description><![CDATA[Great answers everyone!! Y&#039;all brought out some crazy old celebrities too, I love it :)

@&lt;b&gt;leslie&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh a new business venture of yours?  I wanna hear!!!  If you ever want to bounce around ideas, or need help w/ anything, let me know :)  I love brainstorming ways to make projects come true (I do it every other day with some people)
@&lt;b&gt;Leslie&lt;/b&gt; - Love that walking idea!! You&#039;re lucky you have a partner who likes to do those -- my wife hates walking unless we&#039;re going somewhere specific and it&#039;s only a few blocks away, haha... it&#039;s a good thing I&#039;m fine going by myself! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Amanda&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that Hugh sure does leave a good impression on girls!  I don&#039;t see it with him, but I do see it on the usuals (Clooney, Pitt, etc).  Regardless though, you shall get your wish one day ;) And I hear ya on your charming ideas, though you can probably call all those c/c companies up at anytime and get them to lower it or at least consider it pretty easily.  Talking to a manager increases your odds every time :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey @ Zero to One Million Challenge&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;d hang out with ya :)  We can have fun drinking coffee and working on all your blog stuff.  One day!  (and also - you should totally do a question/answer post like this on your site - you really do get to know your readers!) 
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, yeah - I agree about the grandparents :(  I wish I had taken advantage of their lives and stories/knowledge/love growing up too!  Great answer.
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, all you need is an hour to get caught up with work?  Lucky bastard! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I like how I&#039;m right in there w/ the Dalai Lama.  But you&#039;re right, I&#039;d totally spill all my blogging secrets to ya ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Hahhahhaa a woman who knows her poker!!!!  I love it :)  That might be the best answer yet, haha... hilarious.  And congrats on the wedding!
@&lt;b&gt;kim&lt;/b&gt; - I like it!  You should enter my Financial Peace Giveaway then today to get your fill of Dave Ramsey :)
@&lt;b&gt;Dana J.&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww, the first person to NOT need an extra hour!  I&#039;m impressed! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah L&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, welcome back to the 5 For Friday club :)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - GREAT 1st time participating!  Love the answers - esp the home ofice one, that&#039;s key :)  gotta have your work space all fit and clear so your thoughts can flow easier!  I&#039;m working on my new office too over here -- moved from our upstairs 2nd bedroom to our furnished basement... now I have a whole blogger cave! woo!
@&lt;b&gt;Bryan at Pinch that Penny!&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah you&#039;re missing out!  Though I just admit the first season was the best... it starts getting pretty dark as the seasons go by - I&#039;m a bigger fan of the happy/crazy/weird stuff than the &quot;everything&#039;s going to hell&quot; parts.  We&#039;ll see what the next season brings tho.  Hope you and Netflix make up so you can watch it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;sandra&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you have 2 dozen pairs of shoes at work?  now That is funny,  haha... and awesome.  Maybe during your next snowstorm the tree will be blown into the street and the gov&#039;t will have to haul it away? :)
@&lt;b&gt;graduate.living&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah they do!  I&#039;d be ecstatic to share beers with them as well.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, the writing part of blogging is the hardest for me!  I love doing all the other stuff cuz I don&#039;t have to *think* that much ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Kegarator! YES!
@&lt;b&gt;Danielle Liss&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... Tina Fey is pretty cool.  I wanna read that memoir when it&#039;s out, too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;kody @ financial money tips&lt;/b&gt; - She&#039;s a cutie huh?  Got mad stage presence compared to Idol too - she&#039;s def. doing her thing.
@&lt;b&gt;KSUE&lt;/b&gt; - Roseanne? Barr?  Haha... didn&#039;t see that one coming :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, I bet Anne Hathaway is totally chill in real life.  Seems so nice!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, we gotta get you another job!  What are you looking to do this next round?  I can keep my eyes open for stuff as it comes up :)
@&lt;b&gt;jaded&lt;/b&gt; - There you go!  Serene seems crazy smart too - maybe you could get the tips while you play together? Would be like me and Buffett playing Bridge :)
@&lt;b&gt;L.G.&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  Although he&#039;s playing for the wrong team ya know?  I&#039;d be more impressed if he were on my Redskins ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Geena Davis!  Forgot about her.  Yeah, I bet she&#039;s super sweet.  Nice one :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Extra $1,000?  Buy the futon for my home office and finish off the new wardrobes for me and Mr. BFS since we lost a lot of weight and don&#039;t have many outfits yet.

An Extra Hour Today? I liked that extra hour of making out you mentioned...

Mad Charming Skills? My blogging advertiser business until my hubby gets home and then it would all be at hime along with that extra hour above.

A termination letter?  Just one of my clients?  I&#039;d want to know why but honestly, I could blow it off it wasn&#039;t my fault.

A whole afternoon with your favorite celebrity or role model?  Sandra Bullock or Geena Davis.  I think they are both too awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. An extra $1,000? I&#039;d buy a new wool peacoat, some uggs and some jeans, some tops, and dresses.
2. An extra hour today?  I would&#039;ve gone to yoga.
3. Mad charming skills? I&#039;d charm my professors into giving me As without actually doing the work! :D 
4. A termination letter in your hand? Like if someone fired you right now? That would be weird if someone fired me, cause I don&#039;t have job, so I&#039;d probably just look at them like they had 10 heads.
5. A whole afternoon with your favorite celebrity or role model? Wes Welker, that guy is AMAZING! I would work out with him (he&#039;d do way better) to figure out how he came back from an ACL/MCL tear with only missing 1 post season game! I just LOVE Wes Welker (I may also use number 3 on him!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.  Extra $1,000 —  Either a special edition Coach bag or a new business suit.  With loads of alterations :)
2.  An Extra hour today — Sounds boring, but I think I&#039;d use it to hit the gym  Today was so packed I did lots of work, no fun.
3.  Mad charming skills — I&#039;d get some extra flirting in at one of the new bars in the neighborhood.
4.  Termination letter — I&#039;d be sad, I like my coworkers.  Then I&#039;d respond to the flurry of recruiters hitting me up on linkedin.
5..Celebrity afternoon — Hmm. Since I am in a tennis mood, I&#039;d want to hand out with Serena Williams.  And get fitness and business tips.  :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1)Remodel my bathroom with a shopping spree at Ikea
2) sleep.  10 months of 2 to 5 hours of sleep EVERY night takes a toll.
3)Get my husband a raise, get a dream job for me, get good deals on everything I would want and could afford for the day.
4) Did I mention I am unemployed again?  So pretty much just take one day at a time.
5)Pick the brains of some top financial people and some top executives.  But if I got a hall pass I would totally do Pierce Brosnan.]]></description>

2. An extra hour? Sleep. Period.
3. Mad charming skills? Ask the barista on my favorite coffee shop to give me a free cup of coffee, charged on his salary. LOL. 
4. A termination letter? Cry my heart out.
5. An afternoon with your favorite celebrity? Hang out with Anne Hathaway or Daniel Radcliffe and get an update on their career and personal lives.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. An extra 1000 dollars? I would book a trip to Disneyland for me and my kids.
2. An extra hour today? A walk on the beach would be great.
3. Charming skills? I would charm someone to invest money and marketing skills into my art and writing.
4. Termination Letter? I would probably cry, and then look for a new job fast.
5. Afternoon with a celebrity? I&#039;d hangout with Roseanne on her macadamia nut farm, or have lunch with Jeff Probst (from Survivor).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. An extra 1000 dollars? At this point in time i would invest the entire thing into my website :)
2. An extra hour today?  I would spend that time hanging out with family. I don&#039;t have too much time on my hands lately, so that extra hour would be amazing.
3. Charming skills? i would charm everyone i see, hoping to put a smile on their face. 
4. Termination Letter?  IF that would happen i would work harder on the things i love. 
5. Celebrity? I would easily hang out with carrie underwood and use my charming skills to seduce her ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.An extra $1,000?  I would immediately call CCCS and increase my payment for next month so that I would be even closer to paying off my last credit card and making the ultimate credit card snuff film. (Oh yeah, there is a Dexter theme. But Dexter&#039;s coming to Vegas.)

2.An extra hour today?  I am going to lose an hour traveling today for a conference, so I think this would make me even. Regardless, I want to read or sleep. Things I don&#039;t get to do enough of. 

3.Mad charming skills?  Upgrade on today&#039;s flight and hotel check-in

4.A termination letter in your hand? Work full-time on my business and my memoir

5.A whole afternoon with your favorite celebrity or role model? Today, I need more time with an awesome chick who wears glasses, so I&#039;d like to hang out with Tina Fey and talk about living near Philly in our youth and how she gets paid to be really funny and I just sit in an office surrounded by unicorns.]]></description>

<p>2.An extra hour today?  I am going to lose an hour traveling today for a conference, so I think this would make me even. Regardless, I want to read or sleep. Things I don&#8217;t get to do enough of. </p>
<p>3.Mad charming skills?  Upgrade on today&#8217;s flight and hotel check-in</p>
<p>4.A termination letter in your hand? Work full-time on my business and my memoir</p>
<p>5.A whole afternoon with your favorite celebrity or role model? Today, I need more time with an awesome chick who wears glasses, so I&#8217;d like to hang out with Tina Fey and talk about living near Philly in our youth and how she gets paid to be really funny and I just sit in an office surrounded by unicorns.</p>
