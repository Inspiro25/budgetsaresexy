					<description><![CDATA[Having been that bartender (minus the girls) I have to say that it&#039;s ok to get change. It happens to everyone.

Honestly though this shouldn&#039;t be a thing, bartenders make change for people all the time so they can tip. You should never have to feel awkward about it.]]></description>

Very interesting way of looking at this situation! You&#039;re GOOD at this game! Haha... And to answer your question - yes, I would have done the same at a PF blogging event (same predicament in my mind - which is I got caught w/ my pants down and wanted to quickly resolve it in the easiest - most right - way as possible). It was more of an uncomfortable feeling in general than a wanting to look good one, though of course that naturally went through my mind a few times. I feel like the best thing that could have happened was that a) I had been given more time, even just 10 seconds which I would have used to then decipher it was worth asking for change, or b) No one was looking and I could get away w/out tipping that second and then coming back w/ a dollar later. Definitely interesting to think about though in your &quot;performing&quot; story way - I like that :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a theatre PhD student, this story is very interesting to me on the basis of for whom you&#039;re performing. On the one hand, you&#039;re performing for the bartender who expects some kind of tip for pulling the cap off of the bottle, and on the other hand, you&#039;re performing for the friend whom you haven&#039;t seen in a while and whom you believe to be a standout in the new community you&#039;ve found yourself in. You, having already offended the standards of the community unknowingly (by not dressing up more), are torn in a lot of different ways--and, it seems to me, you want to feel like you belong there as well as show/perform that you belong there (and your belonging-ness is being questioned by all the people staring at you--and the presence of your friend).

I guess my question for you would be: if this scenario were different in terms of location, would you have reacted differently? For example, at an open bar at a PF blogging convention where you are one of the larger fishes in the community, would you have reacted differently? Such an act of largesse might be be looked down upon by other PF bloggers, so I suspect you might have made an effort to make change in the tip jar. Conversely, in the early days of the startup you worked at (where, from what I&#039;ve read of what you&#039;ve written about it, the money was flowing quickly and easily), tipping ten bucks might be showing off or might be a joke (&quot;see how little I care about this ten-spot? I&#039;ll make this back in ten minutes tomorrow!&quot;).

In short, in your story, I think you were trying to appear comfortable in a situation in which you were necessarily uncomfortable for a couple of reasons. To answer your question, if I were really uncomfortable, I would probably have reacted in the same way--but I&#039;d like to think I would have made eye-contact with the bartender (who, while being happy with a $10 tip, certainly would have found it extravagant) and asked, &quot;Do you mind if I make change?&quot;]]></description>

Haha... oh yeah, you gotta drop it in those events. I keep a few dollar bills in my car for that exact same reason when I&#039;m stopped at those lights and they walk on buy asking for help. My rule is that I always have to say &quot;yes&quot; if asked (other wise I&#039;d never give), but you def. get into pickles when your singles are all gone. At least you did a great thing!]]></description>
