					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the note Leslie, it&#039;s nice to meet you!

Regarding your question, I go over how to talk to the park manager if you need to find out the lot rent here in my podcast: https://adventuresinmobilehomes.com/podcast-episode-8-how-to-talk-to-mobile-home-park-managers/

As for finding mobile homes on private land, you can scope out the areas you want to buy and see if you can find any for sale. Another option would be to work with a real estate agent who specializes in working with sellers with mobile homes on private land. They may be able to help you find a few opportunities. 

If you have any other questions, feel free to let me know. Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/investing-in-mobile-homes/#comment-289817&quot;&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Ed, I appreciate it! 

Yes, the great thing about investing in mobile homes is that it gives you options. You can choose to buy the home only or the home with the land or the entire mobile home park. But you don&#039;t necessarily have to do it all to achieve financial success. 

Over the years, I&#039;ve met other mobile home investors who&#039;ve taken different paths. It&#039;s all a matter of what you want to do and the type of lifestyle you want to live. Personally, I&#039;ve chosen to stick with the homes for now. It&#039;s what I know and what works. 

In the future, I may look into buying land or maybe a small mobile home park if the numbers work. Though, I&#039;m pretty happy and satisfied with the business so far. :) 

Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/investing-in-mobile-homes/#comment-289796&quot;&gt;Deanna @Recovering Women Wealth&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Deanna! Yes, it&#039;s definitely an asset class overlooked by many. Owning properties that are paid off are a big plus. :) 

Regarding my inventory, I own about the size of a small park. It&#039;s manageable as long as I have more good apples than bad ones. After awhile, opportunities start coming your way as you learn how to maintain relationships with the park managers and owners. 

When I have homes to fix up, I&#039;ve had to pass on some leads. It&#039;s all a matter of timing. What I enjoy about the mobile home business is that it&#039;s much slower paced. Definitely less involved with the amount of work needed when flipping and/or wholesaling single-family homes. 

Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/investing-in-mobile-homes/#comment-289795&quot;&gt;Christine&lt;/a&gt;.

Very cool to hear Christine! Yes, the history with mobile homes is that they were actually used by people who had money. Those who were able to afford them would drive them across country and park them in RV type resorts. They were called Airstream trailers. Here&#039;s more info if you&#039;re interested: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstream

Regarding the parks, you&#039;re right. It is a constant staying in touch and maintaining relationships. I tend to work in corporate type parks. The ones with the bad press lately have been larger investor groups. And yes, some of the tactics used can be questionable. 

It&#039;s important for people to know exactly the mindset of the owners of the parks they want to work in. Having bad relations can definitely break your deals. 

Thanks for reading! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/investing-in-mobile-homes/#comment-289784&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

Great to hear Kate! I agree with J. Check it out! 

I tell most people who are interested in getting into mobile home investing to start small. Do a deal or two. Then if you like it, you can continue to do more deals. If not, it&#039;s better than being in a big deal with more risk. 

Hope that helps. Thanks for reading. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rachel, this is simply fascinating and something I would have never considered. It’s attractive to me because I can afford to cash flow a purchase for a mobile home where I’d need a mortgage for a single family home. I’m not intimidated to start up a relationship with an owner of a mobile home park. Hmm, some things to think about! Thanks for sharing!

How many mobile homes do you own currently?]]></description>
