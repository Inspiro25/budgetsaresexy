					<description><![CDATA[Yeah!!! Same here. Although ever since I heard this radio station talk about how if you don&#039;t tip people they&#039;ll make a note in their &quot;system&quot; and give you crap for service the next time.  (and much much worse things too - think nasty stuff in your pizza, etc). I doubt all of that is totally true, but still - why take the chance?! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always wondered how much they make... I know garbage collector&#039;s make a $HIT ton more than people think - at least the ones in NYC. I feel like someone once told me they can make up to $80-$100k?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great discussions guys!  I thought I&#039;d get a lot more haters out there saying I&#039;m a jack a$$ but you have suprised me ;) (watch, the next comment be all up on me..)

Just wanted to add that I think it IS appropriate to tip if someone customizes their work around you - like, if you forget to take out their trash and they do it for you, or they deliver something to you earlier than normal because they know you prefer it, etc etc.

I&#039;m cool with tipping people for doing something way above &amp; beyond, but just not for doing your job the way you&#039;re supposed to.  Know what I mean?  We all get paid to do a job, and to do it well, not cuz we&#039;re hoping to get big tips or anything.

Some responses:

@&lt;b&gt;Kristia@Family Balance Sheet&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, well that&#039;s nice of you :)  If I had a relationship w/ ours I&#039;d probably do something nice I suppose.
@&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I think the hair thing is much more common in tipping.  Mrs Budgetsaresexy does that too, along w/ every other girl I know.  I used to give $2 before I rocked the &#039;hawk :)
@&lt;b&gt;Niki&lt;/b&gt; - At least we&#039;re all together :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenn&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... mine&#039;s like that too now that I think about it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - But you&#039;re forgetting you tip yourself!  In beer aftewards :)
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - I guess that makes sense.  I wonder if you left an old TV or something valuable if that would count as a tip?! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Michael Senchuk&lt;/b&gt; - I def. think it&#039;s a proximity thing too ever since blogging this... and the newspapers are good for kitty litter ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh.... yeah, that makes sense then.
@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - It is crazy sometimes that people think they&#039;re entitled to tips and stuff even though they&#039;re getting PAID TO WORK and do a good job, right? I wish people would do a good job because they care and it&#039;s the right thing to do.
@&lt;b&gt;SheBudget&lt;/b&gt; - I think the wealthy does tip a lot.  Because they know giving out more gets them more in return down the road... but who knows.  I&#039;ll let you know once I&#039;m there too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kathleen&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s an interesting thought actually - if it matters if they&#039;re kids?  I&#039;d be MUCH more inclined to tip (and tip well) if kids were giving me these services.
@&lt;b&gt;Robert Muir&lt;/b&gt; - I can see that.   But what if it&#039;s their job to get it ther at 5 a.m. whether it&#039;s your preference or not?  I guess I don&#039;t get that we all tip for things that should be done well anyways... I understand the customizing part though.
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - Same here :)  When I tip, I&#039;m generous. I just don&#039;t like tipping for every single thing out there.
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal @ BFS&lt;/b&gt; - I think $100 is great!  Esp cuz that&#039;s the # I&#039;d give if I were to guess :)
@&lt;b&gt;autumn&lt;/b&gt; - :)
@&lt;b&gt;Karen&lt;/b&gt; - Okay so yeah, they&#039;re hooking you up even when you forget which is AWESOME, so I&#039;d tip for that too then. I can see that.
@&lt;b&gt;Pressure Cooker Diaries&lt;/b&gt; - Those bag carriers at the airlines always try tricking you too!  I always try and carry myself since I know they&#039;ll be expecting a tip at the end ;)  But then again, If I were a girl and had like 10 bags then I&#039;d certainly pay for convenience (not saying all girls have 10 bags, or can&#039;t carry things themselves, just givin an ex.)
@&lt;b&gt;jordana&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... is he your personal body guard at times? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kay Lynn (Bucksome)&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, of course!
@&lt;b&gt;jaime&lt;/b&gt; - on my questioning? haha..
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - oh wow, that&#039;s a whole different atmosphere!  no tipping at bars &amp; cabs?  i bet they looooove it when Americans come over there and tip anyways ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Carmie of the Single Nester&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  It&#039;s too bad you can&#039;t do the opposite of tipping and get a little back ;)]]></description>
