Agreed! Gotta use that time wisely and not waste away feeling all depressed 24/7. Though of course much easier said than done :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/from-eviction-to-vacation-in-10-months/#comment-98571&quot;&gt;C The Writer&lt;/a&gt;.

@C The Writer what country are you in? You HAVE to change your mindset. Keep coming to places like this to be inspired. The more you think &quot;poor&quot; the easier it will be to accept that you always knew you were going to stay poor. Focus on being wealthy, happy, stable. Have you heard of a vision board? maybe try that  it will help shift your focus over time of where you want to be if you are looking at something you love every day. I have been in hard times  too. It WILL pass if you apply yourself. I don&#039;t have any special skills or talents except maybe the stubborness that I refuse to fail myself and my family. You need to surround yourself with people of the same mindset. Things WILL change Keep your eyes open to opportunities :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can completely relate to this and its what I have said to so many I know but the sad thing is , most people I meet would rather dwell on their losses and stick their head in the grounds. One person I met I tried to help by showing them how to compare credit cards and loans so they could save money on their debt by consolidating it. Instead they completely ignored my advice and just took out another credit card with their current back with high interest and repayments. The reality was that they were having more outgoings the incoming and neither wanted to work any harder. I decided not to pursue the friendship as I could see them going down a bad path and dragging me down in their negativity.  I have been here myself. We were ready to go bankrupt but stubborness in me refused to fail and so I worked my butt off to put us back in another position. We have debt but at least its now manageable! Also writing my blog helps me to keep track of what I&#039;m doing and reading blogs like yours inspire me to continue. It&#039;s not easy being a stay at home mum when you have a child to care for and a house to uphold but it&#039;s not a good enough excuse to not do anything else. Like you said there is ALWAYS TIME people just need to learn to prioritise and think outside the box. :)]]></description>
