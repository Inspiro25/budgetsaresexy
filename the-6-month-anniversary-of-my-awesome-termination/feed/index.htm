					<description><![CDATA[Hey Catherine! Very cool - I&#039;ll be passing your front door step sometime this weekend :)  I think we&#039;re staying in Grand Rapids Saturday night :)  We&#039;re there to do our 6th &lt;a href=&quot;http://lovedrop.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Love Drop&lt;/a&gt; (a side project where we use micro-giving to help one family a month and we film it kinda like a reality show/home extreme makeover, haha...) and this month&#039;s family lives a bit north somewhere of Detroit :)  I&#039;m not sure how much time we&#039;ll have while there, but if you shoot me an email I can keep in touch with you and see what we can work out?  j (at) budgets are sexy (dot) com.   Would be cool to meet up :)

And I hope you get that PF blog up too soon!  Not only will you learn a lot and be more cognizant of your money (because everyone else will know what you do when they read about it! haha....) but you&#039;ll meet a wonderful group of people while you&#039;re at it too.  It&#039;s really pretty amazing :) Just start!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on all your success in these past 6 months.  I would love to do what you do! It is my goal to start a PF blog one of these days that I actually get my act together. I live in Grand Rapids MI and I am sure you will enjoy the ferry from Milwaukee to Muskegon.  That is the way to travel!  I would love to meet up if you will be around or through Grand Rapids and have any time.  What are you doing in Detroit?  I am originally from Canton.  Make sure you get a Detroit coney before you leave!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe they can get away without paying you for this long. Want me to beat them up? Tell them if they don&#039;t fork over your delayed paycheck, plus a bonus of six months&#039; worth of pens and Post-Its from the supply closet, you&#039;ll send your cranky menopausal writer friend over -- and she doesn&#039;t believe in time-outs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks!  I promised myself I&#039;d go an entire year without searching for a job to see if I can do it, and so far it&#039;s working! :)  It def. makes you feel alive, that&#039;s for sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s pretty darn exciting seeing you take advantage of the opportunity you were given (your termination). It would have been easy to go searching for another job, but instead, you did what you wanted to do and you have been successful. Definitely jealous, haha.]]></description>
