					<description><![CDATA[Well, congrats on the happy hour feat! And we all went for a picnic on Easter, a big family get together, played some games, ate lovely food, lay in the sun and just enjoyed the fact that is was a good weekend. As for your money saving venture - it&#039;s amazing how small changes to our lifestyles can change our financial lives so drastically!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My in-laws are having us over for some yummy dinner :)

We didn&#039;t have a really strong Easter tradition growing up. It was basically go to church for an extremely long mass. I&#039;m catholic :). My mom says there where some years we skipped church because she got tired of our complaining. We had sunday lunch, and then, maybe if we were invited somewhere we would go somewhere for Easter.]]></description>
