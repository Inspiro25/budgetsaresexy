Yeah it is! Haha.... And it&#039;s pretty crazy because if you asked *any* of them if they&#039;d rather stop working or continue working for X # of years, they&#039;re gonna tell you they&#039;d rather stop and have the freedom! Yet no one asks you how you did it so they can learn and copy you??? It&#039;s like we&#039;re too brainwashed to going after the &quot;normal&quot; thing that people just cast aside all other routes... And I was probably the same until it dawned on me how ridiculous it is, haha.. 

Have fun on that lake! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, this cracks me up! It&#039;s so true. The whole time we were saving, investing and hustling, there were those people who thought it was &#039;stupid&#039;. Like driving a beater car, packing our lunch or renovation homes would never add up. BUT then those same exact people after we hit financial freedom, now just think it&#039;s &#039;weird&#039;. Whatever. They can drive to work in their 40k SUV and order take out to make themselves feel better about the 9 hours they have to spend at a job they hate. I&#039;m going to the lake today. Or hiking. 

My sweet mom said after the Hubs quite this year. &quot;You know, honey, it&#039;s weird. People will think it&#039;s weird. You don&#039;t take a year off of work when you have 5 kids. No one does that! Maybe at 22.&quot; She is absolutely right. It&#039;s weird. And freaking awesome.]]></description>

Another interpretation - he may be one of those slimy guys who has learned how effective it can be to be mean to a woman, in order to make her turn herself inside out for him, and thus end up wanting him.  So I agree with J, he may like you, and be a manipulative bastid.  Stay far far away!]]></description>

Maria, they refused your offer of coffee because they thought you were a nanny?  Ok, so I get that the point is that they made an offensive assumption based on accent... but I don&#039;t get the logic of refusing coffee from a nanny.  Do nannies make bad coffee?  Do they only accept coffee from someone of a certain socioeconomic status?  Or -- oh! Were you offering to go out together and socialize together, at a coffee place, and she thought you were lower status and so refused?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well said. Not surprisingly, I&#039;m loving the Aesop quote too. We waste so much time trying to impress others or show others what we&#039;ve accomplished or have, that we lose sight of what&#039;s really important - ourselves, our families, etc. At the end of the race, nobody is going to give a sh#t where you finished, they&#039;ll be worried about themselves. A college professor of mine used to say, &quot;whoever dies with the most stuff wins.&quot; Now I&#039;m wondering which side of this argument he was really on... aaaand now I have a headache.]]></description>
