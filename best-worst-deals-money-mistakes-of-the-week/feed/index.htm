					<description><![CDATA[OUCH, that&#039;s so messed up :( Sorry to hear, my friend.  Our speeding ticket was caught on one of those light thingie&#039;s so luckily no points or real police/courts to deal with.  Just had to pay the fee and wipe my hands of it, thank goodness... hope your luck gets better!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that&#039;s really quite inexpensive for a speeding ticket. I think they are at least a couple hundred in Arizona.  And if you go to the &quot;class&quot; it costs almost as much but you don&#039;t get points placed on your license.  We&#039;ve been having some major car trouble but we think someone in our family got sabotaged... we&#039;ve had to replace fuel pumps in three of our four vehicles and one was going to cost almost $600 to replace from the dealer but my husband found just this morning that he can get the actual fuel pump for under $40 plus shipping. So we&#039;re thrilled about that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yuck!!!  Yet another reason to use credit cards for most of these things! ACH stuff freaks me out, unless I&#039;m getting PAID that way, haha... great things to consider though for sure, thanks for stopping by my friend :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should pay MORE attention to automated payments.  Sounds a little weird, but I&#039;ve seen some terribly upset people (at the credit union I work at) who neglected their auto-pays even after they had canceled the service.  Your case is slightly different since it is a credit card but some people like to use ACH which takes money directly from your account.  The problem with this is that some companies either don&#039;t process the paperwork to cancel the ACH in a timely fashion OR don&#039;t really care if you canceled your subscription.  Then you have to pay a $25 fee to the credit union or bank to cancel that ACH and take up the rest with that company that you chose not to use the services of anymore.  Just be careful when you set up your automatic payments :).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Augh, PiC totally got a speeding ticket taking his usual route this week too! AND at the end of the week he forgot to pay for parking in his rush to catch transit and we very nearly got a ticket for that on top of the speeding ticket. I was going to blog about this today too! :) tsk tsk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s party time!!  Friday night - woo!! (Says the nerd typing on the keyboard)

@&lt;b&gt;Mikayla&lt;/b&gt; - Can&#039;t complain about that!
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, that is wonderful!  I hate seeing perfectly good stuff getting trashed too - though I never pick it up just to donate it, you&#039;re kinder than I am ;)  I&#039;d probably try and sell it first and THEN donate if I had no luck, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Lance@MoneyLife&amp;More&lt;/b&gt; - Nice job! That Saphire bonus is no joke :) Only reason my ticket was so low was cuz it was a speeding camera and not a police pullover - thank goodness!
@&lt;b&gt;Alexa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like the way you roll :)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - I know, but totally my fault :(
@&lt;b&gt;Marc @ FatAndBroke&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, that&#039;s the worst.  I&#039;ve once seen a bike cop ride up to a friend&#039;s car and hand over a no-seatbelt ticket too, they&#039;re no joke!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I probably could get the fee waived, but I&#039;m over it at this point... as silly as it sounds, it&#039;s not worth my time right now w/ the wee one on its way :(  but soon enough I&#039;ll be a father like you!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Laura Brown&lt;/b&gt; - Wow good for you!! That&#039;s quite the accomplishment! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - You are an angel, Trinnie!!  I admire you so much!!!  We feel so bad for your community and everyone losing their homes out there - I can&#039;t even slightly imagine how that must feel for everyone :(  Keep spreading the love!!!  Your God&#039;s little helper! :)
@&lt;b&gt;DebtsnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; - Woah that is bad!! What a nightmare - I&#039;m glad they at least TOLD YOU to go and cancel manually/etc - that could have been a lot worse over time :(  Congrats on the refinance though - that&#039;s exciting :)  And I hear you on the water heater - our brand new one is looking mighty shiny these days, haha... with a grand less in our pockets too (boooooo).
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - It really is incredibly sad - been watching it on the net for a while, just freaky! :(  Way to go on your recliner deal though, I used to never like them but am a huge fan of them now too :)  Maybe it&#039;s a &quot;getting older&quot; kinda thing? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - COOL!! I didn&#039;t know they lived in China?? Exciting :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa@LittleHouseInTheValley&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! You&#039;d think they&#039;d be like Netflix now and just let you take them for however long you want, but you can&#039;t rent anymore until they&#039;re returned ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Tino&lt;/b&gt; - I imagine so - you&#039;re def. not anyone&#039;s friend that day ;)  Has anyone ever tried to bribe you or offer any &quot;services&quot; for letting them off the hook? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Debt Free Teen&lt;/b&gt; - Oh heck yeah!  Best place ever for cleaning out your house. And then you just donate what doesn&#039;t sell and take the tax write off too - win/win/win! (The last win is for the cleaner house ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Dion&lt;/b&gt; - And where was that $200 spent while there, good sir? Hmmmm?? Some thirst quenching and shiny beed action, perhaps? ;)  I think you did better than me the last time I was there though - I&#039;m pretty sure I spent like $200 in one night, haha... but you gotta hook up your boys on bachelor party time of course.
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - 50 down to 30??? That&#039;s horrible!! HUGE difference, jeez!!  But yeah girl, damn good job on selling that stuff outta your place - soak it all in! :)]]></description>
