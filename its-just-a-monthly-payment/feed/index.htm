Oh wow - good on your husband for having that Mini Cooper paid off in full too! It&#039;s like getting PAID to save every month now with an upfront cash bonus, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In March 2011 I sold my 3 year old SUV so that I could trade down and get a 7 year old Honda Accord. My dad and brother thought it was a stupid mistake. My dad finally jumped on board when I told him I&#039;d be saving $360 a month with the Accord. My Accord is now 12 years old, has 199,500 miles and I enjoy driving her every day! Hell...she even has heated leather seats, a moon roof and a 6 disc CD player! My SUV didn&#039;t even have those features! This past August my hubby jumped on board and he sold his paid for Mini Cooper. He&#039;s been biking to work the majority of the time but this weekend he just paid $800 cash for a 2001 Honda Civic. Crazy people can keep their car payments! We&#039;ll keep paying cash and driving &quot;beaters&quot;.]]></description>

And not only with vehicles either! We as a society do this with everything as time goes on - upgrading homes, tvs, vacations, &quot;treats&quot; - you name it... In theory we should all be saving a TON since we keep earning more throughout our career, but it only seems to help people *spend* more :( &quot;Lifestyle Inflation&quot; as they call it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like your beater photo and story!  I once drove a rough car, though it taught me a bunch of things, especially regarding cars as consumption habits.  Once you start, you naturally get higher priced vehicles one after another.  Best to start at 5 grand initially!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gotta love my ten yr old corolla. Still going:P Also still looking pretty good minus a few car door dings. Bumper is all fixed up cause someone backed right into it and paid for it to get spiffied. 

Fun note. Saw a tv commercial for a Cadillac Escalade the other day. Only $799 per month to lease. What a steal!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a Chevy Impala which I still love to this day. Last year she became irreparably damaged and I let my husband convince me into replacing her with a 2014 Dodge Charger. Am I happy? Nope. Do I miss my 04 Chevy with no car payments? Heck yes! The car is in my husband&#039;s name, but I am going to try persuading him to trade it in for another gently used Impala if someone is willing to take Dorian (the charger) off our hands.]]></description>
