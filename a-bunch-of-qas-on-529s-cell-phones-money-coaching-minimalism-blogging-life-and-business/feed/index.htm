					<description><![CDATA[This post caught my attention right away. I had been debating for a while on whether to make the switch to Republic Wireless. I&#039;m about a year into this new minimalist life, and I&#039;ve been slowly adopting more and more brilliant ideas from blogs I follow, yours among them. After careful consideration, and much internal debate, I finally ditched AT&#038;T after nearly two decades. I made the switch to Republic Wireless, and my bill dropped by more than $75/month. I love it! I’m very grateful for your no nonsense approach and the wealth of information you share in your blog. And, I couldn&#039;t be happier with my decision to make the switch.]]></description>

Helluva testimonial for our community - thanks man! And remember that it TAKES ACTION to actually make it happen, so make sure to pat yourself on the back too as that&#039;s the hardest part of the game ;) No action = no point to any of this stuff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To the person asking about starting a blog, I agree do it!  Since finding J, MMM, and ERE I went from an in debt consumer sucka to a 6 figure student loan paid off, a 5 figure car loan paid off, and 10 more payments left on mortgage (a 30 year mortgage that will be paid off in 6 years.)  The value of finding average people willing to share their raw data with the world is tremendous.  It takes the fear out of investing.  Finance is a topic no one will talk about or your friends will lie about, but here you can see the truth.  I was down X% or I was up X%, let me check on J.  Oh, he was too so we&#039;re all doing pretty well riding the Index wave and picking up savings tips as we go.  These three guys have exponentialy changed my life.  We could always use more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use Tello.com for cheap cell service.  I have unlimited talk, unlimited text, and 1 GB data for 14/month.  It is easy to stay under 1 GB by utilizing wifi at any opportunity.  It seems like Republic Wireless uses this same technique.  I was even able to use my current iPhone with their service!  Their customer service is great-- super responsive and helpful.  I highly recommend them!]]></description>

Haha, yup! And if you&#039;re already taking the time to email people back, might as well amplify the productivity and share it around with others who might be wondering about the same things too. Win-win! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for all the good info -- I&#039;m sometimes tempted to answer simple questions with a LMGTFY link, but your approach is much kinder. Pretty much any financial question can be answered with a solid blog post from this awesome community.

Cheers!

Yeah, I needed a new phone and pixel 3 is supposed to have some crazy software attached to its camera.  Basically takes a decent camera photo and makes it look like you are a professional or at least know somewhat how best to take pictures. Crazy what they can do with software.  I also like the screening service for telemarketers.  Having a robot ask them to state their business is pretty cool too.  I keep my phones for 3 years so I usually buy a decent one at purchase time and $600 for a flagship phone and $200 service credit isn&#039;t bad at all.  Its like paying $400 for the phone.]]></description>
