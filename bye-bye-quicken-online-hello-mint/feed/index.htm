					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a similar problem with Mint not letting me organize tags the way I want them for the budgets I have set up.  So I have a spreadsheet &#038; am starting to play with Toshl as a way of tracking my expenses - it is on my phone &#038; I add in the item when I get my bill using whatever tags I like, and it spits it out as a spreadsheet on my computer for easy cutting &#038; pasting into the spreadsheet.  It also keeps a running tab of how much I&#039;ve spent under each tag.  Advertised as &quot;mobile expense tracking.&quot;  So far, so good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the other sites guys!  Never heard of Just Thrive before, or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://ClearCheckbook.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ClearCheckbook.com&lt;/a&gt;, but these are all great - as well as the others mentioned :)  I&#039;m sure these will help Deb and anyone else looking around!

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say go with the spreadsheets.  For me, this works the best in that when I have to manually enter all of the information, and add things up, etc., it really helps me to keep track of things more.  I&#039;d feel guilty looking over my individual purchases, and that would help me to curve my spending habits!:)

Good luck with the search!]]></description>
