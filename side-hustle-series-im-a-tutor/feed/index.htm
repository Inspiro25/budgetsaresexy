					<description><![CDATA[Hi rabia,

In my experience, my clients have preferred to have me tutor in their home. I have had a few who requested a public location, such as the library. Since you have your profiles set up, I&#039;d suggest posting an ad to craigslist consistently. There&#039;s a post on my site that can guide you through that (here&#039;s a shameless link: http://www.howtostarttutoring.com/how-to-write-a-good-craigslist-ad/).

Hope that helps!
- Paul]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First Tutors is the leading tutor matching service in the UK, and has just released its sister site in the US: http://www.firsttutors.com/usa/
Totally free for tutors to sign up on and create your own profile, and they don&#039;t force you to go through some rigorous application process! Also, as tutors deal with the clients direct, you get to keep pretty much all of your proceeds. Its already generating a lot of user interest across the US, just in need of tutors to populate it.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again Paul!  I&#039;m glad to see everyone enjoyed this as much as I did.  Even though the last thing I wanna do is tutor someone, haha... unless it has to do with blogging/building out projects - then I&#039;d totally do it!  That&#039;s just pure fun ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah - def. sounds more interesting than teaching calc ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah L&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I bet!  Most people don&#039;t go through the trouble of either DOING reviews, or asking reviews, so if all you have is GREAT ones - even just a few - it looks great!
@&lt;b&gt;John Becker&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly :)  Good addition...You make that money, you better pay them taxes!
@&lt;b&gt;Natalie @ Mango&lt;/b&gt; - YES!!!  In fact, I may need to find someone to move a piece of furniture I may buy on CL! :)  Good good idea indeed, thanks for sharing it with all of us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Paul, this is great advice. For some reason I always thought becoming a tutor must be more complicated than just posting an ad on Craigslist. But now that I think back on it, I&#039;m sure that&#039;s how my parents found us tutors growing up. This article got me thinking though-- there are probably tons of things you can do, just by placing an ad on Craigslist or a similar site, to earn some extra cash. If you have a big truck and a strong friend or two, you could help people move. You could mow lawns, do yard work, fix things around someone&#039;s house, maybe even clean houses or maintain pools if you&#039;ve got the no-how and the tools. But always be careful offering or accepting any services or products from those sites! I work for Mango Money&#039;s blog and we recently did a post about staying safe on Craigslist. Check it out, it might be helpful if you&#039;re thinking about doing something like this! http://www.mangomoney.com/blog/how-to/the-misadventures-of-a-craigslist-rookie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@John: Yeah, you&#039;re SO right! But there are a lot of tax advantages to tutoring; you can write off a lot of expenses for it. I have a few posts on the topic on my site. You can write off travel expenses, any books, magazines, or other media related to your tutoring field, as well as gifts (up to $25 per person per year).]]></description>
