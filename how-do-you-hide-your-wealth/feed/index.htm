Rock on!!!

Always hard for younger kids to &quot;catch on,&quot; and not sure really how you change that, haha...

Good for your parents for sticking to the plan though, and carving out such free time/money for y&#039;all! Not always the easiest move to make!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post!!
Especially liked the point about the small house..
When I was a teenager, my parents sold the family home and with the earnings bought a small apartment. Since I was a regular bratty 13 yr old and all my friends had huuuuge houses, I didn&#039;t understand the downgrade one bit (and I did not like it!). My mom would just tell me it was so we could &#039;live more&#039; which would only anger me more. 
Anyways, teenage tantrums aside, the fact that my parents didn&#039;t have a mortgage anymore really did allow us to live more. I went out a lot more than my &#039;richer&#039; friends and took trips I could never have imagined. Plus my family became MUCH more financially stable (which caused less fighting lol and an overall happier home)
But the most important part was the mental shift it instilled in me. I no longer grew up with the MORE MORE MORE mentality and am perfectly content in my one bedroom apartment even though i could afford something better, it allows me more quality of life for social life and travels. Plus, it becomes very easy to save money when you aren&#039;t keeping up with the Joneses :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J Money...

I loved this article. I too have tried to live by the principles you state here. Even though I have the money, I never buy new cars. I always buy cars that are a few years old and never anything that stands out. Just the run of the mill Ford Fusion.

I can also relate to the clothes with holes. My wife is always asking &quot;why do you continue to wear socks with holes, you can afford to buy new ones?&quot; HAHA I just laugh and say, I&#039;m still doing fine and it doesn&#039;t bother me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I am late to the convo - :) - but really, while I can get on board with so many of the comments - I just can&#039;t get on board with the &quot;holes in the clothes&quot; (that are worn outside of the house). 

I don&#039;t think that holes in the clothes makes someone look like they don&#039;t have wealth - I think it makes them look, well, lazy. Don&#039;t everyone yell at me at once, though, ok? :) 

I am coming from the perspective as a HR manager. I don&#039;t expect name brand, fancy clothes. I do expect clothes that are in good repair and that are well fitting. With all the clothes in the thrift shops, it is unimaginable to me that people cannot have appropriate attire that fits well without holes. 

But when I see holes - I don&#039;t immediately think someone doesn&#039;t have money. I think they are too lazy to get appropriate clothing, or that they have too low of self-esteem to believe they deserve clothes that fit without holes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed your article and can relate to the &quot;clothes with holes&quot;.

I looked at my wardrobe not too long ago and realized I had sweaters that were 10 years old that I am still wearing every year.

I have met 3 millionaires in the last 20 years and you would have never known. They drove old trucks and wore old clothes, never flaunting their wealth.

So I told myself if they can do it so can I. 

There is a lot of people around you everyday that have wealth and you will never know it!

Great site! I bookmarked it.]]></description>

This is our problem. We bought the smallest cheapest fixer upper in a desirable, rich neighborhood with low crime. Our home appraised almost $50,000 more than we paid for it a year ago just because of the location. Everyone here is wealthy except us! But when I tell people elsewhere where we live, I get the &quot;cha ching&quot; comment or &quot;I can&#039;t believe you live there!&quot;. We&#039;re very slowly fixing it up doing all the work ourselves. We&#039;re the ONLY people here that do our own yardwork (1100 homes in our subdivision) including cleaning out the gutters, caulking 3 skylights on the roof, washing our windows &#038; cars, installing GFI (can&#039;t believe there was NONE in the house), replacing some plumbing, etc. So I guess people just assume we&#039;re poor as we never hire for anything except a new HVAC system a few months ago. We drive cheap cars &#038; haven&#039;t been on vacation in years except visiting relatives, while everyone here constantly travels all over the world. We&#039;d never be able to afford living here if it weren&#039;t for the fact the prior elderly owners let the house go the past 20 years which depreciated the value. In contrast, we sold our prior home an hour away in a declining neighborhood &#038; despite the fact we did many upgrades, the location &#038; high crime made it difficult to sell &#038; we lost $$ selling it.]]></description>
