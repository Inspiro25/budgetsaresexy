Ugh, I know.... the ones avoiding debt altogether get screwed with scores because they like seeing lots of action going on! What I&#039;ve just done is left allll my credit lines opened (and jacked the max limits up high so my utilization rates look super good), and then that&#039;s pretty much it. Outside of paying $hit on time and what not... It really is a messed up way of tracking stuff, though of course the only times you need high scores is when you&#039;re about to take on debt (like a house! the biggest one!). I think you should just save it all up and then walk into closing with a briefcase full of cash :) That would be baller.]]></description>

So....I talked to a mortgage guy at a bank and he pulled my credit.  Two of my three scores came back as &quot;not enough current information to calculate a score.&quot;  Basically, they zeroed out, he said.  I had never heard of this as an outcome of having no lines of credit, loans, etc.  I thought the score just kept slowly going down.  I have not yet gotten a second opinion....and frankly I may not.  Again, blessing in disguise.  The third score was 767.  My score a year ago was 790.  790 to zero in a year. =0  I&#039;m currently working to establish and maintain healthy lines of credit to get back to (or surpass?!?!) that 790.

The thing that bothers me is I did everything right.  In order to get a good mortgage rate, I didn&#039;t open any new lines of credit.  This is what I read in every source I checked and the advice everyone gave me  - even when I said I didn&#039;t currently HAVE any lines of credit.  They said &quot;if anything, that will look good for you.  You have no debt!&quot;  Apparently not the case?]]></description>

You&#039;re the third person to mention the pressure of buying a home to me this week - why are people so adamant of pushing this stuff on us?? Weird that you&#039;re not eligible now (though not sure I know what you mean? Like for getting a good/particular mortgage?), but I&#039;m glad you&#039;re feeling relieved :) Nothing wrong with renting AT ALL if that makes you feel more comfortable and secure... Let others live their lives, and we&#039;ll live ours! The world will not end!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just got back from a 11-day Caribbean cruise, my first vacation in 3 years and the first big vacation that did NOT go on credit!  Everything cash, so yay me!  I always felt like most people do in January after getting the Christmas bills, and that is no way to feel after a vacation.  Now to plan and save for the next one.....maybe Iceland.

After attempting to do my own taxes (hahahaha! Maniacal laugh!), I outsourced them yet again and I&#039;m glad I did, because she found a mistake someone else made on *last* year&#039;s taxes and after we file and amended return, I&#039;m looking at an additional $800 back from Uncle Sam for an overfunded HSA penalty that I shouldn&#039;t have had. 

That was the good stuff.  Bad stuff: it appears I&#039;m no longer eligible for a mortgage even though I&#039;ve been doing everything right.  It&#039;s a blessing in disguise, though.  I feel like it freed up my options considerably.  I&#039;ve been under a lot of pressure to buy (buy! Buy! BUY!!) and now that I can&#039;t, well...less stress.  Shifting my search to a decent, reasonably-priced rental.

Good luck and blessings on the upcoming baby!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just excited that I paid taxes and it was way less than I thought it would be. After inheriting the farm shares and farm land I expected a crazy amount of taxes to be owed.This was also my first experience with starting to pay quarterly taxes so I just did my first payment of those. We get to put money into our Roth this year but the wife just got a new teaching job at another school district and we&#039;ll be earning 10k more a year so we&#039;ll have to wait on 2018 contributions.]]></description>

The funny thing is I was just talking with a friend last night, who does a little more speculative investing than I, who basically did the same thing with Facebook stock. I just stick with my Wealthfront index funds, myself. I know I can&#039;t beat the market (cryptos aside lol).]]></description>

Depth Year - yes!! Killer article and mentality!

Interestingly enough I actually DO feel like I&#039;m still going down that path since Budgets Are Sexy is still my only major project going on (and coin collecting my only main hobby), but you&#039;re right that I/we like to dabble around in life despite trying to keep the blinders on :) I feel like if you&#039;re chasing stuff that you&#039;re super interested/passionate about though and don&#039;t *overdo* it (i.e. add stress to your life) then it can still fit in nicely w/ depth years... You can&#039;t just focus on one thing with every waking hour :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Second Cubert - you still have loads of $hit going on! I think I learned about the Raptitude Depth Year article from your site... and I was like &quot;YES! That makes SO MUCH SENSE&quot;. 
1 month later, I&#039;m like &quot;also, this year I should start a blog, learn Spanish, and DO ALL THE THINGS&quot;.
It&#039;s tough for hustlers to slow down, I guess ;)]]></description>

Ugh yeah - people are crazy man... If only they knew how much EASIER it was just to start saving and investing regularly!! They could have all the $$$$ they want if they just start now and stay patient!

I do like that you keep cashing out in waves to lock in initial investment, then profit, etc... Very smart way to do things :)]]></description>
