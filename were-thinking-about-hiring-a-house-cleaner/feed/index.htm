I&#039;ve had a roomba for about 2 yrs now.  It doesn&#039;t completely eliminate the need to sweep/vacuum with an actual broom/vacuum cleaner every once in awhile, but it has drastically reduced the amount of times that I need to do it.  I have wood floors through most of the house, and then carpet here in my office.  I also have 3 cats and a husband in here.  I mostly just sweep the wood floors sometimes before I clean those with the wood floor cleaner so I don&#039;t grind anything into the cleaning cloth and floor (or if roomba misses any cat food pieces that Senior Kitty decides to share with the floor).  Yes, you will have to empty the bin/shake out the filter every night, and occasionally you will need to remove any hair that may have wrapped around the end of the rollers, but it&#039;s really not that bad.  My husband and I both have long hair and don&#039;t seem to have a real problem with that.  I like to walk around barefoot, and I CANNOT STAND stuff sticking to my feet.  Roombas may not be as perfect as I would like them to be, but looking back overall, I would still buy it again.  The positives are still outweighing the negatives (especially with 3 cats). We do need to pick up certain cat toys so they don&#039;t get caught in the roomba, though (soft mice toys).  You might need to think about the same with certain small kid toys if they will be in the same room.  I can&#039;t speak from experience there.  Best of luck with your decisions.  I&#039;ve struggled with the thought of getting a house cleaner again, myself.  I had one for about a year when I traveled all the time for work, and it was nice to come back to a place that wasn&#039;t trashed every weekend.  Like you, I have both qualitative and quantitative hang ups to going back to it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You do not have to decide this now. You can wait for the kid(s) and try to do it yourself. If you then get the feeling you can not handle it, go for help.
Maybe you will realise, that cleaning is no problem, but something else is difficult for you. Then you look for help in that field.
Until then you save the money. The money gives you options at times when you really need them. 
Wait and see what comes the way.]]></description>

Glad to hear you have similar thoughts. I&#039;ll be sure to do a follow-up post with experiences and stuff after we give it a try :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading this, because I frequently consider a cleaner. Some of my concerns are as you or others mention. For one, our household needs a general daily maid vs a periodic cleaner, which isn’t practical. Second, I’m particular and would be concerned about potential damage, due to processes, cleaning solutions, furniture dings from vacuum, etc. 
I recently bought a robovac, but unless floors are picked up, it can’t vacuum.
I live with a husband and sons who don’t value cleaning, so it’s hard to enlist their help.
My solution is to do it myself, and reward myself. If your family helps, you could reward your family, which would be fun!]]></description>

This might sound weird, but I kind of like doing our own laundry... Monotonous tasks help me zone out sometimes -- folding, sorting, and organizing helps me relax. Sometimes kitchen cleaning, too. So having someone do the rest of the house is perfect :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have had every other week service going on 12 years. We aren&#039;t lazy. We are working and building our lives. There is still plenty to do, especially since adding two kids to the mix. Growing up our mothers stayed home and oversaw such tasks. 

When at least one if us retires we might scale back that service.

I don&#039;t care how much it costs....it is so worth it to just not have to scrub toilets and clean bathrooms. You still have to clean the kitchen daily and do laundry.]]></description>

Forget the roomba with pets, you&#039;ll spend more time cleaning and removing hair from the roomba wheels than you gain time. Roombas are great if there&#039;s only a little dust, not hair]]></description>
