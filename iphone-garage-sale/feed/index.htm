					<description><![CDATA[Wow - thanks for this post.  I hadn&#039;t heard of this site yet.  While I don&#039;t have an iPhone, I do have a yard sale planned for this summer and see that I can post it here for free.  Then everyone with an iPhone and this app can come buy all of our stuff!!!]]></description>

All the work is done for us.  Now all we need is for each sale to be able to log onto a website, show pictures of their wares and then we won&#039;t even have to waste the time driving around only to find they had nothing we wanted anyway.
