					<description><![CDATA[I read long out of print books on Google books. Currently, I&#039;m reading Dante&#039;s Inferno but it&#039;s on a screen. The rest goes to savings and paying down debt :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good post. I think we should be able to find a balance to see what works with our tastes and preferences. I think sometimes the habits/behaviors that gets us in trouble needs to change in order to see a positive impact. Sometimes what feels right is not necessarily the wisest choice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I wonder how that&#039;ll look on you! Send me a pic sometime? I always dreamed of growing it out as a kid (I wanted that surfer type hair!) but my mom never let me... Then as I got older I couldn&#039;t get past the mid-way point and just gave up, haha... so I&#039;ll have to do w/ the &#039;hawk :)]]></description>

Haha... good eye ;) They&#039;re a few older pennies, a half dollar w/ a whole in the ear (so weird?), and then a handful of quarters from 1983. I read somewhere that they go for a hefty premium over other dates for some reason (up to $10+ each depending on quality!) so to separate them out from your change/collection and then sell in batches on eBay :) I&#039;m not sure I want to spend the time doing all that, but I&#039;m at least putting them aside for now in case I change my mind... Just don&#039;t get why they&#039;re worth so much more?? It&#039;s not like they&#039;re rare.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lol I had to comment when I saw something about a haircut. I haven&#039;t cut my hair in 6 months. I&#039;m growing it very long. This is polarizing because I&#039;ve never had long hair in my life.

The way I see it is simple. Hate it or love it, they have to learn to live with it. My hair is gonna get long!]]></description>
