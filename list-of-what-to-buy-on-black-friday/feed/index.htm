					<description><![CDATA[I am going hiking in the mountains on Friday. Not even going to be in the &quot;civilization&quot;. I have no desire to buy anything. Literally have all I need and want, even though I am considered a minimalist by many standards. All I do is buy a bag of coffee from a local coffee roaster every holiday (their holiday blend is unique) because I love their coffee and also to support a local business, with a young owner. The whole bag is $13 and it lasts me a good 3 months to use all of the coffee. So that is my big purchase for year end.
Happy Thanksgiving J$]]></description>

I saw a line the other day in front of the Apple store, literally 20 minutes before the store would even open. This is last week, way before black friday. I have Apple stock and I was cheering for the store to open sooner so they can go buy the whole store hopefully. :)))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was going to say you should specify CDs = Certificates of Deposits rather than Compact Discs, but do people even use compact discs any more?

Oh, and that &quot;I love spreadsheets&quot; mug is &quot;Currently unavailable&quot; and Amazon says &quot;We don&#039;t know when or if this item will be back in stock.&quot; :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My personal addendum: Take advantage of the deals to buy gifts and much needed warm clothes for kids who won&#039;t get anything this holiday season! That and getting PiC an electric shaver to replace the one that broke last year :)  

But we do all our shopping online and I&#039;ve already pre-scouted the stuff and deals so that hopefully on the day of, I just have to click through to buy and then warm things will go off to kiddies who need them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Will I get slammed if I buy something in November/Black Friday that has been on my watch list for months (or years), and it is suddenly on sale?  As an example, my computer speakers have issues.  (scratchy and drop outs where I have to smack the puck controller to get the sound back).  Replacement ones I&#039;d been eyeing dropped 33% this week.  It&#039;s clearly not an impulse buy, but I could live without it.  (As I have been living with these crummy speakers for years) On the other hand, I can afford it, and it is a huge sale.   

In the end, I hemmed and hawed long enough, that they sold out.   :)  So problem solved, but the general question remains.  Should I feel bad about taking advantage of the sales to get a few things that have been on my someday maybe list for ever?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m spending eighty bucks this Friday... on a fishing charter with friends at 7:30am out of Chesapeake Beach, for striped bass. It&#039;s been my Black Friday tradition since 2012. I&#039;ll likely come away with ten or fifteen pounds of straight-outta-the-water fillets, so it&#039;s a surprisingly good deal on tasty fish! If you&#039;re ever interested, what with being in the DMV and all, it&#039;s a good time. 

Well, it&#039;s also cold, and early, and sometimes a little bumpy, but nothing tastes better than a beer at 9am after you&#039;ve reeled in the first catch of the day.]]></description>
