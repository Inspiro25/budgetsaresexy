Yup! Although you can surround yourself with people that more align to your values/lifestyle and such which would help. Can&#039;t pick your family though - hah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All these methods are used by marketing companies to get us to give us their money!!!!! Once you lean what methods work then you can start combatting them. The best method so far for me is to stop and reflect before I buy something. If I really need it or if its an impulse buy motivated by outside factors. 

Admittedly I&#039;ve used the first tactic before to suck in people for a charity bake sale I&#039;ve done before. Giving away free samples really opened up people and brought them over to buy things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well... I don&#039;t know about the Benjamin Franklin story, but you just motivated me to start getting up at 5h am on weekdays (so 1h before the kids) to do a workout and shower.  This is what I need to change in MY life, to start taking better care of my health.  And thanks for the link to the Ted talk, it&#039;s interesting.]]></description>

Very creepy how we&#039;re being bombarded more or less continuously by attempts to manipulate our thoughts and behavior. No way to avoid it unless you want to live like the Unabomber.
