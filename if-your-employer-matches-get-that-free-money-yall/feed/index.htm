This is exactly how I view it. That match isn&#039;t just free money, it&#039;s YOUR money. They earmarked it for you. If you don&#039;t take it its the same as willingly giving back a few percent of your salary to the company. The company gets a discount on your services.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The line of thinking that this is &quot;free money&quot; has always bothered me.  Its not free money, its part of your total compensation package.  You best believe your employer is paying you 4-5% less to account for the match.  I choose of think of it less as free money and more as not letting my employer get away with paying me less...  You don&#039;t take your match, they get a 4-5% discount on you.]]></description>

Congrats on being debt free Chris and taking advantage of the 401k!!  I think everyone wishes they started earlier -- myself included!

Good point on the &quot;catch up&quot; contributions. Hand for those who started late, but also great for older people with high incomes who can lower their taxable income a bit more. Cheers!]]></description>
