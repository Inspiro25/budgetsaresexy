Hey, cool!!!

I totally fizzled out after a while (womp womp) but would love to get back to it again... You&#039;re right about those time limits though - much better odds of accomplishing them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made a 101 in 1001 list, which is *kind of* similar, in that you set up 101 goals/dreams for yourself that you want to accomplish over the next 1,001 days (which is about 2.75 years). What I like about it is that it gives a deadline, which  my personality type totally needs :)

To get to 101 things, I found it was easiest for me to set up categories (books, finances, family life, travel, etc.), and then I brainstormed several ideas under each. Some things were small and easily accomplished (open up savings accounts for the kids), and others are huge and taking months and months (get to 100% fluency in French on Duolingo). 

I love reading other people&#039;s dream lists, so make sure you post the whole list when you have it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting list and it reminds me of one that I had created a few years back (in my 20-s with no financial awareness per se). I am somehow unable to locate it but 2 of the things which stood out were:
1. A diamond ring for myself when I started earning - I made it happen about 6 years back, an year after I started earning.
2. A big beautiful book rack full of the best books ever - I have a small book rack now but sadly not the will to spend on books that I may or may not read multiple times.
Most of my other goals on the bucket list were travel and adventure oriented. 
You are right about how the pointers on it keep evolving and this post has inspired me to start a new list with all the travel, financial, career and relationship goals that I might find relevant now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the article last week when I saw it on rockstarfinance. I&#039;ve been thinking about what I&#039;d want to put on my list ever since. Haven&#039;t gotten to the point of writing any of it down yet, tho. 
I didn&#039;t know you were interested in meditation, though I was thinking it sounded like something you&#039;d like since you&#039;ve been talking about the Ben Franklin mornings. I recently read a book that really got me interested in it, and I think you might really like it. It&#039;s called &quot;10% Happier&quot; by Dan Harris.]]></description>

glad you&#039;ve started one!

you start coming up with a lot more smaller (and fun ones) too as you get going... I haven&#039;t kept mine in my pocket as often as I wanted to yet, but I do keep looking at it and smile every time :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! Writing 100 things is really challenging. But, it&#039;s really worth it once done. I have to do this and see my version of this. Thank you J Money for this idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great!  I&#039;ve started by listing 17 items immediately.  I think the smaller goals might not jump to mind so quickly.  As I would imagine would be true for many, mine thus far fall into a few categories; financial goals (pay off mortgage before xx/xx/xxxx), travel (plan a trip with best friend), self-improvement (study languages).  I think it will be fun to give some thought to the more one-off types of things (like your &quot;take the first flight out&quot; goal).  

I also like the idea of jotting down some of those things already accomplished.  It&#039;s good to take stock and appreciate the opportunities you have taken.]]></description>
