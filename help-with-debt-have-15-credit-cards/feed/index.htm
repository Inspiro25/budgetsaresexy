					<description><![CDATA[I think its really great (and also kind of scary) to put yourself out there like this! Bravo. All of us have had junk and debt we have to pay back. I personally have 6 figures of student loan debt, so we are working hard to knock that out! I can&#039;t wait to read more about your journey and I hope you rock it out!
Best,

					<description><![CDATA[Work it, bro!  I think that&#039;s an excellent idea - it def. helps with motivation :) People will say to go with the route that financially makes more sense with the numbers, but ultimately you have to do whatever feels the best for you in your situation.  And I tend to go w/ the smaller snowball route too over the factually correct way cuz it makes me more excited.... I&#039;m currently doing that right now w/ our home mortgages - I&#039;m paying the smaller one off first, which has the lowest interest, and then I&#039;ll tackle the bigger one.  Gotta do what&#039;s best for you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok so good news and bad news. The bad news is I still have 15 credit cards. The good news is my count was off and I only owe $25,000. So that&#039;s good. My smallest is $230, my largest is $9000.  I&#039;m going to start with the snowball method and get rid of the smallest ones first. I will be visiting the various websites posted and making sure I have all the best possible methods to achieve this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Reader, 

I envy your guts for getting that much credit cards and car loans without sufficient thinking of their effects to your finances. It is high-time that you make necessary changes in your lifestyle to pay off your debts. Why do you need two cars? Is it possible to sell one or both cars and get a second-hand car instead? I suggest that you also need to spend less and look for additional sources of income to pay off your credit cards one at a time.]]></description>
