Agreed... there are many professional people out there. Like you say, you have a lot going on. Most people just have a regular job though.

Filing taxes should be a simple process. You earn $$$, you pay % (the same for everyone). If you make a lot of $$$$$, you will end up paying $$$. No deductions, no exceptions....just my humble opinion...to make it easy for everyone.]]></description>

That would be a class that&#039;s actually useful!

I love having an accountant and wouldn&#039;t change it for the world to be honest with you (she&#039;s always saving me $$$, answering all my billion questions, AND saves me hours of wanting to punch myself in the face), but then again I always have a ton going on more than just a W2... I feel like as long as they&#039;re being filed *correctly* AND you&#039;re getting max savings from it, then you&#039;re good whichever way you go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hahaha...I still don&#039;t understand why people pay a company or someone else to prepare their taxes. Especially if all they have is W2. There should be a class in high school where teenagers learn how to prepare taxes for themselves and their families when they have kids...IMHO.

I know people that pay hundreds of dollars for this. That&#039;s ridiculous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We just filed our taxes a day ago. It&#039;s my 45th year straight that we didn&#039;t owe and didnt get any refund. Well, we do owe like $100ish to Uncle Sam but close enough.

Good luck to all who are still working on their tax returns. Lucky for those proscrastinators for you got additional days to get your taxes done.]]></description>
