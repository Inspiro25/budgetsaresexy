					<description><![CDATA[J just wanted to stop by and let you know how much I love the blog, been on this journey a few months myself now and feel like Neo waking up from the Matrix!

Knowledge is there but the discipline has been lacking and been living like Cypher telling Morpheus to shove his red-pill up his proverbial. 

No more - Thank you for your input!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is cool.  You mentioned in another post that financial bloggers get a lot of truly hit wrenching emails, like suicide threats, so I&#039;m very glad you get awesome notes like these too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yay!!! You&#039;ve inspired so many to keep going to financial independence!!! Pretty amazing to see it put into words. From three different types of people too! Shows how similar we all are rather than how different. Thanks J$! Keep it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great read!

Keeping a positive outlook is the hardest thing for me because I am so impatient!!!!!
I don&#039;t mind all the extra work but I want the end results now!!!
But filling in the free time has been interesting. Gained a lot more knowledge. Been reading tons more. Selling things like crazy. Stole a giraffe.

You know all the normal things to fill time and gain more insight towards the future of being debt free!!!!
