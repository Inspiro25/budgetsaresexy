					<description><![CDATA[I started bartending at a restaurant a couple of weeks into my first job because my job was so boring.  In high school I worked at a pizza place pouring beer and wine.  Even though I didn&#039;t know alot about bartending the owner hired me because I was honest.  There were no blenders behind the bar so it was only beer, wine and mixed drinks.  The hours were great since the full time bartender required both Friday and Saturday nights plus one other each week.  I had the weekends off to visit my girlfriend who was still in college in a different state.  I watched the waitstaff to see how they worked.  Some were good some were very bad.  I was actually allowed to wait tables if they needed someone on the weekend.  Waiting tables and bartending is hard work if done right.  My girlfriend, now wife, would check the list to see who was up next to see if we were ready to sit.  I tip very well if you are good because of all the work/personality that goes into it.  Clare, you sound like a person I would tip 20 - 25 - 30% depending on the event. (Valentines Day, Birthday)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fabulous post, Clare. I also have a lot of respect for people in service jobs. Waitressing is just one of a long list of thankless part-time jobs I had over the years to help me get by. I still got into debt, but it could have been much worse if I hadn&#039;t take initiative and gotten jobs. 

I&#039;m thinking about posting about my brief stint as a night security person in the dorms when I was a busy undergrad who didn&#039;t have time for any other job ... given me food for thought, J Money. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a lot of respect for servers; I know how much they work. That&#039;s why I always leave a good tip - figure 20% and then round up to the nearest $5 (nearest $1 if it was a small bill).  That said, I know that I wouldn&#039;t be able to hack it - among other things, I&#039;m too much of an introvert to have to deal with people for that long.]]></description>
