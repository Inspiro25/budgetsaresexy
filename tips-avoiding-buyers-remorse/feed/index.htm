					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - SOLD!!! Haha... that&#039;s exactly what I, or my wife, would use it for too ;)  I think it&#039;s going on our list!
@&lt;b&gt;Heather M.&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah I can&#039;t buy clothes online for that reason too.  Even though I always get tricked by Woot&#039;s &quot;shirt of the day&quot; and then remember when I go to put it on that their shirts never fit well :(  Harumph.
@&lt;b&gt;Kris&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh that&#039;s a good idea.  Once a week shopping!  I&#039;d go nutso if I REALLY wanted something though, haha... glad you found something that works for you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a list of the things I need (and a few things I want) with me all of the time. If it&#039;s not on the list, I don&#039;t buy it. If I feel like I need it and I can also afford it, I&#039;ll put it on the list when I get home. I only go out once a week to buy things like groceries and run errands, so any new items usually sit on the list at least a week before any purchase. Most of the time I realize that I can do without whatever it was anyway and delete it. 

Another thing that helps is to keep my stuff organized. If I know what I already have, I&#039;m less likely to think I need more of something when I really don&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need to do this more often.  My problem is, if I buy something off the internet (which I rarely do), if the clothes don&#039;t quite fit, for me it&#039;s more of a hassle to find time after work to return the item and potentially pay for shipping, then to just live with something that doesn&#039;t quite fit or if the shoes are little too big.

But when I&#039;m in a store, I really need to start doing this practice.  &quot;Will I be really upset if the shirt rips, shrinks in the washer, if it gets lost, etc?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m loving the iPad! It hasn&#039;t really *replaced* my phone or my laptop or books or magazines, but it&#039;s a really great supplement to them. I&#039;d say I mostly use it for reading stuff, like blogs. I used to wake up every morning and spend 15 or 20 minutes laying in bed reading news and blogs on my phone, and this makes SUCH a difference. Especially something like the Flipboard app. I&#039;m also getting really into magazines on the iPad. It&#039;s the perfect format for them, and you usually get a lot of cool extras. (The Wired for iPad version is pretty awesome.)

I also find it handy for treating as like, a little mini boombox, if I want to listen to music away from my stereo. Or to watch movies/Netflix on when I&#039;m travelling without a laptop. 

Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, yeah that #3 is hardcore!  Haha... that would eliminate almost every single thing! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - AWWW CONGRATS!!!! That is SO. COOOOOOL.  And we&#039;re one of the first to know - yayyy!!!  Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to say my wife&#039;s pregnant too one of these days :)  CONGRATS!!
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, not enjoying shopping is GREAT for your wallet!  Haha... that is awesome :)  (though I&#039;d def. miss it myself -- I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s so fun, but it is to me!)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - What the heck is wrong w/ that kitchen table?  Haha.. I have NEVER heard of that one before, wow... maybe someone was trying to play a prank on someone and forgot to screw them all back in tightly? ;)  Either way, hopefully no on ever got hurt!  I hear ya on the &quot;not buying&quot; struggles too, that&#039;s stressful.  It took me like 3 weeks to finally buy my new backpack (had option overload!) and then when I did, I found a different one I liked much better and was then stuck with 2.  (one was final sale only).  Oh well, it happens every now and then ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sherie&lt;/b&gt; - I like that one a lot :)  Though wouldn&#039;t work for me cuz I arely dust, haha... (bad, I know.)
@&lt;b&gt;Mike - Saving Money Today&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s true.  But it&#039;s too &quot;big&quot; for me that it wouldn&#039;t work, personally.  I know it does for others though.
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - I like it!  Improving your quality of life is HUGE for sure, that is an excellent way of looking at things, thanks for sharing it :)
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Huh.  That&#039;s weird cuz for me, it&#039;s getting HARDER for me to decide as time goes on... maybe cuz I know &quot;too many&quot; variables?  Back in the day I either wanted something or I didn&#039;t - it was super easy for me to decide, whether I had the money or not.  Now that I have the money, it&#039;s like it&#039;s geting harder or something... hopefully it&#039;s just a phase though.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - I can dig that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks!  I think so too :)  You&#039;d like her a lot if you ever met her in real life.
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that doesn&#039;t help me when I already have everything I need though ;)  Sometimes I like to go shopping with &quot;wants&quot; on the mind instead, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh I like that idea!  Cuz if there&#039;s nothing else you&#039;d WANT w/ that money, then yeah - it seems like it would be a good choice!  Good one :)  How do you like your iPad so far?  (I&#039;m thinking of getting the Mrs. one in the future - she&#039;s always studying in bed and this would make that soooo much easier for her!)
@&lt;b&gt;myloverswife&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah. It&#039;s funny the things we do to convince ourselves of things ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Bergie Powers&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  We&#039;re actually in the market for a new sofa ;)  We sold our old one on craigstlist and now we are couch-less down here in our basement! Haha... I thought it would be a lot easier to find one that we wanted - oh well... at least 1/2 of the mission is gone ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nell&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yup!  We are very similar, my friend :)  Sometimes I feel like people are staring at me weird when I do that stuff, but in the end it&#039;s always the best way about it.  Sometimes carrying things around for a bit helps you get rid of that &quot;excited&quot; phase enough to put it back down.  And if not, then at least I know I like the thing!  Guess we all have our methods :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha!  I thought I was the only one that had serious buyer&#039;s remorse.  As I&#039;ve gotten older (I&#039;m 25 now), I&#039;ve realized that material things aren&#039;t as satisfying as they used to be, but sometimes I get a sudden urge to buy things.  I do have a weird pattern when I shop though--I&#039;ll pick up all the things that I like as I&#039;m browsing around the store and as I get towards the end of this, I go into a little corner (lol) and go through what I&#039;ve picked out.  Usually from this, I can think about what I already have at home, the price tag, etc.  After doing all of this, I&#039;ve dwindled my purchases down to 1-2, but oftentimes I leave with nothing.  This is a bit time consuming, but I feel that it helps when I get those sudden urges to buy things.  Other times, I will sort of &quot;stalk&quot; a item--keep my eye on it for a couple of weeks to see if the price decreases.  At this point, usually the item is marked down, or I just end up forgetting about (which means I don&#039;t spend any money!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome idea. I will have to try this one. I like how you can find someone&#039;s tactic and make it your own, like how rearranging the question to be about returns worked for you. 
Daisy, I love your comment above  about how many hours of work it takes to pay for a desired item (two weeks for a new sofa?! I&#039;ll just get a slip cover).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My approach is very much like your mother&#039;s concept. I ask myself if I really love the item and if the answer is no, I pass on the purchase. I used to think that I could buy it and return I later, but 9 times out of 10 I would find a way to convince myself to keep the purchase. My new love it or leave approach saves time and money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also do the &quot;how many hours of work will this cost me&quot; tactic, and  it works great! I like your mom&#039;s method, too, but I feel like for me, it would only really work on the smaller items. Like, it&#039;d be great to hold up a shirt and think, &quot;If this disappeared from my closet after a week, would I be really upset?&quot; But when you consider larger purchases, I mean, the answer will almost always be &quot;heck yes I&#039;m upset!&quot; because then you&#039;re out all that money. I find it hard imagining myself getting &quot;upset&quot; about the prospect of losing an item that I haven&#039;t yet developed any sort of attachment to. 

Another thing I do that&#039;s really helpful is to try to imagine the other things I could do with the money I&#039;m considering spending, and then deciding whether or not I want that item more. So, when I bought an iPad earlier this year, I hemmed and hawed for a long time before I actually bought it, and I considered, &quot;Well, what else can I do with this $600? Is an iPad worth losing $600 that could potentially go to this?&quot; I decided that I *did* want the iPad that badly, but I find this method is really effective for a lot of things. Oftentimes I DO want to put the money into savings more than I want the thing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A long time ago a friend was shopping with me when she asked me if I &#039;wanted&#039; or &#039;needed&#039; whatever I was going to buy.  Ever since then, I practice want or need when buying.

However, I really like the idea of expounding on that to ask additionally if it broke, how upset would I be?

Great idea.
