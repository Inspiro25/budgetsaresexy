					<description><![CDATA[This is an incredibly inspiring journey—congratulations on hitting the $1 million milestone!  Tracking your net worth so diligently over the years is not just motivating; it’s a masterclass in persistence and focus.

One thing I appreciate is how you’ve emphasized the accountability and reflection aspects of tracking. That monthly pause to review your numbers is such an underrated practice. It&#039;s a reminder to not just set goals but to continually engage with them.

Also, your point about fees in retirement accounts is golden. For anyone who hasn&#039;t done this yet, running a fee analysis could be an eye-opener. The potential savings could easily redirect more money back into your net worth growth.]]></description>

Hey Angie!  Yeah I think just monthly manual tracking is the way to go for now. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there a system or a way to be able to easily account for balances that can&#039;t be connected to Mint/Personal capital?

For example, I have some money in real estate syndications and some money in NFTs that can&#039;t be connected/updated to my Mint account.

I guess the best way to do this is just to do a monthly accounting to see where you&#039;re at with those unconnected accounts?]]></description>

Cool, thanks for sharing. J$ uses personal Capital every day - I use Mint for budget tracking as well as manual spreadsheets to back-up all the raw data.  So cool to see all the new tools out there today that are helping people get into the right habits. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on the $1M milestone! It&#039;s pretty cool to see a precise net worth calculation (down to the penny!) going back for over a decade.

Do you track your monthly spending with the same attention to detail? My personal experience with using a budget / net worth tracker to track my spending is that it&#039;s a lot of work to set up and maintain. Often, I simply want to be able to search my past purchases and see how much I&#039;m spending, without setting a budget.

Ended up building a tool called Fion (fion.co) to search my past transactions, across all my cards, and actually see how I&#039;m spending money. It&#039;s more insightful than a basic &quot;tracker&quot; app when I want to look up a specific purchase and much easier than following a strict &quot;zero-balance&quot; budgeting methodology. Already making better spending decisions with it.]]></description>
