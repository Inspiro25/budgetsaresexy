					<description><![CDATA[Haha, you are not alone, J Money.  I would definitely trade chocolate bar for that as well. 

Now my son is just starting to talk. When he is a bit older, I can only imagine all the interesting conversations we&#039;ll have.

And, thanks for the book recommendation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is precisely how I set up my business. I started it while working FT elsewhere. The business does not pay me yet, but it allows me to dabble and see that I really like doing it. I have the safety net of other money coming in while I build this up properly. I also get the satisfaction of knowing I&#039;m a business owner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do agree...don&#039;t get too excited to leave your day job just to pursue entrepreneurship. Enjoy the best of both worlds for now! What&#039;s important is that you won&#039;t get bankrupt so it&#039;s better to prepare yourself with enough savings once it&#039;s time to give up on that day job and work on your startup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hahahaha This was a great read.  I love kids&#039; perceptions about adulting.  And then you become an adult and miss the care-free days of childhood.  I completely agree with your perspective that the freedom of our choices as an adult can be a great thing if we recognize the power in it.   I am in my early thirties and it makes me sad when I hear that so many of my friends haven&#039;t even thought about retirement, are in over their heads with debt, and have no plans to change things.  As long as they get their fancy vacation every couple months they are content.  My family has made the choice to be debt free and to learn everything we can about DIY investing to save for our future.  We still travel a couple times a year, but I am truly stoked about what our possibilities will be when we retire.  Our choices today will give us the freedom to do whatever we want in our retirement later!]]></description>

YES!!! EXACTLY!!!!

We all hurry up to get older and become adults, when everything we actually wanted/enjoy was sitting there right in front of us the entire time! Oh well... guess we just gotta work harder to become &quot;free&quot; again so we can go back to the good ol&#039; days. The whole point of FIRE, eh?]]></description>
