I called it &quot;Ramen Resentment.&quot;  People feel like you just didn&#039;t eat enough Ramen to deserve where you are.

However, kudos from going to nothing to hanging on to something and admitting mistakes you made along the way.  2 years ago, I inherited the same amount from my father as did my four siblings.  I was so torn about how to honor him and just not wanting to spend it (it meant accepting the loss) that I finally bought a condo that I rent out.  To me, my dad wanted me to have safety with that money, and I know that to him, knowing I had a paid off place to live would be the safest.  I don&#039;t live in it because I couldn&#039;t afford the area I want to live in, so I rent a much less nice apartment in a better area:-)

I think my siblings bought fancy cars:-)  Oh well.

Anyway,  lots of people blow inheritances, especially after being poor for a long time.  I was reading the blog of the guy (can&#039;t remember the name) who retired at 33.  His first money lesson was a blown inheritance before he got his financial life together.]]></description>

Bar Harbor was fantastic. I hope it&#039;s not another 14 years before we get back there. There was plenty of hiking and plenty of lobster sprinkled with the occasional reading of &quot;$$$ blogs&quot;. Now it&#039;s back to the real world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not only do I love reading other people&#039;s stories and seeing where they&#039;re at in comparison to the rest of us normal people, but I love seeing the different spreadsheets being used to give me ideas on my own. I look forward to the next iteration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All of them are great stories and shows that we come from different backgrounds and find various ways to build your net worth.  Really like the couple who was living in a trailer then sold it and ended living at someone&#039;s poolhouse. Talk about various ways to live, that is pretty unique right there. Like it!]]></description>

YUP! 100% agree on all accounts! I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s such a sticky point online, but it is... At least in the forums and comment sections of bigger media sites. You&#039;ll def find more logic/civil discussions in the blogging community which is at least good :)]]></description>

I think that resentment for so-called &quot;cheating&quot; comes from the &quot;self-made-man&quot; ethos. We did pay off 80% of our debt before the inheritance sped up the last 20%, and I felt what Financial Samurai said in his article (which I hadn&#039;t read - thanks) was true: &quot;The only reason why you’d be ashamed of inheriting your parent’s or grandparent’s money is if you DISHONOR their money by spending it frivolously on stupid things.&quot; There is a gratitude and peace in knowing we have honoured the givers of this gift. On a separate note, shouldn&#039;t the online pf community discuss inheritances simply for the sake of being prepared to use them wisely and to be prepared for the potential pitfalls of estates, etc.?]]></description>
