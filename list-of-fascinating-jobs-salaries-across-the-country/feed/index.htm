I would imagine? Or maybe a couple different routes a week so you don&#039;t have to do them all at once? I bet some machines sell out faster than others too...]]></description>

The vending machine operator job is super intriguing. I agree it&#039;s not really passive but it&#039;s probably not a 40hour a week job either. How often does he refill machines? Once a week at the most?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m always fascinated by these sorts of reads.  I can&#039;t believe how lowly paid our teachers are and that the Vice President of the United States makes so little compared to what executives make at even small to medium corporations.  I guess that&#039;s why they call it public service!  Anyhow, thanks for the info.  It was a good read, as always.]]></description>

True true - nothing is ever 100% passive - but it&#039;s certainly more so than other more hands-on gigs. And especially 9-5s :) I used to call my blog a passive one too until I realized I was spending 40 hrs a week on it and it certainly wasn&#039;t, haha... Now I cringe whenever I hear that!]]></description>

yeah dude, def. got to know yourself well enough to opt out of college and go on our own :) I don&#039;t think the old me would have been good at it (too lazy and needed to be told what to do!), but the new me with what I know now would certainly have been fine without the degree. We all know you don&#039;t need one to start a blog or social media account, lol... But it did get me on the path, so no regrets whatsoever (and the degree is nice to fall back on if ever needed as well, which feels good).

I bet that coder in your family has seen a lot!! internet/computers have changed so much in the past 20 years! We&#039;re all really the first beta testers as it&#039;s still fairly young, all things considered :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t calling vending a passive business.  You still have to procure and stock the machines as well as maintain them.  Jamie is a fun watch, but so far, from what I have seen, he hasn&#039;t had too many breakdowns in his machines, and has been working during a fairly booming economy.  I will be interested to see how his business evolves with the current situation.  From what I can tell most of his machines are in locations that could possibly be shut down for the time being, which could lead to spoilage on some snacks.

That being said, I have thought about doing vending for a while, but where I live the good locations are taken by large groups or are for sale for insane prices (at least until some one get desperate to sell).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A lot of people think that having a college degree is required to make it big but two of my family members have proved that to be false. One became an insurance agent and opened his own business before selling it. The other started learning to code in the early 2000&#039;s and works for a small tech firm and makes almost 200k a year now. No degrees. 
I would still go to college if I had to do it all over again because I am that kind of person, but I do think more people should go into the trades instead of getting useless degrees that don&#039;t lead to a well paying career. Now I&#039;m just trying to get to the point where I don&#039;t have to work in a cubicle. Sounds like you are all set J Money.]]></description>
