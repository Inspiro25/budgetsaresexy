6 MONTH UPDATE: One of the best decisions we&#039;ve made :) Kids absolutely love it for fort building and couch jumping (despite us outlawing it!), and then we love it for a comfy place to put our legs as it&#039;s so big that it basically gives our couch another chaise lounge on that side of it.  The only downside is that it&#039;s one more thing to clean, haha...]]></description>

True true... Only problem is that you don&#039;t always *know* how long it&#039;ll take to fight, and once you get going its harder to quit and &quot;give in&quot; :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry for your trouble. It doesn&#039;t seem like all the anxiety, time and effort you put out was worth $150.  Not sure what I would have done in your situation but I probably would have given up a lot earlier and just bought the ottoman. If it was what I really wanted anyway, the peace of mind of not fighting with them and my time taken away from my life would have been worth the $150 eventually saved.]]></description>

Dang!!!

We thought of hauling the 1/2 couch back to them too in a worst case scenario, but thankfully we never got to that point :)

Too funny you&#039;ll still shop there though!! That&#039;s knowing yourself real well, haha... Eventually you&#039;ll catch on to all their tricks! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have such a hard time with Ashley. Their prices are excellent and the furniture is great quality. But we’ve had issues like this with every single order. Items have shown up damaged every time. They’ve had to ship us pieces or new ones. The first salesman was super upfront. But the second time we received a dishonest response about their return policy. Apparently they consider rugs a home accessory - no returns. But we asked the sales person if it could be returned or exchanged before buying and he said yes. The rug arrived and I HATED it so I wanted to exchange it. I followed the same steps you did on email and social media with no response and got the run around trying to call the store. I was so fed up i had my husband come with me and we carried it right back in to the store itself. I think they were so shocked that they didn’t know what else to do but let us exchange it. (Then that rug got back ordered and then discontinued and no one told us. So 8 weeks later, after multiple calls to follow up and another visit to the store, they finally gave us our money back and we bought one from Lowe’s.) 

We say we won’t buy from Ashley again but I’m sure we will. The quality, prices and style are too good. We are just factoring the hassle, run around and god awful customer service into the value.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You did what I would have done and did resulting in free flooring for half my home! Had a bit of luck that they messed up an invoice. I will tell the story below but always persist with them and fight your corner. 

So I buy a new house and get flooring for all of it through one place. I set up a zero percent credit on it and think great! 2 days later I get a call that they had issues with their system and I have to go in and re do everything. Not ideal but hey ho. 

So 3 weeks pass and we move in and the filters come with the carpet.... but where are the hard wood floors and laminates? Call them up and they weren’t on the amended order. So we argue a little bit about where the hell half my flooring is. Anyway turns out i hadn’t paid for them but they were on my invoice, which was handwritten in paper without a final price. So as it was going to take an additional 3 weeks to get them and they were at fault for messing up the payment I get half my flooring for free!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any customer-service issue I see nowadays gets my attention because I&#039;m still dealing with a store that sounds kinda like Gnome Repo. Why these places can&#039;t simply offer a one-stop for any and all purchase issues is beyond me. I spent nearly an hour and a half yesterday talking to the appliance manufacturer, the store, AND the delivery service -- all separate. First they delivered an appliance that appeared not to be working after it was installed. They sent the delivery crew back to pick up that one (it took about 2 weeks due to Thanksgiving) and replace it with a new one. The new one worked while the delivery guys were here -- we asked them to stick around. Five minutes, I kid you not, after they left, we were confronted with exactly the same issue. I blew my top -- told them I never wanted to deal with them or their appliances again, just come and pick the stupid thing up. After them telling me repeatedly that if we didn&#039;t like the appliance we would have to bring it back ourselves, they went silent. In the silent interim, my voice of reason (also known as my husband) came up with another possible solution. We had bought an extended warranty and that put us in a different customer category, apparently. More phone calls and finally the manufacturer put us in touch with a local appliance service, which agreed to come and fix at no charge the specific issue we&#039;d been dealing with. Great. They came, they saw, they said no-can-do because the problem appeared to involve our electrical outlet, which was out of their purview. I asked a local friend to recommend an electrician. Some guys came out, charged us a modest amount for a house call and proceeded to spend a lot of time looking at our breaker panel and yelling to each other about what their voltage meter said. Whatever the reason, we discovered that when all was said and done, our appliance was working properly. Except -- except, a key accessory had not been connected, and we were seeing some results that were less than optimal and would have to be addressed. Still, the appliance was finally working the way we had expected it to. Just in time for the delivery service to tell us they were all set to pick up our appliance today. I had forgotten all about my call telling them we didn&#039;t want it anymore. Someone&#039;s conscience had finally gotten through; they had arranged for our appliance to be picked up and hauled away. Except now we wanted to keep it. All we really wanted, since we are under warranty, was for someone with a couple of working brain cells to come to our house and do the simple job of connecting an accessory that would give us optimal performance. That&#039;s what I spent an hour and a half on the phone for yesterday. The store, the manufacturer, the delivery service, back to the manufacturer, even the extended-warranty company...finally back to Gnome Repo, who scheduled an actual REPAIR service to come out and install this simple accessory. Could we have installed it ourselves? Maybe; maybe not. Not exactly our forte. Better for an expert to do it. So now we wait, just over a week. Persistence pays, yes, but why can&#039;t there just be a one-stop shop, instead of the CUSTOMER having to call a myriad of separate phone numbers, spend a ridiculous amount of time on hold, explain, re-explain and re- re- re-explain everything to everyone, each of whom will come up with some strange new question to throw into the mix? Like you, J, the persistence did pay off and (knock wood, it ain&#039;t over yet), we&#039;ll have things the way we need them to be and all this will be a distant memory. Enjoy your furniture -- you EARNED it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have worked in retail environments for a long time and my take on this is the salesperson was not well trained and honestly didn&#039;t know that the ottoman was not included with the rest of the stuff. It&#039;s possible he was lying to make a sale but that kind of behavior is relatively rare and it is a lot more common that these low-paid employees are just not very well trained. Lots of times they throw them on the sales floor when they are brand new. He definitely should have gotten his manager involved at the time of the sale to make sure though. Anyway I think you handled it great and I think the manager did the best he could with what the store policies likely are for &quot;exceptions&quot; like this. The sales employee probably changed their story so many times to avoid getting in trouble, having their pay docked or even getting fired ... that kind of stuff totally happens in retail all the time.]]></description>
