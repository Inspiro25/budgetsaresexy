YES!! That&#039;s what home ownership does to you - it ties you down and sucks the military life right out of you! Haha... One of the biggest cons no one likes to mention when you&#039;re thinking of buying a home ;) It&#039;s def. not for everyone!

Maybe you can rent it out and go move somewhere else like we&#039;re doing? It&#039;s not as optimal as selling and cutting ties once and for all, but it&#039;ll get you out the door finally. And maybe it&#039;ll turn into a nice little investment over time too :)]]></description>

Too bad it&#039;s not Richmond--we&#039;d be neighbours when I visited my parents at home! :) 

I bought my tshirt at the Richmond airport...not sure where else they are sold, but I&#039;d bet there&#039;s an online shop somewheres!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I hear you on the urge to move once you&#039;ve lived the military lifestyle.  My whole (Army brat) childhood I thought I&#039;d just want to stay put once I had the choice, but I&#039;ve owned this house for three years and I want SO badly to go somewhere new without this dang house tying me down!  If the rental market weren&#039;t so dismal here I&#039;d totally copy you.]]></description>

There ya go!  You&#039;re on it!  :)  Yeah, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re higher than the 50K/yr...I&#039;m closer to the 20K, so it works out GREAT for us...especially since we&#039;re a one-income family of five.  ;)  And, yes, it is STATE only...but those savings help us survive the federal hit we always take.  

Best of luck in the move!!  It&#039;s gonna be a whirlwind but you&#039;ll be glad you went through it all in the end.  ;)]]></description>

Answer: it&#039;s hard and drives you crazy, but it&#039;s also fun and full of adventure :) we pretty much started with like 5 cities all across the country and then visited some and cut others out based on actual odds of it happening near term. Which really helped out and got it down to only 2 states. For example, we REALLY want to move to California, but too many variables for it to work out on *this* move if we wanted to do it this summer. So we crossed it out and moved it to &quot;future moves&quot; to look into - which isn&#039;t as depressing.

I&#039;d start by taking road trips and hanging with family/friends that live there and then see what happens :) some places are WAY different (good or bad) in person than online for sure.  Good luck!]]></description>
