Weird that only one side of your face is allergic?!

Once half of my face started going numb after drinking a pepsi on a plane - was so strange!! Lasted about 30 mins and then went away and never happened again. (And I&#039;ve never tried Pepsi again either, haha...)]]></description>

Hi Christine--if the pricey item lasts a while, that makes it more &quot;acceptable&quot; in terms of budgeting :P 

Cystic acne on the face is one of the worst afflictions (like.........why??????). I did try USDA-organic raw honey a few times as a face wash, which was quite relaxing. 

I hope that other brand you try works out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this! I have to admit I do have one pricey item in my skincare routine, a $45 little bottle for cystic acne. I went through a similar experience like you where I didn&#039;t have acne much as a teen, then in my late 20&#039;s I started getting adult acne. Nasty cystic acne. I tried so many products, but in the end I&#039;m doing my best to minimize the products I&#039;m using and the amount of chemicals. Honey for face wash is really great(good for acne and it&#039;s tasty if you accidentally get it in your mouth. Unfortunately I still need that pricey little bottle, but I&#039;m seeing if another brand that&#039;s significantly cheaper will work. Fingers crossed!]]></description>

Thanks for sharing those detailed tips with lots of information on how the chemicals function in different types of climate :) Everyone&#039;s skin is different and can react to any chemical that&#039;s on the ingredient list, and change at different ages or stages of our lives too. It makes narrowing the potential chemical culprit down more difficult, which is why less can really be more!]]></description>

Hi Kate--cool to hear! Sensitive skin on the face is on its own level of horror, but I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve found some basic products that work. It is quite mind-boggling how the cost of these products can add up over the years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When it comes to skin care people can be very different.  We offer a ton of different skin care products with different chemicals in them in this country but we don&#039;t do a great job with consumer education (for obvious reason).  In a past life when I used to work for two different companies selling cosmetics/skincare, etc I preferred to advise customers dealing with acne to only change one or two things in their own regime at the most (and that less can be more).  More importantly, having an high level idea as to the cause of your acne helps.  Benzoyl Peroxide is better at helping acne caused by bacteria and salicylic acid is better at helping acne caused by dead skin cells clogging the pores.  I&#039;ve always dealt with oily, acnegenic skin (and I&#039;m closer to 40 than 30).  Benzoyl peroxide worked better for me when I lived in S. Fl since the heat and humidity level meant that you were basically always sweating (a great bacteria breeding grown).  When I moved to NC my skin started peeling and burning during the first winter since the air is so dry here.  I had been using benzoyl peroxide with success for almost ten years, but had to switch to salicylic acid since dead skin cells became more of the cause of my acne in this environment (it&#039;s been about 14yrs now).  I will say if you do have to use one of these items, definitely make sure not to get cleansers or moisturizers that will irritate your skin when combined with the cleanser.  Rough scrubs and harsh chemicals will only dry out your sebaceous glands, which will cause them to overreact and produce more oil in response.  Much like the author, most of my skin care routine does not cost very much. Also note that your skin has different needs in the winter vs the summer, so you may need a more gentle cleanser in the winter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Me too! I&#039;m a basic product woman also! I&#039;m super alergic on the left side of my face only (weird!) and can only use basic products on my face like Aveeno and Cetaphil. You know if it comes in a 500ml pump pack it&#039;s gonna be good value! I think I&#039;ve &quot;saved&quot; thousands over the years on not buying the fancy stuff!]]></description>
