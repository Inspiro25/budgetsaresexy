					<description><![CDATA[That was a really motivating read! But it&#039;s so true. I truly believe that if you hang out with great people that greatness rubs off on you. You begin to think great. Rohn is correct. Nice job Mr.Joel.]]></description>

Yep! Funny how fear of loss holds us back from things.

Learning about real estate investing was scary for me too...  I remember the first in-person meeting I went too, I felt so awkward I just found all the other new people there and talked to them all night. After 2-3 meet-ups I realized the only way I&#039;ll really learn is to talk to people who have actually invested in real estate! haha. Changing crowds changed my direction big time.]]></description>

Great to hear Lisa! Me too - I&#039;m all about self improvement blogs and stuff I read. Not gonna lie, sometimes it gets overwhelming and my mind craves some garbage... But for the most part I try to consume good content :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It applies to so many aspects of life. When I started playing tennis, I just wanted to play with the people who I was comfortable and familiar with. I didn&#039;t grew a lick at all. 

It was mostly the fear that I might not be as good as I think I am if I started playing with the people who were better than me. I didn&#039;t realize it at the time but I was terrified of losing badly. I should have been willing to lose badly cause that&#039;s when I can figure out how to grow the most.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well--nobody... I need to learn to surf! I heard that Jim Rohn quote and it stuck with me. No need to cut out good friends or anything, but it has definitely led me to be more deliberate about seeking out interesting people to spend my time with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great Monday Morning Read!

That is why I have stayed off face book &#038; limited tv news time!  We are so programmed to run on others emotions because of what we currently are seeing.  Getting to the point that I enjoy reading  blogs with meaning for a better me or world.  I have to say I have been reading this site for 10ish years and certainly feel that it has had a positive influence.

Love the picture....I just see freedom!]]></description>
