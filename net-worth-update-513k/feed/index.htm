So glad they&#039;re helping, man :) It&#039;s scary sometimes/lately to do them publicly cuz our cash reserves keep dipping, but we push on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though the markets were relatively flat, it still was a good month for you! Love seeing your reports! They always inspire me to put mine up too! Love being able to look back and see what happened and have that track record! Plus, it is always nice to motivate myself to try to do better each month!

I&#039;m sure with that new match, you will see that account grow quite quickly too! Congrats!]]></description>

Haven&#039;t read it yet but heard of it :) I&#039;m guessing it says to focus on income income INCOME as nothing else matters? And that you&#039;ll never become rich working for anyone else?

I&#039;ll put it on my list, but I prefer to focus on *lifestyle* and financial freedom than trying to become a millionaire just for the sake of being a millionaire. My old self would have loved it though! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J,

You&#039;re doing great, keep up the good work. Mine&#039;s tracking upwards ;)

Wondering - do you do book reviews? Have you read or would you like to read The Millionaire fastlane - MJ DeMarco?

It flies in the face at what i have been subscribing to for a few years now. Also critical of a couple of books that changed a lot for me back in 2013 when my plans really got started, According to this chap, im pretty much in the slow lane. Just wondered what your thoughts  are? Where you at with this?

Best of luck, keep rocking ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats to your wife!  The great thing about the TSP is the G fund which never goes down in value.  That way you can park all your money in a safe place if you aren&#039;t comfortable with where the market is going.  When not in G, the S and I funds are the way to go.  The L Funds are for those who don&#039;t check their accounts very often and have no interest in investing.  I don&#039;t think that applies to you ha!]]></description>

I started from the very beginning - and I plan to read them all!!

RE: 401(k) - Who gives them bad raps? I love &#039;em! I sock away money each month and my company matches 100% up to 8% (4% of which is fully vested immediately, the other 4% after 3 years - been here a little over a year), and I don&#039;t even miss it. Plus, like you, it led me to blogs, and podcasts! And perhaps an MSFE, too!

RE: KBB - Conservative, check!

RE: Include all investments, check!

I agree; I just gotta do what&#039;s best for me. Plus, I&#039;m only using net worth as a guideline for my goals and to make sure I&#039;m not making terrible life choices. Just a measure of my overall financial health, if you will.

Thanks for all of the advice!! I greatly appreciate it! :D]]></description>
