					<description><![CDATA[I took a 25-year house mortgage of 260K and paid off in just 4 years paying only 21K total with interest.
How I did it? During the four years that I&#039;m paying for my house, I stopped eating and drinking coffee outside, and did not go on vacation, stopped paying for a house cleaner, I do it myself instead. Anything I need to buy has to be on sale, or I won&#039;t buy it. I kept my wardrobe for 4 years and did not buy new clothes ( I don&#039;t really need to ). I share my car with my friend from work to save on gas. Doing all that and more, I was able to pay 10% more each year to my mortgage which is 35K direct to the principal. 
Very happy with myself and now I&#039;m learning how to invest in the stock market and my goal is to generate a substantial income for my golden age:))-]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J-Money, if you can track down Samantha Z., let her know that Coinstar has an option with no fee if you get paid in a gift card. Amazon is one of the options and at this point an Amazon gift card is basically cash money ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man, being &quot;nice&quot; totally makes sense. This actually reminds me of a coworker who constantly goes around to just say hi. At times I&#039;m thinking he&#039;s going to ask for a favor, but he&#039;s only stopping by to say hi.

I&#039;m betting my coworker has seen his salary increase! I&#039;ll definitely start being more out there with people. Not for the money, but for the feeling I&#039;ll get for making people&#039;s day.]]></description>
