I&#039;ve heard that about coffee grounds!

Straws help reduce teeth staining ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My baby is also starting to kiss! So sweet!

Other good things: my sister is getting married soon and the whole family (I have 4 sibs) will be reunited. 

On the straw thing...what about getting a pack of metal straws? I don&#039;t drink coffee with a straw but I&#039;ve heard that&#039;s much better for your enamel. So maybe you can harness your habit for good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What the heck is a Panera ? I make coffee at home, and put in a thermal mug. Saves me 2.00 a day and I don&#039;t have to recycle anything, and don&#039;t have to wait to get a coffee. Never Heard of drinking coffee with a straw? Straws are for milk shakes.

Coffee grounds make excellent mushroom compost.

cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One really good thing about this week is that I stumbled onto your site through an article on Business Insider, cannot even remember the exact article though... was browsing for setting up my next career as I have recently been laid off after 10 years at the same firm.  And I am not going back into the business world, I&#039;m going to be self-employed from here on out!  Since I&#039;ve been looking at your site, I&#039;ve been totally re-inspired this week.  Turned myself around, I&#039;m feeling noticeably better about everything.  I knew my next move was going to be a great one but now I&#039;m acting on it.  Thanks J. Money! #OneGoodThing]]></description>
