					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I think perhaps Urban Outfitters is just too cool for me, anyway. Though their skirts always fit me well for work, because I&#039;m very, very short. I think they&#039;re meant to be mini skirts but they come pretty close to my knees. 

The sales tax thing is also another reason I LOVE free shipping deals. Because I&#039;m Canadian, if I order something from an American retailer, I don&#039;t have to pay any sales tax. Which is awesome, because tax in Ontario is 13%. A lot of times, even if I do have to pay shipping, it still ends up being cheaper to order online than to go to a store and buy it in Canada.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Determined definitely.  I&#039;ve been to Dick&#039;s Sporting Goods 5 times in the past two weeks to look at a certain backpack I want for my trip to Denver.  Not a special trip to the store, but since I&#039;ve been in the area already, I go in and check it again for price and to make sure i still like it.  I do this same thing for everything over $20.

For some reason, nobody wants to take me shopping.  Wonder why?  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s not a bad way to go, brotha.  What do you do when there IS no free shipping though?  I can&#039;t imagine every product you ever want is like that? (Or is that when you just go buy it in stores then?)
@&lt;b&gt;Andrew&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! I like it.  For some reason I NEVER think about sales tax online at all.... in fact, I don&#039;t even know if I pay it or not whenever I order? Guess it depends on where I shop, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, HUGE fan of coupon codes.  Esp @ Go Daddy ;)  Buyin 7 domains in 7 days def. starts adding up for me! Haha... #Addict
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Well you&#039;re smarter than I am sometimes ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, me too :)  Once I want something there&#039;s rarely anything stopping me from getting it.  Luckily, though, I don&#039;t usually want many things in general.
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice...  And you just reminded me - I need to return a few shirts at Urban Outfitters!  They *never* fit me right for some reason, drives me crazy... yet I always forget when I&#039;m shopping there :(
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, trying things on are important in my books (see comment response above, haha...).  I&#039;m starting to become a HUGE Amazon shopper too which usually isn&#039;t my style.  But since I&#039;ve been blogging and get referral $ sometimes from them, it&#039;s like a free shopping trip all the time! :)  (even though I spend way too many hours on this blog making it happen, haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Gotta go where your money stretches further!
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Really?  Gonna go over and check it out in a few :)
@&lt;b&gt;Christine&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like that :)  I need to get better about wish lists actually though so that whenever anyone asks me what I want for my birthday or Xmas, I can actually tell them!  My brain has turned into mush over the years and I cannot remember anything for the life of me... even stuff I want! (well, plus I usually buy it all anyways, but there are def. those items that we always like but could never bring ourselves to buy.  I leave those for present time which makes it even more exciting :)  when I remember &#039;em..)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I rarely get free shopping... I need to get better about that.
@&lt;b&gt;BoeshaneHR&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you should send them a friendly note so they can take your money better! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Not a bad skillset to have :)]]></description>
