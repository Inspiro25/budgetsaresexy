Oh wow - def. an older post! Haha... Sorry to hear you&#039;re in this situation though - def. not fun :( you&#039;ve def. got the right idea being on $$$ blogs though!! that&#039;s completely changed my finances around and great for helping stay motivated. I&#039;m not sure *how* you found yourself in the bankruptcy scenario, but step #1 would be to pin point what got you there so you can fix/watch out for for future. Lots of people have gotten out of bankruptcy only to go back in, so if you can plug that spot you&#039;ll be well on your way! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there. I know this is an old post, but I searched for the subject of bankruptcy after finding your blog about 6 months ago. Unfortunately, I&#039;m filing for bankruptcy myself, and am actually looking for a guide on what I should do afterwards to keep from falling back into the same situation. Single income, already know that I&#039;m living in an apartment that is way over 1/3 of my income and will be looking for something cheaper once my lease is up, just now learning bout budgeting thanks to your blog. With this being a college town, it&#039;s going to be difficult unless I move outside of the city proper.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting that you felt were able to bring up this point because I&#039;ve seen the other side of the devestation debt can bring into a person&#039;s life.  It&#039;s so annoying when people behave as you protrayed because it definitely gives the wrong impression to all those who suffer in debt and in a lot, if not the majority, of cases through no fault of their own.

Jason&#039;s comment above is not untypical and having just about survived the last recession, and wrote a book about it, I totally feel for him and his wife.  Desperation is making him talk like that and unless you have been in the situation, most people can have no idea of how it feels.  It&#039;s devesting for everyone in that position but it is not the end.

He knows how to make comments, so believe me he can make money online within a couple of months at the latest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh no!!!!  I hope you&#039;re not talking about your lives here :(  I can&#039;t imagine what you two are going through, but living is the one thing we all have right now!  Can&#039;t take that away - and you guys have each other to lean on :)

Maybe you can find a group at church or your local community center?  There are TON of support groups out there in almost all cities and developments, that would be the first place I&#039;d look.  And of course, poking around all our blogs online would be certain to find you someone in a similar situation.  Each of our sites offer a different spin and background, and there are PLENTY in debt believe me.

Keep on searching around my friends, you&#039;re bound to come across a helpful group! :)  And if you&#039;re religious (or even if you&#039;re not) try praying! It may seem lame to those who don&#039;t believe, but I really think they help.  I shall shoot you over some myself as soon as I hit submit :)  You guys will be fine!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not all who file bankruptcy are irresponsible. My husband and I are being forced to file bankruptcy because a business we were in was destroyed by a bank and a con artist attorney. We are losing everything we owned because we were set up and scammed. Not only are we destroyed financially, but many of our coworkers, friends and associates have lost their jobs as well, and are unable to find work.
Our vehicles and even our lawnmower has been taken.  We are driving a 25 year old car loaned to us by a friend.  
I would like to hear from others who have gone through such scams and con games and have been beaten to a pulp.  How they feel, what do to get through the day, and whether it is even possible for two 68 year old retirees with nothing left to survive? At this point, we have been through so much hell, so many lawyers that play paper games and then require more money, and so many promises that are never met, that we are thinking the only thing left to do is to simply end it all.  If either of us get sick with a major illness, that will be the only choice left.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People&#039;s spending habits are way out of sync. It doesn&#039;t help that pop culture portrays &quot;wealth&quot; as &quot;having money to blow&quot;. People spend all their money on flash even if they can&#039;t afford it, but stuff of substance gets left out.

Reading &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; should be mandatory, lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugh.  This reminds me of a time I loaned a (now ex-) friend over $500.  It was the day before her rent was due, she&#039;d just kicked her alcoholic husband out, her mother (and only stable family member) had died six months earlier and she was fearing eviction.  I told her to take the money and pay her rent--but it was right before Christmas so she ended up using a chunk of it to buy presents for her two little girls.  I can understand not wanting to let down kids, but what six year-old needs an iPod shuffle?  Especially when you&#039;re applying for food stamps?

Unbelievable.]]></description>
