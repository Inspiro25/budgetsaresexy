Super interesting!!

Reminds me of our post the other week when I discovered people spend real life money on digital money in video games :) Had no idea how prevalent that was!

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got one I&#039;m fairly proud of, although it&#039;s over the course of a year rather than a weekend - when I was a freshman in high school (which was 2003), I started playing a text-based online game called Hyperiums (it&#039;s still active, www.hyperiums.com), and played actively up until 2011 or so (once I began working full time I wasn&#039;t able to commit the required activity to really succeed).

The game was technically free to play, but if you wanted full accessability, you had to purchase in-game credits at a rate of ~$4/credit (the price fluctuated some over the years), which gave you 3 months of full access play.  However, you could also buy extra credits and sell them for in-game cash, if you were so inclined, to give yourself a leg up (to then buy more resources, fleets, etc.).

Well, at my peak during college I was ranked in the top 50-100 of maybe 1000 active players, and I had the resources to do the opposite; I bought the credits folk were selling for in-game cash, and sold them via paypal for less than $4 (sometimes as low as $2, sometimes as high as $3.50), sometimes dozens at a time (My in-game cash was also needed to maintain my level, so I wasn&#039;t able to constantly buy and sell)...my best earning year was my sophomore year in college (2007-2008), when I pulled in ~$2400 in a 12 month period...on the whole I&#039;d probably say I made $4000-$5000 before I quit (at that time, I couldn&#039;t put in enough hours to be any good, which meant no more being able to buy credits...the game also declined in popularity shortly thereafter).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What fun stories! I used to make pretty great money working the bar at weekend parties over long weekends. I was a collage student at the time and did part time waitressing during the week and these gigs were big money earners at the time. We would start super early in the day, set up the bar, work our butts off serving drinks, then shut the bar down and clean And I had so much fun! I could listen to the DJs and have a dance whilst I worked and I loved the teamwork and the sense of satisfaction at the end of the day. Those days are long gone now. Like 20 years gone and, literally, the other side of the planet gone! Now I identify with Suzy. I work hard during the week in my paid job, and my non paid community service work, and love my weekends with my husband and dog exploring the parks and cooking or going out for a meal with friends.]]></description>
