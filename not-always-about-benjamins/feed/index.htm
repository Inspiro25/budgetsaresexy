I liked that article of yours :) I always think about mowing lawns and earning money outdoors when I&#039;m doing my own. But then whenever I run the numbers and try to make it worth it I usually stop thinking about it, haha... So great you were able to actually do well!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great conclusion, Tonya, with both not taking the job and not undervaluing yourself.  It seemed restrictive to future opportunities - glad you made that call!]]></description>

I think we&#039;re on to something here. Personal finance bloggers should start writing for The Onion.  Financial advice under the veil of satire.  The defences of the typical consumer would be completely flanked. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha, I was one of the ones who said you should take it! I do get your logic and I totally understand after turning down a low paying gig myself recently. It&#039;s good to value what you&#039;re worth and be in a place where you can turn down work. I&#039;m sure the right thing will come along or it won&#039;t and you&#039;ll know you&#039;re already in the right place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Early in my career, I had a former colleague contact me and ask me to quote some consulting work for him and his new company. At the time I had done very little consulting work and I was having a hard time coming up with what I thought was a proper valuation for my time and skill set. I also wanted to cut him a break from a price standpoint because of our relationship. 
When I came back with the quote he gave me a great piece of advice that I have remembered to this day. He said &quot;I appreciate that you are trying to cut me a break on the price, but if I go back to our board with this number they are going to think you are charging less because you are unqualified or inexperienced.&quot; It was a wakeup call that companies will infer things about your ability and experience based on what you charge in relation to others in your industry. Sometimes when you try to be competitive in pricing you can actually be doing yourself a disservice and lose jobs because of it.]]></description>
