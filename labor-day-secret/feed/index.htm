					<description><![CDATA[We canceled our cable last May and the monthly bill went from $185 to $62 (for internet only). We can&#039;t be happier - kids don&#039;t really miss the TV programs and they go out more; hubby is trying to get me subscribe the basic cable so he can watch the games...the answer is, &quot;well, what are you willing to trade off?&quot;
Like you said, we didn&#039;t die and the extra $123/mo gained went to our savings.  I wish we had done this sooner..]]></description>

I agree. I have watched more movies since I disconnected my cable than when I used to have it. I have read more books too in the same time period since I sold my TV all together. I know people who rush home at a certain time of the evening just to catch a certain show. I really can&#039;t wrap my brain around it. Before I retired, I had a staff member that used to watch &quot;Amazing Race&quot; and would come and ask if she could go home early on the evenings that the show aired so she would have time to pick up dinner and get to her show on time! 
I really feel you are doing your teenagers a favor by giving them the chance to consciously choose what they watch.]]></description>

I totally hear you. There are so many options that I am never short of movies or documentaries to watch. I also feel I have control over what I want to watch. Once I cut the cable I stopped making evening dates with a specific channel just because they wanted to show me a certain program at a certain time of the evening. I go do what I need to do, walk in the park till sun goes down during summer, and live my life, then when I feel like watching something I do it on my own time.
I wish just like you I didn&#039;t have cable since I was a kid. It really is not a necessity. Not even a little bit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the dark side my friend. Glad to hear you took the leap. We&#039;ve been without cable for about five years and don&#039;t miss it one bit. 

And, with $1,200 per year saved, we can fly to an additional fun destination for &quot;free&quot; each year ;). Ok, we&#039;d do it anyway, but still...]]></description>

Nice! I&#039;m considering upping ours from 75 to 150 w/ Comcast too actually which is cheaper than Verizon, but still more than $100 that we&#039;re paying now for 75. Just can&#039;t stomach the idea of calling up another company anytime soon haha...]]></description>
