					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Sandy&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... You&#039;ll be up in the plus in no time, I&#039;ve got faith in you :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - I bet it moves back up later though - your post was pretty dope.
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - Huh. Well, after reading this article I guess it&#039;s not that surprising then, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;The Financial Planner&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m sure a lot of people look at it that way too :) Although in some cases I don&#039;t necessarily think it goes hand in hand. Take doctors for instance - would you trust one that chain smokes? They know how dumb it is more than anyone, but does that mean they&#039;d influence YOU to smoke more or give you bad advice just beause he/she does it?  Could relate to finances too. Some people are better managing other people&#039;s money because they can take the emotion out of it, whereas whe it&#039;s our own it gets trickier. All interesting things to think about either way though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bret @ Hope to Prosper&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s just crazy how fast pensions have gone out of style in careers, ya know? just a couple of decades ago they were all the rage!
@&lt;b&gt;becca&lt;/b&gt; - I totally agree - you&#039;re allowed to do anything you want with your money, ESP if you&#039;ve got millions in the bank! :) I don&#039;t know how morality plays into it all (are you saying it&#039;s bad to make tons of money?), but the Obamas are def. gonna be well off no matter what they do with their hard earned dollars for the rest of their lives. As they should be - they&#039;ve been killing it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, the folks in the Kiplinger article assuming that the rule of thumb &quot;a couple this young needs to have 40% in stocks&quot; is applicable to the Obamas is just crazytalk. While the majority of couples around their ages have many earning years left and need the boost from compound interest working in their favor in their retirement accounts, the Obamas might well decide they don&#039;t want to make much money in the future. If they stopped working come January and never made another dime, they could be perfectly comfortable (former presidents all make 150k/year in pension, so even if they had zero net worth today they&#039;d be better off than 89% of American households). 
Once you&#039;ve made 4 million, you&#039;ve earned the right to DECIDE what &#039;mismanaging&#039; your money means to you. Didn&#039;t it ever occur to some of you that there might be some MORAL (not just political) reason to not be a greedy sack of manure?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that looking at the candidates&#039; personal finances is very insightful and relevant for the upcoming election. The economy and the national debt are core issue for many voters. While the finances of a country are far more complex than any individual&#039;s finances, the principles are very similar. For example, in both cases spending more than you earn leads to debt.

If someone has mismanaged his own finances, what tells us that he will do a better job with the finances of the country?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I heard somewhere that Biden was actually one of the only senators that didn&#039;t have a net worth over $1 million.  He was the poorest in his profession.  I don&#039;t know where I heard that though so don&#039;t quote me...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - I think a lot of industries are hit when elections come up - I&#039;d totally believe it :)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... thought you&#039;d like that one ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - I know right? They def. believe in education!
@&lt;b&gt;Pauline&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you never know ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo! Hello there, friend! Though it looks like now you have a competitor by the name of Dave Manuel trying to beat you out - uh ohs!
@&lt;b&gt;Emily @ evolvingPF&lt;/b&gt; - Huh. Hadn&#039;t thought about that actually, perhaps? I guess it could be a lot of things considering they&#039;re getting up their in age... They&#039;ve had a lot of time to take loans out for stuff :)
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - I was too!
@&lt;b&gt;Lisa&lt;/b&gt; - Hmmm... you may have a point there. Maybe I should then add other stuff into my net worth too, like the value left on my years left to work and/or other properties that I could sell at any given point like this blog? :)
@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - I guess just to stop finance bloggers like us talking about them! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;David Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - I won&#039;t comment on that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;frugalredneck&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man if it were all gold bars that would be CRAZY!!! Haha... I think Romney has a TON in gold and silver actually, but probably the right amounts due to his massive worth.
@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - Maybe not for long though if you keep at it! :)]]></description>
