					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m concerned with the downside risk. I&#039;m less focused on what I would be able to do once I have money, and more focused on what I&#039;m currently unable to because I don&#039;t. There is no one thing I want to do with the money I hope to save; but plenty I know I won&#039;t be able to do without it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely need money so we can buy a house, go on vacations, pay off student debt and just have enough for extracurricular activities. I never really had the opportunity to make lots of dinero; hubby and I are hoping we can do so now with our new company. After switching careers and not working for two years and a half, I was able to find my first job. The pay was so-so but it was better than making zero dollars. Unfortunately, I felt the job was damaging my confidence and I just didn&#039;t feel comfortable there anymore. I decided to give my two weeks notice and interestingly enough, bosslady decided to tell me not to return one week and a half in.

We wish the money would come quick enough but it does take time. We probably will break even in the next few years.]]></description>

Yup! Exactly. I have A.D.H.D. too (without being on meds - that intensifies things! Haha...) and I agree it&#039;s all about changing the use of time towards something that excites you and you&#039;re passionate about over stuff you &quot;have to do&quot; for money. We&#039;ll all reach that point at some time, but those who hustle hard now will be chilling there quicker ;)]]></description>

Haha... At least you KNOW that it&#039;s all a phase too - that&#039;s where a lot of people get stuck. Thinking that it&#039;ll &quot;be this way&quot; forever. It rarely is, for both the good and the bad. And I share your exact same mindset - hustle our asses off now and reap the rewards for years and years to come! Gotta work hard while we&#039;re young and nubile ;)]]></description>
