					<description><![CDATA[Yayyy!!! haha... that&#039;s great you&#039;re on top of this now girl!  I think we all agree we wish we could learn a lot earlier in our lifetimes.  Not sure how exactly since as kids we couldn&#039;t care less, but there&#039;s gotta be a way! Right?  Right ;)

Thanks for sharing with us, I hope you stay around and continue participating my new friend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whhhhhyyyy don&#039;t they teach this in high school or college as some type of prerequisite??!!! :( (What do I have to do to make that happen?!) Especially for 1st generation americans with parents who aren&#039;t proper examples of mentoring proper habits on saving and managing a credit card. It could of saved me from falling victim to all these bad habits! From 2006 (the year i graduated college) till now!

#1... I irresponsibly used my credit card in a similar fashion and used the cash as &quot;free money&quot; when I was working for commission. Bad Idea indeed! 

#7....right now i&#039;m stumped because I feel like I am not making enough to put aside money for an IRA account since I&#039;m paying for my debts related to #1. 

#9....2 years flew by fast with me not looking at my credit card statements because of my bad habit in relation to #1 and not working a job at all for a period of time. 

#10....I totally keep my receipts and note on my bank statements connected to mint.com to keep a reference on what I spent my money on whether it was for $1 for water with my debit card when i don&#039;t have cash in my pocket or $5 for a few groceries or $10 for a doctors visit etc.....

#11..... Unfortunately my company does not offer 401k!!! :/......I&#039;m searching for a new opportunity but I need this current job!

#16 &#038; 19...$100 is realistic as part of an emergency fund but when I live paycheck to paycheck its tough to maintain an emergency fund.

Right now I&#039;m working on getting a certification that with lead to a raise but I am definitely not planning to stick to my currnet job because of the lack of benefits! I&#039;ll leave once I securely find something better! 

Thank you so much for passing along this email J Money! &#060;3.... I am happy to have found it through the ING Direct page in Facebook. It&#039;s reinforced my need to pay more attention on my expenses while I resolve my debts. 

Many Blessings and Much Success to you

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not entirely sure what living pay check to pay check is. I have savings, but I don&#039;t use it. I usually put about 60% of my pay in there and live off the rest. I rarely buy anything I don&#039;t need and generally live like a hermit. And the number of dates this year is equal to the number of credit cards I have in my wallet: 0.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The annual &quot;shoe budget&quot; versus savings budget is brilliant. Ha ha! That point alone may inspire a post on my little blog.

Cheers,

					<description><![CDATA[$5k saved on a $34k salary - that&#039;s impressive!  Well done :)  And I agree that the 40% rent/mortgage rule is a lot harder to do in certain areas of the country (or world even).  My ratio used to be around 65-70% when I first moved to the DC area - freakin&#039; crazy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I spend 42% of my income on rent. I used to pay way less for rent but sadly where I live rent is high.  I used to live in a cheaper building.  It does not take long to grow weary of the CONSTANT visits to the building by the police department, noisy neighbors, ineffective building staff and the constant smell of marijuana. 

It&#039;s real easy to preach &quot;don&#039;t spend more than 40% on housing&quot;  but for those who are single (i.e. responsible for all costs) and make a modest salary, it&#039;s not really a choice. And frankly, at age 43 I have no interest in roommates.   

BTW, I do put 10% into a retirement fund and I have saved almost $5K in one year.  I make  $34K (Canadian) a year.]]></description>
