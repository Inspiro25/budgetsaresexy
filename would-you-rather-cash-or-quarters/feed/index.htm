					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/would-you-rather-cash-or-quarters/#comment-83633&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt;.

So I know this post is ancient, but actually, you&#039;re not allowed to take rolled coins as payment because so many people were rolling a bar of steel and add a few nickels and quarters to each end, and trying to pay like that. OR if they weren&#039;t that sneaky, they&#039;d only roll 38 quarters instead of 40, shorting my drawer $.50. Across three rolls, that&#039;s $1.50, and if my drawer was short it came out of my check. If my drawer was short three times across the lifetime of my employment, I lost my job.

I love you, promise, but your rolled coins are SO NOT worth my job... So, what I always did was to say, &quot;I&#039;m so sorry, but I&#039;m going to have to ask you to break your beautiful roll and make sure I count this correctly -- again -- I know, but if I don&#039;t, my boss will have a fit!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d pass on the quarters even though I&#039;d be out the extra $5000!  Stores are really irked when you count out a lot of coin.  The convenience of Dollars far out weighs the extra amount.  Even banks look cross ways at you when you turn coins in for bills.

I&#039;d jump for joy with the bills..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh hell yeah!  You&#039;d save a TON of your own money with this.  And maybe you even get so USED to being more conscious with your spending cuz you have to use quarters all the time, that your whole habits change too?  That would be cool ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[20k in quarters.  I mean that wouldn&#039;t be the only money you had access to because you would have cash from your regular job to pay bigger bills with or to use when you didn&#039;t have time. You could use the quarters for lunches and miscellaneous purchases and only carry around what you thought you needed that day and then the dollars that you had in your pocket would feel like &quot;savings&quot; because you wouldn&#039;t use them for the little things.... and then... it would seem like it lasted forever!]]></description>

Who cares if I have to pay in quarters?  Then again, I have no qualms about paying for a dollar&#039;s worth of stuff in pennies, either.]]></description>
