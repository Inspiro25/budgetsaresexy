					<description><![CDATA[My thoughts are to keep everything as-is and continue rocking it :) If you&#039;re getting 18% of your salary into your 401k each year that is INCREDIBLE! I&#039;d do whatever it takes to make sure that&#039;s locked in, and if you don&#039;t have any after that then it&#039;s all good. 18% is great for now, so way to take advantage of it :)

And you&#039;re right about fund choices/etc too - though not sure about &quot;having more in an account makes more money&quot; - I don&#039;t think that&#039;s correct, but I could be wrong. I&#039;m no professional :) It may also seem like you have &quot;a lot&quot; of accounts too, but really that&#039;s fairly common and you&#039;re now set up for the future too. Like when/if you leave this job, you have the rollover IRA to put your 401k money into and also the Roth for when you have extra to apply any time. I think you&#039;re good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m late to the discussion but my question seems fairly relevant. I just started a new job who matches 100% my first 7% (and puts in an additional 4% of salary each year - bonus!) into my 401k account. From previous jobs I have a small former 401k account that is now a rollover IRA as well as a small Roth IRA. Together they total about $33k. I haven&#039;t been able to contribute to either for about a year (ugh was unemployed) but they still made small, decent gains regardless. 

Because of this new 401k, which will grow with 18% of my salary each year, should I roll the $33k into the retirement account or keep all separate?  I&#039;ve always heard that money grows faster when there&#039;s more in it.... and $33k would be a good base. But I also know that 401k accounts aren&#039;t as flexible with fund choices or aggressive as traditional or Roths. At the moment I don&#039;t have extra money left to contribute to the rollover or Roth, since I&#039;m still paying off debt.

Your thoughts J Money?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ooooh that&#039;s a tricky one. My gut says probably not though, just to be on the safe side... money and friends usually mix strangely. Maybe you could ask your friend to refer you to someone they like and trust?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of using some of your own money and comparing the ROI to what your advisor is getting you (minus his percentage/rate of course). I have a question for you - would you ever invest with an advisor who is a close friend? Just curious.]]></description>

Well, kinda yes and kinda no. You don&#039;t really have to live and hang out in your investments - nor do you *need* them per se - so I wouldn&#039;t make that exact comparison really, but I do get what you&#039;re saying. Always best to at least know what&#039;s going on and do *some* research even if you&#039;re not gonna manage them yourself...]]></description>

So glad you got a lot out of this, friend! And even more so that you allowed me to share it with everyone so they can read/ask questions too :) Look at this nice thread you&#039;ve started!]]></description>

Well luckily/unluckily you usually don&#039;t have much of a choice in where your funds go with 401(k)s - or at least many options. But the 15 or 20 you do you can at least research and learn a lot knowing you&#039;re options are limited :)  Just make sure you&#039;re investing at LEAST as much as they&#039;re willing to match! That&#039;s free money just prime for the picking!!]]></description>

Good idea with the practicing. Your comment also reminded me of a friend of mine who always says &quot;Yes, I&#039;m smart enough to learn about _______, but I choose to spend my time elsewhere and pay someone to do it for me.&quot; :) It&#039;s all about priorities, right?]]></description>
