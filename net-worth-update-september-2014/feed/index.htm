					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-update-september-2014/#comment-164152&quot;&gt;Louise @ Good Financial Choices&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m calm and collected cuz I&#039;ve seen how the market goes over all these years and I know I won&#039;t be touching it for quite some time :) Much easier when you understand that!

As for side hustles - yeah, totally worth exploring. I&#039;d start with the stuff you love or are passionate about first and then just see what happens. Almost every single person I know who&#039;s successful with hustles or location independent jobs started things out as a hobby or just because they really enjoyed it, and it wasn&#039;t until after when opportunity hit that their biz started to explode. Rarely do I come across anyone who was 100% in it for the money as you typically burn out before you get close to that goal in the end.

So think about all the stuff you enjoy and would probably do for free anyways, and then see if you can make any $ off that in the beginning. Worst case you fail but still have fun, and best case you hit your dreams! And potentially those you couldn&#039;t even have conjured up because your path takes a wild turn while out there hustling in the real world :) 

I had no idea you could make money blogging, and DEFINITELY would not have thought I&#039;d be doing it full-time as a &quot;real&quot; job one day, haha...You just never really know with life.... the trick is just starting and then seeing what happens.]]></description>

SEPs are based on a % of your business profit for a year. So I pretty much watch how it&#039;s going throughout the year and do my best to have a rough amount stashed (usually just in my savings account) so that when it comes time to invest I can just xfer that puppy right on over... And the beauty of SEPs is that it helps save mad taxes too - which is why I max out the most I&#039;m allowed to put in there each year no matter what that amount comes to :)]]></description>

You know, ever since we got close to this &quot;half a million&quot; territory it&#039;s been a lot harder to complain about stuff :) It&#039;s nice to be more relaxed and soak it in after working for so long! Just gotta make sure I don&#039;t relax *too much* since we&#039;re still a long ways away from the dream of early retirement...]]></description>

Glad you like the site! Thanks for stopping by to comment :)

I&#039;m not sure if how long you live somewhere really determines whether you pay down your mortgage faster or not, as that decision depends on your goals and priorities, but I do know that it does go into the decision of whether to buy a house vs rent. If you&#039;re only gonna live somewhere for a couple of years it usually doesn&#039;t make sense to buy, but if you&#039;re staying but for a half dozen+ then it prob does.

At the end of the day though it&#039;s a personal decision so as long as you stay true to what&#039;s good for your own situation then it&#039;s all good :)]]></description>

Oh yeah, the rental thing definitely makes a difference.  Probably best to keep it as is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your personal finances are so complicated! You have a whole lot to get your head around, but it looks like you&#039;ve got it figured out. I would have a hard time taking all of these details into consideration on a regular basis. &quot;Every month – no matter how much income we make or not – we always round up and pay extra towards our mortgages… It’s been such a habit over the years that I don’t even notice it anymore.&quot; THAT&#039;s the kind of personal finance I like. Not intimidating. Auto-pilot and smart : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m always inspired by your updates, and this one is no exception - especially the way you are calm and collected by the drop in net worth. 

It&#039;s an inspiration how you are always focused on the big goal, and always have a plan or two in progress to get you there.

Personally I&#039;m at the seriously considering a side hustle stage, but haven&#039;t yet come up with an idea that&#039;s more profitable than my day job. I dream of being location independent, and working from coffee shops etc, so I&#039;m going to put more focus into this area now..]]></description>
