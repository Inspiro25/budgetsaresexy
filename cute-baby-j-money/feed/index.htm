					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the baby! As a young father of a beautiful 7 year old girl, I can tell you that it will be wildly interesting, but a beautiful experience at the same time. 

If you ever need help with anything, feel free to reach out! I&#039;m pretty experienced in the children department with a daughter and a zillion nieces and nephews. Good luck to you and take care of that handsome boy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats to the Money Family! I remember too well all the freakouts we had over our first little one. I remember thinking, &quot;Are they really gonna let us take her home and nobody is going to check in on us to make sure she&#039;s okay every day?!?!&quot;  Right when I was about to leave the hospital is when it hit home for me.  

This time next year I bet we&#039;ll be seeing another &quot;we&#039;re expecting!&quot; post. That&#039;s about the time I predict your wife will get the baby fever again. I did.  After #2, I was ready after 12 months!  :-0]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man!!! I have not been keeping up here. I feel terrible I didn&#039;t get to give you an earlier note of congrats. You crossed my mind today and I zoomed over to see if you had Baby Money up and you do.
HE IS PRECIOUS!!!!
Congrats a million times.
Our little guy was born in June and we&#039;re just so in love. It&#039;s amazing how they just change you, isn&#039;t it? Craaazy. I know you and Mrs. Money are just as smitten as can be with your cute little bundle.
Congrats again!!!
