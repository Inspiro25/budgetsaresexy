Haha that&#039;s a good start!

You can also try selling some of the stuff you no longer *love* anymore (or even donating &#039;em) to help you feel better about at least breaking even with &quot;stuff&quot; :) Sometimes that helps me feel better about my book hoarding, lol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn’t know you are Catholic! We are as well.

Great tie into Lent and I am already thinking of what I can give up this coming year! ;) 

I have a iced tea addiction which I know the sugar isn’t so great or the bottled water. I am going to try and use my good old tap more lol.
The other thing is home decor. I have to stay out of Hobby Lobby and Target or I just want it all! Luckily our last debt is our mortgage but sometimes I overspend on home decor when I rationalize we don’t have car payments etc. Lately I have been sorting through and only allowing myself one bin per season and Christmas 2. It seems to be helping :)]]></description>

I did not :(

Completely forgot that we&#039;re *not at home* on Halloween night because WE&#039;RE OUT TRICK-OR-TREATING! Which makes it pretty hard to pass out books, haha... 

I did think about leaving them on the step for them to choose from, but didn&#039;t want to risk it yet without first testing out face-to-face ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the 40 day ban! I find accountability helps me in giving stuff up. If I tell people, I feel this huge sense of obligation to honor to my commitment. Plus others call me out on it.

Happy Halloween &#038; I must ask, did you pass out books instead of candy?!?]]></description>
