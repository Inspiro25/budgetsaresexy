					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Sun&lt;/b&gt; - 1) Yup!  Usually... If we pay ours off under 10 (intead of 30) we&#039;ll save over $250,000 in interest!!!  You can find out how much you pay by looking at your most recent statement :)  The other side of the coin, though, is if you can make MORE by investing the money vs. paying it all off.  Once&#039;s definite savings (paying mortgage) and the other is more speculative.

2)  I just log into my accounts and grab the number that&#039;s currently in there.  I don&#039;t account for fees/etc, especially since I&#039;m not going to touch it until there ARE NO FEES.

3) Awesome, glad you found a way that works :)  I just xfer the same amount every month into a &quot;tax fund&quot; (really just a separate savings account) and then use that to pay the quarterlies... your route is DEF more accurate though, haha... I&#039;m gonna have to adjust it more for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;Andrew&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, thanks for saying hi now!  Glad you&#039;re enjoying the site - I love hearing from my readers more than anything! :)  And to answer your question, no.  We do not pay any PMI. But you&#039;re right, that WOULD be another great reason to keep knocking it down!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s right!  All a part of the game, right?
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ll have plenty to give out when the time comes!  I&#039;ll even bring some good craft beer especially for you ;)
@&lt;b&gt;DC&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, cool!  She actually doesn&#039;t want me mentioning it here on the blog (privacy reasons), but if you want to email me I can tell ya :)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m extremely jealous of others&#039; net worths ;)  We&#039;re all somewhere on the chain, eh?  The awesome part is that we can all keep climbing too!
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Nah, doesn&#039;t really hurt much cuz I expect it to go up and down all the time - especially in this market.  It&#039;s actualy kinda weird to be honest with you.  The old me would have been FREAKING the F out right now - or any of the times it&#039;s dipped this year - but I think I&#039;m so used to it all now that it&#039;s just an afterthought :)  On the other hand, when it goes UP so much I also don&#039;t get as excited as much, haha... I can&#039;t tell if that&#039;s good or bad all the way?
@&lt;b&gt;Evan H.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah!!  And I did mine the day before so I missed it in the calculations! D&#039;oh.
@&lt;b&gt;Courtney&lt;/b&gt; - Print it out baby and stamp it up and everything!  Just a matter of time!  (Though, you&#039;ll probably need to put like 10 more stamps on it by then ;))
@&lt;b&gt;YFS&lt;/b&gt; - Work it yo!  That&#039;s the sexiest way to go right there -- live off one and play/invest/pay debt off with the other!  I love it!
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - GREAT!!!  I love hearing that :)  2012 is gonna be a KILLER year for sure, I&#039;ve got nothing but good good feelings about it.  Less than a month away!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Up about 2% this month!  The retirement portfolio is showing no losses for this year-to-date so that helps.  And the house held steady this month, too.  Our cars, however, lost $1,500 this month according to Kelly Blue Book, so that hurt.  Overall, though, our net worth this month is the highest it&#039;s ever been, so I can&#039;t complain.  If we can get through the holiday season without overspending, 2012 should be looking pretty good for us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking at the investment losses made me cringe a bit.  But, like you said.  It&#039;s long term.  Living on 1 income is were it is at!  Talk about flexibility.  We currently live off one income and use the other income to invest in money making opportunities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Up just under $1500 for the month.  The big market rally yesterday really helped!  Noticed that the markets have tanked toward the end of the month the last few times I did the net worth update.  It&#039;s nice to see the month end on an uptick for once :)]]></description>
