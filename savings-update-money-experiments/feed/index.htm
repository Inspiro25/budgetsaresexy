They&#039;d have to be pretty old/special to get more than $2.00 of it. Unless you&#039;re selling them to people who don&#039;t know better :)]]></description>

Before tossing them $2 dollar bills into savings I&#039;d take a looksy online and see if you can get more than $2 for each one. 
If you&#039;re gonna stick it into savings for the $$$ value it may be worth it to try and get more than $2 and then put that money into savings.]]></description>

Good position to be in! 

Can&#039;t really advise without knowing you/your goals/your situation, but you can&#039;t ever go wrong w/ investing your leftover money :) Keep reading some blogs and seeing what others are doing and what makes the most sense for you, and then pull the trigger! That&#039;s the most important part before your $$ starts flying out the door again. (or, in your case your savings account it seems like - hah - which wouldn&#039;t be too horrible ;))

But personally, yes, I invest all my investment $$ into Vanguard these days. As well as Acorns.com just for more padding which also uses Vanguard funds as well as others.

You&#039;re about to go down a beautiful path here, so I salute you in making it happen! And for living on less than half our income too. You keep that up and you&#039;ll be a millionaire in no time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HELP! J. Money, I have recently stumbled on your brilliant website and have been overwhelmed, but extremely excited to start my own millionaire pledge. I have USAA, $30,000.00 in my savings account and a paid off vehicle. I make $3,800 monthly with $1,600 in living expenses. How should I start? IRA first with USAA then Vanguard?]]></description>

hah - no shame at all.

yeah - you&#039;d probably spend about $50/mo total switching, though you do have to buy the phones outright first which is the only sucky part.]]></description>

I hope you do it and then share it with me so I can have fun through you :) It&#039;s true that we want a lot of things, but you know very well the stuff you&#039;d walk right up to the register and buy vs those you wouldn&#039;t. I dream about ever Mercedez that crosses my path but not gonna put those on the list - hah!]]></description>
