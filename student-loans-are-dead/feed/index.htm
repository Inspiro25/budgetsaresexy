We&#039;re trading in our 9-5 jobs for remote freelance work so that we can travel the country in search of a cheaper cost of living and a community we enjoy. We both grew up in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia area) so starting work by 5 a.m., sitting in traffic for hours, and paying almost $2000 for a one bedroom apartment is what we&#039;re used to. We&#039;re converting an old sprinter van and planning on traveling for about a year before settling somewhere. We may go international, too, if an opportunity presents itself.]]></description>

Yes! Australia! It&#039;s such a great system! When I started working I was still living like a student (the natural progression of lifestyle creep hadn&#039;t started creeping yet!) so I didn&#039;t notice the payments coming out of my fortnightly paypacket.

From a DPM position standpoint, we shield our teams as best we can...but sometimes the Powers That Be really need something to happen (or...dictate something to happen) and we can only roll with it the best we can. The Seattle Market is so tight right now (especially with 2 schools in state) that there&#039;s basically no jobs within 30 miles of Seattle. Part time positions have basically been eliminated...and even staff positions are SUPER hard to come by, since no one wants to manage these days. 

I wish I hadn&#039;t wasted those years before hunkering down and getting serious about the loans, but you live and you learn right? I&#039;ve learned that not spending as much really doesn&#039;t affect my happiness level. If anything, I was trying to buy happiness before!]]></description>
