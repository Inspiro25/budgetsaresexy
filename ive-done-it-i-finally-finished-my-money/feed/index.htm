					<description><![CDATA[HAH!  Did you know that I&#039;m working on the same thing, actually?!  Been collecting my tkts for over a year now so almost ready to go ;)  Be sure to let me know when yours is done!!!  I would love to see it.  And I&#039;ll even feature it here on the blog too if you&#039;d like :)  

Oh, and this guy&#039;s hanging in our hallway.  Unfortunately we don&#039;t get many visits to our house, or you better believe it will hit &#039;em right in the face when they walked in ;)  Have a great week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I give you kudos for being brave enough to create a piece of art that is really worth something!  I&#039;m thinking of trying the same thing, but with the equivalent of lottery and scratch-off tickets that were* once worth their weight.  Thanks for the idea!  Is this hanging in your living room and getting outrageous comments?]]></description>
