yes!!! beautiful!! I bet you&#039;ve invested *thousands* over the years doing that... not including the amount of compounding from putting it into the markets either! Such a simple, yet effective, habit. Well done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this sounds OCD but every time I saw what I had saved by purchasing on sale or with a coupon,  I moved that amount from my budgeted line item to be invested.   I also did this when someone would treat me to lunch or dinner.   Then any surprise money,  like a $3 rebate check I moved that too.   I would invest it in my S &#038; P 500 index fund when I had the minimum amount to do so.   My friends that I told laughed at me for doing such small amounts but it sure did add up.  It gamified savings and was fun for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude. Good tips to live by! I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve had to come crawling to company X, Y, and Z to request a penalty or some random fee be withdrawn. Way I see it, if it takes a 5 minute phone call to get $50 back, you&#039;re working at a rate of a lot of dollars per hour (all obviation of course, but who cares!)]]></description>

Ahhh yes - forgot about the tax hassles, but at least they print it all out at the end of the year for you right? At least that&#039;s what I remember... Of course, I just passed it to my accountant so it wasn&#039;t too much of an issue, but if I were doing it myself i prob wouldn&#039;t be as happy &#128514; That&#039;s really with *all* earnings though - the more you earn the more taxes/filing you need to do but still worth it in the end...]]></description>

I love the biking hack!!! I&#039;ve started traveling more on my long board, but it still usually requires me to drive somewhere first and then ride... Still too much of a wuss to go on main streets w/out a car :(]]></description>
