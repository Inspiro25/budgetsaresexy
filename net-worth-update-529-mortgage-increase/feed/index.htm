					<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t that be something ;) But I probably would egg him on to do the &quot;college experience&quot; cuz I got so much out of it myself and wouldn&#039;t change it for the world. At least if you&#039;re talking about living on campus, going to a 4-year college from start to finish, etc, etc... Not saying the other routes are wrong or worse or anything, just that I was really pleased with my experience and would thus like to pass it on to my spawn. I love it that I now have spawn! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think by the time Baby Money is college-age the landscape will be different.  As in cheaper.  As it is, if you choose correctly now and do things a little bit differently than a typical &quot;college experience&quot; your kid will be able to pay for it himself with a part-time job!  And no debt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lots of great comments/questions today guys - thanks! Always enjoy seeing what you have rolling around your heads :)

@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, how cool would that be? Will blogging even be &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; then? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Hot damn! Every time I try and catch up with you you shoot even higher :)
@&lt;b&gt;Romeo&lt;/b&gt; - Well I&#039;ll still probably give the money to my kid(s) whether for college or not, but who knows what will change from now &#039;till then... I&#039;ve already changed my mentality in 30 days! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - I know right?? I&#039;m def. with you there. The older coins are just so much cooler.. and more classic... Maybe they just got *too* classic for engravers? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Crap! Yes. I think about it at least 10 times a week but can never find the time to do it :( But I promise I will get to it and blog about the update as soon as that happens... Sorry for slacking!
@&lt;b&gt;K.K. @ Living Debt Free Rocks!&lt;/b&gt; - I guess I could do that, eh? I&#039;ll mark it to review again next month.
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Well congrats to you too then :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica O.&lt;/b&gt; - I think it was the right move for sure... I haven&#039;t wondered abou the decision since I made it a week or so back (unlike the first one).
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Nice job on West Point! That&#039;s cool! I don&#039;t think the author of that email meant anything harsh w/ entitlement since she was just giving me another perspective on it, but I do agree it&#039;s not good for kids to expect stuff and plan around it. I&#039;ll have to make sure to do a good job of setting expectations up sooner than later when it&#039;s time.
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @My Multiple Streams&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, well that&#039;s nice! Do you believe it truly goes up like that though? I never do... I just ignore all places that say so to err on the safe side, but in theory they could very well be right.
@&lt;b&gt;Christine B.&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah girl! Work it!! An increase of anything is better than a decrease in any month anyways ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jay @ effumoney&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, that&#039;s pretty neat. I just follow what Kelly Blue Book says in any given month as that&#039;s what I&#039;d be using if I were to sell it as a private party (which I would). I don&#039;t actually believe it went up, but if I&#039;m going with those numbers whenever the day comes to sell, I like it for my net worth. Does that make sense?
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - COOL! We believe in the same mission then - I like it :) I&#039;m gunning for our 2nd mortgage first and taking the emotional play over the financially better one. Just &#039;cuz it excites me more and pushes me forward (plus, the idea it&#039;ll be gone faster is even better!). I wrote about it in detail &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/mortgage-payoff-plan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you&#039;re interested. And then before that I blogged about which I should do to get readers&#039; reponses too. You can find that post &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/which-mortgage-do-i-pay-off-first-my-1st-or-2nd/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
@&lt;b&gt;Janine @ My Pennies My Thoughts&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you!! It feels so good! :) Did you have a great month too? Hope so!
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! And you&#039;re right, it is kinda dumb to keep it all in cash but ther are reasons for it :) Mainly emotional ones. A) My wife feels more comfortable having cash on hand over less debt (specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/new-monster-cash-account-emergency-fund/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1 year&#039;s worth of expenses&lt;/a&gt;, which covers $66k of it), and B) The rest will be used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-twenty-thousand-dollar-investment-answer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;max out my SEP IRA&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the year once I find out how much I&#039;m able to put in (it&#039;s based on my business&#039; profit for the year). Anything on top of those #&#039;s usually goes towards one-off expenses or our mortgages. A deal I made with my wife :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo! Congrats to both of us! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, that&#039;s pretty hardcore! But will totally pay off in the end, both literally and figuratively :) And having no debts on the othe side will also be huge! So keep it up!
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks, friend! :)
@&lt;b&gt;The Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Man, that&#039;s so much! I couldn&#039;t &quot;lose&quot; all that so early on like that, good for you guys... You&#039;ll be done and growing that $ before we even have our first $5k in it! Haha... As long as both our kids are prepared for when the time&#039;s right though, I know we&#039;ll both be happy. They&#039;re growing like weeds!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You guys are doing great! I talked to a financial planner and they wanted us to add 30-40k to the 529 now. That&#039;s a lot of dough. Baby RB40&#039;s 529 has about 10K in there now and I&#039;m going to add 10k this month. College is going to be super expensive when he&#039;s ready so I think it&#039;s best to put as much in as we can now while it&#039;s early. 
It would be great if he can get a full ride, but how many people really get that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice Net Worth!  My net worth went up a whole $965.21!  Woohoo! lol.  I am just happy it keeps going up with school draining all of my funds (no school loans).  Come January I plan on taking all 8-week condensed courses so I will have to pay tuition every other month.  I hope I can budget enough for it, because I am now planning on doing a dual bachelor and master degree at the same time!  I don&#039;t know what the heck I am thinking at times :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This month I went well over $91k in the net worth category, so it was a pretty stellar month for me too :D

Just think, 12 more months of those $3000 mortgage pay downs and the 2nd mortgage will be gone!]]></description>
