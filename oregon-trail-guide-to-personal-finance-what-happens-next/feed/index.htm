					<description><![CDATA[FBS, the Sims expansion pack made it so much better. I would get lost in that game for hours on end!

Edward, I&#039;ve never heard of Tank Wars. Then again, I&#039;m horrible at math so if I did have it available, I&#039;d probably ignore it anyway. Sad. But true.

Christa, hmmm. You can tie it to personal finance like this: you might encounter a weakness in your spending or your budget, one that always gives you a hard time, and you constantly fail at it. The best solution is to avoid it altogether or find a work around (instead of fording, take a ferry. Just make sure you have the money saved at all times). Maybe that works?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure how to apply this to finance: I always died trying to ford the river. Maybe look before you leap? Or wait until the conditions are right? I&#039;m not sure...cause I never forded successfully!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved that game. It was all the rage in 4th and 5th grade, dozens of us would huddle around the Apple IIG! Oddly enough, we didn&#039;t have any computers in the classroom in 6th grade. 7th grade, the IT computer game was Family Feud and 8th grade was a little game called Tank Wars. I can&#039;t say that Family Feud had any educational value, but Tank Wars was a great way to understand trigonometry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HAHA Oregon trail and the sims; I loved both!  Oregon trial I wouldn&#039;t trade items until I got the best price and only if I needed to.  With the Sims I ended up just building and designing houses most of the time lol.  Must be because I grew up with my dad owning a construction company.  Besides the jobs were lame, and all you could do with the sims gone was stare at the tv or maid BORING!  Now Sim city, that was awesome.  You had to design your city, spend within budget, take out small loans just to get you over the rough patch, have multiple income streams... just awesome :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rod, I agree with you. We need to take baby steps and eventually, those baby steps will add up to big things. 

Joanna, I loved the Sims. I would play it for hours, especially once they started with the expansion packs. But I did just the opposite. I would force them to go to work even when they didn&#039;t want to; I never had the incentive to look up cheat codes. And I won&#039;t even tell you what my husband did to those poor Sims...

Dave, walking is so important. I work from home and my dogs remind me when I need to get up and take a break. They&#039;re the best employees!

Chris, I am sorry to hear about your misfortune :) It is a great game, though. I never went at the grueling pace but I always picked the poorest profession. Not sure why. 

Greg, I loved the terrible graphics and green color, too. The new version is really fun, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved that game! I remember playing it on the old Apple computers with all the graphics and words in green. It was awesome!

This is actually a great analogy. Buy your necessities first. Then, worry about the rest. So true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I spend a lot of time daily at my work. I make sure that I get out for a good long walk each day to allow my mind to relax and see other things besides a screen and charts and a keyboard. The mental break, to me, is most necessary. A time to reflect and recharge the mental battery.]]></description>
