Yeah, I bet they do free versions down the road if it becomes super popular... Always a way to make money once you have people eating it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a cool idea.  I do have a decent amount of credit cards that I use based on what gives me the best rewards.  It would be a hassle if you lose it right?  And I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d pay for it...I&#039;d take if I can get it for free!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did get one of these. The reason is I have 3 reward credit cards that I use. I use Wallaby to see which one will give me the most rewards based on where I am at. Wallaby will be coming out with a card that you use instead of your credit cards and then it charge which ever credit will give you the best reward. So that means no more looking it up, just swipe. So the end goal is to have my wallaby card on this card with all my grocery rewards cards and get rid of my wallet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hell yah I bought one! Now all I have to do is sit patiently for...about 8 months. Can&#039;t wait!

I would actually prefer the wallaby card, but it&#039;s not out yet, so I had to settle for the first one to market.

9. People who think this will help them get laid (again, these people are out there, haha…)
If you whip this thing out and refer to it as your &quot;black card,&quot; you definitely fall under this category]]></description>

I think this will be a lot more popular once it integrates with smartphones too. You already can use your phone at several retailers to pay, so I don&#039;t imagine it&#039;s too far away. Security aspects make me super wary though... I&#039;d rather a few Guinea pigs give it a go for a while. Although I am excited to hear their reports.  

And Broke Millennial, Key Ring is a good, free app that lets you load in all your rewards cards and just use the app to find them and pay - it would be even better though if you just had a &quot;universal&quot; bar code or QR code or something instead of having to still swipe through your listed rewards cards to find the right one (gosh, how inconvenient, right? ;o).]]></description>
