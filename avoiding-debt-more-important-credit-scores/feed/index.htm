					<description><![CDATA[nope, not off base at all. I&#039;ve never been a big fan of credit cards myself. I think it&#039;s funny when people tell me that they are just using them for the rewards. They think that they are winning, but I just see it as them being gamed into spending more to justify the rewards. If you can make the rewards on your main monthly bills alone, ok, I can see that. But, when was the last time you heard a wealthy person explain that the reason they are so wealthy is because they got the credit card rewards?]]></description>

I guess it depends on your future goals and how good/bad your credit is right now :) You def. seem to be doing better than most of the country! Esp w/ that mortgage pay off - well done.]]></description>

There are plenty of studies that show that students who take on loans instead of working part time while in college are more likely to graduate.  I realize that many students attend institutions where graduation rates are less than 50% and this can be a big risk, but I&#039;d suggest (and I do suggest it to students that I advise) that a student who&#039;s made it through a couple of years of college with good grades in a major with reasonable job prospects consider taking on loans so that they can graduate more quickly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Trailing edge boomer here.  My wife and I have been debt free for about five years now.  We&#039;ve paid off all of our student loans, car loans, mortgage, and credit card debt and have a net worth (including home equity and retirement accounts) of about 7 times our annual income with 15 years until I retire.  I&#039;m finding it hard to imagine any circumstances under which we would ever need or want credit again.  Is there any point in worrying about our credit scores?]]></description>

Do the show hosts own credit cards?

If not, see my answer above :) You wouldn&#039;t know where to pick them up or find the best ones if you&#039;ve chosen not to go that route (similarly to me knowing the ins and outs of whole life insurance because I&#039;ve decided to go with Term instead).

If they DO own credit cards, however, then yes! That is pretty bad!]]></description>

True true.... Not going to argue with you about the power of knowledge.

But how do you know these millennials haven&#039;t done their own research and consciously came to the conclusion that these cards aren&#039;t for them? From the looks of the stats, it&#039;s pretty telling that they&#039;re very much aware of how credit cards work and are choosing not to buy into it. Hard to fault them for that.]]></description>
