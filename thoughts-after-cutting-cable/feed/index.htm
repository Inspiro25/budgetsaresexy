Congrats!!

We bought our router too for the new home and loving seeing the static low price every month.

It&#039;s a beautiful thing! (especially since we installed a cheap antenna too - I get my NFL games back, and for FREE!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I cut the cable &#038; haven&#039;t looked back. After unsuccessfully trying to get my services and billings corrected by Frontier - who bought Verizon FIOS -  WORST TRANSITION !!  I dropped my cable &#038; landline. Bills were $206.mo &#038; now I pay $53.mo &#038; have quadrupled my internet speed. I bought my own router because it saved me $75 compared to their price &#038; was 1/2 the cost of renting it for $10/mo.  I bought a firestick for each TV when Amazon had a 1 day sale in August &#038; I have no complaints (the voice activated firestick is easier to use &#038; saves a few seconds when in search mode). Trying Kodi streaming too. Over $150/mo now made avail for long term goals. If u don&#039;t like it, they will open their arms &#038; take u back...Frontier lost more accounts than they care to admit to!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome post! 

I haven had a cable bill for over 5 years, going back to when I was single. It really is possible. I don&#039;t know the exact number but I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve saved thousands of dollars. 

Keep it going if it&#039;s working!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought my life would be miserable without Sky TV, I can honestly say i have never missed it. I share a Netflix and Amazon account between three of us (about £4 each for both per month), I can&#039;t live without my super speed broadband, but with that I can stream whatever I like anyway. My bill used to be £130 to Sky TV alone, that didn&#039;t include the phone line and internet. I got sick of Rupert Murdoch ripping me off and walked away!]]></description>

I tried a digital converter, but not with the antenna at the same time... Could very well have been a human error though, haha...

Thx for the tip on antennaweb.org - will check it out once ready to get back to testing again!]]></description>
