					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/money-morals-decisions-fire/#comment-322693&quot;&gt;William Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Will Smith! I kind of disagree with this, respectfully. As much as I want to screw people who screw me, sinking to other people&#039;s levels based on how they treat me never actually makes me feel great afterwards. It&#039;s not like I would buy them a gift after they spit in my face, but I definitely wouldn&#039;t spit back just &#039;cause they did.

But I definitely agree that some industries are dirtier than others, and there are unspoken rules and expected practices that you can guide with.

Have a great week! Joel]]></description>

I agree that how you leave the old employer shows the new employer how you might leave them one day. They&#039;ll often be impressed if you show consideration for the place you&#039;re leaving.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it also depends on industry and how slimy the company has been. If the company you are leaving has been a terror than I say screw them, make sure you get your bonus. If the company has treated you well, than I would play nice in the sandbox.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t the easy answer here &quot;tell the new employer you need an extra week or two to adequately transition from the old employer?&quot; Absent some truly compelling reason, the new employer has no reason they couldn&#039;t go one extra week or two before onboarding you/paying you; it allows you to leave the old employer without burning bridges; and the new employer may even be impressed that you&#039;re considerate enough to transition fully and not leave your old employer in the lurch (under the theory that it shows you&#039;ll treat them well if/when you leave the new employer).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to suggest the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  How would you like it if YOU were the employer and your employee took advantage of you?  I wouldn&#039;t appreciate it and would remember it.  I find the world is a smaller place than we often think and bad behavior or even just crappy behavior has a way of coming back to haunt in ways we can&#039;t even imagine.   On a separate note.  I have made the decision to retire 2 years early 10 months from now.  It&#039;s so great to have enough time to transition my thinking and behavior because as we get older we are not as flexible or adaptable as our younger selves and now I have the time to adjust whatever needs adjusting.  It was really scary at first making that decision since retiring early requires me to do some things differently than I had ever thought about doing, but I find that I am very content with my decision as my company was bought out and is imploding in front of my eyes.  I am ready.]]></description>

Might depend on the people left behind. Some employers move on quickly, but some coworkers could hold a grudge for years.
Cheers Gills - have a great week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly I would have no issue working for both and giving no notice to get the bonus. At the end of the day he has worked for it and the reason he has to do it that way is that his employer will take it away if he does give notice! Think about it the other way the employer is going to take any opportunity not to pay the bonus so why should he do any different than what is in his best interest. 

It will be difficult for the employer with no notice but give it a few days and they will have solved the crisis and a few weeks and they will have forgotten about it!]]></description>
