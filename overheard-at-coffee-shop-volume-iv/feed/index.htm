You realize the game is designed to fail.
I just played it 4 times. 
When it became obvious I was going to win, it gave me the biggest mandatory hit possible on day 30.
There was literally a year&#039;s worth of bad luck in my 1 month of playing. A couple of illegal things occurred. And of course, it doesn&#039;t tell you the downside until after you make a choice(things that could be knowable beforehand).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say, thanks for posting these.  As a Deaf person, I don&#039;t hear these kinds of conversations and there are moments I wish I could hear.  I find them fascinating! When I see people engaged in conversation and emotions are ramped up, it makes me curious. Sometimes I can figure out partial things with lip reading but that requires intense concentration and staring.  More and more people don&#039;t look at each other, they look around and I&#039;m easily &#039;caught&#039; if I&#039;m trying to figure out what they are talking about. I&#039;ve tried downloading dictation apps just to &#039;hear&#039; what people talk about at random times - grocery stores, at the Apple Store waiting for my turn, gas stations, long lines of some grand opening, campgrounds....look forward to the next installment even though it&#039;s a ways away! And no, none of the dictation apps really work. :-/]]></description>
