					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the boy! Bummer on the costs...our insurance is covering everything (aside from prenatal vitamins) -- pretty amazing. I am delivering my 4th boy in 18 days. We are still working on names....

I managed not to pay for the pregnancy test. I went to the emergency clinic (covered by insurance for a UTI) and when they tested me, I suggested they run a pregnancy test too...just in case. The nurse walked in and said &quot;congratulations&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[THANK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!  I hope each and every one of you are blessed this week too!!  Whatever way that means to you! :)

@&lt;b&gt;Pretty Penny Saved&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, I did&#039;t even know something like that existed?  &quot;Amazon Mom program&quot; - I&#039;m emailing it to the wifey, thanks!
@&lt;b&gt;andi&lt;/b&gt; - I LIKE THOSE!!! Both actually!  &quot;Cash&quot; haha... how perfect would that be?
@&lt;b&gt;Marianne&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  We&#039;ll take a look at your site to get some good ideas :)  And congrats on your new baby too!!
@&lt;b&gt;Aaron&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a pretty good one :)
@&lt;b&gt;ChiMomWriter&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you know I do what I can! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - It would make it easier, huh? ;)  I think we crossed out Jackson already, even though it was in my top 10 if I recall correctly...
@&lt;b&gt;Kandace&lt;/b&gt; - Yay for our babies!  And SOMETHING saved is always better than nothing, so keep all that up. I think these large numbers end up scaring so many people that they end up just forgetting about it altogether.
@&lt;b&gt;Hermoine&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, that&#039;s not weird - my wife does the exact same thing!  Every name that we&#039;re seriously considering she&#039;s going through all the iterations to make sure nothing funky can come out of it.  I told her he&#039;s gonna be a pimp either way, but she said &quot;just in case&quot; haha... 
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ simple island living&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re gonna have some GOOD protection when they get older! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Dr Dean&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh, do I get your personal pager number too?
@&lt;b&gt;Cordelia&lt;/b&gt; - You know he will! And you know I&#039;ll be posting a pic of it too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Quentin! I like that!  Though it&#039;s always hard pronouncing (or not pronouncing) that &quot;t&quot; - say it a few times and you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talkin&#039; about ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Hahah... yes, if a &quot;Luther&quot; found me in a dark alley I&#039;d DEF be scared! :)
@&lt;b&gt;WR&lt;/b&gt; - That def. makes it fun ;)  I&#039;m surprised there was no &quot;tax benefits&quot; in there though?
@&lt;b&gt;Bethany&lt;/b&gt; - Oh for sure.  We&#039;re def. hanging onto mostly unique names that you&#039;ve probably heard before, but really rarely.  We can&#039;t wait!
@&lt;b&gt;One Frugal Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Awww thank you!  And CONGRATS on your new baby too!! Yes, we had started trying 2 years ago on and off, and then when we tried &quot;for real&quot; it still didn&#039;t happen and we started to get scared :(  Then, out of nowhere, it just happened!  We were incredibly shocked, but even more so happy :)  So yay to being blessed!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... can&#039;t dads do whatever they want and you have to listen to them? ;)  You better tell me the sex of yours once you find out (IF you find out before it&#039;s born), it&#039;s all so exciting!
@&lt;b&gt;Poor to Rich a Day at a Time&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks so much!
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahahha..... I hope you get a little girl then next :)  That&#039;s what I&#039;m gonna be hoping for too on the second round!  Braeden is absolutely beautiful, way to go on that one :) Same w/ the others actually, they&#039;re all so unique which is what we&#039;re going for!  And you&#039;re def. right on me wanting it to be a surprise, haha... I did, but the wife wasn&#039;t having any of it ;)  So she wins!
@&lt;b&gt;Dani @ OK, Dani&lt;/b&gt; - YAY!!!  We&#039;re all having babies around the same time!! Let&#039;s throw a party!
@&lt;b&gt;Young Professional Finances&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, but what are you gonna do, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;Stacey&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I believe it about their &quot;own toys&quot; ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jonathan&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re the second person to put down &quot;Cash&quot; here :)  Just asked the wife if she liked it (cuz I do, esp cuz it reminds me of Johnny Cash) and she said no.  &quot;We&#039;re not naming our son so it fits with your blog&quot; is what she actually said, haha... But Benjamin?  Def. on our top list ;)  It&#039;s the only non-unique name on it so far...
@&lt;b&gt;Katherine&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re like my wife - she&#039;s researching all kinds of backgrounds on names.  I think it&#039;s important too, but if one comes out that&#039;s REALLY cool we both like, but means something strange, I wouldn&#039;t be averse to it either.
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Possibly, but I REALLY hope it&#039;s a penis or he literally does have 3 legs! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe... it&#039;s true.  I&#039;m all kinds of emotional on the inside ;) Love you back, friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to you and your wife. Boys are so much fun! I named my son Emory, after a very well respected hospital, here in Atlanta. His name means work ruler. I want him to be a hard worker. The name also is a constant reminder for me to continue working for my degree in the medical field. Whatever you decide to name your son, put some thought into it. I believe names can affect one&#039;s characteristics as they grow older.]]></description>
