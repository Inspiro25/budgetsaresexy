					<description><![CDATA[Haha, there you go ;)  I actually felt pretty bad that our house had a furnished basement for the 4 years we never used it (like, only twice!), but now I have my work office down there and loving it!!  But I def. agree on the stuff part - we&#039;ve accumulated more to make this downstairs more fun for me ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this so much!  While I don&#039;t feel the need to take minimalism to an extreme, I definitely like the idea of having a carefully edited selection of &quot;stuff.&quot;  Lots of clutter in my physical space makes me feel mentally and emotionally unsettled, but I don&#039;t like things to look too bare, either.  For me, it&#039;s all about a balance. 

One thing I actually kind of like about my house, as inconvenient as it can be at times, is the lack of basement since it&#039;s on a slab foundation.  Yes, it&#039;s less storage space, but it really forces me to think before I buy something.  I have to make sure I (a) REALLY love it and (b) have space for it.  We do have a large attic, but it&#039;s not very convenient and I&#039;d have to do battle with the stinkbugs, so we try not too keep too much stuff up there. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s one way to do it!  I can&#039;t wait &#039;till we downsize one day :)
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you liked it :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah - clothes are a problem for me too ;)  I have like 10 hoodie jackets and quite a lot of shoes as well so I can have options, it&#039;s def. hard for me to dwindle down as well.  I wish I could cut back more though, and in a lot of areas I still need to do it.  So this is a nice reminder to stick w/ it.
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Exactly.  And at that point you can then upgrade the same stuff you have (ie. better quality) and still be saving tons of money and have the same # of things ;)  That would be ideal in my book.  Then I can finally get my Benz! Hehe...
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, now that&#039;s something to consider ;)  I had that problem moving buying a house cuz I never really needed any tools before that.  Those alone take up a lot of room!
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - There&#039;s a happy medium in there somewhere :)
@&lt;b&gt;jesse.anne.o&lt;/b&gt; - Right? A good reminder for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;Neo&lt;/b&gt; - Time to print it out so you don&#039;t forget then!
@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Good!  I love it :)  Do it!
@&lt;b&gt;Foxie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I miss the military!  Was so much fun moving around and doing all that stuff - soak it all in baby! :)
@&lt;b&gt;David Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!
@&lt;b&gt;Valeriu&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m glad you liked it too :) Thanks for stopping by.]]></description>

The more things I have that I don&#039;t need, the more energy they take away from me. Love the list!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have always looked up to FB and her minimalism -- but, seeing as how the military provides me with a house, I don&#039;t need to cram everything in the tiny apartment I dream of. (I just naturally love small spaces. Though giving up the 120 gallon fish tank will make me a sad panda for a bit.)

I just cleared a few boxes of unpacked miscellaneous crap from our house that was never unpacked from at least one move, for some it was two. I still have a lot of stuff, though, but it&#039;ll fit into less than 1,000 square feet. Compared to the amount of junk the military says we should own when calculating a DITY move, we own WAY less, and I&#039;ve heard of people that go OVER their limits. O_O]]></description>
