WHAA!! I&#039;m in Olathe KS just south of KC and my SO and I have been living at this motel 6 since march 2020 and its $302/week.
I&#039;m about to go insane without a kitchen and it gets dirty extremely fast if I slack for even just 48hrs. 
Our pit mix stays with us for free which is great and I do laundry at my moms.
If I had a kitchen and an extra room I&#039;d be golden but my daughter cant stay with me and ultimately that&#039;s my goal: to find a nice non hotel place to live so my daughter can come stay with me
...
And an apt is what 2 weeks here costs.]]></description>

interesting question! I know there *are* services out there where you can get a &quot;normal&quot; address (like not a PO Box) for like $15.mo but not sure that would help w/ licensing as you wouldn&#039;t be able to prove you lived there... Have you already asked the hotel about it? If they have people living there for long periods of time I&#039;m sure others have tried to figure it out as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just moved to California (San Francisco Bay Area), currently in a hotel. Was looking for apartments but just realized that the hotel is just as cheap and better. 
Only problem is, would I be able to get CA health insurance and a CA driver&#039;s license using the hotel address? I do plan on staying for at least 6-12 months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there! I am an RN about to start travel nursing and was planning on looking at some extended stay hotels for my contracts. In your post you mentioned a cot that you take with you so you can always sleep on your own bed. I like the sound of that!! Could you let me know what kind you use? Thanks!]]></description>

I bet you could pull that off if it&#039;s a smaller or boutique-like place. It probably won&#039;t nearly be as fun/nice for reasons you&#039;ve already mentioned, but no harm in researching a little, right? Call up some of the hotels you like in the areas you like and just ask the manager! Never know what could come of it :)]]></description>

Haha, right??

Check out this post we featured recently on &quot;condotels&quot; (hotel rooms you can actually BUY!). It&#039;s not the exact same thing as a fancy&#039;ish hotel, but it&#039;s another route to look into?

There&#039;s def. a difference between *being forced* to move into a hotel (and probably a crappy one?) compared to doing it on your own wishes (and into a nicer one).

Sorry to hear it isn&#039;t going well for you :(]]></description>
