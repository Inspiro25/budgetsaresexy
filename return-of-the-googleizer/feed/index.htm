					<description><![CDATA[As a HUGE NKOTB fan, I am cracking up that you included them here. 

I was too old for trading cards, never owned them back in the day. And now? Well they reunited in 2008 so there may be a &quot;slight&quot; value on eBay for the original ones but doubt there&#039;s much. They seem to pop up everywhere. 

That pic brings back fond memories!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I especially like the NKOTB Google hits... I had tons of those trading cards when I was a tween. I wonder if my mom still has them? I could sell them to Germans, it appears!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - I know :( And there&#039;s a LOT of those kinds of searches too... But at least they&#039;re looking for help! And coming across sites like ours to motivate them :)
@&lt;b&gt;Verne Halom&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... don&#039;t worry, you&#039;re not missing out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Yes, they would. It&#039;s called breaking and entering!
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - OMG that&#039;s funny... have you ever blogged about that?
@&lt;b&gt;Brittany&lt;/b&gt; - I know right? It sounds like a more religous place to me too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Yes! Do it! It&#039;s fun.
@&lt;b&gt;Jarrod&lt;/b&gt; - Oh well that&#039;s a nice idea! If you shop there anyways then yeah, totally worth it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like taking my coins to the Coinstar at Albertson&#039;s grocery stores. You exchange the coins for an Albertson&#039;s gift card (for no fee) and then you can use that gift card to buy gift cards for other places (iTunes, Best Buy, McDonalds, etc.).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I purchased an entire box of NKOTB trading cards at a dollar store in the early 90s, exactly like that box for $16 on Amazon.  Though some of the packs have gone missing over the years, I still have a bit more than half the box and the individual packs are all still wrapped.  Kudos to mom and dad on telling me not to unwrap those things!  They&#039;re not exactly the high-demand collectors items they dreamed of, but it&#039;s something.]]></description>
