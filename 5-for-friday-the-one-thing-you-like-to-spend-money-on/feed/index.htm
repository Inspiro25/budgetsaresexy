					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys!  Sorry for the delay here, but glad to see so many responses on this one :)  Getting to know y&#039;all more and more every week!

@&lt;b&gt;Colleen&lt;/b&gt; - I like that :)  Falls under the &quot;experiences&quot; category which is A-Okay to me!
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - I totally get that :)  Friends &amp; Family are high priority!
@&lt;b&gt;WR&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  An intelligent one up in here, I like it.  Can never go wrong with books :)  And I agree - Borders shutting down absolutely SUCKS.
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, dessert?  Did NOT see that one coming :)
@&lt;b&gt;graduate.living&lt;/b&gt; - Mom &amp; Dad food is the best!  And not just because it&#039;s free.  It always feels so comfortable eating there :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lynn&lt;/b&gt; - 60 Days in Asia - that&#039;s hot!!!  I used to live there, did you know that?  Korea.  Freakin&#039; loved it.
@&lt;b&gt;John&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ve seen it before?  It was my first :)  And I was wondering if anyone was gonna put down car stuff.  I know a LOT of people who invest a crap ton of time and money into theirs, esp. tricking it out.  As long as y&#039;all get a lot out of it though, I&#039;m all for it!
@&lt;b&gt;Kerry&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, not even a week?  That is hardcore :)  Glad it&#039;s so productive though - great way to use your creativity.
@&lt;b&gt;Richard Anthony&lt;/b&gt; - Yo!  I know I already talked with you before leaving this, but again - HUGE fan of your stuff :)  Def. gonna add you into my blogroll here shortly - been seeing your stuff for a while now.  Though I don&#039;t know about these PEACEBUCKS?  I&#039;ll have to poke around a bit and read up on them.  Thanks so much for stopping by my man!
@&lt;b&gt;CityFlips&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwwww you DO travel! Haha... I haven&#039;t gone 3 weeks w/out planes this year, but only cuz of Love Drop :)  Without it, I could go months before hopping onto one.  Though I&#039;d def. go on lots of road trips in between the flights.
@&lt;b&gt;Mysti&lt;/b&gt; - You are my new favorite person :)  I LOVE holiday decorations! Not really spending money on them, or finding them though, but more like keeping them up an absurd amount of time after the seasons are over. I didn&#039;t take down my Christmas tree until April ;)
@&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting.  Didn&#039;t see that one coming either - but this is def. awesome seeing how different we all are :)e
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, $1500 for 10 days abroad is great!  I&#039;d take that up myself anytime :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Very cool!!  I bet others are into it as much too - we&#039;ve got a lot of crafty bloggers/readers here, thanks for sharing all the tips!
@&lt;b&gt;Andrea @SoOverDebt &lt;/b&gt; - haha, I always forget about Pier 1.  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s one in my area cuz I&#039;d totally be in there a lot more if that was the case :)  Mainly for looking and ideas though - a bit too expensive for my taste.
@&lt;b&gt;Jeffrey Trull&lt;/b&gt; - I was at DogFish Head brewery this week - love that place! Although moreso their tours than their beers, not my preference.  
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - I like eating out too :)  But more so at NEW places as I get bored pretty easily.
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, no worries - you&#039;re rockin&#039; it out so obviously you&#039;re good w/out a strict budget ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Indeed, good sir, indeed.  I&#039;d buy and play it too if I had friends to play it with :(  None of them live close enough by, so I just don&#039;t ever get on my gaming system... though NES doesn&#039;t have the most recent games anymore, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a great one!  Or two/three/eight, haha... self-improvement is def. good!!
@&lt;b&gt;WinrWinrChknDinr&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I used to looooooove collecting cards!  Particularly basketball ones.  They didn&#039;t have &quot;graded vs. non-graded&quot; back then, but I could totally get re-addicted again if a store opened up next door ;)  Toward the end all I collected was Michael Jordan (instead of just trading all cards, all the time) so now when I look back I have a ton of good ones still!  It&#039;s been a year or so since looking through them, so I should totally do it again this week... I miss it.
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re better than me.  If it doesn&#039;t have pictures, odds are I won&#039;t be reading it anytime soon :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Music is great!!  That&#039;s an awesome one, forgot about music :)  Though I usually just stream it for free online or on radio, but I can see how you can get hardcore about it. Thanks for sharing :)
@&lt;b&gt;rainbowfish&lt;/b&gt; - You can plan my trip next - I HATE the planning part.  My ideal trips are just following others on whatever they are excited about ;)  I just go w/ the flow. 
@&lt;b&gt;Diva&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww, haha...  I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not a girl cuz I&#039;d probably be the same too in that case :)  Luckily my wife can cut my hair since all it involves is shaving the sides since I cut the &#039;hawk part myself!
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ll help you, just wait :)  We&#039;ll go on another vacay together AND you&#039;ll buy some photography goodies!  Let&#039;s do it!
@&lt;b&gt;crashdamage1957&lt;/b&gt; - I can see that.  I don&#039;t like fish (only shrimp), but I have a ton of friends who swear by it.  Anything that excites you that much is def. good in my books though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What’s something that’s ALWAYS worth spending your money on? 
--- Sushi. Very expensive for what you get, but worth every penny.
How much does it usually cost you? 
---- ~$10 for a small platter that is enuf for a really decent appetizer ;)
What’s the MOST you’ve ever spent on it?
---I once spent about $75 for a sushi platter that i brought to share at a party. Way out of character, since usually i&#039;ll make something to bring for such occasions that will cost me less than $5. But,  altho those home made items are equally appreciated as the sushi was, again it was worth every penny, and was actually a lot of sushi for the money. ( i guess the platter was the sushi version of buying in quantity. )

 (What’s the LEAST?)
  $6 for California rolls.

Are there any alternatives to getting it cheaper?

 DYI Sushi? i dont think  so...

Do people think it’s a huge waste of money? (Do you care?)
---of course its a huge &quot;waste&quot; of money, since comparative nutrition can be had for much less. But, thats not  the point. Its a luxury.

*BONUS* How long could you go WITHOUT this thing? 
---Many months, to forever, really.. its a rare  treat, one i  only indulge in a few times a year, which for me just adds to its appeal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ferrying. *snort* :)

Actually, I don&#039;t spend a lot of money on any one thing. We spent maybe $2k to fly our fam to CA for 11 days this summer (and incidentals may have added a couple hundred to that) - but mostly we stayed with family and we NEVER vacation. I *would* spend money on travel. I should MORE often because I get twitchy sitting still (work from home blues? That may change with the office job). I also spend money on camera stuff - but even that? I can&#039;t remember the last time I bought anything, though I&#039;m eyeing a lens I want a lot. 

I am making a point to travel more - last year, i went on several trips - mostly with friends - because I LOVE to travel. This year, a few more (and one lined up for fall...with my mom. Should be interesting).

But I&#039;m not really great at spending money on the things I love - I spend a lot of time wishing I would travel more, of that I had that awesome lens or whatever... but not doing much to turn it to reality. Working on that :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What’s something that’s ALWAYS worth spending your money on? Personal Care: Hair cut &#038; color, manicures/pedicures, facials
How much does it usually cost you? My hair is $138 with tip; mani/pedi $50; facials $100
What’s the MOST you’ve ever spent on it?  Hair $225 with tip; mani/pedi $75; facials $250 (What’s the LEAST?) $100 with tip; mani/pedi $35; facials $61
Are there any alternatives to getting it cheaper?  Doing it myself is cheaper, but not necessarily effective.
Do people think it’s a huge waste of money?  Some people do, but I don&#039;t care!  I love having my hair done, mani/pedis and facials are incredibly relaxing.
*BONUS* How long could you go WITHOUT this thing?  When out of work I can usually go about three months between hair coloring and cuts.  And when out of work I can go a year with out a mani/pedi or facial.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. This was tough as I have three things I feel are worthy of spending money on. Books, art supplies, and travel. But I think travel wins out. 
2. A wide range here, depending on the destination. I live 2 hours from Orlando, so like to take weekend jaunts there. Then there is family a few hours away, and of course real vacations. lol 
3. To date: the most would be last years trip to the Bahamas, but next years trip to CA will probably beat it. The least would be when I traveled with my child for sports and we would put 2 or 3 adults and that many kids in a room to save money. 
4. Staying home, no more weekend trips, fewer trips to Orlando would all make it more economical. 
5. Someone must, but I DON&#039;T CARE! I love to go places, and get restless if I don&#039;t go somewhere every few months. 
*BONUS* Not long. I get restless. I love planning the trips, finding things to do, figuring the budget, then the trip.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. I really like spending money on entertainment stuff, but especially music. I don&#039;t go to as many concerts as I used to, but I LOVE spending money on new records. Like, I can&#039;t even go into a record store without buying something. But the little thing makes me really happy. 
2. A vinyl record might cost anywhere from $8 - $25, depending. 
3. I think I once spent $30 on a 180 gram (better quality) Modest Mouse record that was about to go out of print. That&#039;s not really that extravagant. Though if you&#039;re talking totals of record store shopping sprees... For the least, I think I once got a copy of U2&#039;s The Joshua Tree for a dollar. That was awesome. 
4. Buying online is pretty economical, even with shipping, and ESPECIALLY since the Canadian dollar is so high right now. ;)
5. The first record I bought was a copy of Elliott Smith&#039;s either/or. I bought it while on vacation with a relative, who literally yelled at me for wasting my money, being so foolish, etc. &quot;You know they have that on CD, you know?? You can just buy it at the store. It would be CHEAPER on CD. Why the hell would you buy that? It&#039;s so out of date!&quot; And no, I don&#039;t care. :)
*Bonus: I can force myself to not buy records for long periods of time if I have to, but if the question is how long can I go without listening to music? Probably not even 24 hours.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. I really like spending money on entertainment stuff, but especially music. I don&#8217;t go to as many concerts as I used to, but I LOVE spending money on new records. Like, I can&#8217;t even go into a record store without buying something. But the little thing makes me really happy.<br />
2. A vinyl record might cost anywhere from $8 &#8211; $25, depending.<br />
3. I think I once spent $30 on a 180 gram (better quality) Modest Mouse record that was about to go out of print. That&#8217;s not really that extravagant. Though if you&#8217;re talking totals of record store shopping sprees&#8230; For the least, I think I once got a copy of U2&#8217;s The Joshua Tree for a dollar. That was awesome.<br />
4. Buying online is pretty economical, even with shipping, and ESPECIALLY since the Canadian dollar is so high right now. ;)<br />

					<description><![CDATA[1. Something that&#039;s always worth spending my money on is books. I absolutely love to read!
2. It costs me between Free 99 to about $15, depending on the book. Things are usually between $5-$10 since I&#039;ve been reading on my Kindle lately.
3. The most I&#039;ve ever spent on a book that was for leisure reading was probably about $20 since it was a hard cover. The least is free :)
4. Cheaper alternatives are renting books (like through Lendle) or borrowing/swapping books.
5. I haven&#039;t met anyone who thinks reading is a waste of money and even if they did, I certainly wouldn&#039;t care.
6. I went a while without reading leisurely. A couple years. I&#039;ve just recently started getting back into it, and I&#039;m glad I&#039;m back :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.) What’s something that’s ALWAYS worth spending your money on?
Well, I used to collect football cards of a favorite player. It seemed like it was worth it at the time. Now, not so much. Was it fun? Heck yes. I called it a &quot;non-traditional savings account&quot;. It worked out OK, because selling some of them paid for (3) tickets to the Super Bowl this year. (GO PACKERS!)

2.) How much does it usually cost you?
Typically between $75 and $250. Depends on the card, grade, year, population, etc.

3.) What’s the MOST you’ve ever spent on it?  (What’s the LEAST?)
Most was bought for $1800. Sold for $3500. CHA-CHING!
Least was bought for $0.01 and probably given away at a loss. BOOO!

4.) Are there any alternatives to getting it cheaper?
You can buy them ungraded and have them graded. Or, you can go without having them graded at all and keep them in &quot;raw&quot; condition. Or, you can get a lower graded card (scale of 1-10). Obviously 10s cost the most.

5.) Do people think it’s a huge waste of money?  (Do you care?)
I am sure they do. My family, especially my parents, thought I was crazy when I spent $1800 on a piece of cardboard with a grown man on it. When they found out another card sold a few months later for $6600, they became a little more OK with it. At the end of the day, it was my money and my decision. It made me happy at the time.

6.) How long could you go WITHOUT this thing?
At the time, hours. It was my crack. I have gone a year without really buying a new card. It&#039;s a neat hobby and one that I will stay passively involved in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ALWAYS worth spending money on- Self-improvement! Whether it&#039;s books, hobbies, education, foods, travel or whatever.
Usually cost- between nothing and thousands.
MOST spent on it- Most spend would be $3,500 and the least zero dollars.
Cheaper alternatives- use the internet for free information, cheaper substitutes, borrow, receive as gifts and just getting creative.
People think it’s a huge waste of money- probably, but I don&#039;t care enough to pay attention ;-)
How long could you go WITHOUT it- a nanosecond?]]></description>
