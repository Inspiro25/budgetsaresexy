I dump any extra cash I have back into it and then go for a nice long walk :) 

Though it does still freak me out from time to time, like with yesterday&#039;s huge drop... Hard not to pause for a sec when it&#039;s down 2,000 in ONE DAY!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that&#039;s awesome for both of you!  I have to admit that some of it goes against the grain when compared to some of the standard advice I normally hear, but looks like the risk was worth the reward in this case.  With today&#039;s market changes it makes me wonder how things turned out or if the drop caused a lot of stress.  Who knows, maybe he&#039;s well diversified now.  What do you do on days like today when the market tanks?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Inspired by this post I called my pension company and got an update on my account and that pushed me over! Hurrah! And yes, I do feel a bit different. Not planning on changing any spending habits or making any lifestyle changes... But I feel really happy to have hit a personal goal!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a nice positive way to start the week! I just got my bonus paid and am *this close* to hitting the $1m mark! I&#039;ll hit it next regular payday at the end of them month. Then it will drop down when I get my bathroom renovation done (been saving an planning for ages and am super excited!) but for a few months I&#039;ll be in the club too!]]></description>

And he&#039;s only in his early 30s too! Both him and his wife!

That sucks about your colleague :( Def. good to have some barriers and know your risk tolerance... No way I&#039;d have the balls to take it that far even if it was a sure bet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am glad it worked out for him, but taking out a loan to invest is risky. Let alone 9%! I remember working with a person back in late 1999 who mortgaged his house to buy his company&#039;s stock. When the dotcom bubble burst, he lost everything, including his once paid for house.

It is impressive that his wealth doubled in about 3.5 years! I also like how he started with a regular income and worked his way up and saved a bunch.]]></description>
