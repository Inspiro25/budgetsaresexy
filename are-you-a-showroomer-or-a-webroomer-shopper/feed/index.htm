Interesting to hear your take on it as a mall biz owner :) Is the reason you&#039;re shutting down the other one due to the massive rise of internet sales? Does it make sense for you to sell online as well as physically or not really if you&#039;re re-selling other brands anyways?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a retail store owner in a small little local town (and in the process of closing one also) I have seen first hand the massive effect of online shopping of products. Over the years we had to continualy change the products we sold and what is best to not compete with online. The funny thing that we compete with most though, we compete with the brands themselves that sell direct from their own websites. So they are getting us as retailers to buy from them while they are selling direct to customers as well.

As for the comments here, I was pleasantly surprised so far to see people that see the value in shopping local and extremely pleased to see the mindfulness of the waste and carbon footprint of shopping online regularly for single items.]]></description>

Wow that&#039;s a lot, haha...  I actually read the other day that Nutella was one of the most *stolen* items at food stores! So strange, right?]]></description>

Good point on the Zero Waste stuff!!

Do you ever read Bea Johnson&#039;s stuff?? She inspired the crap out of me a few years ago and even got me into composting (!). Here are some articles I wrote about it, but needed this reminder to get back to paying attention again - so thank you. We DO waste so much incessantly using Amazon!!

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m definitely an &quot;InternetRoomer&quot; haha. All those darn millenials ;) 

Amazon Subscribe and Save for the win! I love using subscribe and save and getting that 15% off already low prices. 

I even order Nutella through subscribe and save. 12 jars every 4 months :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really depends on the item.

I used to be more of an online buyer but as I&#039;m trying zero waste I&#039;m cutting back. Ordering one item at a time generates a LOT of packaging garbage. Turned out, btw, I spent less on useless impulse buying.

I&#039;m a big showroomer for electronics and appliances. For the rest, not nearly as much.

Books - tending toward webroomer. I&#039;d rather buy books in a store, on principle (plus, no packaging). Here, by law, retailers can&#039;t reduce the set price of a book more than 5% so it&#039;s basically the same price everywhere including local Amazon.

Clothes - both. in bulk online for T-shirts, jeans and all simple things, and at least showrooming for more elaborate/adjusted ones.

Finally, internetroomer on non-perishable groceries - buying in bulk online boring things like cat food, cat litter, toilet paper... one big delivery every three months, less boredom and sometimes nice savings.]]></description>

YESSS TO SUPPORTING BOOK STORES!!!! All of them really as they&#039;re def. a dying breed :( A solid 80% of my book purchases come from local book stores, mainly because I love me some *used* ones, and particularly the ones that are rarer to find. So basically, Rare Book Stores for the win.]]></description>

I can get down with that :)

I much prefer to do stuff IN REAL LIFE when possible too, and I&#039;m sure the stores love having these real life people walk into them! Whether they&#039;re buying or not!]]></description>

Haha agreed... And the stores have already done the years of research to try and get you to pony up on the spot too!! So it&#039;s only fair that we get a chance to poke around first :)]]></description>
