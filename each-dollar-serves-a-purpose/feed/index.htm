					<description><![CDATA[I love this! Taking a long-term approach to money has also helped me completely cut out impulse purchases. If you train your mind to think of money as an improvement or investment tool, it makes you think twice about those cardboard cutouts of Kim Kardashian. ;)

I&#039;m still working on putting my money towards index funds, like Vanguard. Right now we&#039;re still working on getting out of debt, which will yield a higher return than investing, but soon we&#039;ll need to consider our options to let our money grow passively.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great breakdown! We usually tell our Financial Gym clients to keep a minimum of 6 months worth of their fixed expenses in their emergency fund.  It&#039;s important to review your expenses and adjust your savings numbers on a regular basis so you can live comfortably for a few months should anything happen.]]></description>

Haha... you&#039;ll get it at some point, but along with it will come some even higher credit rates :) Hopefully by then none of us will have any debt needs anymore!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me, it&#039;s frustrating how low the returns are in all the relatively risk free savings instruments. I don&#039;t really find it worth my effort to open a new &quot;high yield&quot; account at a new bank if it&#039;s going to return 1%, so most of my short to long term savings has just been sitting in my checking account.

I would like a safe investment with a decent return where I can park some money until the market comes down a bit. Is that too much to ask?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great point &quot;not every dollar is meant to build wealth.&quot; I allocate my dollars to where I think it gives me the most opportunity, whether it&#039;s on leisure, necessary expenses, or anything else. I sure have a lot of money tied up in the stock market too though :) 

I&#039;m sure you could find discount stores that let you buy a life size Kardashian for less than $78 :p]]></description>

Well...since you asked.

I&#039;m going to go on a road trip and live in AirBNB&#039;s for....however long it takes? I have 30 states that I haven&#039;t been to yet and I have 30,000 miles and a year left on my auto warranty. It all just sort of worked out that way.

I feel like my dividends (as well as my savings) will go a lot further basically anywhere that isn&#039;t called California, (or DC or NYC).

There&#039; some very cheap Real Estate in a lot of these places that I will be exploring. Who cares if the jobs might pay a bit less when you can buy a small house for cash or rent at a drastically lower cost?

What could possibly go wrong, right? ;-)

It will be a great adventure...or misadventure, and I will be blogging all about it I&#039;ll let you know when the blog starts to get interesting, right now it&#039;s basically just &quot;practice&quot;. :)]]></description>
