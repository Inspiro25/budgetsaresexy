					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not creative, but my way of saving $5 is by bringing my lunch to work. It&#039;s something that can be done most days. I always try to take lunch at least 3 times a week. One day is usually covered by the office and the other is half price lunch day at a local restaurant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an awesome idea but it&#039;s hard to spend less than nothing directly out of pocket yesterday. :)  I did turn off lights a bit more and have a lower temperature overnight. Perhaps I can try to save later today when we go out for dinner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All great ideas guys!  Thoroughly enjoyed reading these - even at 1:33 a.m. as I&#039;m typing this! :)  Although now I may be too tired to add them into the post above...

some responses:

@&lt;b&gt;Barb&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  That is awesome.  I love it when patience pays off like that.
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - The first rule of Money Club: Save it!!!
@&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... yeah, sad huh?
@&lt;b&gt;Dan&lt;/b&gt; - Stopped for real for real?
@&lt;b&gt;Clare&lt;/b&gt; - Bam!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathleen&lt;/b&gt; - There you go!!!  Good job!! Especially since you&#039;re not just &quot;spending to save&quot; since you need Thanksgiving stuff anyways.
@&lt;b&gt;Ben&lt;/b&gt; - Turn down beer?  I don&#039;t know if I could do it! haha... now, were you already planning on not going or did this challenge change that? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kitchen Penguin&lt;/b&gt; - good work!
@&lt;b&gt;MKG&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  TotallY!
@&lt;b&gt;jesse.anne.o&lt;/b&gt; - I think it&#039;s all a balancing act.  Esp with coffee.  Sometimes you save, sometimes you don&#039;t!
@&lt;b&gt;mary&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahahaha... I love that game :)
@&lt;b&gt;Desi Guy&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin I&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s 17 lottery tickets :)
@&lt;b&gt;Courtney&lt;/b&gt; - YES! YOU DID IT!!!  Well done my friend.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, see that?
@&lt;b&gt;Bob&lt;/b&gt; - Well that was easy.  Good job!
@&lt;b&gt;Money Reasons&lt;/b&gt; - Well you can&#039;t be perfect ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MK&lt;/b&gt; - Smart, but glad you&#039;re not my girlfriend - I drink so much i always need refills!
@&lt;b&gt;Lynne&lt;/b&gt; - That counts!
@&lt;b&gt;Kelly&lt;/b&gt; - Only if you&#039;re spending on stuff you need to spend on anyways and NOT just to save!  (*ahem* some of you Groupon lovers)
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - Now THAT is a trick!  Adding that one to possible future blog posts, good one!
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Ack!  Missed you by 24 hours.  Heading out to Chi-town tomorrow! (today? it&#039;s after 1a.m...yikes)]]></description>
