					<description><![CDATA[hah!  we literally JUST started cleaning up our nursery room last week :)  The wife was REALLY freaking out so we took all the junk out, repainted, and just put the crib together last night... we&#039;re getting closer!  And the wife is feeling a LOT better about it too - as am I :)  Appreciate the heads up on the diaper genie thing too - we&#039;re doing our best to lay low until we figure things out, but all this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations!  At about 6 months is when I started to panic that the nursery wasn&#039;t set up and we didn&#039;t have everything done.  At 34 weeks we had a pretty big scare and that is when my husband had his panic about not having everything done :)   You will be fine.  

Side note:  I think diaper genies are a waste of money.  I have a small foot pedal trash can that I use grocery store bags to line and take it out every other day.  I don&#039;t need a huge thing of gross diapers stinking up his room, even if they swear they won&#039;t stink.  We also do some cloth diapering to cut costs and live a little greener.  So, figure out works for you and ignore all the &quot;must haves&quot; until you figure out you must have it. . . we went out to buy a baby swing when he was about 3 weeks old because it turned out that is was necessary with our son :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whoa, haven&#039;t been here in a while! Congratulations on the baby! There&#039;s a cool Zine on Microcosm Publishing called Rad Dad (punk plus parenting) that might be of interest, I think he blogs, too. Here&#039;s the Zine link: http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/artist/tom_moniz
cheers! Jane]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The clothes! It&#039;s so easy to get overwhelmed and not know what to buy and end up with too many things of one size and nothing in the next size. Check out my handy spreadsheet listing all the clothes you really NEED for your new baby:

I&#039;m due around the same time as your wife, and I&#039;m feeling the pressure to get things done as well. At least I have most of what I need for this baby as it&#039;s my second. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, time flies doesn&#039;t it? Can&#039;t wait till you give us the good news about Little J$ when he finally makes his entry into this world. I&#039;d say if you can help it, wait until after the baby shower to buy things for the baby, but definitely have a list ready to check off so you&#039;re not left without basics when it&#039;s show time.

And as far as that bib goes, I&#039;ll do you one better. Here&#039;s a whole line of &#039;My entire life is being blogged&#039; clothing:

I especially love the little onesie..so cute!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here I am, thinking of more advice now......
I would wait on the breast pump.  I nursed all my kids, and went back to work, and never needed one.  I believe they are available to rent/borrow from some hospitals, also, if you find you do need one.  And if for whatever reason your wife is unable to nurse, don&#039;t feel bad about it.  Millions of us baby boomers did ok on formula (and formula is better now.)  But do sign yourself up at all the baby sites, because you will get cans of free formula, and good coupons for more.  Even if you do nurse, it&#039;s good to have some around.
Of course, the one thing you must have is a car seat.  Get a new one, and then plan on getting another new one in a few months, depending on how fast your Jr. grows.  My youngest son outgrew his first car seat in just a couple of months.  We nicknamed that first car seat &quot;the nutcracker.&quot;  (He was 10 1/2 lbs at birth, an anomaly you shouldn&#039;t worry about.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t read through all the comments (supposed to be working, here!) so forgive me if I say anything redundant.
You will be a wonderful father.  You have a good heart, and you WANT to be a good Daddy, and that is a great start.  In the &quot;olden days&quot; people didn&#039;t read books to learn how to parent, and I&#039;m sure that 99.9% of your instincts will be spot on.  As a &quot;seasoned&quot; mother of 6, this is my one piece of advice:  The most important thing you can do for your child is love his mother well.  That&#039;s it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Make your baby money stretch as far as you can!  
Breastfeeding:  No mixing, no bottles, no cleanup, instantly ready whenever and where ever!  Get a decent pump for $200ish.
Cloth Diaper:  You can diaper a child birth to potty learning for less than $500 and sell them when you&#039;re done for 60-70% of what you originally spent.  It&#039;s not that gross and the laundry isn&#039;t that bad! ;o)
Sleeping:  Baby doesn&#039;t NEED a bed!  Nursing moms can safely co-sleep or at least room share.  Trust me, you&#039;re not going to want to wake up and walk to another room multiple times in the night. Pack and Play in your bedroom is a must at first!  &#060;3 
Car seat:  There are some seats that will work for 5# up to 70# that are awesome, but plan on spending $250.  
Sling:  Who needs a stroller?  Get a nice comfortable sling and if you have somewhere that has a babywearing group attend a few meetings and try something out.  It&#039;s hard to engage a child from a stroller when their main POV is not even 3&#039; off the ground. 

Once Mrs.Money is up to it, get out of the house after baby is here!  You&#039;ll be hitting up the &#034;kids eat free&#034; days at restaurants before you know it!]]></description>
