Oh jeez, haha... that&#039;s certainly a hack!

Wave has been doing the trick just fine for me so far... It doensn&#039;t connect to Paypal which surprised me, but the rest has been pretty smooth and easy so I&#039;m gonna stick with it for now.... (and no hacking necessary as it&#039;s 100% free!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a small business and my bookkeeping is super simple -- so simple that I can enter a year&#039;s worth of transactions in about an hour.

I&#039;ve been using Quickbooks since 2000 so I don&#039;t really want to switch to a different program (tried Wave and Xero -- wasn&#039;t a fan), but I hate the idea of paying a monthly subscription. My &quot;hack&quot; is to pay for only one month per year for their service. In mid-Dec I activate my account and pay for a month, enter all my transactions, then have my accountant grab a copy of my books once I&#039;m done. Once she has a copy, I cancel my plan. Quickbooks keeps data for a year while cancelled, so there is no data loss (can still log in and view all reports, just can&#039;t make any changes). ~92% yearly discount for Quickbooks :)]]></description>

Haha, thanks man...

JD is in the process of redesigning his site too to be more minimal! or as he calls it - &quot;Dedesigning&quot;... 

guess we both just can&#039;t stay away for too long :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very helpful on the curation sites! It does seem like there used to be more of this kind of stuff (before I had a site of my own!). There are a couple on there that I wasn&#039;t aware of. Hopefully they are in the market for once or twice per month content from a part-timer like myself!
