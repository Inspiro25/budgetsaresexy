					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  $90 is no joke for sure. He must really love you ;)  Those tickets you got are killer! (no pun intended) I love going to those things - such an experience!
@&lt;b&gt;bogofdebt&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, whatever works :)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... same here actually, I blog and the wife studies and makes dinner - we like it ;)  Our Valentine&#039;s went pretty well, thanks for asking.  We hit up a nice dinner (we rarely go anywhere fancy), and then watched a movie and just relaxed.  Pretty normal for V Days, but we like traditional stuff sometimes :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I told my husband not to waste the money on sending flowers.  He did anyway.  $90 for 15 roses, teddy bear and chocolate.  Its a nice gesture, and I&#039;m not mad, but it was $90.  Oh well....I guess if he never remembered then I would be upset.
I got him tickets to a murder/mystery comedy dinner show.  To me that is money better spent, but hey...the flowers do look pretty on my desk and getting flowers delivered to work always makes the other girls jealous!  lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hope you all had a good one!  And your loved one treats you well EVERY day of the year, instead of just the one ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Jon B&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, it went pretty well if I do say so myself ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stacey&lt;/b&gt; - I ended up making my wife a card too :)  Complete w/ construction paper and all! haha... she said it was the best one she had gotten from me, so yay!
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, I hope it was as nice and relaxing as it sounded!  I need a Starbucks buddy to go w/ me sometimes - I always go by my lonesome :(
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah - people like to do that ;)  As long as you two are happy little peas in the pod it doesn&#039;t matter!
@&lt;b&gt;J. O.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I have the opposite problem - I always want to extend the holiday, or gift giving, or even the gift-receiving so it never ends ;)  I still haven&#039;t opened my VDay card from yesterday cuz I like looking forward to it!
@&lt;b&gt;Kim @ Say What?!&lt;/b&gt; - Funny t-shirts are awesome!  Good choice :)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed! :)
@&lt;b&gt;bobbi&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, no shame in that!
@&lt;b&gt;bogofdebt&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice.  What type of game was he playing?  Poker? World of Warcraft?
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re def. on to something there ;)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I can&#039;t wait to celebrate holidays together w/ a wee one.  I was just thinking yesterday that it will be our last Valentine&#039;s Day without a kid for the rest of our lives :) Pretty crazy!
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt; - As long as you both are happy and on the same page, right? It works :)
@&lt;b&gt;Good Cents Savings&lt;/b&gt; - OOoooh that is cool!!  I&#039;d totally do the same thing! Haha... in fact, I&#039;m kinda hungry for that right now ;) Good call.
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, hope you got everything done on that list!  If not, there&#039;s always today ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - That IS a great gift idea! Haha.... smooth work on that one ;) And your husband too!  GREAT note he sent you for sure. Y&#039;all seem happy together :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaa... well, it&#039;s a damn good tradition to have for sure - I like that :)  Y&#039;all are funny.
@&lt;b&gt;bax&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Not gonna touch that one.
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, when you tell a guy &quot;nothing&quot; the card is usually forgotten too, haha... so good job bringing that one up ;)  Sometimes I forget them though until the big time to exchange, so I gotta go rush and make one ;)  Cards are very important to my wife too - it&#039;s her favorite part.
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ SimpleIslandLiving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah you do!  And that&#039;s a-okay, it&#039;s our job to make you feel special :)
@&lt;b&gt;Skint in the City&lt;/b&gt; - That works :)  I like to go out sometimes and be in the middle of it all at dinner/etc, but usually can&#039;t take it every year, so sometimes we cook at home instead together.  Kinda fun!
@&lt;b&gt;Ms. S&lt;/b&gt; - No shame in that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Tessa&lt;/b&gt; - WOW!  Yeah I thought you were gonna say he did something crazy surprising too! Haha... jeez... it reminds me of a friend who had such a hard time picking out what he wanted to get his girl, that he ended up just giving up and giving nothing at all.  No gift, no card, nothing.  I was like, &quot;But you were out shopping for hours!  ANYTHING would have been better than nothing!&quot; Haha... he&#039;s way better about it now, but sometimes us men have to fail once or twice to get on the ball ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Monica&lt;/b&gt; - Dick&#039;s Sporting Goods would be nice! We like that kinda stuff :)  I like picking my own stuff out too sometimes  (which is why I give gift cards out a lot during birthdays/holidays to people - so they can get exactly what they want).
@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you&#039;ll have to tell me your secrets on that as we just had our last Vday without kids!  Have no idea how it&#039;ll work in the future once our 1st one comes out in July :)  Excited though!  Hope it all worked out for you last night!
@&lt;b&gt;Hermoine&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha... I still need to give Big Bang a chance too - everytime I see it I just never &quot;get it.&quot; But I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s cuz I need to watch a few in a row or something, or if it&#039;s just not my style.  It&#039;s unbelievably popular though!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME IDEA!!  I love baked cookies smell!!  Man you&#039;re smart.
@&lt;b&gt;Jefferson&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll be waiting a long time ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jai&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, you won&#039;t hear a complaint from me on that one.  I totally agree people should love their other halves every day of the week - both men and women!
@&lt;b&gt;Emma&lt;/b&gt; - All those sound fun!  Esp the picture drawing :) I did that myself last night actually, on this big card I made for the Mrs... I drew our future family on it, haha... it looks like a 3rd grader did it, but doesn&#039;t mean it didn&#039;t come from my heart!
@&lt;b&gt;Money Infant&lt;/b&gt; - I like it :)  The wife was just asking me about watching Breaking Dawn last night!  It&#039;s back on our list again to watch soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I&#039;ve celebrated Valentine&#039;s Day a couple of times with current Darling. Here are my experiences:

- went to a restaurant - horribly packed and over priced!
- went to watch an orchestra play - beautiful, happy we went, but will happily do so at any other time of year
- Went to watch &#039;Valkyrie&#039; in the cinema - made us both cry, lots of cuddling
- Don&#039;t actually remember what we did last year ???
- Yesterday, we ordered Chinese, she got ill and I had to take care of her :)

I usually buy a card and draw her lots of pictures (haven&#039;t done that in a while) but I&#039;ve been drawing her loads of pictures throughout the year so she knows what that means :)

Basically - yeah, money doesn&#039;t have to be spent. We do lots of &#039;I love you&#039; things throughout the year, and the fact it&#039;s Valentine&#039;s Day doesn&#039;t really mean that much more! I know I&#039;m never dining out on that day again though!]]></description>
