What&#039;s funny is that at the grocery stores I shop at advertise these same specials, but if I only buy one I still get the good price.  Note that these are grocery store promos, not actual coupons though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;John S @ Frugal Rules&lt;/b&gt; - Yep. It&#039;s insane that people don&#039;t take advantage of that.

@&lt;b&gt;Ross&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, thanks man! We haven&#039;t tried LEDs yet but I&#039;ll give it a shot :) And then if those burn out we&#039;ll know that it&#039;s something jacked up with our electrical or something - it would have to be? :(

@&lt;b&gt;Anne @ Unique Gifter&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Awesome. I love you for that :)

@&lt;b&gt;Joanna @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;d freak out after 2 months too! That&#039;s crazy talk right there ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - You can probably just read it online too if you prefer - I know a lot of people do (I don&#039;t though cuz I like holding real-life things in my hand! Esp since I don&#039;t have to stare at another screen for more hours on end).

@&lt;b&gt;Manette @ Barbara Friedberg Personal Finance&lt;/b&gt; - It will always be that way too :(

@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - For sure. Coupons are not always sexy!

@&lt;b&gt;Punky Coletta&lt;/b&gt; - First, I love your name :) Second, I still need to read that book!! I&#039;ve had a copy of it for years now but keep forgetting to place it on my nightstand to remind me! So thanks - gonna go find it and drop it off there so I can start picking it up again :) Glad you got so much out of it!

@&lt;b&gt;Kin&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly. You can&#039;t make a budget on numbers you don&#039;t know about!

@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - Haha def. tricky :) Same thing happens to me but on Amazon.

@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Well it&#039;s awesome you at least USE your library! I always forget about those places :( So I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve saved plenty over the years to make up for your fees, haha... keep it up!

@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a GREAT idea for a new site btw ;) &quot;SendMeYourGiftCards.com!&quot; Haha...

@&lt;b&gt;JD Maybe&lt;/b&gt; - Hi friend!!! Always be hustlin&#039;, right? :) Hope things are well in your hood too - it&#039;s def. been a while.

@&lt;b&gt;Jane Savers @ The Money Puzzle&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m sure of it. And people will ALWAYS use them too as they&#039;re just so convenient.

@&lt;b&gt;Sharleen&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!! I love it that they&#039;re illegal in Australia! I bet it&#039;ll get that way here too shortly, if it&#039;s not already on the books. Cool you&#039;re reading this from Australia too :)

@&lt;b&gt;Rebecca&lt;/b&gt; - Sweet!! We need to follow in your country&#039;s footsteps :) In many ways...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always have partially-spent gift cards around.  It&#039;s illegal for them to expire in Canada.  So if I have any money at all left on a card, I keep it until the next time I spend at that store.  Once, I only got 26 cents off a gift card and paid the rest in cash -- but it was 26 cents!

Sometimes it takes a really long for me to get back to the store.  Sometimes it does take a year or two for me to spend an entire gift card.  But eventually, they all get used.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am guilty of the giftcard one, but good on all others, I live in Australia and here it illegal to sell standard light bulbs so everyone has no choice but to buy energy efficient ones. 
 I am fairly good with turning things off but I have an energy meter in my house that tells me how much electricity I am using at any given moment, and avarages for day, month etc, It motivates me to aim for 4cents per an hour when it&#039;s not hot (when hot I run the house at $1 an hour (got the energy meter from the government as they were offering lots of energy saving things for $50).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe the unused gift card statistic.  I will never give my sons a gift card again.  They just seem to stress the seams of their wallets and never get used.  

There is a cash machine at the Costco I shop at.  A friend shopping with me used it and was charged a $3.00 bank connection fee or some other absurd justification for the fee.  Now, whenever I am at Costco, there is always someone using the machine.  Seems very wasteful and I think it is safe to assume that a lot of machines in gas stations and other stores charge a similiar fee.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post is so on point! When I look at all the leaks in my budget it&#039;s eye opening-and really frustrating. I have found unused gift cards, noticed a large number of fees (not overdraft) just bullsh$t fees from the bank, book fines from the library. The list goes on. I had to think about the online coupon thing. And now realize that if I hadn&#039;t received coupons maybe I wouldn&#039;t have purchased the last outfit that I bought online. Huh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$2 Billion – The value of gift cards that went unspent in 2011

WOW!  Send those gift cards to me! hahaha. I&#039;d use them that&#039;s for sure.

And coupons are really tricky.  I think they change your mind set.  Almost like ebay does for me.  For instance I sold 2 things on ebay yet some how I find myself looking for things to buy.  Am I buying they because they are a good deal and I would have bought them anyway?  Or because I am on ebay already? or because I feel awesome because I just made 10 bucks? 

... I have got to work on that...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It always amazes me how much wastefulness go unobserved and unmitigated, be it in energy usage or simply being unaware of banke fees.  I think the bottom line is, we should have a better grasp of what are our &quot;resources&quot; and learn to how to use them efficiently.  

Personal finance wise, people should always have a ball-park idea of what and where they monthly spendings are going...  This is before making any kind of sexy budget :)]]></description>
