LOVE THAT!!!

Was it you who recommended that video to me the other week? I finally watched it with the baby late one night and couldn&#039;t stop thinking about it for a week.. Finally had to stop because it was saddening me too much, haha... (but I did soak up the message and trying to implement more in my life!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea! I saw there was a section on minimalism...

One time when I was a substitute teacher, I made up a project for the 5th grade kids. I had them watch &quot;The Story of Stuff&quot; (20 minute free video online), then I broke them up into groups and had them pick an item and research the entire life cycle from extraction, manufacture, distribution, use and then disposal. Then they gave a presentation on what they found. When I asked what they learned, almost all seemed to agree to buy and get less stuff. They even said they would ask their parents to buy them less stuff for birthdays and holidays. I couldn&#039;t believe it, I was blown away. 

Also, another good website for the older high schoolers could be this: steadystate.org. This is run mostly by economists.]]></description>

LOL. I think she has enough to do teaching her own students, without laying the responsibility on her for teaching the whole of America!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a fantastic idea. I particularly like the idea of giving the kids autonomy to follow their own interests, but by reporting back to the whole class then they all get to hear a smattering of information that will more than likely cover all bases, by the time a whole class gives their reports.
I&#039;d love to do this, but as a Theatre Studies and English teacher, my time is taken up by other, more &#039;wordy&#039; concerns... onomatopoeia anyone?]]></description>
