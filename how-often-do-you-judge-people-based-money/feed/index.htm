That, and also stay concerned with OURSELVES over others too, since at the end of the day that&#039;s all that matters :) Well, that and our family and friends and what have you, but you get the point. What other people are doing usually doesn&#039;t affect us regardless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess you can apply this to everything in life! Try not to be so judgemental and just focus on the positive. I have a tendency to be more a pessimist honestly so I have to really work at this to really make it happen!]]></description>

Oh, update. My landlords stole money out of my security deposit for cleaning fees and stuff that was already like it was when I moved in. 

Can&#039;t say that&#039;s improved my opinion much. In my experience, landlords don&#039;t do what&#039;s necessary, steal security deposits, and, overall, suck.]]></description>

Wow - that&#039;s pretty awesome of you to be so lenient with your tenant!! I&#039;d be so pissed if ours couldn&#039;t pay for so long - especially since we lose money each month on ours anyways :( Good for you on trying to work it out with them - I hope things get back to normal soon over there and you finally get paid up!]]></description>

At least you KNOW the position you&#039;re in and you&#039;re now *working towards a better life!* That&#039;s more than I can say for a lot of people in debt. You can only change the future, so keep on going strong my friend. Every little bit helps!]]></description>

I&#039;m guilty on the exercising habits :( I seem to prioritize my hustles and then family time to the point I leave out working out.. Something I need to def. get better at now that I&#039;m no longer on a soccer/football team which used to do the trick. Just NOT fun at all I think is the problem, haha... I think I need a work out buddy. Want to come down to VA a few times a week and help me? :)]]></description>

Agreed! Perhaps everyone here gets judged more than those we&#039;re judging! So it all evens out in the end! Haha...]]></description>

That&#039;s interesting... I feel like it&#039;s much more competitive in the corporate world too. Not that I have much to go on considering its&#039; been a solid 10 years, at least, since I was last in that space :) The rest of my &quot;real world&quot; experience before becoming a full-time blogger was at startups where people were too busy to care about what others were wearing, haha... Plus, we all wore t-shirts and jeans anyways so we were all in the same &quot;bucket.&quot;]]></description>
