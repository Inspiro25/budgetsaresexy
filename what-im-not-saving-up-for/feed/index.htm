					<description><![CDATA[I am saving for a new house, car and vacation. I need to add a line item for clothes.  I definitely spend over $100.  I think have to battle my spendthrift ways.  I always have to balance between excess and deprivation.  Everything in moderation.

I don&#039;t have a desire for a new car and house.  But I know in the future, I will.  I do not need two or three floors either.  I love a one-floor ranch and some acreage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I love that feeling at Best Buy too!
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;svelte&quot; - haven&#039;t heard that word in a while :)
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - YES!! LOVE IT!  I actually don&#039;t enjoy Christmas as much either because of all the presents going around... I Have everything I need!  Although I do like &quot;make your own present&quot; Christmases when we have those.  Like your donation idea too :)
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMan @ FinancialOdyssey&lt;/b&gt; - Cars do suck your money over time and depreciate.  But then again most of us need one!	
@&lt;b&gt;Michele&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yes - babies are pretty bad for the wallet ;)  It&#039;s a good thing we all love them so much!  Or at least love that we, ourselves, were once born a baby! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;I just want to go to college, be healthy, and enjoy my life every day.&quot; Awwww, that is wonderful :)  Thanks so much for sharing.
@&lt;b&gt;Lisa Morosky&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s nice to think differently sometimes :)
@&lt;b&gt;brooklyn money&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, having no goals can blow.  I&#039;ve been there many a times and def. not as exciting, even though I&#039;d take that over spending w/ no goals!
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - WHAT?!! No microwave?  Are you from the 1800s? haha... I bet your body is healthier because of it :)
@&lt;b&gt;JoeTaxpayer&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re 48 eh?  Wouldn&#039;t have guessed. So young at heart! :) ANd uh..ofcourse, in age too.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not saving up for those things either. 
Right now, it&#039;s saving for retirement. 
I am 48, and need the market to return 6-3/4%/yr for the next 7 years and we will have achieved our &quot;number.&quot; This is the same timing that our daughter will head off to college, and the mortgage will be paid off. Given the last decade, there&#039;s likely to be some reversion to the mean, but I&#039;m not counting on and don&#039;t expect the 10% average the long term has shown.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great post.  It&#039;s fun to think about what I don&#039;t spend money on :)  We don&#039;t need money for DVRs or anything made by Apple Computer.  We have an old TV and will only buy a modern one when we are forced, by the current one ceasing to work.  We have basic cable and don&#039;t want digital or the box required for that.  We don&#039;t rent or buy movies and have gone to a movie theatre around 3 times since 1996 - and that&#039;s because we won tickets.  I&#039;m glad I happened to be online when Sicko was available to watch for free, because that is one movie we would have paid to see if we had to.  I&#039;d personally prefer to meditate than watch most movies, even if they were free.  And I don&#039;t really meditate - I just have a hard time staying awake in front of a boring movie, which to me most of them are.  I do like electronics very much, such as computers, cell phones - Android for our most modern one, and I got a Kindle that I really like.  I secretly (lol) prefer non-iPhone clones for cell phones, but it seems everyone has one and cool things can be done with them, like scanning check deposits to your bank.  I&#039;m waiting for that ability on mine.  With PagePlus Cellular, one doesn&#039;t have to go broke on cell phone plans, but you&#039;d better have WiFi on the phone to make it work.

We&#039;ve never owned a microwave oven!  In looking at homes, we see we may get one included in the deal.  Haha.  Have never felt a need for one.  I wouldn&#039;t want too big of a house, if we do decide to buy a home.  We saw one that is 1866 square feet, and I think that is perfect.  I like value in clothing, preferably low prices, but will spend more on rare occasions.  I bought some excellent cookware many years ago, and only need to purchase new non-stick pans from time to time.  Good cookware is an investment, if cooking is something you do all the time.  We don&#039;t have to save for education or Christmas, as those are either not relevant or our involvement is minimal.

With all these things that we don&#039;t spend on save for, we can save for the things we really want and also have what we really want in the meantime]]></description>
