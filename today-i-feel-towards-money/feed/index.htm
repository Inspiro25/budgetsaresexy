					<description><![CDATA[Haha I remember Mongooses!  And I also remember never being able to afford one ;)  Although, in those days all I cared for was the original Nintendo Game Boy.   Cool you tried that Mentos experiment too - still on my list to try out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. The most I’ve spent this last week was on a Hotel Room (4 nights in Times Square for $500.00-Priceline rocks!).
2. Today I feel ambivalent towards money. Just not something I care about. I don&#039;t mean to sound like a pr*ck but I have plenty of money. There are far more important things to concern myself with. That said, I used to be all hung up on money and that probably helped me somewhat. 
3. Money can’t buy happiness. One free/inexpensive thing I did last week that made me happy was do a Diet Coke/Mentos experiment with my daughters. Great fun! Also, cutting a rather large check for Community Ministries (local food bank) made me feel like a million bucks. There is no better feeling in the world.
4. I will consider this week a success if I encourage, love, support and spend time with my family. That is what makes life worthwhile for me!
5. My first job was working at a bicycle shop when I was 9. I worked toward buying a Mongoose BMX bike. Took about 6 months of after school chain greasing, tire changing and bike assembly. Totally worth it. Mongoose was THE bike to have.

					<description><![CDATA[@J. Money - Hahaha!  I think that is why all guys want to become lifeguards.  I just did it because I was a water polo player and was at the pool all the time.  Might as well get paid for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, I moved just over 3 months ago from Windsor, ON, right across from Detroit.

Jobs are hard to come by anywhere, but especially there, one of the highest unemployment rates in the Canada I believe. It is getting better, but the city depends on the auto sector too much.

I&#039;ve only been walking around my neighbourhood of late, but I want to get walking downtown again, it&#039;s about a 40 minute ride there, but well worth it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those are the cheaper cigarettes, 10 packs to a carton for two smokers.  I don&#039;t like to buy them often, so I buy the quantity at once.  Most of that cost is tax - tax is most of the sale price, and tax is added afterwards.  I think it&#039;s a great time to quit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - New radiator?  Ouch.  At least your car should be back in action now!
@&lt;b&gt;Brandon&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I never do brotha!  I&#039;m all about any job that gets your work out there and interacting with the community.  Even more so w/ jobs you&#039;re passionate about ;)
@&lt;b&gt;JMK&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I like throwing things on my card too for that kinda stuff, as long as everyone pays back like they should!  I always have to keep an eye on some of my friends. haha....
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie S&lt;/b&gt; - Oh no, why are you going to lose your mind or cry?  Do you need me to show up in your videos again? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Christine&lt;/b&gt; - YES! Good job getting that 401(k) up and running!!! My fave tool ever.
@&lt;b&gt;Kitchen Penguin&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, did you ever live in Japan?  Did you know I lived in Korea before?  My mom tought English when we were there, she loved it.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - I always wanted to be a lifeguard.  Mainly to meet chicks, but also to be fit and tan and hang out by the pool all day long ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - WHAT?  Are they lined with gold? No idea how much they cost since I don&#039;t smoke, but man that seems like a lot.
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley Jacobs&lt;/b&gt; - You graduated cuz you thought you wanted to be an &quot;adult,&quot; haha... I made the mistake too, don&#039;t worry.
@&lt;b&gt;Suzanne&lt;/b&gt; - Well only 5 more days to go until you need tat $50 in there - I&#039;m watching you!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;KaseyS&lt;/b&gt; - OUCH.  Yet another reason I need to get back to renting - this home stuff is way too expensive for my taste.  (and never heard of Fazolis, but it sounds tasty ;) I worked at this Italian place tha I can&#039;t even recall its name... was a small local one).
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Wipeout! haha.. never have I ever watched a show that make me tear up from laughing so hard.  I don&#039;t know what it is but that one just kills me! One of our readers here at Budgets Are Sexy was actually one it, did you know that?  Pretty cool stuff.
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Well I hope your convincing works!  If you need help, send him over here and I&#039;ll see what I can do ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Toronto! Beautiful city... I&#039;d walk a lot too if I were there (where did you move from? somewhere else in Canada?)
@&lt;b&gt;Valencia&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  Thanks for stopping by :)  Going over now to check out your answers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. The most I’ve spent this last week was 67.61 on Halo: Reach. Not regretting that at all.
2. Today I feel happy towards money. After doing up my budget, I know I have extra money at the end of the month.
3. Money can’t buy happiness. One free/inexpensive thing I did last week that made me happy was walking my new city of Toronto.
4. I will consider this week a success if everything goes well at work.
5. My first job was being a paper boy. My first real job was at McDonald&#039;s, did it for 8 years, but really helped through high school and college.]]></description>
