Both are annoying, but equally smart! 

Actually, I don&#039;t know which one is smarter to have... probably life insurance I&#039;d reckon. There&#039;s no avoiding that kicking in one day :(]]></description>

Oh yeah - I remember having to up my auto insurance stuff too, but I can&#039;t remember if it was because I moved into VA and it was a VA thing, or an umbrella policy thing (I did both at the same time). Either way, I know my car insurance didn&#039;t rise at all... it went down! (But prob cuz I moved from one state to another ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had an umbrella policy for the better part of 6 or 7 years now and I never regret having it. It costs $128/yr for 1MM in coverage in our case. For people trying to cut back every expense this is one area where you shouldn&#039;t. I can find other ways to save that money and not be exposed to unwanted liability. People are quick to sue, and lawyers like large settlements!

One thing to remember at least for our policy anyways is that you need to up your auto coverage from 100/300k to 300/500k to qualify for the umbrella. But again it really is money well spent in my opinion. 

Smart post J-money!]]></description>
