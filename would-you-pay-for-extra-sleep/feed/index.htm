					<description><![CDATA[I would certainly love more hours in the day!  I definitely don&#039;t get as much sleep as I should but if I could buy extra hours I wouldn&#039;t use them all on sleep.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;d pay $100 for each day I could tack on an extra 4 hours after midnight.  Let me know when you figure out how to do that :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That powder scares me, but that stimulator thing might be worth a shot?  Although usually when I actually MAKE it to bed I&#039;m fine - I pass out in a heartbeat.  It&#039;s the getting there I have trouble with ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had some success reducing my sleep needs using a weird supplement powder called &#034;the Missing Link.&#034; In college, my dorm would gather &#039;round during finals week and solemnly down it, mixed with Mountain Dew. So nasty! But effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a sleep substitute, there&#039;s binaural stimulators, which you can just download to any device with earphones. You can download them from Amazon.com, or there are some really nifty free ones avaialble at themeditationpodcast.com. (Can&#039;t hurt to try!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a great new article from the NY Times about sleep and insomnia http://nyti.ms/cLesp3 . I don&#039;t know if I would pay for sleep though...that would probably bring more sleepless nights about how I&#039;m going to pay for it!]]></description>
