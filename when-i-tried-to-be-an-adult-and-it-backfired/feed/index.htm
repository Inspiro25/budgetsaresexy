					<description><![CDATA[Hmm Not sure about keeping spare phones and laptops for emergencies when amazon Now and prime exist. Especially a laptop you are likely to lose as much time on updates to the OS that it needs from suddenly being allowed online then waiting for delivery of a new one! Each to their own though and everyone has a different idea on DR (Disaster recovery).

Working in IT we tend to have DR plans like these, when it comes round to pulling the laptop from 2003 out of the box and realising it wont even connect to the network anymore is where they usually come unhinged!]]></description>

We try to do that same thing with gifts too... And recently even started picking each other up clothes from the thrift store, that way if they don&#039;t fit or the other person doesn&#039;t like we can just return in the form of a donation which becomes a gift in itself :) And a bonus: you can go out of your comfort zone a little and pick up something they&#039;ll either REALLY love or wanna vomit all over and in either case it&#039;s okay as it only cost a few bucks, haha...]]></description>

Thanks Cynthia :) Amazing how much you continually learn about yourself as the days go by... Just when you think you&#039;ve figured it out your brain throws out another puzzle to solve!]]></description>

Oh wow haha... yeah, I&#039;m not that bad :)

I actually go through my closets and drawers approx once a month and look for at least one or two things to get rid of... Which makes it easier to finally let go of the stuff you SWEAR you&#039;ll use one day but you never do. After the third round of asking yourself you finally wise up :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aside from the technology question (I keep old stuff til it is obsolete) -- we operate in a similar fashion -- wear it out before you buy something new(used). Cars, home goods, clothes, tech.

EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE I think that I should be grown up and buy new sheets and towels, etc etc but where does it stop?  I&#039;m in my mid-50&#039;s now, and I think back to all the money I would have spend on &quot;refreshing&quot; stuff that I really didn&#039;t need...and what I spent that money on instead! Travel! Kitchen remodel! Early retirement options! I think these were worth being &quot;out of fashion&quot; sometimes...and I could not have had both.
I tell my kids-- You can have almost ANYTHING but you probably can&#039;t have EVERYTHING. Make your choices and dave for it.
