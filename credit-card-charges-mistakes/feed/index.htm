					<description><![CDATA[Wowww, that is horrible I&#039;m sorry!!  And obviously not surprised! ;)  Crazy we both had experiences w/ both United AND Marriott!  haha... but you hit the nail on the head - at the end of each issue it was the places w/ GOOD customer service that gets us to come back or not.  Even though both places tried screwing us over, only one actually goes out of their way to try and resolve it. It&#039;s not that hard of a concept.  If your company CARES, people will come back.  If not, they write dirty blog posts about you ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I flew United to and from the conference and will NEVER fly with them again. They were rude, awful and I know of many people  on the flights I was on who also had numerous problems and will never fly them again.

They only allowed 1 hour to catch a connecting fight. I flew in from Sydney to LA, had to clear customs, pick up and recheck my bag and get to the other gate for my next flight within 1 hour of the plane landing. Completely impossible, then trying to get my connecting flight changed was a nightmare (although there were 15 of us who missed flights apparently). That was just the tip of the ice berg. Worst customer service ever.

When checking out of the Marriott they overcharged by a few hundred and then tried double charging my card. My bank was saying the payment had gone through they were saying it had not. It was quite stressful but they sorted it as quickly as they could, gave me free food and drink whilst I waited and helped me out heaps. I was able to call my bank in Australia from their phones for free to sort it out too. They were so apologetic. It was a system glitch or something, but they customer service was the best ever, so I would totally stay with them again.

And this post is spot on as to why we should be vigilant with our finances!

(Add to United and Marriott, my own bank tried to stuff me with fees upon my return from the conference, which I promptly got refunded, but will be changing banks. Stupid fees are everywhere!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;too funny&lt;/b&gt; - GREAT!!!  Yes, stick to your guns and don&#039;t give up!  It&#039;s annoying as $hit, but you&#039;ll feel a lot better in the end for fighting no matter what the outcome.  Giving it your all does wonders - just not in the short term ;)  If you ever want to vent and write about it, shoot me over a draft and maybe we could use it one day?  Sucky situation.
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I actually like American Airlines -- it&#039;s UNITED that&#039;s pissing me off like no other ;)  You&#039;re right w/ Marriott customer service though - they seem to know how to handle things pretty efficiently.  Just *answering the phone* as a human is a huge step away from others!
@&lt;b&gt;Jason&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I WISH I flew Southwest more!  It&#039;s either never an option for me, or they cost way more than the others -- though when you factor in baggage and stupid random fees, then yeah - prob cheaper in long run too.  I def. want to check them out soon, it&#039;s been a while.
@&lt;b&gt;Peter&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, GOOD CATCH for sure!!  That&#039;s super frustating indeed, I&#039;m glad y&#039;all were smooth enough to squash it before you got outta there.  Though your financial skills don&#039;t surprise me ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ben Edwards&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like the way you think, sir ;)  Getting a blog post out of it makes ALL experiences a bit more tolerable! Esp as they get more and more ridiculous (*ahem* United).  Thanks for sharing bro - hope to catch up soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know what you mean about the service from AmEx, I called them at like 3 AM one night back in January right before I left on a trip and grilled them about my rental car insurance.  

They were chipper and helpful and answered the barrage of questions I threw at them. I even took notes as I went so I could write up this blog post on insurance surprises and they were very patient as I kept asking questions and scribbling away at my notes.

I figured if I was going to be up researching it at 3 AM  I mine as well get a blog post out of it :)

Good luck with United.  Maybe you should make a video, kind of like the &quot;United Breaks Guitars&quot; ones a while back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an experience a while back where we got a rental car for 8 days to drive around New England - putting about 1200 miles on it or so.  We had rented the car using a coupon code and corporate code - and were supposed to be getting free mileage. 

When we showed up at the airport to drop off the car on our way home (on our way to catch a fllight) we got a rude awakening when the agent slid our bill across the counter.  Instead of the $500 or so that we were supposed to be charged, the bill had morphed into a 1000+ whopper! 

The situation was stressful as we were heading into the airport to catch a flight, but thankfully we had all our paperwork with us showing that we should have gotten unlimited mileage/etc - and they were able to fix our bill.  

Just glad that I didn&#039;t just take the receipt and walk through the airport doors - and have to deal with it later.  Would have been much harder to prove. :)
