					<description><![CDATA[Having been laid off, the $150 would go towards purchasing some quality interview outfits. My last position allowed use to wear jeans daily, so my professional wardrobe is lacking. I&#039;d probably use Retailmenot&#039;s discount codes for Macy&#039;s and Banana Republic so I can stretch my money and be ready for any corporate interviews.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would use it to buy new work clothes! Recently employed with my first &quot;real&quot; job, and only have nice winter clothes. Time to start thinking about spring and summer! Kohl&#039;s, Macy&#039;s, anything along those lines on RetailMeNot works for me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Me and my partner never really celebrate Valentine&#039;s Day. Even after almost 14 years. Just another day on the calendar for us both. If I were to win, I&#039;d would just split the $150 between us both so we could each pick up a little something for ourselves. 

I would probably take advantage of the Best Buy 20% off small appliance coupon from ReatilMeNot and put It toward the purchase of an Keurig Brewer since I&#039;ve been wanting one for quite some time now, but didn&#039;t want to spend a fortune on one either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would use the $150 to invest in 1-2 pairs of quality shoes for myself - I am so tired of cheap flats that have no support and make my back hurt by the end of the day! I would stretch my $$$ by using the Starbucks offer on retailmenot - you get a free drink when you join the rewards program! I love getting to know new coworkers by taking them out to coffee and by joining a rewards program, I could stretch my $$$ even further!]]></description>
