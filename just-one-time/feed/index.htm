					<description><![CDATA[I used to get a bagel almost every morning on my way to work. Bagel and XL coffee. It&#039;s only $6 - or so I kept telling myself. But when I realized what that came out to monthly, I decided that I needed to stop, or at least cut back. 

Now, I only hit the bagel place on Fridays. It&#039;s my &quot;you made it through another week treat&quot; and it means so much more, because I look forward to it more since it&#039;s more &quot;occasional&quot; than every day! 

There is always a balance to be found.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This actually makes perfect sense. The more you eat out...the more you desire to eat out and it&#039;s because of you basically spoiling yourself. Its the exact same thing with a child. If you keep giving his or her their way, they&#039;re going to want to continue to have their way. Therefore, you have to put your foot down and make your no mean no. So we have to do the exact same thing to ourselves...make our no mean no when it comes to continuously treating ourselves.

To add, I hope their wasn&#039;t a second date because he obviously didn&#039;t &quot;get it&quot; lol.]]></description>

I tried so hard to convince myself to be more like you in the past years because I kept hearing so many times that you SHOULD treat yourself a little bit when say, you get a raise or a windfall. After all, one of ten is better than none of ten, right? Alas no, my brain simply won&#039;t do it. :)  Oh well. We work with what we have!]]></description>

Fantastic hack!

Will just have to remember to eat in the car though since it would be rude to try and sneak it into the coffee shops :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I identified mine immediately.  I used to be happy with Crystal Light mixed with ice water and a splash of real lemon juice in those gigantic cheap bottles from Costco.  Then somehow I started on these cans of Minute Maid lemonade with only 5 calories and it is so much better than Crystal Light.  I limit the household to 4 cases a month, that&#039;s 48 between my husband and I.  I don&#039;t drink alcohol and we rarely eat out.  Can I please have my one treat?? Oh my husband just went to Winco specifically to buy it as they were out on Monday when I was there.  It was $31.01 for the 4 cases and the CA deposit fee.]]></description>
