My problem now is I&#039;m addicted to looking through my spam folder every day... And slightly disappointed every time I don&#039;t find anything :(.
Beers were from Firestone Walker, a brewery just north of LA - actually located in a pretty cool wine region my wife and I visit a lot. Types were &quot;805&quot; (which is mass-produced now - it blew up over the last few years and is available everywhere) and &quot;Union Jack IPA&quot; which is gaining popularity and is one of the more basic west coast ipas they make. I enjoyed them both :)]]></description>

Thanks Matt. I still feel like it&#039;s his baby. I&#039;m just the foster dad taking care of it until he changes his mind and wants the baby back! :)]]></description>
