Ahhhh, yeah - they still look pretty good to me! I suppose you can factor in age or other variables, but then again the point is really just to motivate yourself to keep climbing and look at things in a different light, so I think it still accomplishes that keeping it nice and simple as it is. But you&#039;re more than welcome to tweak it to better push yourself! Whatever it takes to keep that fire lit! :)]]></description>

Was thinking about these categories you said you only put a few minutes of thought into
0%-10% – Meh
10%-25% – Now we’re cooking!
25-50% – You’re on fire, baby! Give me your number!
50-100% – Marry me.
100%-1,000% – How do I get into your will?

Would be interested to know if you had any additional thoughts on what a reasonable target should be.  Possibly by age.]]></description>

Hey dude! Glad you liked that!!

I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &quot;categories&quot;, but it is a good reminder to update the ol&#039; LWR in my spreadsheet as it&#039;s def. been a while :) I&#039;ll have to find a way to make it go viral more so more people start paying attention! It really is a great way to put your entire life&#039;s earnings and savings in perspective!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s pretty cool.  I wonder what it would have predicted for me 40 years ago?  I would not have guessed my pay would have gone from x to 24x. Or that I&#039;d receive a 7 figure windfall I absolutely did not need after already achieving financial independence. But I also would have guessed 10% inflation and 15% raises,  because that&#039;s what the 80&#039;s were like. I did run it from my 21 year old perspective,  oddly it was pretty close to actual even though actual inflation did not stay high. Plus it says I&#039;ll die with 40 million. I better go look at private jets!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have always liked the concept you created on the Lifetime Wealth Ratio.  Would love to see an update on what you think about the categories you set before you go.  After more than a decade of doing this, my guess is you might have a bit more insight now that when you first published the concept.]]></description>
