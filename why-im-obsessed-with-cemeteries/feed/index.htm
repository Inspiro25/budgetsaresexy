Wowwww that is so fascinating!!

Is that done to preserve *space* there in Germany, I&#039;m guessing? People would NOT be happy with that here, haha.... Though eventually we&#039;ll run out of space too so who knows what the future will hold :)

Thanks for stopping by the blog today - always nice to meet another cemetery lover! Weird or not, it won&#039;t stop us from enjoying it! :) Happy New Year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m so glad I found your post. I love to walk through cemeteries and could spend hours reading the tomb inscriptions. I always wonder who they were or what kind of life they have lived. Or why they died, especially the younger ones. I always thought I was weird and never bring it up in conversation because I didn’t want people thinking I’m a weirdo. But just like you mentioned, there’s no better place to make you appreciate life more than to visit the monuments of all those who’ve lost it.

I’m originally from Germany and we don’t have old cemeteries because in Germany you only lease your grave for 25 years. After that your descendants can either extend the lease for another 25 years or they’ll dig up your remains and put you in an unmarked mass grave. At every entrance of a German cemetery they have a message board behind glass that informs people when leases are up. I believe they’ll send descendants a letter in the mail six months in advance to give them enough time to make arrangements. So as you can imagine, it’s very uncommon to see a grave that’s older than 50-75 years. When I visited a cemetery in the U.S. for the first time and saw a grave of someone who had died in the mid 1800s, I about crapped my pants. I couldn’t believe it. So, yes, it may be a creepy hobby, but it doesn’t bother me. Besides, wouldn’t it be great if a complete stranger stood by your grave 150 years after you died and wondered who you were? They’d know your name, your date of birth and when you died. The rest would be lost to history. Anyway, I’m glad to know I’m not the only ”weirdo” hahaha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to walk through a large cemetery every morning with my son to get to his school.  It&#039;s surprisingly refreshing.  It&#039;s such a mixture of emotions to have school kids playing and laughing on the path, people putting flowers on headstones, new graves being dug, veterans flags waving, parents greeting one another... all in one place.]]></description>

YESS!!! I&#039;ve been there!!!! Didn&#039;t appreciate it as much as I would now, but my Lord was that one beautiful - and sad - place... Those tombs are like 10 deep on top of each other! That whole country is so beautiful and fascinating though - easily my favorite of all the countries I&#039;ve been to in my life :) Maybe my next trip will be to your parents house?? They wouldn&#039;t be too freaked if a random mohawked guy knocked on their door during sunset, would they? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money,

My parent’s house where I grew up in is actually behind a cemetery! I remember when I had friends over as a kid they would freak out. It was always normal to me. As I got older I would go there to take morning walks, it was so peaceful. And yes, it does give one perspective and appreciation. So, I understand your love for cemeteries. This post made me smile and reflect for a moment.

BTW, if you haven’t, you should visit Prague, their Old Jewish Cemetery is a must-see. They also have tours of other cemeteries and there are even blog posts around the internet on Prague’s hidden ones! :-)]]></description>
