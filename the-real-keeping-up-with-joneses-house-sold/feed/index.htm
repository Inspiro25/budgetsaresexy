&quot;Maybe there is even a coin mint so you would be able to issue your own J-Money (silver and gold coins only of course). &quot;

STOP TEMPTING ME!! I was just reading a story on a guy who bought an island and then named himself &quot;King&quot; of it and minted coins with his face on them haha.... They could make for great business cards! ;)

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I like castles, You should have jumped into the auction anyway. You could have renamed it to the Sexy Castle and call the property Budgetland :D Maybe there is even a coin mint so you would be able to issue your own J-Money (silver and gold coins only of course). Soon it would become the place of pilgrimage for the PF community.

I really like Harry Potter, but the property prices in England are insane. I like their nice towns, but I have claustrophobia in their tiny homes. Living there would be a reason enough to want to go to the Hogwarts as soon as possible. However, I would move into a hobbit-hole anytime without a second thought :)]]></description>

More than likely, yup :)

This is exactly why I have to remind myself that &quot;anyone can buy that!&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[I occasionally find myself wondering how people afford things like tons of travel AND a nice house in a big city with high COL AND new cars for both spouses AND nights out on the town, etc. Then I remember they are probably where I was before - charging it to their credit cards and hoping they don&#039;t go over their limits.]]></description>
