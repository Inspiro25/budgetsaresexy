					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Elena @ Reinvent Your Career&lt;/b&gt; - I used to put in 90% and have basically a $100 paycheck for 2 months until it was maxed out myself ;) Pretty much sucked living off pennies for a while (our savings would go down during these times), but then for the rest of the year I was getting 100% of my paychecks and watching my 401k investments grow! Def. a cool trade off if you can work it out... Even plowing in 10% into 401k would do wonders over your lifetime...
@&lt;b&gt;savvyfinanciallatina&lt;/b&gt; - Right? Pretty impressive.
@&lt;b&gt;Adam Hathaway&lt;/b&gt; - Great question for her :) I&#039;d imagine she does though - most people who pull this off are SUPER good with their money and frugality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is a great collage!  It is beyond me how anyone can be saving so much for retirement!  Does Gina have room for any other spending in her life(if she even needs to)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This collage is really cool! I like the first note saying &quot;Never Lose Money&quot; and the second one &quot;Never Forget Rule #1&quot;. Hahaha. This is too funny! Saving 85% into someone 401k sounds quite impressive, but who can do that these days except for celebrities?...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pretty funny that her dad would keep rent receipts in a safe deposit box.  I once had a friend who found a great deal on diapers, so she bought a year supply.  But she didn&#039;t have room in her house so she rented a storage unit.  Probably wasn&#039;t her most savvy spending moment :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, we wouldn&#039;t discriminate if you wanted to give it a shot later ;) Maybe your thought process/design skills would be totally different than what we&#039;re used to seeing! That would be fun!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Probably.
@&lt;b&gt;Debt an the Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Me too :) Reminds me of like 2nd grade all over again. We don&#039;t get to create much as adults! (or at least get forced to)]]></description>
