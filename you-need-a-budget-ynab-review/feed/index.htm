					<description><![CDATA[Surprised to see all the negative feedback.  I use and love YNAB.  Like the story says, I was a mess before YNAB.  All that is different now.  Before, no matter how hard I tried, I could not budget.  I was missing something but couldn&#039;t figure out what.  YNAB helped me, and taught me, how to manage my money.  Their process, and classes to teach you how to use it, are the best ever.  Before YNAB I couldn&#039;t even dream big enough to dream of where I am today, 5 years later.  

When changing from YNAB4 to the new YNAB, there were many snags along the way, and the reports still aren&#039;t great.  None of that takes away the dreams YNAB has helped me achieve.  

I understand many people don&#039;t need a budget. Some can do this FI thing without one.  I couldn&#039;t. I needed one and am grateful I did.  YNAB has completely changed the way I think about money today, all for the better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in the UK and the new YNAB’s automatic import tool does not work with UK banks. I think YNAB is a great app and deserves appreciation and acknowledgement for what they have done. However, $84 per year is too much and I’m really struggling to convince myself to pay a premium price. A cheaper alternative might be GoodBudget app.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They have not added a way to print (or output a budget report). They smugly brag that it is like the iphone not having a headphone jack. Sorry guys (it&#039;s just lazy). When you have spent months inputting data and you want to print it or report, not being able to do so is very frustrating. 

At least with an iphone, you can use a bluetooth headset or an adapter for a wired headset. YNAB offer no way to get anything out except your raw data (basically your bank statement).

For me it is a dealbreaker.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry to hear that Lori. That is not at all the experience we are going for! I&#039;d love to help you get your budget up and running properly. If you send me your email (lindsey @ ynab .com) we&#039;ll look into your account and make sure you get a response back today! Again, so sorry about that, but we can get to the bottom of it!]]></description>

I&#039;ve also been having problems lately, Amy.  The program worked fine--until about a month ago.  Now, the money in my budget does not match the money in my accounts.  I&#039;ve had to reconcile accounts about every 3 days just to keep on top of what my money was doing because the money shown in my budget is not accurate. Income is not showing in my budget, and expenditures are showing up out of nowhere.  (Categories suddenly show up red, when I haven&#039;t input any transactions for those categories.)  I&#039;m back to monitoring my account balances instead of trusting my budget.  The entire program is now out of control., and they haven&#039;t fixed anything after the flood of emails I&#039;ve sent to Customer Service.]]></description>
