					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Natalie @ Mango&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks!  I&#039;ve been trying to get it out for a while now, but never thought it was worth posting :)  I guess I was wrong!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, sure - being nice ALWAYS counts ;)  If you want extra credit though, do something special *this* weekend.
@&lt;b&gt;aj&lt;/b&gt; - That is brilliant!!  SO so kind of you, thank you for sharing that :) And I&#039;m super glad MIL is doing better!  I hope it&#039;s not a permanent thing :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately we spent the weekend at the hospital with MIL whose kidneys almost shut down...but we bought a book of parking passes for $10 (parking garage prices are $1 an hour)
and shared them with others that were also visiting at the hospital so they didn&#039;t have to worry about paying the fee when they left.  Many people don&#039;t know that you can go to the cashier&#039;s office to get the discounted passes. (MIL is home now, thank goodness.)
It was a bad situation that we made better by doing something good for others while we were there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was so excited about this mission, but then I spent all weekend painting my living room.  Does it count that the week before I was visiting my mom and did all kinds of nice things for people?  Probably not, it was ND and everyone is super nice and you just can&#039;t help to be the same way ALL the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money, I think this is probably my favorite of your posts so far. Not because it is breaking news or revolutionary information (don&#039;t get me wrong-- some of your other posts have covered those categories), but because I think this post will actually make a huge, positive difference. With all of your readers doing just one nice thing, the whole world will be lifted a little higher this week. I LOVE THIS!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Went to a Party and paid the $5 Valet parking fee for the car behind me...They were SUPER excited, grateful, and confused all at the same time!!! Doing something nice for someone else ALWAYS makes you feel better, especially when they really appreciate it.  I&#039;ll try to do random things more often, and $5 is very manageable :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was hoping you were gonna say that :)  You gotta adapt in this new world of ours or you&#039;ll just go crazy and fall behind!  Nothing stopping her from getting new clients (or even a new hobby?) from youtubing and/or blogging about all that she knows too.  Hope she at least gives it a try!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I attended a small business seminar, and I struck up a conversation with a hairstylist. She was complaining that with this &quot;new&quot; technology, her business was suffering. She was trying to start hairstyling classes, but people were no longer interested, because they could find everything on the internet. I told her that she should check out youtube to see what was being offered. She was very annoyed to hear that people were making videos about EVERYTHING and putting them online for free, which translated to her paid services not being needed. I suggested that she should look into starting a youtube account and maybe making her own videos.]]></description>
