					<description><![CDATA[This was a lovely post Donna.  I&#039;ve been there too in the past, there&#039;s nothing like going hungry for awhile to appreciate the peace that some money in the bank can give you.  Only downside for me is that I still tend to be a food hoarder. Not too different from my grandmother who was young in the Great Depression.  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like everyone else just said, WOW.  This is an excellent motivational story to keep in mind next time I feel like just coming home and relaxing, or am pissed about my money problems.
Your hard work definitely paid off Donna.  Again, extremely inspirational! Thank you for sharing:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The rest of the story is that I went back to school in 1991 taking one class at a time.  I met the love of my life, Jon, in 1994.  I graduated in 1996 with a degree in Occupational Therapy Assisting and have worked in the field ever since (my specialty is Alzheimer&#039;s patients).  During my time with Jon we added to the family, Mick who is now 25 and Josh.  Josh we kind of adopted.  He was a student of my husband&#039;s (Jon is a college professor) whose family fell apart and he had no where to go and was considering giving up on his college studies.  We took him in and treated him as our own.  Recently we proudly sat as parents at his May wedding to a lovely girl.  Josh is now completing his Master&#039;s in Music at Indiana University.  Jon and I  have 3 grandchildren with another due in 2 weeks. Our old 1890&#039;s house is an empty nest now but Jon and I are just waiting for our next adventure.  Maybe we will adopt another student or host another exchange student, I am not sure.  Some things we planned on are on hold as I recover from a serious tendon injury to my left foot and battle fibromyalgia. One thing I am sure of though, whatever comes along I, with Jon at my side and the Lord as my shepard, can handle it.  :-)

Thanks again J.  I hope I was able to help somebody by sharing my story.]]></description>
