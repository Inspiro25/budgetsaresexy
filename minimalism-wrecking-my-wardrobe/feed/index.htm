					<description><![CDATA[I like the Steve Jobs/Dean Kamen philosophy; I pretty much wear the same thing every day. For summer, I bought a 6 pack of white undershirts from Costco. For winter, I bought a stack of long sleeved shirts from Old Navy on the clearance rack. My style is no style!

While I work from home now, I did this even when I had to go into a job. At some point, I found out that my co-workers thought I was wearing the exact same thing every day. They still thought I was a bit nuts when I told them I just have copies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really should do a purge of my wardrobe, there&#039;s stuff just sitting there I never wear.

Thanks to my jobs (dairy farmer and plumber) I spend the majority of my day in work clothes.  Due to the nature of these jobs I just let them get good and ratty before they get hacked up in to rags.  For &quot;going out&quot;  I&#039;m typically a jeans/t-shirt kind of guy.  Nothing too fancy for me.

Snagged this guy at a thrift store last year.

Nearly passed on it until I saw something lurking in the shadows, at which point it became a required purchase. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with quality over quantity. I&#039;m trying to switch my wardrobe in that direction and it really makes a difference. Also have to agree about the lulu lemon stuff, it lasts forever and is so comfy. And they have men&#039;s clothes too! My sis works there and can only buy me stuff once a year with her discount. ]]></description>

Oh man!  That&#039;s classic.  Typical mom. Nothing less cool than parents&#039; puns or pointing out that their irony really isn&#039;t that cool.

On a side note, concert t-shirts are generally a good buy!  There were only so many and when you get a hole in your favorite one, you want a replacement!

The old rock band ones go for CRAZY amounts.  This Iron Maiden one from 1984 has a hole and a stain and it still went for $700 bucks!  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-IRON-MAIDEN-Concert-T-Shirt-Tour-Shirt-1984-Md-Camo-Tan-Aces-High-Metal-/380397925894?pt=Vintage_Unisex_T_Shirts&#038;hash=item58917bb606

Always keep an eye out and you could easily flip it quickly!  I generally look through the black t-shirts on the rack since it seems like most concert t-shirts are black.]]></description>

Decided to keep my favorite shirt. However, my 14 year old stepdaughter bought a Reba McIntyre (sp?) shirt on our last Goodwill shopping trip. I googled it for fun.  She bought it for $2 and it&#039;s selling for $25! I told her we should start flipping Goodwill shirts and start a blog.  We could call it Goodwill Hunting. (Ba dum dum!)  she hasn&#039;t responded to my Facebook message. I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s soooo not cool to her. Haha]]></description>
