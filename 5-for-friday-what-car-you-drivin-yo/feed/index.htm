					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Paul&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that would be hot.  I&#039;d LOVE a lifted up jeep/truck of some sort myself. I&#039;ve gone the lowrider way before, but I&#039;m all totally over that and ready to go the opposite ;)
@&lt;b&gt;TCY&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, a bit bigger than the Sportage ;) Awesome you paid all cash though for it - I&#039;ve never done that before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.What car are you sportin’? (If you have two, tell us about both.  If you have three, what do you do for a living??)

&#062;&#062; 2008 Kia Sportage EX

2.How much did you pay for it?

&#062;&#062; $25,000 cash

3.How much is it worth NOW? (Hit up KBB if you don’ t know)

&#062;&#062; around $15,000

4.How much do you pay for insurance? (you can guestimate)

&#062;&#062; $1600 / year.  Such is life in the big city.

5.Why did you choose that one in particular?

&#062;&#062;  Cheap, long warranty, enough room to haul my stuff but not too big to parallel park comfortably.

6.*BONUS* Your car gets totaled, and insurance gives you $25,000 for a new car. What would you get? (You have to spend the money on a car, you can’t spend it on debt or savings or anything – nice try ;))

&#062;&#062; Honda making a hybrid Odyssey?  Because if they do, I&#039;ll figure out a way to parallel park that baby.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1: What car are you sportin’? (If you have two, tell us about both.  If you have three, what do you do for a living??)

09 Jeep Patriot &#038; 98 Chevy 2500 pickup beater

2:  How much did you pay for it?

$12500(after rebates) I got it the day cash for clunkers started, my Grand Cherokee (that i got at the auction 3 years earlier for $1300) rear strut separated from the frame and was unrepairable and i made the scariest ride of my life to the dealer ship to trade it in for  $4500

$1000 i needed a beater pickup truck when construction of my house began and didnt want to punish my jeep anymore then i do now.

3:  How much is it worth NOW? (Hit up KBB if you don’ t know)

kbb says 13,325 for trade in on the jeep
and $1025 for trade in on the pickup

4:  How much do you pay for insurance? (you can guestimate)

about 1200 a year for both

5: Why did you choose that one in particular?

 low amounts of trinkets or thinks that could break,  lifetime power train warrenty (i do lots of driving), 4x4 with auto in that price range(incentives), and its eligibility for cash for clunkers
    *BONUS* Your car gets totaled, and insurance gives you $25,000 for a new car. What would you get? (You have to spend the money on a car, you can’t spend it on debt or savings or anything – nice try ;))

A new jeep 4 door wrangler lifted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What car are you sportin’? 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe, and a 1995 Nissan Maxima
How much did you pay for it? Both were bought used:  $9000 for the Santa Fe, and $4500 for the Maxima
How much is it worth NOW? KBB says $7390 for the Santa Fe, $3145 for the Maxima
How much do you pay for insurance? (you can guestimate) Too much!  Around $200/month (I have 2 teenagers - one recently was in an accident)
Why did you choose that one in particular? Both the cars I own were &quot;Car of the Year&quot; for their year, and I read a lot of good reviews on both.
*BONUS* Your car gets totaled, and insurance gives you $25,000 for a new car. What would you get?  I&#039;d love a Nissan SUV.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes! It started at $280 or so with Travelers, then dropped to I think $208 with Geico. Since then I&#039;ve raised my deductible and which lowered the amount to $165, and set up a savings account for the difference between the old and the new specifically for any insurance deductibles or car repairs I might need to pay for!]]></description>
