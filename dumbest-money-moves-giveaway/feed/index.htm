Always enjoy your little ditties here, sir ;)

Though surprised to see how far away you two lovebirds live?? Just once a month? Must be a damn important reason for that one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I only see my wife once a month.  We live hundreds of miles apart.  
We don&#039;t like it, and it&#039;s not how we envisioned our future, but for 
now, it is what it is.  On our monthly visits we usually go out for lunch.  
I found insulated food transport bags,and portable sectioned food 
containers.  We copied some fancy, quick &#038; inexpensive recipes.  
Instead of a restaurant we would take our lunch to the market, park, 
greenhouse, by the tree shadowed pools at the walking gardens...  
nice places to enjoy a quiet, private, (free!) and elegant lunch together.  
The cost per meal?  About the same price as the tip at the restaurant.

Planned it all out.  A savings of $308/yr.

We then went to lunch at the restaurant.

UGH!  Stupid!!


     -&quot;Mad&quot; Max Speedwell


BTW... there is an old saying (about 3,500 years old):

&quot;Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil 
the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.&quot;

It&#039;s not the big, growling, charging bear that comes in and
destroys your vinyard (&quot;...aww, c&#039;mon honey.  We can use 
the flight lessons and a new Cessna to go and visit your 
mother more often!&quot;)  You can easily see, and hear THAT 
bear coming and know what to do!  It&#039;s the small, quiet... 
almost un-noticeable foxes.  Stealthy and without notice little 
foxes (latte&#039;, speeding ticket, impulse item at the supermarket 
check-out) that destroy wealth!  They oh, so quietly slip into 
our lives, hide under the branches and leaves in our financial 
vinyard, and we never even notice them (&quot;Hey, back-off!  That 
magazine is only four bucks!&quot;) and they quietly burrow below 
the ground, gnaw on the financial roots that support our vinyard, 
and the damage is never even seen.  Then, one day, our leaves 
are curling.  They&#039;re turning brown, the harvest is very light, and 
the grapes are small.  WHAT HAPPENED??  Next year, the vines 
are dead, and the vintage lost.

BE WATCHING AND SHOOT THOSE LITTLE FOXES!]]></description>
