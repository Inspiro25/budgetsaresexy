					<description><![CDATA[Yes we all make mistakes every now and then. Sorry that you made one. It could have been worse! Try switching your colors. The sharpie trick doesn&#039;t work. If you are in a hurry you don&#039;t have time to read if it says credit or debit. I recommend getting one bright orange and one blue/green. You&#039;ll never make a mistake :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha! I did the exact same thing sometime back.  Thought I&#039;ll give a call to my favorite credit union and get the fees waived.  Didn&#039;t budge.  :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My goodness! I had no idea that you could do that...I just figured that it would spit the card back out and say wrong card or something! But I&#039;m guessing that if the banks could make a quick buck off of that, they would. And if you don&#039;t want to write directly on your credit card, you can put a color coded labeling sticker on it like this: http://s.ecrater.com/stores/79362/4ae8d65236093_79362f.jpg]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[UPDATE: Called up the financial love of my life (USAA) and was one of the first times I had no luck ;)  They def. understood it was a mistake but said they couldn&#039;t reverse it since all 3 cleared.  I don&#039;t blame them though, maybe it costs them more money for me to swipe like that? I dunno.  They did say I could go online and &quot;submit a ticket&quot; which will give me an answer in a few business days (and I&#039;d have more luck there for some reason?) but we shall see.  Going to file it tonight!

Some responses:

@&lt;b&gt;Sandy L&lt;/b&gt; - Haha indeed.  Sharpies are good for sooooo many things. In particularly fake tattoos... you know, to try out before you actually get one ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kristia@FamilyBalanceSheet&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! Sure did.  (posted news above)
@&lt;b&gt;philip&lt;/b&gt; - I don&#039;t use my ING card but it sure is bright!  I used to carry just 1 c/c and 1 debit card, but now I carry 2 c/cs - one for MY stuff, and one for our HOUSE stuff.  We&#039;re considering combining everything into one major pot, but for the most part this has been working just fine going on 5 years now.
@&lt;b&gt;Wayne&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, good point!  I guess I did it for one of those &quot;just in case&quot; scenarios, but thinking more about it you&#039;re right.  I&#039;ll have to call and see if I can clear it or at least block it.
@&lt;b&gt;Brent&lt;/b&gt; - I don&#039;t mind getting bit every few years when it saves me soooooo much time and effort :) I use my c/c to budget and keep track of stuff. Plus, so much easier to use and stay out of trouble (for me.  and usually) than cash or debit card.  Now if I were slipping up every other month it would be a different story...
@&lt;b&gt;ZFarls&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I have the money to wipe it way, I just gotta be smoother next time.  And I still have yet to read a Dave Ramsey book - can you believe that?
@&lt;b&gt;Liz&lt;/b&gt; - Me too, but only kinda.  I didn&#039;t expect them to waive all chages (up front fees + interest), but I was hoping for at least 1 to be removed. We&#039;ll see how my &quot;ticket&quot; gets handled - maybe it&#039;ll be someone who knows this blog! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cori R.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like that idea :)  Not once have I ever been able to put a photo on any of my cards either, I really want one.
@&lt;b&gt;the Dad, Climbing Out&lt;/b&gt; - What?  Pick up *more* credit cards? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Julie F&lt;/b&gt; - Well done!!!  Now you don&#039;t have to be a stupid face like me.
@&lt;b&gt;Daniel Howard&lt;/b&gt; - Good idea, but not my bag.  I want the least amt. of banks possible so I can track easily every day.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Good thinking.  Gonna update the post w/ that in 5 seconds :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nunzio Bruno&lt;/b&gt; - True that.  Blogging is much more fun when you&#039;re all fired up!
@&lt;b&gt;Jim&lt;/b&gt; - We live and we learn, right?
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Oh for sure.  The only reason I was actually taking it out was to give $ to my parents right there on the spot (had to reimburse them for travel costs) instead of spending the 5 mins online to cut the check! Haha...so i basically traded 5 mins for $15+, and counting.  
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, CANCEL!!!
@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s all good, just reminds me (again) that I have lots more learning to do :)
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yup!  Although I&#039;ll be the first to admit that I do mostly talking on this blog than pretending I know everything.  I&#039;m like really good at a few things, and really absent minded w/ hundreds of others ;)]]></description>
