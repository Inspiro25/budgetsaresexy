					<description><![CDATA[Oh no! So sad that Mike Piper’s wife died! I didn’t know. I hope the book he wrote helped him heal.

I’ve never heard of Tori Dunlap. Do you know her background? I’m always interested in reading books from people with finance backgrounds, not marketers. Hope she is legit!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad you wrote about &quot;Buyer Aware&quot; like I told you that you should do ;)

The other books look great, too. &quot;Tipped?&quot; I never thought about being a stripper for a side hustle. I should have tried it because my side hustles of selling pine cones (abundant in my yard) and toilet paper and paper towel rolls (abundant in my house) didn&#039;t work out. I wasn&#039;t able to sell them on Craig&#039;s List and sending them through the mail is too time consuming while I&#039;m finishing my book.

&quot;After the Death of Your Spouse&quot; is a good reminder to get the basics for your end of life stuff done. My draft will has been sitting on my kitchen counter for two weeks. Time to review it and get it finalized.

&quot;Financial Feminist&quot; looks great. I&#039;ll be getting some copies for gifts. Too bad it won&#039;t be ready for Christmas.

Love your articles. I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re back to being &quot;Sexy&quot; again.]]></description>

rock n&#039; roll!!

that Tipped one will probably become more and more handy as time goes on too, with everyone getting into a mixture of side gigs vs the typical 9-5 from yesteryear... Barbara is also a very cool person to hang out with in real life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ohh a good list indeed J! I never thought about how so many FI books can cater to 9-5ers (401k, HSA, leave discussions), so Get Tipped should be a good read. Also want to know more about how we&#039;ve been getting ripped off (not surprised) so I&#039;ll place a hold on Buyer Aware!]]></description>
