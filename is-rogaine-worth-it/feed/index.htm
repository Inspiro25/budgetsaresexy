					<description><![CDATA[Awww, well at least you have a good head on your shoulders! (No pun intended) It&#039;s a true man who knows what&#039;s important and can see the bigger picture like that. Way to go :) I have plenty of shaved-head friends too and the ladies LOVE &#039;em! Get that degree, my man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My hair started thinning when I was just 13. I went to specialists all the way in UC Davis to see if something was wrong. They found out I was anemic but also told me that more than likely I was just going bald because of my dads baldness. It depressed me and you can say scared me as well because honestly who wants to deal with thinking hair during jr high and high school. I dealt with a lot of insults but I refused to use rogaine. Today at age 19 and in college my hair does look thinner and some might say I should completely shave it. But it&#039;s thinning at a slower rate. I still don&#039;t take rogaine but Iv thought about it. Either that or ill shave it soon. I would love to have hair but I care more about my health and my budget. And the ladies I have a difficult time with but iv been told I&#039;m not a bad looking guy and my main focus is my degree not my scalp. So you can say I can&#039;t complain I&#039;m healthy enough :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started thinning pretty good in my 30&#039;s and before it became noticeable to others I shaved my head and have been doing it for a decade. 

It was a tough decision at first because I wasn&#039;t sure if I had the right skull to pull it off. Luckily no moles, flat spots, or other unsightly defects. Little sun to even out the color and the head was complete. Hit the gym to put on more muscle mass and honestly I really liked the look.

I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t fall into that money trap and I feel like I protected my health in the process. 

For what it&#039;s worth, not all women dig bald heads, but there are plenty that do......trust me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My hubby and I knew he was going to have thinning hair even when we met at 18.  He shaves it way down, lets it grow out for a month or so, and shaves it again.  Not super expensive at all and he looks good to me.  ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again &lt;b&gt;Charlie&lt;/b&gt;!  Always wondered how much that stuff cost, and I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m starting to recede a little bit myself :(  But so far the main strip in the middle is going strong so my mohawk can still be in full effect!! Haha.... I&#039;ll take that all day long ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Edward&lt;/b&gt; - The other nice thing about greying early?  You&#039;ll always look more distinguished :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@John Shaver - I couldn&#039;t agree more! I will embrace my thinning hair primarily because it is cheaper! :) haha

@Joe@RetireBy40 - ya I&#039;m in the same boat as you are. I don&#039;t need to impress the ladies anymore either, but that doesn&#039;t mean I dress like a slob or anything. When it starts getting too thin, then I&#039;ll just shave it off like you suggested. Way cheaper too!

@Kevin - how long you been using Rogaine? Do you recommend it, and if so, then why?

@Debt an the Girl - I&#039;m glad to see some women embracing balding men. :) This whole topic reminds me of a Seinfeld episode - relating to George Costanza. haha Gotta love him.]]></description>
