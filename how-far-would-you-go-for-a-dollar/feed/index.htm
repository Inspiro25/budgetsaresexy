					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-far-would-you-go-for-a-dollar/#comment-236455&quot;&gt;Dividend Diplomats&lt;/a&gt;.

I wish our bank still had them :( From what I hear more and more are getting rid of them because they cost so much to maintain and not worth the added benefit to their customers... Which sucks as I now have to roll them up myself! (Though I&#039;m training my kids to do it which should speed up the process ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If no one is around and it is a small amount, I would take it. If there is a homeless person nearby, it goes in their cup. If someone is around, I ask if they dropped it. If it is a large amount, I don&#039;t tell them how much before asking. If it is very large, I take it to the manager. Never came across money large enough that it felt necessary to return it to law enforcement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bet that next experiment&#039;s gonna be the shit! :). Interesting to see what people value. A lot of my friends think that cutting $10-$20/mo in expenses isn&#039;t worth the time. But those cuts can add up to a ton invested and compounded. I&#039;d probably not pick up a dollar off a toilet. I&#039;d wonder what happened to that dollar before it got there. That being said, I&#039;ve picked up a beer that wasn&#039;t mine and drank it so maybe I&#039;ve got my priorities skewed :o]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read this post this morning, and saw a crinkled dollar on the table the one break room this afternoon, not one with a vending machine. At my job we have both salaried and hourly workers, temps, and interns. From the crinkle of the bill it looked like it had been stuffed in someone&#039;s pocket, and all I could think is they could probably use it more than me. I told myself if it was there when I was leaving work it would be fair game, but ended up not walking out that way, so I&#039;ll never know. 
 I feel like a work place is different from a public venue, store, parking lot etc.
 My mom &#038; I were in Walmart once and found $100. It was summer, and frequented by local camp counselors, campers, etc. We turned it into the store manager, in case anyone missed it. It was so long ago I forget what happened in the end.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The farthest I&#039;ve ever seen someone go was on a Boy Scout backpacking trip. We had been on the trail about a week without seeing the comforts of civilization. One of the guys dared another to pick up a cow patty, take a bite, and swallow in exchange for a $1 ice cream cone when we returned to base camp. He did it, and swallowed. Most impressive thing I&#039;ve ever seen]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Free money is free money; I have picked up anywhere from $5-$20 on the street.  Money is dirty most of the time you touch regardless if you pick it up in the washroom, on a park bench or change at Starbucks.  I say be open to all money in all forms.]]></description>
