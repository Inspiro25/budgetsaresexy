					<description><![CDATA[I advise to accept it and pay him the $2,500 you had budgeted. Your grandfather wants to help you and probably feels very good that 1) he is able to help you out of a dire situation, 2) you now have a nicer car that you (and he) will feel safer in.  Accepting this gift does not make you weak. If you flat out do not like the car or think it will be too expensive to repair down the road, trade it in and downgrade in a year.

On a more personal note, this situation has given me excellent perspective since I was actually considering buying my dad a newer car.  The car he drives now is old, breaks down often and is just a money pit.  Also, I feel that it is unsafe and get very nervous if he drives long distances in it.  Giving him a newer car would put my mind at ease. However, I hadn&#039;t quite thought through how he would feel about accepting such a gift.  Thanks, Brandi, for showing me the other side. Good luck!]]></description>
