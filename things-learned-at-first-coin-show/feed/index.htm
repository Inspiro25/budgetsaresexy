					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jim&lt;/b&gt; - For sure. They were a LOT more friendlier than I imagined, not that I was thinking they were all gonna be mean to me or anything, haha... it was just like they went out of their way to help me cuz they knew I was new! A very welcoming feeling indeed.
@&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt; - Def. a killer combo! That is awesome :) You should totally dig them up - maybe you had a few gems in there that you didn&#039;t realize at the time? Those are always the best stories you hear... Let me know if you do!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome.

When I was a kid, we used to collect coins and, to a lesser extent, stamps. There was a coin shop a few miles away (with a bowling alley next door, killer combo!) that we would bike to several times a week in the summer.

It was just a little hole in the wall run by a retired cop. Great guy, very friendly, and he never seemed to tire of us rolling in to ogle his wares and only occasionally buy a low end coin of some sort. And he always packing heat. Nature of the beast, I suppose.

I &quot;specialized&quot; in pennies and nickels and had a coin folder for each. Still have them, in fact -- somewhere. Probably at my parents&#039; house. I should probably dig them out and share them with my kids.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the best parts of these types of shows, where you talk to vendors who are fellow collectors, is that they&#039;re often very nice and most (not all) are not in the business of earning a buck at your expense. I suspect the guy who offered you $5 just didn&#039;t know what you had (but thought it was cool), he wasn&#039;t trying to rip you off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks man!! Had no idea you&#039;re a coin guy too :) If you ever wanna chat about it let me know - I&#039;m pretty addicted, haha... and first got hooked with Morgan dollars too. There&#039;s actually a GREAT article on Mr. Morgan himself, and how the Morgans were designed and all, in the October edition of Coin World - you should check it out :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jacque&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! In a very morbid way, you may have a point there ;) I certainly haven&#039;t thought about it that way, haha... Though yes - it&#039;s def. more fun than it is anything else at this moment, but who know long term yet. You&#039;ve now got me thinking!
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! I&#039;m working on a few modern coin books now too actually - just to get into the habit of finding and collecting/etc. All through loose change and me picking up rolls of them at the bank ;) The good thing is you can always cash them right back at any time! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Well I&#039;m not $5k richer, but my parents are ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Scott&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man! Glad you enjoyed it :) I take it you&#039;re more of a natural now, eh? I think you&#039;re right about the conditoins of all the coins too - they vary a LOT and it really is a crazy amount to take in. But one thing at a time, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;Alexa @ travelmiamor&lt;/b&gt; - Yes! It does :) You can tell him I think he&#039;s a P.I.M.P!
@&lt;b&gt;bryce&lt;/b&gt; - Ooh la la my first selling opportunity! But nah, sorry my man - gotta keep it in the family at least for now... But I do have some other coins that I&#039;d be up to selling ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - GO FIND THEM NOW!! That&#039;s like a treasure hunt waiting to happen, haha... I&#039;d be over there in a heart beat to sort through them with you too ;) That&#039;s my favorite thing about coins so far - going through my friends&#039;/family&#039;s coins and seeing if there&#039;s anything juicy in them! It turns out I had a bag full of old *silver* coins from Germany my grandparents also gave me a while back. They&#039;d been sitting in a box for years until it occured to me that the US wasn&#039;t the only country to make coins out of silver ;)
@&lt;b&gt;peth&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, thanks! I def. have no problem getting excited about things and spending time on them, it&#039;s more about not changing my mind all the time! Haha... but so far we&#039;re going strong in the coin realm ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lynn @ Broke-Ass Mommy&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhhh that coin is so COOL!!! I WANT IT!!! :) And have never seen such a type either, that is dope, yo! Good for you, wow. Much better than my lame &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/bought-first-gold-coin-us-mint/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;buffalo gold coin&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;m totally trading that one in later and finding something cooler in its place. And I&#039;m liking the fancy use of &quot;troglodyte&quot; too, haha.. I had to Google that! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad you enjoyed your first coin show, J. Money! The significant other and I like to giggle over all the &#039;old man river&#039; types at the coin shows we attend, but they are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; knowledgeable. 

Also, I wanted to share my gold angel with you!! :D

I am looking forward to hearing more of your adventures into the wondrous world of numismatics and bullion coins..]]></description>
