					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m signed up, J.

I&#039;m going to be cornering everybody at the social events and demanding that they talk with me about Safe Withdrawal Rates.

That&#039;s a joke!

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ruby&lt;/b&gt; - Wonderful!!! It&#039;s our very first conference, so we&#039;ll all be new there ;)  And as soon as you find the guy w/ the mohawk, you go right up to him and he&#039;ll keep you company and make you feel at home.  Promise :)
@&lt;b&gt;MainlineMom&lt;/b&gt; - Looking forward to being there in better weather too!  Been twice my entire life (in past 4 months, actually) and it was not the most pleasant out ;)  This should be much better!
@&lt;b&gt;TJ&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do!
@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - As long as you&#039;ve got a beer in one of those hands ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - GREAT!!!  See you there :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - You should show up to REALLY make TJ feel bad, haha... All the way from New Zealand, you&#039;d be a hit!  (and I hope it continues year after year too - I have a sneaking suspicion it will.  so you&#039;ll have plenty of time to make it back ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[what a great idea!  i hope it takes off and becomes a regular thing.

ooh i&#039;m jealous!  it would be so interesting to be around people who understand why i keep all of my receipts. haha.  i think you guys going on your own are very brave, too--Ruby, i&#039;m lookin&#039; at you.  Since i am anonymous, it would just be so trippy to introduce myself as &#039;Sense&#039; and have all these people (OK, like 3 people, but you know what I mean) know about my life when I&#039;ve never met them in real life!!]]></description>
