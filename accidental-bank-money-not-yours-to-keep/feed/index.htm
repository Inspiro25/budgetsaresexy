I didn&#039;t get a letter they didn&#039;t called me but they sent me a money  to my bank acc £2500. After 2 months from date I received the money I saw someone took some money from account I went to bank and they told me the money which I got it 2 months ago it wasn&#039;t mine someone made mistake... no one let me know. I thought the money I received they are mine. What to do now? I have to sent the money back but I&#039;m working part time and I have a kids;( probably if I don&#039;t tell them they don&#039;t sent me any letter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man what a bunch of goodie two shoes on this page. If someone is dumb enough to write a check to you and you deposit it, it&#039;s their loss. Play the &quot;I didn&#039;t know&quot; card or &quot;I was too busy to check&quot; card until the cows come home. It&#039;s going to be nearly impossible for them to prove that the money didn&#039;t belong to you if you were given a legitimate check in your name. It all depends on how the money was received. Wired in by accident could be problematic or a wrongful amount made on a check but if you are truly naive about it, can&#039;t be your fault. 

 If your guilt is killing you then go ahead a be a broke dork. Give it back. Bunch of nerds I swear to God.]]></description>

Sorry to hear :( I would just make sure you stay on top of Walmart until you get whatever it is you feel you&#039;re deserved! You&#039;re the only one who can fight for your money.]]></description>

Not sure I follow all the eway, but since you didn&#039;t do anything wrong you shouldn&#039;t have to worry about anything! I&#039;d just make sure you&#039;re in contact w/ your bank and they understand everything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think my bank account was involved in a scam. The owner of the money transferred $4100 to a person in a bank account. The person who got the money through her bank account tried to send to another person to get to the scammer through western union. The guy at western union advised the lady not to send through western union because he felt it was a scam and the scammer used my bank details to use my bank account to receive the money. Am thankful during the process of sending the money that something was wrong, and the money didn&#039;t land in my bank account.

Now I think the matter got reported to the police, now my question is will I be questioned about the money? Or how my bank account got involved?]]></description>

I know, it&#039;s always annoying and feels like a waste of time trying to fix other peoples problems :( But remember that it&#039;s better to be THEIR problem than YOUR problem! I.e if you cash it in and they come back later! I&#039;d just double check that your mother-in-law in fact got the money okay that first go around.]]></description>
