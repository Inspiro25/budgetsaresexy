Hah - totally!! If it weren&#039;t for my parents forcing me to apply to things growing up I never would have either :( I&#039;ll have to keep my eyes open for similar grant-like stuff... Can&#039;t think of any at the moment but there&#039;s gotta be more out there?! It can&#039;t just end when we grow up...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool! Thanks for sharing, I will be sure to enter! Do you know of any other &quot;adult-life&quot; scholarships/grants like this? 
I didn&#039;t try hard enough while in college to apply for scholarships and I wish I did. I also always wish there were things to apply for now!

Thanks again!

Triple - nice!! Good thing those investments were tied into a 401(k) too so less chance of you cashing out and moving around during those scary times of &#039;08 :) It&#039;s gone up SO MUCH by then and like you said you didn&#039;t have to do a thing!

I wonder when the last time someone brought up the 401(k) option with your employer? Think it&#039;s worth revisiting it and seeing if you can get lucky? Maybe if you help them navigate it or something?]]></description>

YESS!! GOOD!! We need more 401(k) angels like you!! I hope you submit your essay as that&#039;s exactly the kind of stuff they&#039;re looking for! Then just throw in a few (appropriate) laughs too so they really can&#039;t resist ;)]]></description>

This is true, actually! But still won&#039;t be able to get any *free* money as I&#039;ll just be paying myself, lol... I should look back into it though as it&#039;s been a few years since comparing it with the SEP.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep J, I loved my 401K from a previous employer, but the company I&#039;ve worked at for the last 14 years, doesn&#039;t have one.  However, the money I managed to save from my previous employers 401K, and their nice match, has tripled since I left in 2008.  I can&#039;t say I had too much to do with it tripling, so I&#039;m grateful to have had that opportunity to work for an employer who helped me squirrel away a ton of acorns!  It&#039;s really paid off!]]></description>
