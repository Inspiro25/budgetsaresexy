Gooooooood luck!!!!!! We need as many people as we can get spreading the good word on $$$! :)

As for my diversifying stuff, yeah - def. something I need to work on for sure, haha... I&#039;m rather addicted to retirement accounts because of all the benefits (and the FIRE crew only adds to it with all their hacks on how to convert them before you&#039;re in your 60s!), but I do need to be better about spreading the $$ around. I used to do it with money I had leftover after maxing out my SEP and Roth, however ever since kids I rarely have anything left over and so my investing typically stops there. Outside of the incremental Acorns deposits (which was why I first signed up to them).

Anyways, all that to say that yes - it&#039;s def. smart to have your hands in a handful of pies, and at some time in the near future I hope to be back to doing that as well... Always something for us to be working on, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J! :) I just realized that almost 90% of your assets are in retirement accounts. I know you are now a fan of minimalist living, but any plans of diversifying your portfolio? And anything big you&#039;re saving up for aside from finally retiring? :D

I&#039;m also thinking of simplifying my increasingly complicated net worth tracking, but I guess the scenario here in my country (Mabuhay from the Philippines!) is also a factor why I need to spread out my assets (banks may close, the equivalent IRAs are not very enticing, etc.).

Can relate with reviewing your net worth for the past years! I am also trying to do that while I prepare for an opportunity to present my journey as part of a Financial Wellness Program in a company. Wish me luck and God speed for you too!]]></description>

Hahahaha...

It was all worth it just to see a nice note from you this morning :) A guy&#039;s gotta mess up every now and then to appreciate the times he doesn&#039;t, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a brief moment, I was thinking you did the unimaginable, bought a lottery ticket and won $25K from a scratchoff, netting about $18K. Or landed a bookdeal, and this was your upfront money. It started when your email came out, and I was at work. (For anyone that&#039;s heard me call myself retired, I still do. I spend 2 days at a high school, tutoring kids in math. I was never so happy to get up at 5 in the morning to go to any job). 
So there I was, thinking about Trigonometry, Algebra, some Pre-calc, and what in the world J had done to score $19K in a month where the market was essentially flat. And then, I caught a Tweet, it was all a typo, a miscalculation. My favorite student walked in, and saw the look on my face. She actually asked me if I was ok. I kept the story short, but explained the great news that wasn&#039;t. She was a little sad for you, too. &quot;It must be like thinking you had a lottery ticket that was good for $20K but then discovered you read the numbers wrong.&quot; Yup.]]></description>

No shame in that... Do you keep your house in the net worth reports? Seems there are those of us who keep houses and cars in it, and then those who leave them both out for similar reasons. The car one I get more, but leaving out the house portion always surprises me... mainly cuz it&#039;s such a huge part of your financial picture!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J - 

Pumped for your April post honestly - to see some massive investment account pops!  Solid month, nothing too extreme, and the thrift is always awesome to see the growth.  

In the first quarter, my net worth has jumped a solid 7% YTD or approximately $20K, so not doing too bad, but know that there could be improvements.  For me, though, a lot of the fluctuation within the NW is due to the stock market, and being a dividend investor - I actually wish there were some &quot;nice&quot; corrections to scoop up some undervalued blue chips, haha.  However - I am contemplating throwing more at the ugly as hell auto loan that I still have (Around $6.1K now), as I can open up new cash flow fairly quick if I pay that off.  Hmm.. may have that paid off easily by the end of the year instead of the next 20 or so months.

Appreciate the share J - talk soon.
