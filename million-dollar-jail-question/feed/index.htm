					<description><![CDATA[Minimum security, midwest prison...happily! Hell, I would do it for 500k, shoot the more I think about it, 250k tax free would be fine.

Oh, yeah, if you&#039;ll only do one martial art ever, make it krav maga, the Israeli martial art (actually, the founder Imi Lichtenfeld developed it in Eastern Europe, against anti-Semitic gangs trolling the Jewish quarters to beat or murder Jews, but he fled the Nazis to Israel and taught it in what became the military).

Why do I love krav maga?  First, no silly uniforms or belts to buy.  Second, no bowing or elaborate choreographed routines that teach only in abstractions.  Third, the people tend to be really high quality -- my experience has been that krav students tend to be *serious*, but that even though it&#039;s largely guy students, they don&#039;t seem to be d*cks to women (which, as the chick who likes a lot of &#039;dude&#039; activities, can be super rare).  Fourth, krav helps you develop the situational awareness that makes it so you hopefully never have to fight.  Fifth, krav is defensive - never ever start the fight, but by darn finish it however necessary, at least enough so you can run away safely.]]></description>

YES! My wife laughs at me whenever I mention that I wouldn&#039;t be too upset losing the lottery cuz it would be MUCH more gratifying earning the money more myself, but of course if you already have the systems in place and you DO come across large amounts of money, even better :) I don&#039;t think I&#039;d keep any of my street cred if my net worth jumped by millions because i won the lottery though haha... i&#039;d be shunned in the personal finance world!]]></description>

Just had to google what that is - sign me up too! I could use some self-defense skills up in here (I don&#039;t think crying and running away fast really counts?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you J$. Money is for freedom. A year is so much time, especially when you have young kids. I guess a bundle of cash at the end would be tempting, but what a crap way to get it. Not through your own ingenuity or hard work, but more as a lucky payoff. Reminds me of lottery winnings. Too much potential damage to the family, not nearly enough reward.]]></description>

Getting ahead of myself. It&#039;s actually 20 years, not 15. Makes prison look a bit better?]]></description>
