And I love that FIRE reframing from Primal Prosperity. She&#039;s a thoughtful one! 

She wrote an awesome guest post for me about Sustainable Real Estate Investing 101 - How to Make $1,000/hr and a Better World: http://www.coachcarson.com/sustainable-real-estate-investing-101/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy belated Birthday J.Money. I surely am happy to see you back &#039;at work&#039; after your sabbatical. FIRE is all about freedom to me too. Not necessarily from work but a way to work on things I enjoy and want to be doing. 
I am still a WAY away from that dream but since we starting tracking our net worth I know we have saved much more than what we would have without tracking. Seeing the money grow is so motivating. 
Happy New Year J. Money! Appreciate you and your blog]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woah; apparently we share a birthday. Pretty freaky.
I think I gave myself the best present of all for my 30th, &quot;retirement.&quot; I have taken the plunge and it feels pretty weird.

I like this definition of FIRE. Every part of it hits home for me. There&#039;s a reason I always put the word &quot;retirement&quot; or &quot;retired&quot; in quotes, and that&#039;s because I will never stop doing, building, and creating. Some people might get bent out of shape and call that work, but if it&#039;s work I want to do, when I want to do it, it&#039;s not really work at all. It&#039;s more like a hobby, and we all need hobbies, right?]]></description>
