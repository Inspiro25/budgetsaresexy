					<description><![CDATA[Personal capital is fantastic for both listing the fees for all of your funds, as well as showing you your overall asset allocation. 

It takes about five minutes to set up.

The fee piece, in particular, is very motivating in terms of taking action steps to improve your portfolio (i.e. moving money out of expensive funds and into inexpensive index funds.)

Personally, I&#039;m not a fan of paying them a dime  for their investment services.

					<description><![CDATA[Doing #7 because of #2 is common and dangerous.  This is especially true for value investors or people who want to be value investors anyways.  They have a plan to own a company&#039;s stock for the long haul, but they give into fear and sell when the company starts to tank.  It&#039;s a dang shame!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m heavily invested in Vanguard target date and Wellesley funds but not everything.  I use Fidelity to hold all of my rollover IRA&#039;s and Roth IRA.  I&#039;ve taken the slow and steady approach and set it and forget it.  My company just started offering the Roth 401k.  I&#039;m sinking 7% into that and 15% into my 401k.  My company matches 3%.  Started investing with my first real job @ 21 and I&#039;ll be 38 in march.  In those years of investing I&#039;ve learned a few lessons some harder than others.  Would love to retire early to a log cabin in the mountains!!!  Maybe one day, a man can dream.  Cheers!]]></description>

You can also practically forget about rebalancing if you go for one of their diversified funds which contain stocks and bonds and wotnot. They are called life strategy funds over in the UK. I&#039;m not sure what the equivalent is in the US but they&#039;ll definitely have one/some as you always have more investment choices than us! :)]]></description>

I&#039;ll agree with that. A perfect world is low fees and high returns :) Though usually you don&#039;t get high returns consistently, whereas the fees are - so that&#039;s something. Not that I&#039;m the expert here obviously - I don&#039;t even know how high my fees are currently!]]></description>
