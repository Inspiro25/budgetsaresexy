woww!!! that&#039;s one heckofa friend! :) i def. would be feeling a bit weird about it too - esp with such a NEWER car. But - and I say this being on both sides of similar gifting experiences - it&#039;s also very nice to *let friends* do things for you as it makes THEM feel just as great too. Having the means and ability to help out a good friend like that. So while it does prob feel pretty selfish, just think about the gift you&#039;re giving them too in accepting it :) 

And this applies to ANY event in life, big or small, when someone is offering kindness like this. Even when I don&#039;t want or need the &quot;thing&quot; I still accept when I know it&#039;ll bring the other person joy (like when my grandma used to offer up $5 to &#039;treat myself&#039; or force leftovers on me, haha... i didn&#039;t need or want either but after rejecting her once and seeing the sadness in her eyes I always said yes from that moment on! ;))]]></description>

Cheers Matt, and congrats on the new Prius! You&#039;re right about trading in while there&#039;s still a bit of value vs. waiting until it&#039;s worth absolutely nothing. Problem is, there&#039;s no real way to tell when it&#039;s gonna blow up. :)

Have a great weekend!

Anecdotal, but my friend&#039;s 2009 Prius&#039; battery completed died and refused to hold a charge in October. They were having some other minor issues with the car and didn&#039;t want to any money into replacing the battery and replaced it with a new car. That got me thinking about my 2009 Prius and how much battery life I had left. Since I recently paid off our other car, I was willing to take on a new car payment and started shopping around. End of December, we upgraded to a new 2021 Prius and I&#039;m loving it. I hope you get 5 or more years out of your Prius and maybe I would have too, but preferred to replace it while it had trade-in value and when I was financially ready, instead of surprised by a dead battery. A no payments used car from my parents or in-laws would have been even better, even if it meant my insurance and gas expense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Go with your gut! You will know the right decision when you just know. :) I don&#039;t have a car accepting/denying comment, just read in the comments that you are in the process of maybe fostering and I want to say that that is truly wonderful. The world needs more people like you. High five from Connecticut, and now after reading for ages I have commented exactly twice. :) Take care, thanks for a great blog!!!]]></description>

Wow thanks for sharing. Goes to show that even the best of intentions can morph into feelings later that aren&#039;t pleasant. Sorry you had to go through that, but I hope it made the relationship stronger in the end and you came away with a learning opportunity!]]></description>
