					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for guest posting while I was out of town, Pop -- This was a great one :)  Appreciate you responding to comments too.   Have a few of my own:

@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Dang, that is so CRAZY!  I bet it&#039;s like that in Greece too... I always bargained but never to that extreme. If something was 20 of whatever, I&#039;d try for 15... but I&#039;m sure even then I got ripped off ;)  Even though whatever I bought was still worth it to me. So really, everyone wins.
@&lt;b&gt;Katie&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!  And good luck! Let us know how it goes :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - I guess that does make sense... sometimes I actually feel bad getting a super good deal so I&#039;ll give extra to local sellers.  Even here in the US.
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - YUP!!  That pisses me off a lot actually. Like if a friend says something only costs $1,000 down from $5,000 and I still say no to flying wherever they want me to fly.  Yes, it&#039;s a bargain of course but it&#039;s still $1,000!  If I don&#039;t want to spend it, it doesn&#039;t matter where the hell it gets me ;)  Kinda a bad example cuz I love flying and adventuring, but you get the point. Gotta compare fairly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few years ago I went to Australia, bought a 4x4, drove it into the Outback and camped in a tent for 10 months. When I would complain about the hefty costs associated with the car -- the repairs, the maintenance, the &quot;foreigner&quot; insurance premium, extremely high fuel costs --  people used to say, &quot;But think about how much money you saved by camping with your 4x4 instead of staying in hotels every night!&quot; That was totally a false comparison. The cost of staying in hotels every night for 10 months would be so high that I would never consider doing it. If hotels were my only option, I simply wouldn&#039;t have gone to Australia. But by implanting this &quot;comparison&quot; into my mind, people tried to make the cost of maintaining my vehicle seem smaller.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@NoDebtMBA - Agreed. Or maybe just not to care so much whether or not you&#039;re getting a good deal. While Khan el Khalili was a good lesson in negotiating, in the end it IS only one or two American dollars you&#039;re talking about, probably. And in the end, both the buyer and seller are happy.

@Katie - That&#039;s great that you asked for more. So many people don&#039;t even bother. Not asking is the only sure way that you won&#039;t get as much as you could, and employers expect that you will. Good luck!

@retirebyforty - There are tourist taxes in the U.S. too. I&#039;m pretty sure Florida residents pay at least 10% to 20% less than non-Floridians to visit Disney World, for example.

@Financial Success - Yeah, it&#039;s a Western world mindset. We only expect to negotiate at car dealerships or on homes. As long as you can afford to pay a price, though, don&#039;t kick yourself too much about not negotiating on small stuff. That nervousness/pushiness/sense of confrontation you feel when you negotiate might not be worth the $10 or whatever you save.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anchoring is a great way to &#039;set up&#039; a successful sale. I only wish I were better at negotiating. My thoughts are that every price I hear is set in stone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh.. yes, the tourist tax. In Thailand, they have Thai and non Thai pricing for all the tourist destinations. For Thai people to go see the Palace, it cost 5 bath, but for foreigner, it cost 40 bath. That&#039;s still only about $1.25. I think that&#039;s fair because local people make very little money. Of course it helps that Thai has their own numeric characters so foreigners can&#039;t tell how much less they get charged. 
Yeah, everyone love a discount, that&#039;s why anchor price works.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had an interview last night for a position. At the end of the hour long interview, I asked what the salary range was for the position. The person interviewing me told me a number and said if I wanted to negotiate, now was the time to lay on the table what I thought I should get. I had done some research (And the position is within my current organization as well, which helps) - so I upped it by a couple dollars an hour. 

I know what the person in the position previously made, without a college degree, so I am going to be damned if I take the job at a salary lower than that benchmark just because I am trying to move up in the corporate world. 

We&#039;ll see how it goes....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to Khan el-Khalili a few times when I was living in Egypt and it was pretty fun.  Vendors there name ridiculously high prices (for reference a doctor&#039;s starting salary is 220 Egyptian pounds a month and I think the average was like 500 Egyptian pounds) so we would go and name what seemed like ridiculously low prices compared to the starting price.  So if something was listed at 20 Egyptian pounds I&#039;d offer two.  In Arabic.  The vendor talks about how his price is $4 USD and how I&#039;m starving his children etc etc, but you hold your ground, walk away a few times, and only give slight increases.  The vendor won&#039;t sell it to you if it&#039;s a loss but I&#039;d end up getting 20 Egyptian pound items for about 3-4 Egyptian pounds.

The problem is that as a tourist your mental accounting is in dollars and you have some preset notion of what things should cost in USD.  So when the vendor, experienced in the ways of tourists, converts his prices to USD or euros people fall over themselves to pay what are outrageous prices in Egypt (or were when I was there).  Guide books won&#039;t tell you how to get a good deal because the vendor will give you a hard time about it which is not much fun for your vacation and there are many places where prices aren&#039;t 80% tourist inflated and offering 10% of their asking would be incredibly rude.  I guess it&#039;s just really important to know the market if you want to get a good deal.]]></description>
