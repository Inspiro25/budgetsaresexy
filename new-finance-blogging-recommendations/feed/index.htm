					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;GB @ In Budgets We Trust&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool!  No, I&#039;ve never heard of that book yet but I&#039;ll check it out online too :)  I bet there are a TON of great resources out there that we have yet to stumble across ourselves, but as long as we&#039;re open to them we should hopefully continue learning!  Thanks for stopping by, my friend.
@&lt;b&gt;Julie @ Freedom 48&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Yeah, my all-time fave books there so if you ever need one to get you pumped up, now you know where to go ;)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  That&#039;s the hardest part ;)  Once you get going though, it&#039;s smooooooth sailing my friend... and I could have *sworn* you already had a blog going?  Am I just imagining things?  Are there TWO StackingCashes around? Hmm...]]></description>
