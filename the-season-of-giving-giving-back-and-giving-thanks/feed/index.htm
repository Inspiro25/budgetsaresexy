I guess now with easy crowdfunding platforms individuals can invest in, give, or support almost anything.  I was surprised too by these organizations and how they think collectively.  Cheers Simone - Happy Thanksgiving!]]></description>

Hey Steph! You just summed up how Thanksgiving feels to me each year! I&#039;m overwhelmed with gratitude and helping others makes me realize how freaking blessed I am. The more I give --&gt; the more I get.  Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful and uncommon ideas Joel!  I’m going to look into the medical debt because, even though I work in health care, I am horrified by what I feel are exhorbitant and price-gouging practices throughout the field.  This time of year I do the unexpected; pay for the next person in line’s groceries or, if s/he’s only buying a small amount, pay for two. The reaction is always priceless.  My heart overflows with gratitude because not only do I feel like I’ve put some good karma out there, I realize just how freaking blessed I am!  I’ve come to see that people are just so amazed by kindness anymore that they often don’t know what to do or say, and it’s yet another blessing to be a teeny part of someone’s smile in that moment. I tell them thanks, and walk away, with an almighty happy dance in my own heart. 
Slay the world with kindness people!]]></description>

I really like the anonymous part of it all. When strangers help strangers, it encourages a pay-it-forward mentality :)  Happy Thanksgiving Fiona, have a great week!]]></description>

Awesome! I was most surprised about the Amazon Smile one....  I wish I knew about it earlier - I&#039;ve done a ton of shopping over the years and could have been donating this whole time! It&#039;s free!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, Joel...I&#039;m quite the Christmas Elf when it comes to donating this time of year, but you&#039;ve come up with some absolutely brilliant and unusual ideas here!

This year I&#039;m focusing my giving on those who tend to slip through the cracks, like families who work but barely make enough to get by, and also homebound/isolated senior citizens. Nursing homes and similar are hurting this year because social group activities (e.g. girl scouts, school clubs) aren&#039;t happening.]]></description>
