It&#039;s a spreadsheet of course! I have an odd obession with excel LOL. It&#039;s a nice tool because sometimes I realize that I&#039;ve been buying only skirts and it stops me from  buying even more skirts :)]]></description>

I used to do my best to ignore all those smaller purchases, but now I give in and fully allow myself them. I find they bring me more joy than most everything else! And plus they&#039;re budgeted in ;)]]></description>

I hope I can stick to it for that long - I tend to give up after a few months, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keep in mind that it&#039;s also hard to resist going out to eat or buying coffee everyday, and doing that may actually save money in the long run. $4 coffee adds up! I have never heard of this impulse save app before, but it sounds interesting! I&#039;m more of a rainy-day fund type of girl so I tend to focus on saving money automatically.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The hardest thing is to refrain from buying something you really want. I prefer not to go shopping too often, otherwise I will always find a thing or two I can&#039;t live without.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a clever idea! I think that this would motivate me to save more and stop myself from buying things that I don&#039;t end up using/needing

I actually keep track of the clothes that I buy.  I don&#039;t buy THAT much clothes but I keep track of what I bought, when I bought it and if I have worn it or not.  If the merchandise still hasn&#039;t been worn after 2 weeks, I return it because I clearly didn&#039;t love it because I didn&#039;t wear it.  This prevents me from hoarding and buying things because I found a good deal]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s definitely a clever idea, although as you said - not technically saving. Just &quot;not spending&quot;. It would be interesting to see where this tracker takes you 1-2 years from now! Definitely an exercise to be considered by chronic shoppers.]]></description>
