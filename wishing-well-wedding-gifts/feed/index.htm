					<description><![CDATA[Sorry guys but $30 is very frugal/tight.   You gotta think,  most wedding receptions cost about $130 to 150 per head.  If its a cheap hired hall with the &quot;Auntie Bev&quot; doing the catering then maybe $30 is fine.  but if its a reception place,  at least you can give them what they spent on your head cost.
Apparently in Vietnam,  as the guest families arrive,  they announce them and also &#039;their donation&#039; to the wedding,  whilst each family about to enter hears this and wants to one-up the previous family, they end up adding more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m amazed at the difference in the meaning of “wishing well” from my generation to today’s!  I’m 51 and when I read the words “wishing well” on a baby or bridal shower invitation I know that to mean...I bring a small unwrapped gift for baby/bride &#038; toss it in the actual wishing well (rented or made out of a plastic laundry basket). It’s neither tacky or distasteful but a very nice way to stock the new mother’s medicine cabinet/baby supply cabinet  or the new brides spice cabinet/pantry/kitchen etc...  Asking for cash on top of a gift for a honeymoon fund or wedding fund etc was never done and would be considered very tacky and rude. If my husband and I couldn’t afford to pay for our own honeymoon then guess what, we didn’t go on one...imagine that!  Lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One wishing well I experienced they requested you bring your favorite spice / spice mix, with recipe. Neat idea.

A recent baby shower they had pre-printed cards to write wishes for the baby. I was at their house this weekend and the parents have the card strung on a faux clothes line decorating the baby&#039;s room. That is a cool thing in my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 66 &#038; have been to many, bridal showers over the years. The Wishing Well here on Long Island is when you fill up w/little incidentals like kitchen gadgets even older people, or rich people or already co-habiting people still might not have (ex.&#039;s ; a pizza cutter, measuring spoons, corkscrew, kitchen towels, wooden spoons, toothpicks in a fancy holder, salt &#038; pepper shakers, napkin holders, a gravy ladle, small Tupperware-like containers, paper goods [plates &#038; cups]), etc. BUT NEVER MONEY !]]></description>
