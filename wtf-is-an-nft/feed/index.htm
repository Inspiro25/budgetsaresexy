Hey Ryan! Yeah, that would not surprise me at all. 

I know some really smart people see potential here. But plenty of really smart people also think they&#039;re complete B.S!!!

Only time will tell. Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[NFT&#039;s are the most bizarre concept for me. It seems like digital beanie babies where you can replicate endlessly but add a NFT &quot;#536&quot; to it. 
Big money at stake for these too, but I think we are all going to look back at these 5 years from now and go &quot;WTH were we thinking?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey G, 

That&#039;s basically correct. 

OpenSea is a marketplace with sellers (like you) and buyers. 

Your picture would need to be compelling enough such that a buyer would want to pay money to own it. Your transaction would occur on the Ethereum blockchain, i.e. you&#039;d be paid in Ethereum cryptocurrency. 

Hope that helps and thank you for reading!

					<description><![CDATA[So if I understood it correctly, I can snap a picture and upload it say OpenSea and start selling it as a NFT. 
If it is correct, how do I sell it and get paid?
Thank you.

I&#039;m with you Julius! Even after all this research and whatnot, I still don&#039;t understand how this is a solid investment. I&#039;ll stick with what I know!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s pretty amazing just how much things change so quickly. It&#039;s not even about cryptocurrencies anymore, it&#039;s about a derivative of cryptocurrencies. Can&#039;t imagine what the future will look like in the next 5 - 10 years out, too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/wtf-is-an-nft/#comment-323524&quot;&gt;Accidentally Retired&lt;/a&gt;.

I hear ya, AR! Give me a year, and *maybe* I&#039;ll start to see the light enough to consider purchasing an NFT. But right now? I can&#039;t convince myself it&#039;s even close to a true investment. 

Good to see you here :)
