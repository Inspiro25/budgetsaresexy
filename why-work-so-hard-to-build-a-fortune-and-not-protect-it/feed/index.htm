I still need to look into short term and long-term too. My wife gets some (I think short term?) through her new job but I&#039;ve been slacking on it for myself. And I&#039;m a $$$ blogger!]]></description>

I really wanted one too until I had kids. Now I don&#039;t dare as the thought of leaving them behind freaks me out so much :(]]></description>

I never even thought/heard of no insurance after FIRE until the other month! It seems to be a hot topic lately all of a sudden..... Still freaks me out thinking about it, but then again I&#039;m pretty far from hitting ER so it&#039;s not top of mind :)]]></description>

Also, cuz it&#039;s usually boring :) But wouldn&#039;t be so much if people shared their stories like Gene did here! Puts it all in much more perspective, doesn&#039;t it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s incredible how safely you can behave and still have tragedy hit you so quickly. I had never heard of Search and Rescue Riders. I have renter&#039;s insurance but not short-term disability. I really need to add that, but the debt is getting in the way. My small business has an umbrella policy, but it does not truly extend to most areas of my life.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure exactly, I just like the idea :) Maybe protects from hackers or keyboards exploding? Haha... Every year or so I&#039;ll get someone reaching out from an insurance company talking about starting something but doesn&#039;t get much farther out than ideas. There&#039;s probably some businessy insurance that would do the trick but wouldn&#039;t be as cool sounding :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Hope you get better soon. Thank you for sharing your story. It was hard just to look at that x ray picture, I can&#039;t imagine the pain you were in. Your story was enlightening and educational. I had never heard of search and rescue coverage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gene, hope you get better each day and can go back to work soon. My son always want have a motorcycle, but I forbid it as it is so accident prone.
