					<description><![CDATA[I am an employer and it happened to me and let me tell you, it stinks.  People who don&#039;t own the business don&#039;t understand a hard-won client; it takes a long time and a lot of money and a lot of risk and anxiety to set up shop; it may seem like nothing to accept an &quot;under the table&quot; deal but it definitely kills small business.  And it really makes it hard for employers to trust again.  The employer would love to hear from the customer if this is ever happening.]]></description>

As an employer, I would have to fire the poor s.o.b. it bring me to the point of an electrical contractor recommends me to a client of his because I&#039;m a handy man and they needed drywall work, I go and meet his customer discuss options and the customer finds out my I&#039;m am an electrician also. So they proceed to ask be if I wanted to do the lighting as well. I refused on morals alone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[while I was away from the job site for a little while my long term customer asked one of the employees if we did demolition also, he stated yes he did and proceeded to steal a lead from me. while I mainly do tree and crane service I also do these type of things and if not I pass it to someone that can represent my good name with standards I would expect and this employee could not do that since he only owns a Hurst and a Pickup but since he was new he said &quot;it doesn&#039;t say demo on the vehicles so I dint know&quot; so he still claims he was right and felt no guilt or need to apologize and he proceeded to try and steal the 3500.00 dollar job from me anyway.   what has happen to personal responsibility and owning up to being wrong?]]></description>

I think if it made you feel bad, then you did the right thing to bring it up :) And usually when the other person gets really defensive, it means they know it wasn&#039;t the right way either. (though it also depends on *how* it was brought up too, so that part plays a huge role).

Either way, hope things get better with you two - never fun to deal w/ situations like this :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today Ed, Call me
Ed, is a guy I&#039;m doing work for some concrete work 
And he call me asking me for my carpenter foreman phone number
So I ask what do you need ?
he said well Tony is going to do some drywall for me so I was like ohh ok 
So I call Tony and I ask why he didn&#039;t tell me 
And he said well you don&#039;t do drywall  
so I said ok but that guy is my client 
And I felt you and him are running over me 
and he was no really happy because I confronted him 

At the end of the day I don&#039;t care about the extra work is just about trust
 if that was me I would asked first even if he didn&#039;t do that type of work.  
I didn&#039;t like the fact that he didn&#039;t mentioned. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
Sorry for my spelling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The point is that the business owner in order to find that client, to make that phone ring; 
 had to invest money, time and effort. I&#039;m sorry but that is stealing! There&#039;s an overhead that everybody 
is missing to talk about. Looking for the clients is the harder stuff.]]></description>
