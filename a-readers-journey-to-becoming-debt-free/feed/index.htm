					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad you all enjoyed this!!!  It took me a bit to convince Anonymous to allow me to post it up, but I kept assuring him/her that it would inspire others :)  And I think it did!  I&#039;ll try and post up more in the future - I get a lot out of them too.  

If any of YOU have interesting background stories, or philosophies, let me know!  j (at) budgets are sexy (dot) com.  I always have my eyes open.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your story, and congratulations on being out of debt! I know how hard it can be to cut back on the things you love, but when it comes down to it, they really are just things. Living without the constant stress of paying off a debt is much more important than any &quot;thing&quot; in the end. At the same time, though, it&#039;s important not to get so frugal that you begin denying yourself life&#039;s little pleasures! Which is why I love that rather than nix what you enjoy altogether, you just found cheaper alternatives (ex: the less expensive wine.) Good job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What an inspiration! I would love to hear more of her story and others just like it. Her story really drives home the idea that anyone and everyone can benefit from budgeting. And she did it by finding economical alternatives and she is still living comfortably. Plus she has options! Brilliant!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rock on! Love this story. I share the same philosophy (except I pay rent and will continue to do so while I work. Will probably buy something in cash when I retire). I live in a small space in the city -- so no car, no property taxes, no home maintenance costs, no cell phone (free through work), very low utilities (less than $50 a month total). My biggest fixed expense is probably cable/internet at $100 a month.]]></description>
