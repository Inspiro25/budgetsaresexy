					<description><![CDATA[Read it, loved it, continue living it, well, some of it!  I later got a version of the book on tape too. (we had to do that in the &quot;90s, podcasts were not invented yet, come to think of it, neither was the internet until 1993 for me.) 
and listened to it a few times while driving between customer sales calls.

Bottom Line: Your self-talk matters so it might as well be about positive and productive topics to move your own needle in your chosen direction.]]></description>

Ahhh good one!!

Didn&#039;t recall that passage but a great one to make your mantra :)

I hope your book is all kinds of highlighted and underlined! Those are the best to keep around for future inspiration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In his book, he shares a story of a man digging for gold, he gives up after trying for so long, I think he sells the land/equipment to someone else, and they dig a little more and strike gold.

This section is titled &#039;Three Feet from Gold&#039; and that has been my life mantra since I read this book years ago. It&#039;s my reminder to never give up on my goals, because who knows how close I am.

I have the version that came out in the 80s and I love how beat up/vintage it looks. Maybe one day I&#039;ll stumble upon the 1st edition though!]]></description>
