					<description><![CDATA[We usually gave our kids a dollar, and they were happy...but later would mention that a friend got more :/.  When they were a little older, and the dentist was going to have to start pulling the slow-to-fall-out teeth, we offered them $5 for any teeth they could wiggle out on their own!  Saved us a little money on the dentist bill!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m hanging my head in shame as one of the big spenders for teeth. We pay $5 per tooth.  But in my defense, we accidentally set the bar high. His first 2 teeth were extractions so warranted a little extra. We wanted something per tooth, plus the extraction and as a non-cash family, all we could scrounge up was 3 $5 bills. Every tooth my son has lost has been relatively dramatic if not traumatic though (a headbutt from the dog, a failed attempt to do the string trick, lost in a burger, and almost swallowed overnight) so he actually probably deserved the $5 each time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE GIVING THEIR KIDS BIG BUCKS FOR TEETH!?! I do live in the midwest where the average is the lowest but seriously!?! My son swallowed his first tooth while eating lunch at school. He wrote the tooth fairy a note explaining what happened. She did leave him $1 and note asking to make sure he didn&#039;t swallow the next one. After all, she&#039;s in the tooth business. When he lost is second tooth (this one not swallowed!) he got $1 for that one. That means his entire mouth will cost $20 (unless he needs braces-Lord help us).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Daaaaaaaang, $3-4 per tooth?! I&#039;m with whoever said they got 50 cents in the 80s. Good grief. I&#039;ll keep the cool coins and whatnot in mind for when my little one starts losing teeth...]]></description>
