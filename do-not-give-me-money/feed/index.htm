					<description><![CDATA[I think the emails and too long and drug out to make them believe able.  I know if anyone I knew was in that position there were be more &#039;panic&#039; in their message.  Sure there would be misspellings and improper sentence structure.  My goodness, they just got mugged in a foreign country and are now stranded there.  They would be a mess....

Thanks for the heads up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have gotten these emails SO many times I can&#039;t even tell how many exactly I received. Most of them were asking for my personal/bank information because they needed help &quot;claiming their inheritance&quot; and such. And you&#039;re right, it must work because I started getting these emails years ago, and I still receive them to this day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting way to look at it for sure...esp when most of us are posting up all the times we&#039;re away from home and every last detail!  Remember that one site that was out there?  Something like PleaseRobMe.com or around that?  I think it was bought out by a consumer watch group, but it used to aggregate all the tweets of people who would &quot;check in&quot; to different places on foursquare - basically telling everyone that they&#039;re not home and to &quot;come rob them.&quot; Haha....crazy.
@&lt;b&gt;Bucksome Boomer&lt;/b&gt; - Dang, people fall for it all the time! :(
@&lt;b&gt;Nunzio Bruno&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...that was the year I got OUT of school!  With $0.00 in my pockets and a big dream to make it in NYC ;)  I got half of that right at least - I did move to NYC!
@&lt;b&gt;ken&lt;/b&gt; - Indeed :)  Plus, I would like to think that if you somehow had access to a computer you&#039;d easily have access to a telephone.  $hit, I bet these emails are written on iPhones!  That would explain the grammar.
@&lt;b&gt;Jerry&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Only problem is a lot of people don&#039;t use their noggin&#039;....esp me, but luckily not when it comes to money ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, really?  Do you live in Haiti too?  That&#039;s sad man, sorry to hear :(  (about the hacking, not about if you live in Haiti.  Although, I am sorry to hear all that sadnes too!  did any of that I just say make sense?)
@&lt;b&gt;David H.&lt;/b&gt; - Microsoft is still around? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This just happened to my fiancee&#039;s mother about 2 weeks ago.  First they got her MSN Hotmail / Live e-mail account.  Then they figured out she had the same password for gmail and facebook and hacked those too.  They all used the United Kingdom story.  Thankfully no one sent any money in.  She got the gmail account back the quickest after filling out one of the request forms then facebook then hotmail.  Apparently microsoft didn&#039;t want to help because it was a free versus a premium account.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I honestly can&#039;t believe that people will fall for something like this - after all of the publicity these scams have received. I&#039;m still getting emails about me winning drawings and lotteries that I never entered! 

I am the treasurer of an orphanage in Haiti, and our president&#039;s email account (the one tied to the orphanage) was hacked and one of these &quot;I&#039;m stranded in [insert country]&quot; emails was sent to many of our donors and potential donors. Needless to say, this cost us in many ways!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We use craigslist all the time and get scam responses constantly from there.  I also get them regularly in my spam e-mail.  I guess you&#039;re only insurance for not getting taken in by these scammers is to use common sense.  If it seems at all strange it&#039;s because it probably is.  If it leads you to scratch your head wondering about certain aspects don&#039;t act on it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like how in the first spam mail it says &quot;I can’t access phone for now.&quot;
What company would stop you from making a phone call if it meant they get their money?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is some seriously crazy stuff. That second one looked all to real - I&#039;m glad to hear that your friend got their email back. We (financial bloggers) write about money, budgeting, and financial planning all the time but I haven&#039;t seen an article about identity protection and how to not fall victim to it in a while. Nice work! 

I loved the zombie reference and pictures too..it kind of reminds me of my early college years and those sad calls home I&#039;d have to make after an unexpectedly expensive weekend...ohhh the fall of 2002 - that was some fun times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our newspaper had a story about a woman getting this same type of scam email from her &quot;grandson&quot;.  

I can see sending money for a loved one, but it&#039;d be hard for me to even think about doing so for a friend.  (Wouldn&#039;t you wonder why they didn&#039;t contact their family?)]]></description>
