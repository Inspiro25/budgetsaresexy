					<description><![CDATA[True indeed, my friend! Though now I print them off first and *then* I archive away. And usually don&#039;t have to go back looking for them :) But it would be smart to label them as well just in case I ever need to - I appreciate the tip! And you&#039;re right - you&#039;ll have a lot more to write up once you own :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Instead of just archiving useful documents for taxes in gmail, why not add an &quot;incometaxes&quot; label and star them AND THEN archive the email? That&#039;s what I do for charitable donations, even though I don&#039;t have enough to itemize this year. Next year, however, that will be more useful since I will have mortgage interest to itemize!

You could even use sub-labels, say:
1) incometaxes/personal
2) incometaxes/blogging
3) incometaxes/lovedrop

And then you would have separate records for each of these entities!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. Money, I&#039;m right there with you. Tax season is that wonderful time of year where everyone seems to be perpetually grumpy, grumbling about filing taxes and numbers. Numbers! I thought I was done with numbers after college! Anyway, to take the edge off, we created a post at Mango that actually has some interesting information about taxes. I know-- I thought it was impossible too! Check it out, it might make you smile! :o)  http://www.mangomoney.com/blog/news-insights/10-things-you-never-knew-about-taxes]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man.... well, after another 7 hours organizing and categorizing Love Drop&#039;s paperwork, it looks like I&#039;m almost done!  I have another hour or so to double check everything, and then wait for all the forms to be mailed and hit my inbox and all that, but other than that stuff I think we&#039;re sitting pretty finally.  Boy, what a mess...

I can&#039;t wait to post about 2012&#039;s taxes though, and how much I&#039;m gonna rock that $hit!! Haha... all a learning process, I guess ;)

@&lt;b&gt;bogofdebt&lt;/b&gt; - Nice.  I haven&#039;t ever tried filofaxes before, but if they&#039;re what I&#039;m thinking of I think they&#039;re great ideas.  And even more so holding on to all your tax stuff for 7 years - well done, my friend! Very smart.
@&lt;b&gt;Jeffrey&lt;/b&gt; - So you just scan in all phsyical receipts as you get them then?  The part that scares me there is if your comp dies! Yikes.  Maybe you&#039;re good at backing stuff up though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I know - def. the hardest part is finding that system that works and getting started.  After spending 5 more hours today on it (the Love Drop part) I&#039;m pretty confident I&#039;ll be motivated to stick to it... I can&#039;t go through this pain again!  (And yeah, only good thing about paying $25k in taxes is that I made a lot more ;) And as long as that keeps happening, I&#039;ll be happy to keep paying more taxes!)
@&lt;b&gt;Carrie - Careful Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Carrie!  No, have&#039;t heard of Lemon before but I like the name :)  I&#039;ll check it out in a bit, once I post this.  Keep up doing a great accounting job over there!  That&#039;s sexy ;)
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - Aww, thanks. Appreciate it :)  I am glad that I can do that as well, but man - still sucky I have to learn the hard way a lot of times... and the only reason I started so early this year was cuz I knew it was gonna be a pain, and just wanted to get it done once and for all. Bleh... 2012 is gonna be a helluva lot better, you wait! :)
@&lt;b&gt;slug &#124; sunkcostsareirrelevant.com&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a smart idea.  If you think you&#039;re doing well, and nothing major changes w/ your stuff, then great - keep it up, bro!
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  It does get a bit more exciting though once you do *your* part, and then you&#039;re waiting to see all the magic they do and what the final outcome is :)  I like the surprise &quot;final&quot; numbers at the end... well, *surprise* only if it&#039;s a good one! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Robin&lt;/b&gt; - Aww, good!!  I&#039;m glad you were able to find it - we decided to leave up the site mostly as-is until we work on Phase II... that way we can all check it out whenever and get happy :)  Have a great weekend!
@&lt;b&gt;Heather Stephens&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  And yup - no way I&#039;m doing all these myself, I totally don&#039;t trust myself at all w/ hardcore details, I&#039;m more of a rough estimate kinda guy ;)  Which is not good for this stuff, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Chris P&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice!  Is that because you&#039;re a minimalist, or just cuz it&#039;s cheaper to rent/own? :)
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I know, right?  It&#039;s so awesome!  That&#039;s pretty much what took me 5 hours today too, going in and entering every single reciept into my spreadsheet - jeez... I think doing it once a month is gonna be MUCH much better going forward.  I don&#039;t mind mini spurts of 20 mins here and there, but there&#039;s no way I&#039;m doing that many hours again down the road.  I learned my lesson! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I can&#039;t get an electronic bill/statement which is easy peasy to save, I scan everything, save it to my computer and back it up to my Seagate. Then I feed the original to my shredder. When you live in 850 square feet, you gotta save space!]]></description>
