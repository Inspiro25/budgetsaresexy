					<description><![CDATA[I seriously cannot get this song out of my head!  I had no idea she was only 16, that&#039;s just ridiculous.  If you haven&#039;t seen this a cappella version, check it out:

Haha... 401k statements DO make things better for us, indeed ;) Sometimes I wonder if the Joneses are just putting on a show for the rest of us, and in actuality they&#039;re squirreling away a ton of cash but they don&#039;t want us seeing it, haha... Like, it&#039;s some sort of cult and they&#039;re outsmarting all of us ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a friend, she and her husband are the Joneses.  They won a lawsuit and now live like the money won&#039;t ever stop.  They both have professional careers, lawyer, vice president of development for non profit.  Just bought a home for $560,000.
Both drive new cars, wants to dabble in real estate and flip a house before the end of the year.  She is flying to New York for her birthday to shop.  Wanting to know if we wanted to go. Ummm no, can&#039;t afford it at the spur of the moment. Joneses make me sick. Then I look at my 401k statement and I feel better. lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This song has been dominating the airwaves for quite some time. Every time I hear it, I never get sick of it and it still hits home every time. It&#039;s just such as amazing song and she&#039;s an amazing person to realize that at such a young age, living that lifestyle is silly. 

I , too nominate that song as the official personal finance song.]]></description>

They DO have national health care.  It&#039;s actually pretty amazing.  I was living there for a little bit back in 2007 and it worked out pretty well.  I had friends from the US that got reasonably injured and were able to get fantastic health care free of charge.  Makes life pretty great :)]]></description>
