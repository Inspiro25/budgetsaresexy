Yes it&#039;s really weird. My only guess is it&#039;s some regulation that they have to abide by. And maybe not common enough that they are pushing for change.   On the positive side, at least if you fund in 1 chunk a single wire isn&#039;t too bad.]]></description>

I can&#039;t understand why they would require a wire transfer. That&#039;s bizarre.]]></description>
