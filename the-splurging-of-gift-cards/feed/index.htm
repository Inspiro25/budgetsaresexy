					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Deanna&lt;/b&gt; - Layaway? Wow, haven&#039;t heard that term in a while.. just for that I&#039;ll leave your comment up even though you&#039;re posting for a company ;)  (and yes, you should try it!! it&#039;s fun I promise - but only if you get things you actually need and not just to get rid of them.)
@&lt;b&gt;Kerry&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That is awesome.  You should treat yourself to something nice that you&#039;d normally not spend on yourself :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money -- What a fun idea?  I have a ton of cards and am thinking of shoppig this weekend.  Although many cards are for restaurants so free lunch and dinner may be added to the agenda.  One idea to throw your way is to use gift cards for programs like layaway.  If a Sears or Kmart gift card cross your desk, consider using it towards a bigger ticket item.  Layaway allows you to pay over time without incurring finance charges. Easy to use and perfect for budgeting.

					<description><![CDATA[As much as I wanted ALL of those things (Esp that watch - it was on sale from $450 to $199!!!), I ended up with just the bedspread and the addidas. The two things we actually needed. Or at least kinda needed ;)  That bag was pretty hot too - I&#039;m 99.9% it was a chick&#039;s bag, but man was that thing smooth to roll around.  Looked like it could fit a lot in there too.

Some replies:

@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - I was tempted!  Already have a similar watch though (blinged out, of course), and i don&#039;t know where I&#039;d put that pig... which is unfortunate because it only cost $10 bucks!
@&lt;b&gt;Uncle El&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that is a MAN&#039;s watch! :) But you got half of it right.
@&lt;b&gt;sarah&lt;/b&gt; - You know me well my friend ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Hahhaha... aye!  nope.  those skulls were actually really shiny pillows - pretty cool though.  but the wife was NOT impressed by them.
@&lt;b&gt;momcents&lt;/b&gt; - Ummmm... don&#039;t you girls have purses?  if I can keep them in a Money Clip you have no excuse! :) or you can put them in your glove compartment too.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome little gifts, indeed!
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh very nice! I heard that Gap promo shut down Groupon for a bit too... was so popular it crashed the servers, right?
@&lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; - If you lived closer i&#039;d buy it for your birthday :)  don&#039;t think it would make it via the mail too well.
@&lt;b&gt;Suba @ Wealth Informatics&lt;/b&gt; - You won!!!!  Well done my friend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have the same problem as momcents. I have quite a few of these &#060;$5 gift cards to expensive places. I still keep them around because... well.. it is $5 but I end up just storing them. Once in a while I go for a &#034;cheap&#034; shopping, to see if I can find something to buy with that gift card. Last year I just ended up giving a gift card with ~$2 to someone in the line behind me, atleast they could use it.

And I am going to go with the comforter set and the adidas.]]></description>
