Sounds like a fun problem to solve over time! I have a vague idea about my draw down strategy, but it&#039;s not really well thought out because i&#039;m still years away from retirement. Good to keep in mind though for sure. Perhaps I should also start tracking rental property payments and cashflow, as well as dividends from all the funds I hold.

Have a great week!

					<description><![CDATA[I track my net worth on occasion, but as I get closer to retirement, the more important number is the amount of income my net worth generates.  Building a retirement paycheck is the ultimate goal of investing so it makes sense to focus on that number the closer you are to retirement. At some point, you&#039;ll need to convert a growth portfolio to an income portfolio to make your wealth last.  

Just two cents from a man approaching 50 ;-)]]></description>

Great to hear you&#039;re staying active despite the cold!  You&#039;re right, even .5 miles is better than 0! Just raising your heart rate each day is a great goal. :)

Wishing you a great weekend too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I front load my Roth in Jan so I don&#039;t have to think about it for the rest of the year. (In the background I&#039;m saving up for next year but that&#039;s automatic.) I figure my 401k gives me enough dollar cost averaging.

Great start to your 1k goal!
I had a good start to my walking goal in Jan, but the East Coast snow storm has meant a slow start for Feb. I am proud of myself for getting out, and having a &#039;start&#039; for the month. 0.5 or 1 mile is better than 0 miles.

Have a great weekend! I think people are excited about a Superb Owl?]]></description>

haha! Mathematically, if you have the money, it&#039;s better to front load in a lump sum than it is to dollar cost average.   Play around with this calculator....

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-report-5-man-alive/#comment-320477&quot;&gt;HM&lt;/a&gt;.

HM - I love the way you think!  Umm... this is embarrassing to admit, but, I am already contributing 100% of my salary into my 401k. I know, it&#039;s very small, but I only work part time right now. So there is no additional paycheck money available to put in there. So unless I get a pay raise or do more contract work for my employer (very possible!) I can&#039;t put more in my 401k.

That being said, I can always invest excess money in our after-tax brokerage account. In the long run, mathematically, it should work out better than paying down our mortgage.

One last note.... Remember how I told you in your other comment that it all depends on the mortgage rate?...  You are locking in at 2.5%, which has a huge difference to someone with say, 7%, etc..  Anyway, my mortgage for this rental is 4.125% which is low considering, but also given the expected lower returns in the stock market the next 10 years, maybe it&#039;s just a safer play for some of my money.  It&#039;s just a thought.

Have a great weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome work! I always debate whether to front load my Roth as opposed to dollar cost averaging through the first half of the year. I was regretting the front load in March last year. But because my past self has already set an automatic $6,000 payment for the first of the year, it&#039;s more work for me to change so I&#039;m a front loader for life now haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joel,

Congrats on a good month! We love boring months with no extra spending :) Quick question, if we have determined that investing in retirement funds are always better than paying down mortgage, why don&#039;t you completely fund your 401k first before paying down your rental mortgage?

Thanks!]]></description>

Hey J$! Yep, selling stuff is a great habit and a constant reminder that everything has a value to someone out there. Plus, it&#039;s FUN!
Have a great weekend my friend!]]></description>
