					<description><![CDATA[HAH!  No to the money, no to the wedding, and no to any other questions that may be brewing ;)  But at least I gave him a chance to prove himself one way or the other. So now I know.  Anytime I think about giving him more money, it&#039;ll only be as a gift.  He&#039;s like a perpetual 16 y/o when it comes to money, stuck in a 60 y/o&#039;s body ;)  Love him to death though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been 3 years since this post. Has your uncle paid you back any of it? Does he talk about it? I&#039;m hoping that he still went to your wedding, right?]]></description>
