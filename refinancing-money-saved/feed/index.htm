					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Yep!  Exactly.  And if it weren&#039;t satisfying I&#039;d totally go the more financially-factual route ;)
@&lt;b&gt;lam91897&lt;/b&gt; - Rock on!!!  That&#039;s so awesome.
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - I know you are!  And doing a good job so far, keep it up yo!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Me neither.  But I think I&#039;d rather have hundreds of G&#039;s in cash than $0 mortgage, haha... at least at the current moment.
@&lt;b&gt;LLF&lt;/b&gt; - You know, one day I AM going to do that ;)  I think it&#039;s on my Life List actually - to place $500 or so on black just to say I&#039;ve done it and to get that rush!!!  I&#039;ll let you know whenever I get the balls ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... one of the few times being lazy works in your favor! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks :)  Castles and fortresses always make me feel secure!  I swear I&#039;d try and live in one if it were possible... and I had the money like Scrooge McDuck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks dude.
@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it def. helps having your emotions in check :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ SheBloggs&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow.  HUGE E-Fund but def. smart!  My mortgages are the hardest for me to pay off.  As bad as it sounds, I honestly block it out a lot of times cuz it drives me insane!  It&#039;s the only part left for us to tackle and it kills me.... hate those damn things ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - You suck!!! haha... did you sell your house or did you actually pay it off?  You get equal respect points either way ;)
@&lt;b&gt;bleu&lt;/b&gt; - Also a woman who knows what she wants ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brandi&lt;/b&gt; - A romantic trip at that!  Watch for my post tomorrow, maybe it&#039;ll spark some ideas ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger B @ Ask the IRS B*tch&lt;/b&gt; - We try!
@&lt;b&gt;katie&lt;/b&gt; - It can be a tough balance sometimes too... sometimes you just want to see huge amounts being tackled, but then if you throw it all one way, the other side is now not as sexy.  But you gotta do what makes you the most comfortable!]]></description>
