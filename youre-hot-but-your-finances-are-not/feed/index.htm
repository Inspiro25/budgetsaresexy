					<description><![CDATA[Neither my husband nor I had student loans or credit card debt when we started dating, but most of that was due to financial education (always pay off credit cards in full every month!) and financial support (to cover what scholarships didn&#039;t, loans to cover used cars, etc.) from our parents. Our lack of debts wasn&#039;t necessarily an indication of greater character than someone who has a significant amount of debt--even bad debt--but who is trying or is willing to try to tackle it.]]></description>

That&#039;s right man - you can only deal with stuff in the present, can&#039;t go back in time! Especially when you didn&#039;t even know what was UP back in time! Haha... Good for you guys working on it now, and for her admitting it&#039;s a problem - which of course is the hardest part of all of it :)]]></description>

Yup - I&#039;d agree! Student debt is way different than c/c and other consumer debt which I think Lance implied here (all his examples lean that way, anyway), but prob better if it was pointed out somewhere. Student loans show drive and a PLAN for the future! That&#039;s 100% sexy!!]]></description>

Yup - agree 100%. It&#039;s the *type* of debt that matters most, besides the fact if they&#039;re consciously working towards things or not... Should have been pointed out somewhere in the article for sure.]]></description>

I think there&#039;s a good difference here between loads of *student loan debt* and loads of *credit card debt* when first starting to date too. I wouldn&#039;t be too turned off by the student debt even though it sucks, but a massive c/c bill that wasn&#039;t medical/other unfortunate circumstance-related? That would throw up a red flag.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Going into our marriage, we knew what each other made more or less but never got into any real deep financial talk. Once we bought a house and especially once we had our first kid, my wife was using here credit cards more and wasn&#039;t able to pay them off in full. Adding the student loan and car loan on top of this made for a bit of a situation. The worst part is, I had no idea. A couple of years ago, she happened to pick up Total Money Makeover which then prompted me to ask questions and led me to see where the finances stood. While encouraging that she realized there was a problem needing fixing, I&#039;m disappointed that we weren&#039;t connected on that level. Things have been a lot better financially and we&#039;re slowly whittling down the debt, but we haven&#039;t taken on any more debt aside from moving which increased the mortgage amount.

I really wish we had discussed the hows and whys of finance much earlier on in our relationship, but at least we&#039;re talking now.]]></description>
