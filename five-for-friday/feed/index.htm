					<description><![CDATA[1. Groceries -- and I&#039;m not typing out the full list!
2. $36.70 -- plus the $20 cash I got back so I could give Princess Penelope her allowance!
3. $8653.89 --- and yes, I could just about wipe out my debt with that cash, but as a single parent, I feel the need to have some in reserve. Besides, I think I NEED to get in the habit of being more frugal and the arduous task of paying this all off is hopefully developing the better habits.
4. Approximately $100
5. A drawerful!
6. I prefer to drive --- other people drive like crap! ha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.  I rented a movie from Amazon.
2.  $2.99  I don&#039;t watch (thus don&#039;t pay for) TV.  Heck of a lot cheaper to pay for only the screen time I&#039;m actually going to use.  My entertainment spending is about $10-12 per month.
3.  About $5K
4.  $2.99  :)
5.  About 20.  It&#039;s important to have an &quot;emergency fund&quot; of undies!  
6.  I&#039;m usually alone, so it&#039;s best if I take the driver&#039;s seat.  In a classroom, meeting, movie, etc., I always take the back row so I can see everything that goes on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. New roof for house and detatched garage. 40yr shingles with ice and watershield under most of it, so even with our winters we don&#039;t plan to do this again in our lifetime.
2. ~$18,375, but all cash. Ouch.
3. $1000 (we never let our account drop below this). We also life on ~55% of our take home so unless we both lose our jobs simultaneously we can get by without changes on my husband&#039;s income, and with minor alterations and cutting on mine.  He was laid off 4 yrs ago and I was laid off (with months of notice) this past December. With his big severance package he didn&#039;t bother applying for unemployement - he wouldn&#039;t have qualified for a year. I applied and after using up the waiting period and time equivalent to my vacation payout I only received one payment before starting my new job. When you live way below your means you can easily take an emergency in stride. You have excess money every week that can cover anything you absolutely couldn&#039;t predict. If there is no emergency that week, it goes into the retirement accounts or we make an extra payment on the mortgage. Next week, rinse and repeat.
4. $10 for a potted flowering plant for the relative hosting Easter dinner.  It&#039;s a pot luck affair and we&#039;re providing two veggies, but we would have made dinner at home otherwise so I&#039;m not counting that as spending.
5. What?  I&#039;m going to say 10, but only 5 I actually like to wear. The rest are only for times when the laundry is behind schedule.
6. In cars I prefer to drive, on a three person sofa I want an arm to lean on. The middle seat sucks.  I hate sitting at the head of the table - I feel the need to make a speech or something. Round tables are the best - no hierarchy in the seating arrangement.]]></description>
