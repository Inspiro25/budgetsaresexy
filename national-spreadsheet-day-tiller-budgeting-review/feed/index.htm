					<description><![CDATA[Hey, no mention of Lotus 1-2-3? Those wonder geeks gave us the &quot;Menu Bar&quot;.  Broke my heart when they lost that lawsuit.
     And to add my voice to this day I use spreadsheets to do my creative writing.  Each sheet is a chapter.  I even use a spreadsheet when I &quot;script&quot; something:  On assign each line of script its own row.  Then with that row I enter the char motivation, synopsis and/or location in one column, the name of the character speaking in the next column and the actual speech in the last column ,   I came up with this when I realized how easy it would be to sort by a particular character to list all their lines together.  Simpler than using a word processor.  And Publisher is just too bloated with stuff I don&#039;t need.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use MS Excel for our personal tracking because we use Excel at the company I work for. I can keep our expense/budget ledger up in the background while I&#039;m doing &quot;real work.&quot; Then I don&#039;t have to mess around with all the numbers when I&#039;m at home. Just gotta remember to email a copy home once in a while. ;)]]></description>

Well that&#039;s good! It was a bit wonky the last time I tried it (4 years ago prob?)

Tiller def. sounds too good to be true and prob why it took me a while to finally just go to the site and check it out, haha... It also helps talking to the founder of companies face to face so you get a better sense of their values and reasons behind the things they build :)

I was super impressed with Peter, so from that point forward Tiller was on my &quot;good&quot; list!]]></description>
