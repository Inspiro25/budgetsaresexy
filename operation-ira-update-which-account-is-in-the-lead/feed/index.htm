					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - You and me both! haha... what do you need to get started?  $50k?  when you hit it let me know and we&#039;ll contrast that one in too w/the game ;)
@&lt;b&gt;20&#039;s Finances&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man, I don&#039;t think it could realy go TOO wrong here since each option is a viable one really, at least in my books.
@&lt;b&gt;Beth&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, sure thing.  We all start out somewhere, my friend!  I remember when I had a Net Worth of like $500 :)  Though back then I never even tracked it, so I could have been way off in my head, haha... (actually, that was one of the reasons I DID start tracking it - so I *knew* 100% what my deal was.  no more guessing!)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Success For Young Adults&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, either of these accounts could easily take over at any time, I have no idea what to expect except for best guesses.  I def. miss my 401k plan w/ all that free matching (!!!), but these will have to do for now.  DEF get on it and at least put in what your company is giving you for free! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - They&#039;re actually not doing well, but it&#039;s all good ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I know.  It keeps me entertained and somewhat happy either way ;)  I know it&#039;ll go back up in the future, just a matter of time, baby.
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - WOWWWWW, that is crazy!  $60k net worth!  I remember that time so vividly too - esp those blog posts that are at the top of the site :)  Seems like forever ago, and yesterday, at the same time.  And oddly I feel just as secure w/ money back then as I do now?  Weird, huh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is unrelated, but out of boredom I looked up Budgets are Sexy in the Wayback machine. Everything is still in your archives but looking up a date and seeing what you posted, and that your net worth was still in the 60K range. It&#039;s crazy how things change in a few short years.

					<description><![CDATA[This is a pretty cool test. Those are all unrealized losses I&#039;m assuming so you could potentially see 1 and 2 come back. I&#039;m still only invested in a Roth IRA and a few personal stock accounts. I&#039;ve gotta get my 401k going assp.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow.... that was both slightly insane and pretty awesome at the same time. a magic combination!
I am busting my hump to get to the point where I can start and contribute to my own personal retirement, and there are waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many options for my brain to keep it all straight. That, and I have absolutely no trust for any financial &quot;products&quot; until I have concluded my own research to my own satisfaction. Money: I don&#039;t have too much right now (working to improve that slowly but surely), so I really don&#039;t enjoy the idea of wasting any.
Thanks for putting yours on the line and letting us know the results!]]></description>
