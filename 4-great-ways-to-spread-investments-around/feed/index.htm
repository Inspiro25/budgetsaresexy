oh man, yeah - that would be no fun haha... I&#039;d cash out too and then just re-invest, smart! (although isn&#039;t that stock better than nothing at all or junk you would have gotten in its place and no longer have?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Depending how the first poster is buying the stock as souvenirs, they&#039;re likely making a big hassle for their kids in the future. I had a smattering of gift stocks (including Disney), and getting them converted from UTMA to a regular holding is nearly impossible (requires excessive documentation and for both my father and I to be present and sign a form in front of a notary, except we live in different states now). 

In the meantime, even though they were filed under my SSN and I was a legal adult, I still had to get my dad to call them to update the mailing address etc.  I eventually just sold them all rather than bother trying to do that. Also that Disney stock netted about $4 a year in dividends, so they wouldn&#039;t go very far in paying for a disney vacation.]]></description>

I&#039;m actually the complete opposite! Haha! I only physically go to our credit union a few times a year. I can mobile deposit a check in 30 seconds, but cash sits in our office for what feels like forever until I finally make myself drive over and deposit it.]]></description>

I gave my younger cousins checks for big milestones and had to laugh when I found out why they wouldn&#039;t deposit it. Back in the day, you had to hand over the check to the bank, and they didn&#039;t want to give it up! Yay for mobile banking these days ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These were very sweet!  Thank you for sharing. We live far from our family, so my kids receive money pretty often as gifts. They will get $20 to spend as they choose, along with other &quot;real&quot; money if someone also wants to contribute to their 529s. That way they can still buy the Legos they desperately need, and we save for the future too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stockpile looks awesome!  My daughter (14) has her savings in my investment account for convenience and we often talk about the amount, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s real to her.  She is learning a little about retirement accounts and compound interest in one of her classes this year and (FINALLY!) has showed some interest.  I&#039;m thinking I may open a stockpile account for her, buy $100 worth of my preferred index fund and let her do what she wants with another $100.  She can get the experience of curiosity while have the performance comparison against the oh-so-stable index fund!  Thanks for the idea!]]></description>

yeah - that&#039;s a good one!!

I haven&#039;t actually done any of this for my own kids since all their $$$ goes into their 529 accounts that I control, but at some point I know I&#039;ll need to do it once my kids get as obsessed with this stuff as we are :) And something tells me index funds won&#039;t nearly be exciting enough to do the trick, haha...]]></description>
