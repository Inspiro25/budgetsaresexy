					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-series-im-a-mystery-shopper/#comment-169267&quot;&gt;Jessie&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello Everyone!

I work in operations for a large mystery shopping company, and we happen to be members of the MSPA. I can assure you these types of assignments are completely legitimate. Ones where asked to pay money out of pocket and wire money back, are examples or the types of assignments that are not legit.  Most companies do NOT pay via check, and none pay up front. There is even a conference in Dallas next month if you dare. Find out more at http://www.mspa-americas.org/

While you don&#039;t have to &#039;pay&#039; to become a member and perform an assignment with us, MSPA does have a paid Plus Membership Level that gives members added benefits. For a list of companies, who are legit, you can go to the MSPA site, and apply on sites like Gigspot, Presto Maps, JobSlinger, iSecretShop and several others. The MSPA is a really great place to start.

Good Luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This seems interesting. Looking for something to bring in extra cash as I&#039;m going to school right now. On the website you linked, MSPA, it is asking for a $20 shopper registration fee. Is this normal? Thanks for your input!]]></description>

No you do not need a business license to be a mystery shopper. You will file your income/expenses on a Schedule C, and just indicate that you are a sole proprietor. You are an independent contractor in the eyes of the law. 

I was a mystery shopper for many years and finally got out of the business when I got tired of the low fees and picky report editors. It&#039;s not for everyone, and you won&#039;t get rich, but it is kinda fun being undercover. The best way to make money is to batch jobs together - get several assignments in the same area to lessen the amount of driving you have to do.]]></description>

I&#039;m not a mystery shopper so I can&#039;t say with absolute certainty, but I don&#039;t believe you need a biz license for this at all. You&#039;re pretty much a contractor and as long as you report the income come tax time you should be fine. Same if you hustled in other ways like mowing peoples grass or babysitting, or even making money online! I&#039;m self-employed as a blogger and never got a biz license :) Though I&#039;ve never really looked into it either, haha... In any case I think you&#039;re fine, but a great question to ask if/when you go down this route with the company you work for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really interested in this opportunity but wanted to know....... besides certification, do you need to obtain a business license? It was mentioned in the article about reporting this income on your taxes. I just wanted to get more information on that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this - I loved it!  Very informative and funny.  

I&#039;ve been put off trying to get any gigs by the low pay but you&#039;ve encouraged me to have another look - no-one starts at the top and it sounds like it&#039;s really taking off for you now.  I really love the idea of being certified too.

I have to admit that it&#039;s not just the income that attracts - I would really love to be a Mystery Shopper when I am getting bad service.  For some reason, some companies seem to take complaints more seriously if they are paying the person that makes them!  Weird, huh?]]></description>
