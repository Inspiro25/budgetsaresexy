You&#039;re making me miss the days of customer service now!!! Haha...

Used to LOVE talking to the crazies out there and not knowing what you&#039;re going to get on any given call :) Had to on many occasions whip out the ol&#039; &quot;Alright, why don&#039;t you get it all out of your system, and then let me know when you&#039;d like me to jump in and help you and we&#039;ll get right to it&quot; line haha... This worked wonders for those who were extremely upset and just needed to yell for a bit until they were *actually* ready to be helped :) On some occasions they even laughed and thanked me for the vent session! #WIN!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you were listening to my call the other day.  
Rule - we can&#039;t interrupt the customer or talk over them.
Rule - we can&#039;t ask the customer to stop interrupting us. We just have to start over. 

Me asking a question:
Are [interrupted by the customer]
Are you [interrupted by the customer]
Are you in [interrupted by the customer]
Are you in front[  interrupted by the customer]
Are you in front of [interrupted by the customer]
Are you in front of the [interrupted by the customer]
Are you in front of the de [interrupted by the customer]
Are you in front of the devi [interrupted by the customer]
Are you in front of the device?

Answer:I bought it in November.

 This stop and go method of communication is pretty silly but sometimes we are unable to fully form words and  just emit weird sounds like when dolphins try to communicate with us.]]></description>

Kid- &quot;I won.&quot;
Dad- &quot;No, that&#039;s not how this works.&quot;
Kid- &quot;Daaaaaad, I won. Don&#039;t you see these points.&quot;
Dad- &quot;Please don&#039;t try to explain the rules of Pokemon to me. I was incredibly uncool in high school, and I know all the rules. I clearly won.&quot;]]></description>

That actually reminds me of my old mailman friend who I surmised would be a millionaire by the end of his (32) years of service:
