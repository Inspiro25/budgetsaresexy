					<description><![CDATA[Congrats to you and the other posters with success for Jan. I have to say that I wish I had a fraction of the inflow that you had this month!!! Regardless -- keep it up. With this kind of cash coming in you should be able to retire in no time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, sure - but it&#039;s nothing too crazy. I just put everything into a money market right now until I figure out what exactly I&#039;m gonna do with it.  I&#039;ll be paying some good taxes here shortly w/ parts, and then dumping a pile into my SEP for the year, but then the rest will be unknown until the wee baby comes along :)  I don&#039;t know what happens after that! Haha... I&#039;ll go and email this to you now - happy weekend, bro.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice job J$. 100k liquidity is a lot of cash. What do you do with those cash? Do you put them in CD or some kind of interest bearing checking account? How do you maximize interest in this low rate environment?
Can you answer me through email so I don&#039;t miss it?]]></description>
