					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - I know!  I mean, some were much more than $600 too, but still - overall GREAT deal when everything&#039;s factored in :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I think some had like zero others, and then other places had like 10 others, haha... guess it depends on how big the place is and how much trouble the owner&#039;s in ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, though at this point renting rooms would give them a decent income stream for a bit while they learn to hurry up and cut back more efficiently :) I think some of them would love to just sell the whole lot, but it&#039;s no longer an option in today&#039;s maket eiher so they&#039;re pretty much stuck... but agreed - they need to tone it down more if they&#039;re looking for a long-term solution.
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, in some of those places you may never have to! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Rafiki&lt;/b&gt; - True true - it would be like a small apartment in a gated community. Only much more impressive to look at/live in ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah :(  They mentioned they have to be low-key with it too due to community rules and stuff like that.  It would be nice if there was a website specifically dedicated to this kinda setup!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, for sure... one of those owners mentions he can only have women staying there since his daughter is a teenager and he doesn&#039;t trust men ;)  Though on the other side, as a women it would be weird knowing there&#039;s one man of the place and a gaggle of ladies! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah!  Workaholics are awesome for those kinds of situations - esp knowing they&#039;ll probably have no trouble paying since they work so much! :)  (unless they&#039;re the kinds that work so much becuase they have bills up the a$$, but those aren&#039;t &quot;workaholics&quot; - more like &quot;forced workers&quot;?)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... and? :)
@&lt;b&gt;MariaN&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  I want to go back to renting soooo bad!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - $500 a month!  That ROCKS!!! Well done my friend, damn.  Well done... (and yes, I will take pics if I find a way to pull it off ;))
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Having a family def. changes the picture.
@&lt;b&gt;Work At Home Market&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah I bet you can totally find a place near the beach!  Would be more expensive of course, but def. do able esp if you are ready to downsize anyways and rid yourself of all that &quot;stuff&quot; that takes up money ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - I bet there&#039;s some CRAZY nice places in Portland too - I still need to get out there and vist y&#039;all!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahahah...  maybe he was that same guy who said he couldn&#039;t have men staying there because of his young dauhter?  Cuz he wouldn&#039;t trust them? :)  But either way though, way to go brotha!!!! Haha... though if you&#039;re accustomed to that sort of lifestyle, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not as exciting to him as to the rest of us if we had a year or two like that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Wow congrats!!! You guys were much smarter than us who bought a place for DOUBLE that and then lost money the very next year ;)  And I don&#039;t even want to own anymore! haha...  but good job working all that out, very impressive.
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it def. all makes sense if the situation ever arose like that.  I&#039;d probably be okay with renting out our basement in any event for the extra money, but def. don&#039;t think the Mrs. would be okay with that ;)  Or our cats who&#039;d probably change their bathroom area just to show us who&#039;s boss.
@&lt;b&gt;Burnette&lt;/b&gt; - AWWWEESOME!!!  I love your friends!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I read an article about that guy a few months ago.  he only rents to women, and they all have a movie night together.  Not a bad deal for all parties involved though.  They get to rent a room in an insane house for a few hundred bucks a month, and he gets to keep his insane house!   I&#039;ve thought about renting one of my spare rooms, but I just don&#039;t know if I can live with another person for an extended amount of time right now....  Plus I&#039;ve got no issues with the bills.  Now if I loose my job, that is a whole new story!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t see myself living long-term that way, but it would be kind of a cool alternative to staying in a hotel for a vacation!  

But I also have a home with a mortgage, so renting is not an option.  Although our house is a 3-bedroom, 1.5 bath, 1400 sq. ft. ranch, so it&#039;s the perfect size.  And the mortgage we took out was only for $140,000.  I just ran a quick search, and our mortgage payment (including taxes and insurance) is about $300-500 LESS per month than the going rate to rent a comparable house in our zip code, and that&#039;s only 2 years after we bought it.  It was a short sale, and waiting on the seller&#039;s bank to approve our offer was kind of agonizing, but totally worth it in the end. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG there was a special on TV about a guy who did this. He had a phat mansion, I think it&#039;s the one in the pic, 60 minutes or something went and interviewed him, and all his &quot;tenants.&quot; I was laughing because all his &quot;tenants&quot; looked like play boy bunnies, yes they were all women. There were all women, hot, frolicking in the pool and sipping margaritas. He convinced the interviewer that he was doing it &quot;for business&quot; because he lost so much after the real estate crash. I was like MY ASS...... you are Hugh Hefner! It was classic.....I&#039;m sure he&#039;d love to have you...and your wife.]]></description>
