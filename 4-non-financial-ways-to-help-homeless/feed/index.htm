					<description><![CDATA[A really good proactive message you are putting across with your articles. This is the first time I&#039;ve seen a focus on &#039;eye contact and conversation&#039; in an article on ways to help homeless people. Nice work and for making a really inspiring piece.

This issue is very close to my heart and I have just opened a business making and selling quality waterproof blessing bags for the homeless. 
If anyone is interested in finding blessing bags packed with the essentials homeless people need please visit

Hey @ArDee - I don&#039;t assume anyone is lying when they are asking for food (or anything else).  I just hear that a lot of people struggle with giving out money.  I&#039;m just offering another option of other needs guests might have other than cash.  Respect, dignity and a conversation.]]></description>

Why assume they are a hustler or that their &#039;other&#039; uses for money is not right for them? These people have a 5 second window to get a bit of help, and a asking for money for food is probably what works best without having to explain their whole life to every person they approach. Don&#039;t assume giving a &#039;goody bag&#039; is helping, it just shows a distrust of that person to determine for themselves what they really need.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing your story, Sam.  I agree, with you on most of your points.  I think your suggestions are great for people who are friends or have established relationships with those who are homeless vs. what I&#039;m suggesting here of starting a conversation and are just starting a relationship with someone who is homeless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of &quot;blessing bags&quot; -- I&#039;ve never heard that term before, but I think it&#039;s great. And beyond that, you&#039;re raising $27,000 for the homeless for your 27th birthday?!?! That&#039;s incredibly impressive. I checked out your website and saw that you&#039;re already 8 percent towards your goal, which is fantastic considering that you&#039;re still several months away from the deadline. I&#039;ll be following #27kby27 on Twitter, especially as we get closer to August. Good luck, Jenna!]]></description>
