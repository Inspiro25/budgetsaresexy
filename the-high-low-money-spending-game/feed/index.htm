					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Steeb&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes!! That&#039;s super annoying, jeez... What happens if you just don&#039;t have any change or no one&#039;s behind you to ask? It&#039;s not like you can just run through it if the gate is down yeah? Scary stuff... Happened to me once where I just ran though it cuz I wasn&#039;t paying attention (late at night) but only the alarms sounded as there was no gate or anything... and come to think of it I don&#039;t believe I ever got a ticket either? Huh...
@&lt;b&gt;Erin S&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... it&#039;s a good thing they&#039;re so tasty! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dumbest expense of the last week was $2 for a quarter.   Stuck in line up to pay the toll to cross the bridge between Canada &#038; US.  The auto lane wouldn&#039;t accept my $2 coin (Canadian Toonie) as the new 2012 coins are slightly lighter and cause problems.   With all the change in the car I was still 25 cents short and the machine still wouldn&#039;t take the $2.  Ran to the car behind me in line (over 1.5 miles long) and offered him the $2 coin for a quarter - got it and ran back to my car, threw it in the auto-teller, the gate went up and I could continue on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad y&#039;all enjoyed this :) It&#039;s always fun to see where everyone&#039;s money is going and see how similar/different we are! Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend...

@&lt;b&gt;Gina&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! That is awesome. I looooooove me some Micky Dee&#039;s Monopoly! And had you won something big it would have been moved into your BEST purchase of the week ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s pretty good if you only shelled out money 3 times last week - way to go!
@&lt;b&gt;m1nts&lt;/b&gt; - I like it! $3,000 is still $3,000 so def. sucky. Glad to hear y&#039;all are prioritizing it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Emily @ evolvingPF&lt;/b&gt; - Nice job Husband! A great surprise indeed :) And awesome y&#039;all tithe too - we&#039;re not so good at that :( Though I am much better at giving back than I was a few years ago which is something.
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Go son!!! I hope they won the game - that&#039;s awesome! (Though coming from someone w/ a mohawk I&#039;m a bit biased ofcourse ;)) And also agree that quality family time like that is ALWAYS worth it.
@&lt;b&gt;Renee S&lt;/b&gt; - Well nice job snagging that great date! Let&#039;s hope there&#039;s a 2nd and 3rd one too, eh? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes! I&#039;m glad it wasn&#039;t a big surprise though so you weren&#039;t shocked or in denial or something :( Still sucky though. Bone up on that knowledge and work your way out of it my dear! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats!!! One less c/c in the world is a nice feeling ;) You can do a happy dance in your Hufflepuff tie, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jennlandia&lt;/b&gt; - I love Tuesday Morning!! And probably good there isn&#039;t one around me, haha... TJ Maxx is enough of an addiction ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - You should be most proud of that Refi expense! Congrats :) Ours was like $5,000 when we did it last year, but our damn mortgage is pretty freakin&#039; high too... the only (and biggest) issue in our finances, ugh.
@&lt;b&gt;Dave H&lt;/b&gt; - Dang, you guys rocked it this week! Congrats on the new home! That&#039;s always exciting :)
@&lt;b&gt;Beckey &amp; Jeff&lt;/b&gt; - We treated ourselves to non-home-made coffee too this week ;) Back when I worked at a &quot;real&quot; job I&#039;d do it every morning though, so I&#039;m pretty proud of ourselves now. Though, to be fair, I also rarely leave the house Mon-Fri, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Oh no! Was the food still salvagable, or did you end up losing all that too? That blows, I&#039;m sorry :( Yay for the movie and c/c pay off though - that FAR beats out the McDonald&#039;s run ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah H.&lt;/b&gt; - WOW that&#039;s a lot of money. Pretty cool you get to attend galas though! Are you allowed to share what you do? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m impressed by all you library people - I just can&#039;t bring myself to do it :) If there&#039;s a book or mag I want, I always buy it so I can keep it in my personal library. Other stuff I don&#039;t do that with (like with movies), but for some reason it feels good hoarding books ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Liz J&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s great!! CONGRATS!! You share company with a few others here today paying off their credit cards :) Be very proud of yourselves!!
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah consignment shops!
@&lt;b&gt;TeacHer&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, throw it into your next round :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Awwwww, I&#039;m sorry to hear that friend. I hope this weekend brought you many blessings!
@&lt;b&gt;LB @ Finanical Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, very cool! I didn&#039;t even know they had stuff like that? Or enough suits for all those people to run around in? Haha... You better take pictures :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mysti&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re just like my wife w/ those pets and their bills :) She never regets spending a penny on her furry babies!
@&lt;b&gt;Erin S&lt;/b&gt; - $1.05 for a donut? That better be one BIG and juicy one! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah CHRISTMAS!!! Best time of the year!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - Nice work w/ the car payments - you&#039;ll be saving SO MUCH by the end! :)
@&lt;b&gt;jenn&lt;/b&gt; - What kind of hairstyle are you rocking these days? Pic please! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Liquid&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s not bad at all then if your only purchases for food for $10 and under - good job :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.The most expensive thing we paid for this week: $500.00 car payment. Over double the minimum, what what!

2.The least expensive thing: $2.18 at the gas station for coffee for me and the hubs.

3.The most *exciting* thing: $9.35 for fudge at Cedar Point. P.S. Pumpkin fudge in the greatest thing ever. Or $19.09 for a Loaded Baked Potato pizza at a local pizza joint. Also the greatest thing ever.

4.The dumbest thing: $15 for a gym maintenance fee. Lame.

 5.The purchase you’re most proud of: Same as #1. Knocking that car payment out...almost there!]]></description>

The most exciting thing: $164.00 for a new Christmas tree. Yes, we are preparing for the holiday break so we are purchasing new decorations as early as now!
