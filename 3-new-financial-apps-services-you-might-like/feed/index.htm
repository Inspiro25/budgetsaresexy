					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been part of Brightpeak Financial&#039;s survey group for a while, and they are definitely one of the more generous survey companies out there.  I don&#039;t think I realized they were connected with Thrivent, but my experiences with Thrivent have been great.  I haven&#039;t banked with them (but I think I will now.)  

Our church kids hold a fundraising pancake breakfast every month, and Thrivent donates all the ingredients for the breakfast.  The kids send their earnings from the breakfast to Feed My Starving Children, an organization that provides a special type of meal to children at the end stages of starvation that allows them to heal and grow again.  

So I think that&#039;s pretty cool, that Thrivent is donating not just to outside causes, but that they have specifically chosen to work with our youngest citizens!]]></description>

Heyyy very cool!! You should do a post on how you can re-create the system yourself if you wanted to :) And then list the pros and cons as I&#039;m sure there&#039;s stuff both methods do well and those that one or the other do better... Would be neat to see :)]]></description>
