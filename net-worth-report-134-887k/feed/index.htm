					<description><![CDATA[Hi J,

Greetings from the UK!

A new reader to your blog and your progress updates have influenced me to make the first steps in working out my current net worth. First goal is now also set, to have a household net worth of £60,000 in 14 months time, linked in with turning 30.

Slightly different rules here, and houses are crazy expensive, but the principle is still the same.

What a day it will be when you hit the million.

Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-report-134-887k/#comment-276759&quot;&gt;Revanche @ A Gai Shan Life&lt;/a&gt;.

We have hit a new mile marker ourselves as well! We actually hit it about six months ago, but then it went away thanks to the markets, and it appears to be back. Although the markets could take it away again. Anyway. I wanted to say that I have never updated the value on our houses (yes, we own two) in my personal spreadsheet but I do watch what Personal Capital does via Zillow. Because, like you, I feel it is only paper value until we sell, but I do want to balance the mortgages against them.

PC has us worth about $250K more than I do. And I&#039;m okay with that...]]></description>

If the market cooperates.

Trying not to get too emotionally invested in it being THIS year.  But it is inevitable at some point if I keep doing what I&#039;m doing.  :)]]></description>
