					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve got plenty of funds outside of the IRAs that are hardcore conservative ;)  Like cash, haha... but honestly, all these &quot;aggressive&quot; funds still have X% in bonds/cash/etc too.  Just a bulk of it going to stocks and other mutual funds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I know you&#039;re young and you stressed &quot;agressive&quot; several times, but hopefully you&#039;re putting some of that money into some more conservative investments like treasuries, etc. 

Being agressive with $20-30,000 is one thing, but $180,000--that&#039;ll be worse than a major headache if we see a repeat of &#039;00-02 or &#039;07-09.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey... I just wanted to let ya know that I have an Ira, mutual funds, all my investments with USAA and they are managed by the company.. I&#039;ve made tons of money so the fees don&#039;t even matter to me. I&#039;ve had them for three years now and I can go online and see when they buy and sell not to mention I love my financial adviser who I can call if I have questions or need to make changes. I have them aggresively invested since I too am young but want to make the most money possible. Hope this eases your mind a lil... ;)]]></description>
