Yep - Karens galore!  I didn&#039;t even want to join the PTA Board but my wife made me when they were looking for a treasurer (I&#039;m a CPA and great with numbers).  The next year the President moved on to middle school and suddenly I became President. I still don&#039;t know how that happened.  Haha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so true! I love the idea of volunteering – have done a few days here and there, and I had great fun. Honestly, the reason I don&#039;t do it as much as I should? 

1 – leading a busy life, I find I need 9 days a week and 28 hours a day sometimes to fit in my usual routine, never mind adding more to it! 

2 – It really can be inconvenient, which – honestly – doesn’t encourage you to rush back. 

3 – Some of the ‘long term’ volunteers can be decidedly… Set in their ways – which can make you feel awkward at best, and downright frustrated at worst! 

But when you have a good day, or see the gratitude in someone&#039;s eyes - it is so worth it!]]></description>

So cool to hear! Working with the youth is something I&#039;d like to try. If my wife and I end up adopting, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be exposed to a bunch more youth programs where I can help out :)

Thanks for what you do! Have a great week!

Nice to hear, Steve. I&#039;m sure you have a ton of experience to offer boards and great private sector management skills from your past workplace to bring over to the non-profit side. Must be frustrating at times, but glad you see the greater good.

I volunteered on 2 boards in Los Angeles for emergency planning and business preparedness. This was back in my disaster management days. It was definitely thankless, but I made life-long connections and friends. I hope to do it again one day. I was the outreach/membership director, which was in line with my sales skills and background :)]]></description>

Hahaha! I&#039;m imagining a room full of Karens. Must have been very tough. But thank you for doing that and putting in the time. Glad you saw a lot of the good side!]]></description>

Amazing Chris, thanks for sharing. And thank you for your work! It&#039;s great when parents &quot;force&quot; their kids to volunteer - it teaches so much! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I volunteer, but at the governance level.  Because I had experience at running a large company I have served on the board of two large nonprofits for years. I&#039;m board chair currently and while it feels more like my old job than it does delivering meals (which I&#039;ve also done) it is work that requires specialized skills.  We are handling tens of millions of donated money and trying to make sure it is wisely spent in the community.  We hire and fire the head of the organizations and are responsible to make sure everything done  in the organization is fair, legal and mission focused.  There are a lot of ways to serve, generally boards are looking for legal, tax, accounting, HR and senior management experience since they cannot afford to hire experts in all of those areas and they know we will work for free because we believe in what they are doing.  There is a lot of inefficiency and lack of motivation in the nonprofit world, but there are also true heroes that see the work as more than a paycheck but as a calling.  They more than make up for the meh parts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joel, I feel you with the good and bad of volunteering.  I was PTA president for two years and although it was mostly a thankless job, there were some pretty cool moments - like the time when we raised $25k for a new digital sign out front of the school.  It kind of made up for all the hassles involved dealing with Karens and other crazy parents ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Forced&quot; volunteering (LOL) by my Dad as a teenager led my sister and I to our careers.  We were candystripers at a hospital.  We got to do all sorts of things, more than at other hospitals I think.  Anyway, I liked the office work as a candystriper and my sister liked the medical side.  She&#039;s been a registered nurse for about 20 years.  I did medical transcription and medical office work for about 20 years.]]></description>
