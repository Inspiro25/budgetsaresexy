If they asked these questions on The Bachelor, viewers might think it&#039;s normal to spend $800 on dresses and suits and whatever weird stuff people show off on TV these days :). But yeah, I think we should definitely normalize these types of conversations between partners!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are the kinds on interviews we need to see more often Joel! If only these were the kinds of questions asked on shows like The Bachelor, viewers would start to think it&#039;s ok and normal to have financial conversations with their future partner...at least it would provide good entertainment!

Excellent choice of questions. I&#039;m glad I included a chapter on conversations for couples to have in my book as it doesn&#039;t happen nearly enough. 

Also, kudos for having an open and honest relationship about money with one another.]]></description>

I think many people are scared of the stock market, and have a hard time believing in things they can&#039;t feel and touch. probably more common than we think!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a fun idea, I will have to give it a try with my partner! The honesty your wife shared about the stock market is commendable. In private this is easy to say, but knowing it would go on this blog is another thing entirely. Thanks for sharing this with us!]]></description>

Absolutely! I love taking surveys and answering questions - even if it&#039;s not a couples exercise. Just being self aware and realizing your own beliefs is so helpful. Thanks Christine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great exercise! I am definitely going to save it. I did pre-marital counseling with my now husband (which I highly recommend to anyone thinking of getting married) and it covered some similar questions. If nothing else, it helps the person answering them realize where their money anxieties, habits, and beliefs come from. I realize that I have anxiety about my husband spending a lot on groceries because seeing a large grocery bill takes me back to when my mom would try to get the best deals and have a food budget that it was bad to go over . It seems like “too much” even though I’ll spend money on other stuff like food delivery which makes less financial sense. I think even when a couple agrees about financial goals, little stuff comes up that surprises you.]]></description>

I actually had a dream the other day that I won the lottery and didn&#039;t tell anyone, not even my wife. Then for the next few weeks I went around doing massively nice deeds for people. Weird dream!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now we know more about her! I was surprised that you would be hurt if Joel didn&#039;t tell you that he lost money. 

I personally do not like to talk about winning / losing money as I found that talking about it either makes me feel worse that I lost money or makes my ego inflate to a stage where I can&#039;t control it if I made particularly absurd money that day. 

However, that&#039;s not blaming or faulting you, just saying it in matter of fact terms. To each their own!]]></description>
