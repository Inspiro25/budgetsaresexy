					<description><![CDATA[The stock market this summer has been a killer. I&#039;m so glad it&#039;s been rebounding (so far). I&#039;m salaried, but I travel a lot for my job, and I like to think of my expense reimbursements as income.. I get 55 cents per mile now and there&#039;s absolutely no way I spend that much! I tend to travel a lot more at the beginning/end of the year, so my &quot;income&quot; tends to go down in the summer as well. =[ It stinks after getting used to awesome reimbursement checks coming in and then you realize what you&#039;re REALLY making.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Stephen&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah dude, smart move :)  We have a Corolla Sport.  It&#039;s my wife&#039;s and she LOVES it.  Which is strange to me cuz she doesn&#039;t really care for cars, haha... so I guess it&#039;s a great one ;)
&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes!  Having a head start is always MUCH better than getting surprised outta nowhere though ;)  Sending happy vibes!!!  (and btw - no go w/ that guy from Colorado :( I&#039;ll give ya a shout later...)
&lt;b&gt;Financial Samurai&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yes please - I&#039;m interested :)  And I hope I&#039;m making enough or else I can&#039;t live this life anymore! But so far so sexy.
&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, we all gotta start somewhere ;)  You&#039;re probably like 10 years younger than me - which I&#039;d gladly trade for! Haha...
&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Yessir, that&#039;s the plan.
&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - I think about selling it every single day ;)  Problem is we can&#039;t, so we may try harder at renting it out in meantime, but all my projects keep taking up my time.  Which is def. good ;)
&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Thought about that route - def. has it&#039;s pros :)  It&#039;s just such a huge amount that I like watching it move in the Net Worth since I do have to deal with it (and seeing it low like that reminds me how important it is and that it&#039;s &quot;real&quot; haha...) - but we may change it up in a bit.  Congrats on your increase! I remember when $100 up or down was a BIG thing so in perspective that&#039;s awesome :)  Good job.
&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I want to come drink beer with you! ESP in the Fall - my favorite season! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My income doesn&#039;t fluctuate in the summer because I&#039;m on salary, but I find my spending does, for sure! I always end up spending more than usual in July and August, and it&#039;s almost kind of intentional. In the winter, I&#039;m usually content to just stay in most nights out of the week and cuddle up with a movie or a book, because it&#039;s miserable outside, but when the weather is this nice out, and you just know it&#039;ll be fall before you know it — every day not spent drinking beer on a patio just seems like a wasted day! It definitely takes a bit more creativity when it comes to budgeting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our&#039;s went up $1,192.40 this month (updated it on the 1st), mostly to paying down the evil credit card. We also don&#039;t make much $, so it&#039;s like a huge deal w/ our tiny Net Worth. 

About your taxes, not sure if you&#039;ve already thought of this or not---but have you thought about leaving it out of your Net Worth and just including it in your budget? &#039;Cuz it makes your Net Worth go up and down even though it doesn&#039;t exactly represent it. Just an idea. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hola J - Paying $5,000 in quarterly taxes is good because it means you made a lot right?  Good bright side!

I&#039;ll let you know about the summer blog income months.  This week should be slow due to holiday week.  I haven&#039;t really payed attention over the 2 years, but i&#039;ll pretend i am full-time and track it better and let you know.
