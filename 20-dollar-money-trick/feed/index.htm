It works a lot with entrepreneurship too and just getting your idea out there into the real world :) We obsess soooo much about making things perfect, when half the time even doing it just 60 or 70% well would do the trick! and then tweaking from there!]]></description>

Love Kiva! Been a while since I&#039;ve had my money invested there, I should jump in again and keep re-lending my $20 :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Consistency &#038; smallness, that&#039;s how you can reach your goals.

I did this when I was super intent on getting rid of my student loan debt. I put a bunch towards the student loans and $25/month towards my other savings like retirement. Now that I&#039;m debt-free, I&#039;m putting more in there now!]]></description>

&quot;it would make me too nervous going around w/out the ID just in case of random emergency situations&quot;

Yeah, this entered my mind as well, but I kind of brushed it off. But, you are right that if I get hit by a bus or something, I would like to be identified. :) So, I remembered that the last time I traveled internationally, I took a paper copy of my DL and passport in case I lost the real documents overseas. I still have that piece of paper, so I put it in my money holder so that I do have some way to be identified, but, if I lose it, there is nothing that is a hassle to replace. :)

And yes, I will let you know when I&#039;m ready to hold another workshop. Like you, I&#039;m trying to practice some essentialism at the moment and I have some very narrow focuses at this time. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting! What I was thinking of is that even though I&#039;m not much of a saver, I do invest about 20$ in promoting different posts or new pages to see which will catch on, probably weekely. 

And I know what you mean about feeling fantastic doing it, I&#039;ve been lending on kiva, 25$ here and there can help someone make a living, and they even repay you so you can lend the same amount multiple times.]]></description>

&quot;I’m only going to walk around with $20 (or less) on me and no credit cards or ID&quot;

oh wowwww that&#039;s a huge one! it would make me too nervous going around w/out the ID just in case of random emergency situations, but i hear you on the no credit cards and limited cash route. I know for a fact that would help me spend less too! the other day i forgot my cell phone for a good 6 hours and that also felt nice and freeing :)

RCF -- awwwww, well i&#039;m so glad you got a lot out of it as we did too :) we&#039;ve been a bit more laid back on it lately just cuz of time and family commitments, but the RCF is still humming along and doing good so continue keeping us in mind for any other ideas or people you know who could use our help! we&#039;re ready to do good at a moment&#039;s notice!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago, my wallet was stolen. I had two credit cards, my license and probably $60-$80. It was at the library... which I was surprised, but it is what it is. I left the library and started walking home and about 10 minutes into my walk, I had a strange feeling, so I took my backpack off to check for my wallet and it wasn&#039;t there. I first had that sinking feeling. But, since I still had to walk 10 minutes before looking for it, I had time to think. It really wasn&#039;t that big a deal in the big picture of life. My license was expiring in a month anyway and I only had to cancel two cards. The loss of cash sucks, but isn&#039;t really that big a deal. So, what I decided to do was use this experience as a challenge and satisfy my minimalist cravings. :) 

I have since gotten my new cards, but they stay at home. When I renew my DL, that too will stay at home. Like you said, $20 makes a difference. So, my challenge is that I&#039;m only going to walk around with $20 (or less) on me and no credit cards or ID. I&#039;ve already noticed that my frivolous purchases have gone waaaaay down and I now focus on the necessities. It really makes you think. Plus, I used to put everything on a credit card for the points, so I generally know my previous monthly spending habits by looking at past statements. I&#039;m going to start tracking my reduction in spending and put that amount into a separate account every month that I will use in the future for giving away/donating, and I will use your recommendation of the $20 increments. It is a win-win, because it is a fun mental challenge, and then I can have fun giving away money. :)

Also, I need to do a shout out to RCF... not only was it awesome that I could help my friend in need with the $150 debt drop, but it was so much more fun to give to a community where it feels personal. I still donate to large organizations where I believe in their mission, but it is not nearly as much fun to get a cookie cutter thank you letter as it is donating to the RCF and getting a personal email from J$ himself! :)]]></description>
