It&#039;s smart having set hours, esp if you&#039;re self-employed. I used to work all over the place with no hard rules and after a few years it started getting to me. Scaling back now def. makes me more productive, but on the flip side I now don&#039;t work as long either haha... so there&#039;s always something to do :)]]></description>

Yeah...have to admit, when I first deleted certain apps I was freakin&#039; out, just a little...but now I am more efficient with work time on the computer.  I have certain times I&#039;m on and certain times I am off, almost like regular work hours.  No more working in the middle of the night...it can wait til the am...I need my sleep.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I love the doodling in coloring page as a motivator to knock out debt! I use ReadyforZero.com and my personal motivation is to see the dot move down on the chart. It&#039;s not nearly as creative though. 

Also, the retirement calculator from Personal Capital seems interesting, thanks for posting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Go get your philanthropy on! I thought the Love Drop concept was cool - I&#039;m excited to see what you come up with next. I have one year left on my stupid ass Verizon contract, so I am looking forward to that being over and I can really pursue something like RW. Lastly - that site you linked for coloring your progress is sweet! Although, I&#039;m not sure I am on board with spending $20 for an image to color in. The concept is cool, though, especially if you&#039;re a visual person.]]></description>

I like that idea - snap the pic and then right back into the pocket :) I&#039;ve been sharing a LOT less online since keeping the phone away which it super hard as a blogger  (as you know!) but it&#039;s been quite refreshing. I used to get anxious if I hadn&#039;t posted something on Twitter every few hours and now sometimes I&#039;ll go the entire day without even realizing. Feels good!]]></description>

And LOVE that you got rid of those apps on the phone, haha... that&#039;s hard to do! Esp as a realtor. Good for you.. I bet your son just loves your direct attention :)]]></description>
