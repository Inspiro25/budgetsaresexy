I like that! Haven&#039;t ever heard of it that way either, haha... good job on that one :) If only you could find ways to work 8 hours days at that rate, eh? Let me know once you&#039;ve mastered that and I&#039;ll share my profits with you when I turn around and do it ;)]]></description>

I remember a lot of that during the Romney race too - people were hating on him big for the simple fact he was wealthy (well, for other reasons too, but usually that was up there at the top which never made real sense to me).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For getting a part time job ... here is a concept I teach and proved it pays a LOT more than any part time job on the planet ...

Make saving money your part time job because it pays more than five times the money. 

If you make saving money your part time job, you will never need to get a part time job to save money.

When you learn all of the most incredible money saving tips on the planet and make your part time job practicing those tips, you can earn as much as $500 per hour depending on where you might have outgoing money at the time.

For instance, my wife and I just rented a 3,800 sq. ft house in a gated community on the coast of CA for only $300 for FIVE DAYS where a cheap hotel room is more than $200 per day.

Since it only took me one hour to find that fully furnished house for our vacation because I know this unique money saving tip that anyone can learn, I saved (earned) $700 per hour. A penny saved is a penny earned after all.

Most people would have found the hotel room and spent $1,000 and lost all of that extra money.

We had the outgoing money anyway, because we had the trip planned, so I made saving money a part time gig and one hour paid us handsomely for a better place to stay in a safe area. Anyone can do this over and over in all of the areas where they have outgoing money.

When you learn cool tips on how to save a ton of money where you have outgoing money, and then go to work every time you need to dip into your wallet, you can average more than $100 per hour in savings over the long haul.

Tell me if you know of any part time job that pays more than $100 per hour where you don&#039;t have any boss breathing down your neck every second. You&#039;ll be lucky to find a $12 per hour part time gig.

When I started making saving money my part time job, our savings started piling up at an unbelievable rate. I always kept track of the amount of time and the savings and since a penny saved is a penny earned, I made a lot of money where I had those unavoidable hits and expenses that normally would break most people and leave them struggling.

If everyone knew the tips and concepts I know, no one would ever struggle financially.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The amount of money you have has nothing to do with whether or not you’re a good person.
Believe me I&#039;ve met folks who talk about nothing else but money and how they spend it on luxury items. They&#039;d look at someone financially less fortunate as if they don&#039;t even exist.]]></description>
