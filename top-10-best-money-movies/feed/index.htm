					<description><![CDATA[Since my one true movie love is comedy, I have to say Brewster&#039;s Millions is my favorite, with Money Pit, and Trading Places closely behind. Richard Pryor, Tom Hanks, and Eddie Murphy: it doesn&#039;t get much funnier than that, especially when they were in their prime.

Office Space is epic but I don&#039;t really consider that a movie about money, as much as it is about not working a job you hate. 

I would LOVE to win this awesome movie pack!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yo J!

Always inflating your ego man, you are a living legend!  What do you think about scoring us some primo DC-premier tickets to Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps?  Leverage all those professional contacts you have in the media business.

Or you know if we pay to go see the movie, then write about it, we could write it off as a tax deduction.  Maybe a double-date with the Mrs. Budgets Are Sexy and Mrs. Engineer Your Finances??? HA

PS - have a great trip]]></description>
