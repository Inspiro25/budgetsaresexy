Yeah, sadly some financial advisors aren&#039;t very good at taking their own advice. I met some who were terrible with money. That&#039;s not the guy I want managing mine!]]></description>

And you know what&#039;s even worse? When PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH don&#039;t even take advantage of retirement perks and/or their own advice they&#039;re giving to all their clients - always so hard to believe. (For example, I know a guy working at a center that teaches companies/employees how easy it is to max out 401k benefits yet he doesn&#039;t do it himself. WTF?)]]></description>

Agreed! I even had one guy who said to me, &quot;You&#039;re going to hate me. But instead of putting all my extra money into retirement, I&#039;m going to pay my house off faster.&quot; It would take him until he&#039;s 51 to do that. Then all he&#039;ll have is $50,000 in a 401(k) and nothing else. Some people are ignorant, but some people actually do consider the consequences and still make the wrong decision...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, Ben! It&#039;s really sad that so many don&#039;t even start thinking about saving until they reach their 40s and 50s when they have extra responsibilities and expenditures. Starting early is the best way to make sure that one&#039;s retired life is stress-free.]]></description>
