Yes we sold everything we owned &#038; retired early to another country. It&#039;s quite liberating not owning all that &quot;stuff&quot; anymore. Renting a small but comfortable space is great after renovating 4 homes in 16 years in the USA
. No more home maintenance for us! Now we can move anytime by just packing up our 3 suitcases of clothes &#038; 2 small dogs.]]></description>

Debbie you seem like the ideal tenant. A true win/win and I&#039;m happy you seem to have a great landlord too!]]></description>

Hi Angie, me too. I&#039;d way rather have a steady tenant at a slightly lower rate than charge maximum and have constant turnarounds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think with COVID, our monthly rent is $4k/mo in a pretty great neighborhood in Manhattan. But due to the market situation and the landlord&#039;s desperation, we were able to get 2 month&#039;s free after their concessions.

I think one of the main things to keep in mind is that landlords are human beings too. They don&#039;t want vacancy, nor do they want to throw a bunch of capex in to turn a unit. As a former landlord myself, I&#039;d much rather if the tenants had stayed and I&#039;d be glad to give up a few hundred bucks / month in rent for it, because it works out better both financially and mentally if a tenant stays for the long-term as opposed to flipping tenants every year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our landlord advertised our duplex for $850 a month. We negotiated $800 per month with a one year signed lease. We pay the rent early every month in cash or depositing into the landlord&#039;s bank account. We hang our laundry outside to dry which saves energy costs which the landlord pays (our rent includes all utilities) &#038; we keep lights on only when needed. When the toilet broke down, we fixed it ourselves &#038; took the $17 part we bought off our next months&#039; rent. Our lease expired 11/1 &#038; our landlord didn&#039;t raise the rent. In fact we didn&#039;t even sign a new lease. We&#039;re now on a month to month lease. Comparable rents are now $900 here but we remain at $800. We would like to think the landlord values us as tenants &#038; for this reason decided not to raise the rent or have us sign another lease.]]></description>
