					<description><![CDATA[You know, back in the day I did count loans as an asset but this time I thought I&#039;d just keep it out of the equation since it&#039;s 100% &quot;live&quot; if you will.  When I get paid back I&#039;ll just lump it back into the cash I have :)

As for &quot;cash&quot; - part of it is literally in a savings account, but the rest is in a money market for now.  I&#039;m cool with that as I have enough invested away and I like the comfort have having so much liquid.  Will probably reconsider once I get a better handle on self-employment stuff though.  Good points you bring up, thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, it&#039;s perfectly acceptable to consider any loans you&#039;ve made as an asset.  I wouldn&#039;t lump it in with any of your current list items, but adding another one wouldn&#039;t hurt.  It will also help you track repayment.

Also, is your cash savings really just in cash?  Maybe you should consider putting that money into an investment account of some sort.  You&#039;re losing a lot of money to inflation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J - one thing to be aware of when dealing with KBB (I know this since I used to work with pricing in the auto industry), is that they have inflated auto values.  This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing if you&#039;re trying to sell your car, since you can pull out the KBB price for the car and tell the seller &quot;Look, I&#039;m selling you a car below KBB cost!&quot;.  It&#039;s a trick the dealers use all of the time.  So, this was a bit of a tangent, but something that your post reminded me of :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[March was my biggest jump since I started tracking the progress. Getting my income tax back was REALLY nice.

I love hitting those milestone numbers. No 100g&#039;s yet but I&#039;ll get there eventually!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - No details huh?  Gonna make us guess how much it&#039;s at? :)  haha... yeah car stuff is kinda confusing, but I guess it really doesn&#039;t matter until the day you go to sell it.  Which I hope is never for me!  (unless it&#039;s cuz it dies. then that would just suck)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - WOW that would be hot! congrats!  And sending good thoughts over to your wife too on her job situation.  It definitely makes life interesting, that&#039;s for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;Diva&lt;/b&gt; - Wooo!!!!  Good job :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that I do... and wish I didn&#039;t since it would mean I&#039;d be renting again ;)  Now hurry up and do your net worth!
@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Wade, and happy to hear you&#039;re starting to stick to it yourself, I think that&#039;s important.  Even if it changes a little big each month, at least you can tell how it&#039;s trending in general.  If it&#039;s going down every month we know there&#039;s a problem ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jon &#124; Free Money Wisdom&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooooh that would make sense if that Japan stuff is true, although kinda sounds like an urban legend ;) haha...  either way, an interesting theory, thanks for sharing my man.
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Well I guess Jon above was right then, haha... damn you guys are smart.  Congrats on the huge uptick!  I hear ya on that solid number for your house value too - always the hardest to value accurately.  Keep it up! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah Smith&lt;/b&gt; - YEAH!  Me too!  Never heard of at ALL until last month - crazy.  And oh so hot as you&#039;re finding out too I&#039;m sure ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - That would do it!
@&lt;b&gt;Steph&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s what she said, that&#039;s what she said... ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad to see you&#039;re diving right into the self-employed investment lifestyle with your new SEP IRA!  We recently opened one for Julian, since he&#039;s self-employed.

					<description><![CDATA[Your car probably went up this month cause it&#039;s a Toyota.  With the recent disasters in Japan, car companies can&#039;t produce enough parts to keep up with their usual stream of production.  As a result, car dealerships are actually running low on Japanese cars.  Both of my cars are Japanese and I saw nearly a $1000 increase in value this month.

As for my net worth, I&#039;m up five grand this month.  Very exciting stuff.  Our house has been dropping like a stone on zillow since August and this was the first month that it stayed still.  So even though I took thousands out of savings to fund a three week European vacation (we&#039;ve been saving for years for this), my net worth still went up!  

My husband and I are in the process of diligently paying down our mortgage to get it out from underwater.  I really can&#039;t wait for the time when we can refinance... both so there&#039;s a lower interest payment AND so I can get a professional opinion on the value of our home and stop letting zillow give me a heart attack every month.]]></description>
