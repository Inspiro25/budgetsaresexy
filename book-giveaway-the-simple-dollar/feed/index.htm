					<description><![CDATA[My mom had told me to always look at your statements. Consistently go online and check out your bank and how your funds/accounts are doing. That way you will always know how well or how badly you are doing. You have to be honest with yourself. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Take care of yourself. When we don&#039;t make time to take care of ourselves it costs us. Simple things like staying active, eating right and taking care of our teeth can save a boat load of cash by helping avoid future cost like bp medication, medical bills and root canals! I truly believe health and wealth go hand in hand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So here&#039;s my tip, which I&#039;ve finally gotten my wife on board with: not all debt is bad. For instance, if you can make a return of 8% on an investment, but you&#039;re paying 3% on a debt, then you&#039;re still better off by a whole 5%.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The best advice I ever got was to prioritize what you need.  Before I make any purchases, I think about whether I want it or need it.  Always prioritize the needs and write down the wants.  If you give yourself time to look back at your &quot;wants,&quot; you will be able to make less impulsive decisions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think most of it has been said here, but then again, it may bear repeating (until I can actually do it!):
1. Live beneath your means. Always. Every day.
2. Pay off the credit card every month.
3. Reduce your exposure to advertising. Less TV, fewer magazines, etc. Although I think I&#039;m immune to those silly ads, it turns out that if I see fewer ads I want less stuff. Go figure.]]></description>
