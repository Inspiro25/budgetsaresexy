					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for tips Joel! I have fallen prey to impulse spending for far to long. It is really good to read some practical ways to put the habit behind me. I downloaded that chrome extension and it is already getting the job done! 

I have also been using an app that helps me put money away using automatic withdrawals and round-ups. I thought someone with your expertise would appreciate. Here is the link peakmoney.com.]]></description>

Yep I agree. I think that&#039;s also why people increase their spending when their income increases.  Make more = spend more. It&#039;s a really tough habit to break and mindset to shift!  Cheers, Mark!]]></description>

This is what I love most about the FIRE movement... &quot;Looking rich&quot; is short lived, as it&#039;s only a single moment in time. &quot;Being rich&quot; is a lifestyle that you get to benefit from every day. It&#039;s better to fill your life with things that YOU care about, vs. what other people care about. :)    Thanks MMW - looking forward to reading more from you too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post and tips Joel! 

I actually didn&#039;t know for a fact that the younger you are the more likely you are to make impulse purchases - but it completely makes sense. 

As it relates to status awareness - I completely hear you. The more you want to &quot;look rich&quot; rather than be rich - the status and brand of something can easily lead someone to impulsive purchases. 

I look forward to reading more from you!]]></description>
