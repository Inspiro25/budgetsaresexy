					<description><![CDATA[This really is interestingly simple. For sure, anyone can have a try at this approach but then again, it depends on how well you know yourself as well as what your current situation is. If you&#039;re single without that much financial obligations, and have the tendency to overspend, I believe this method of sticking notes is a simple first attempt to practice budgeting. Thanks for including your other methods too, J. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am with K.K. as I love Excel spreadsheets all the way... to the bank! HA!  I have way too much fun with my spreadsheet and figuring out where my savings will go, that I had to limit the amount of times I update it.  I used to EVERY day, but now I am only allotted 2-4 times a month, depending on if there is a huge emergency (like hospital) or not.  I got mine directly from Microsoft and then tweaked it every day for about 2 years lol.  It makes life so much easier now that I have it just right. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@JMoney, Thanks for the shout out, I&#039;m glad you liked my original comment.  

I have to agree with all the comments that doing something is always better than doing nothing.  I also have to say that I am a HUGE fan of spreadsheets- I have one for every workout I do tracking distance, time, pace, additional exercises, calories, etc as well as one for every horse I ride and what we worked on during our ride.  I love having goals and keeping track of things, but for money, its easier for me to take a super simple approach, like I described.

:D

Cheers,
Cat]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Rohit @The Money Mail&lt;/b&gt; - You know it! All you gotta do is get *started*!
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - The &quot;most populuar budgets&quot; DO suck ;) Great way to think of it like that in your post...
@&lt;b&gt;Catherine&lt;/b&gt; - Cool to hear! I&#039;m glad you found a way that works :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I believe you&#039;re the only person I know that still balances a check book too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Greg@ClubThrifty&lt;/b&gt; - Oh hell yeah it! I was hooked when I stated seeing it GROW every month rather than stay stagnant or worse, decline! I&#039;d thought for years it was growing and I was doing a-okay, but it wasn&#039;t until I started tracking it and comparing that I knew I was in trouble ;) And it&#039;s been on the up and up ever since
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - That does help :) I think I&#039;d put &quot;always tweaking&quot; as my main priority though cuz life rarely stays the same!
@&lt;b&gt;savvyfinanciallatina&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s half the battle right there!
@&lt;b&gt;Mandy @MoneyMasterMom&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, no more boring-ness. There&#039;s enough of that out there ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice... Is it bad that that kinda turns me one? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Holly@ClubThrifty&lt;/b&gt; - Another perk of pen and paper? You can never lose &#039;em in a computer crash! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ve never even heard of it myself, but hopefully others chime in who have and share :)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Hooray! And I can tell you that the founder of it (Jesse) is an INCREDIBLE human being too. I met him at this year&#039;s financial blogging conference and we really hit it off. Great overall guy - I&#039;m glad his baby is helping you! :)
@&lt;b&gt;MakinSense Babe&lt;/b&gt; - That would be too much sexiness to handle :)
@&lt;b&gt;K.K. @ Living Debt Free Rocks!&lt;/b&gt; - FuN?? With money? Blasphemy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that as long as you&#039;re doing SOMETHING, that&#039;s all that matters.  I used to be terrible with my money and am now suffering from it (I used to earn $75K a year when I was younger and single and didn&#039;t save any of it) because I&#039;m a SAHM with only hubby working and we struggle to make ends meet.  We use YNAB and it has completely changed how we manage our finances.  We keep it simple, have categories, set our budget for that month or pay period, and stick to it as best as we can.  Yay for budgets.  I love budgeting!]]></description>
