Nicely done being completely debt-free like that, wow!!

I think you need to have a $$ blog up in here! ;)

Index funds - they are a bit trickier to mold to your desires since they encompass so much of a particular area, however more and more &quot;socially responsible&quot; funds are starting to pop up due to demand which is nice (although they do tend to cost more, fee-wise). 

Google &quot;socially responsible&quot; or even &quot;biblically responsible&quot; funds and you&#039;ll get a good idea of what&#039;s out there. Just really depends on what exactly you&#039;re looking to invest in, or rather, *not* invest in. Index funds don&#039;t work perfectly for everyone so don&#039;t feel pressured if it&#039;s not for you! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Everyone talks about index funds on the FIRE websites. I would like to start investing in them.  We have invested in retirement funds and the stock market (primarily my husband&#039;s workplace).  We would like to invest ethically though, as we are very conservative Christians.  We have heard of the Timothy Fund, which is definitely ethical.  (I may not be using the correct words?)  My question is are index funds ethical or can you pick some that are and how do they work? If this is too involved for the guest or the owner of this blog, I don&#039;t mind if my question is not answered.  (For instance, if this is more the type of information that you pay people for, in a consultation).  I don&#039;t know too much about investing.  We are debt free and mortgage free and live on a low percentage of our income. Thank you.]]></description>

Ahhh could be! I know he was just dumping it all out of his brain when he sent it to me as it wasn&#039;t meant to be a blog article at all (I just convinced him to let me share it ;)). I also had to merge a note from further correspondence and could have jacked something up myself...]]></description>

Scary :(

Did their executor hold off on it on purpose thinking it would rise, or just took his/her own time?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a typo or something out of whack in the chronology.
Theres the bit &quot; 2008/2009 came along ... &quot; followed by :
 &quot;I was done with Ohio so I moved back into that very first house I had bought in Nashville. I lived in it for just over two years, sold it for $340K in June 2002,&quot;
Then ... &quot; in Los Angeles in 2010,&quot;

So thats 2008/2009 then 2002 then 2010

So the 2002 is likely a typo or out of place.]]></description>
