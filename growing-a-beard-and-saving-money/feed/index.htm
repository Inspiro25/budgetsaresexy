					<description><![CDATA[HAH! Really?  Which one are you up there? That&#039;s awesome :) And very very small odds indeed, wow.  You were certainly right about that itching! I ended up shaving it all off in early April, but it got long enough where it stopped itching and I looked like a mountain man :)  I really REALLY liked it but had to shave due to some weddings coming up, and have all intentions of growing it back right after.  It&#039;s fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Imagine my surprise when i was catching up on one of my bookmarked blogs and what pops up but a picture of me!  Thanks for using that pic at the top!  I grew a beard for just under two years and I can tell you that unlike what you say above, it does take hard work!  You&#039;ll see as it gets longer how much work there actually is!
(and the itching stops after a couple weeks as your face adjusts to its natural state of hairiness!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tried!!  It works for like an hour, but then it&#039;s back to the itch :(  Oh well, hopefully only a little while longer to go &#039;till it&#039;s long enough to stop bugging me.  I&#039;m not gonna let it steer me off course though! I&#039;m on a mission, baby! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband will randomly grow a beard, and it&#039;s all right as long as it&#039;s groomed and doesn&#039;t turn into a hobo beard. 

He said, no joke, if you put conditioner on the beard in the shower, it will soften the hair out and make it less itchy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I don&#039;t think I could ever get a super long one (like those in that picture up there) but if I ever did I&#039;d make sure it was pretty well maintained.  Hopefully I can just make it past this itchy hump though!
@&lt;b&gt;Noob Traveler&lt;/b&gt; - The luckiest? Haha... like, in gambling or in getting women? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say that the luckiest time in my life is when I had my college beard. It was half as long as the dudes featured.  But I am with you on this thing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have seen some nice shorter ones that are more goatee like than beard-like.  The long beards disgust me, though.  Every time my husband is on vacation he refuses to shave.  It&#039;s cute for a change, but I prefer him clean shaven.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha I love it. I once grew a beard (what I could grow) for my college soccer team. I did the whole &quot;No-Shave November&quot;, and we ended up winning nationals. I like how you relate this to money though. Who knew you could learn financial success from some hair.]]></description>
