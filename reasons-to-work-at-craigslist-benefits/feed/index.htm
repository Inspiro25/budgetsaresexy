					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say my two biggest benefits where I work are my schedule, and my retirement match. I&#039;ll generally be on the clock for 12-14 hours a day for 4 to 6 days, but then because I&#039;ve accrued so much comp. time then, I&#039;ll usually have a week to two weeks off before I need to go in again. As for my 403(b), I&#039;m given the equivalent of 10% of my (before taxes) income! And come to think of it, that&#039;s whether or not I put in anything myself (though don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m putting in 8% of my before-taxes income).]]></description>

Sounds like Australia has good benefits already! If we&#039;re lucky here in the US we&#039;ll get 2 weeks paid leave, 5 days sick days. Our 401k sounds like your retirement fund. Cept no matching from the Government. Employers can match but it&#039;s getting rarer that they do. If anything its only up to 3% too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I would kill for that! I really dig the charitable giving, wellness money and food! I work for a non-profit and I am seriously happy I have 100% free health, dental, vision--which includes massages and acupuncture! Yes! My friend recently went to SF and visited Dropbox and Google and said it&#039;s just plain ridiculous how spoiled they are with benefits. If you got the skillz, use them! Us plebeians can keep dreaming.]]></description>
