					<description><![CDATA[Great post J! I admit, it is a lot easier to say when you have done the hard work. I think when people say that something was easy for you to say, they are ignoring the sacrifice and hard work it took you to get there. I think most of &quot;those&quot; people are sitting back waiting for the good life to fall out of the sky or something. How do I know? Because I used to be that guy.

It wasn&#039;t always easy for me to say, but most of the things I say now, are things I&#039;ve done. If I can do them so can almost anyone. It&#039;s mostly about attitude and taking action to provide the life that you want. With the wrong attitude and a lack of action, life will not just hand you greatness!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;when you wait until the last minute, your options are limited.&quot; YES! SO true!!! Love that.
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - Lots of time and lots of dedication, you got that right ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - Yayyy! Never heard my writing was &quot;sassy&quot; but I&#039;ll take it! Thanks ;)  and keep on workin it!
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, and the funny part is even if you were blowing it all on fancy cars and houses, they&#039;d still think you were really well off!  even if you were broke! haha...  people just want all the good parts of things w/out thinking of the bad parts.
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, well done biting that tongue!  I sometimes slip and speak my mind but you&#039;re right, sometimes it makes it worse.  At least you can feel like you&#039;ve mastered the art of debt-killing!  We all appreciate that here :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - LOVE that idea!!  I think living off 1 income is def. the way to go for most family situations, so I&#039;m in awe :)  We kinda sorta do that now (Mrs is in grad school) but she does bring in a good $15k+ so we&#039;re not there all the way.  Once we are, it&#039;ll really be like me working @ home (aka blogging/writing) and her going full-time ;) haha...  but in theory either of us could quit at any time and be financially stable.  So well done making that a reality over there!  And glad I help in your journey!
@&lt;b&gt;sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Are you inviting us over for drinks? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - I think all blogs help someone out whether we realize it or not.  Only like 0.01% of readers actually comment and let us know, which makes it really crazy if you think about it.  Who knows who else we&#039;re affecting everytime we post? for the good or the bad?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, J., I&#039;m in no way close to your situation, but I still REALLY appreciate your blog and your advice!  My husband and I have made a very difficult decision to live off of my income alone (I carry the benefits), so my husband can stay home to raise our babies.  We have ZERO EXTRA MONEY...but do we get by?  YES!  We have what we NEED, and that&#039;s why I enjoy your blog.  You help me to stay focused on budgeting and trying to stay focused on our goals...even if that goal is having one parent to stay home!  :)  No, I don&#039;t have all these wicked cool 401(k) thingies and Roth IRAs and a savings account with $10,000 for emergencies and all that awesomeness, but am I currently meeting our family&#039;s goals?  YES!  And do I look forward to taking ALL your advice once my husband goes back to work and the kids go to school?  YES!  

I guess my point is, I could sit here and say the same thing...&quot;Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, J.; you have $10,000 in the bank!&quot;  But I don&#039;t even remotely feel that way.  The fact that you&#039;re making it gives me hope that my broke little family can do the same some day with a lot of hard work...and I think all your true fans feel the same way  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the phone yesterday talking to a friend I had to bit my tongue. She was talking about how much debt she was in, how lucky I was because I was on the outside edge of my huge debt (in her mind a big ole financial fairy came down on me and waved her magic wand to make my credit card debt disappear) and how she got a great pedicure the other day, a little pricey but worth it.
I bit my tongue for several reasons:
1.  I use to get overpriced pedicure (OK, really it was going out to fancy resturants) while racking up credit card debt.
2.  When I try reasoning she gets more set in her position.
Just keep walking the walk and blogging the blog and readers will come around in their own time.  Chin up, dude!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few days ago a coworker made a snide comment regarding my need for money.  For some strange reason lately, many of my coworkers are jealous of my financial standing.  They forget that I had to sacrifice so much just to have a little bit of money in my bank account.  People always look at what you have and not what you had to sacrifice to get it.  Granted I&#039;m &quot;lucky&quot; in certain respects but that doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t deserve what I&#039;ve worked and saved up for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think its great that you have a blog, I like your sassy writing, its different from most PF bloggers. Yes when you do post your networth updates I&#039;m a tiny bit envious but not in a bad way, it just makes me say &quot;hey he worked hard for his money, and I know I haven&#039;t tried everything yet, I just need to work as hard as he is and I can get there.&quot; So you definitely motivate me to be better.

I used to think that once I was out of debt that it would be easier, and yeah I do have a lot of options now that I&#039;m out of debt but I realize the financial thing is a journey. I still have to build an emergency fund, I&#039;m also trying to go to college at the same time, and I still need to open an IRA at my bank. It feels so overwhelming, but I know I can get there, your blog inspires me ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The people who may say could definitely be a little bit bitter, but like you said, who better to talk about YOUR story than YOU?! It&#039;s possible for everyone to get in the same situation you&#039;re in (with lots of money saved up) but it definitely takes time and dedication. It&#039;s not easy, and you&#039;ve told us about the hardships, it&#039;s just how determined these people are. Soon, it&#039;ll be easy for THEM to say]]></description>
