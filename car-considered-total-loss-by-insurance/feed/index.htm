					<description><![CDATA[If the pimp mobile still runs and drives fine, albeit with some cosmetic damage, I&#039;d opt to just keep the caddy and keep the pimp hand strong. You&#039;d be getting $2k and still get to keep a functioning car. Plus at a minimum if your car runs and drives with a reasonable fix you can get $1k on craigslist. So potentially you can keep you car for however long it takes till something more major happens, you get $2k, and you can still sell your car for at least $1k. I&#039;d keep rolling in the caddy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to address the one car concern. Lots of families have one car with children and mange just fine and no one dies. Our family has had one vehicle for ten years and we have a toddler. We have a 14yo 4runner with 232k miles on it. I work at home and me dh is a sahd. If it breaks down then we get it fixed. We then borrow a car from family, rent one or go without. I am confident that as a fully capable adult that you could figure out how to get your sick child to the doctor if need be. I am assuming if it was an emergency you would call an ambulance, if not then I would assume your city had either public transportation or cabs. 

If you are truly honest with yourself then two cars are not necessary in a household where no one works outside the home and is a luxury. Having one car to fill with gas, pay maint on, insurance, registration and so on is good savings. Not to mention the environmental impact. When we sold my husbands car before a big move we planned to get him a different car right away. But after a few months we had adjusted and decided to stay with one. In fact, while we were both commuting we found that we really enjoyed the quiet time together coming and going.

Good luck with your decision. I suspect it is the sentimental aspect that is masking all of the other issues.]]></description>

If only it were that easy! Caddys in good condition are not only hard to come by for that year, but also more expensive the better condition they&#039;re in. So $1,500 would either get me a worse off beater or one with like 200,000 miles on it, haha...]]></description>

Ouch! Were you even able to pick up a new (to you) car with that amount? That was similar? Or did you just give up cars for a bit?]]></description>

That&#039;s actually why I want to KEEP the car right now - cuz  we have so many things going on! Haha... the idea of losing one or picking up another one gives me more of a headache than keeping one that runs perfectly fine ;)]]></description>
