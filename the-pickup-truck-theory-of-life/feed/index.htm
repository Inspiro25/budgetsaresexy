					<description><![CDATA[So true!  Over the years we have done a lot of home renovations, and we have found the Home Depot tool rentals to be most valuable.   We&#039;ve rented (for 4hrs or a day) ladders, wheelbarrows, floor sanders, tile saws etc. etc.  We spend a small amount on the rental, and save ourselves tons of money by not purchasing the tool (not to mention having to store it when we&#039;re not using it).  Unless it&#039;s going to be something that you use all the time - rent it or borrow it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this idea-it forms stronger community bonds; so long as nobody takes advantage of the guy with the tool/truck/etc. 

Always happy to loan somebody my jeep or powersaw or whatever...I&#039;m less inclined to loan out my time to help them with the project though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the reciprocate part of this post.  I like having things to be able to bless people, have a house for visitors, a car to take friends skiing, etc.  But I really do appreciate it when my friends notice this and offer to help out with things.  Just makes life so much easier.  You don&#039;t have to keep track of who has done what, but when people are blessing you it is so much easier to turn around and bless someone else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first real vehicle was a small truck.  I loved that thing and it was very useful when I was moving since I had been on my own since the day I turned 18.  I did get too many friend requests to help move their couches and crap so I started saying no to requests.  Pizza and beer?  All I got was &quot;Thanks, can you move this box too&quot;.  I eventually sold it for that reason, but do miss it since I recently downsized from a station wagon to a hatchback.  Oh well, my new little car can still haul a lot, trust me I am very creative, but don&#039;t tell anyone. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bought my pickup back in &#039;04 with the knowledge that I would never buy another truck or trade it in. For me, it has proven its usefulness over the years as my family and I have made half a dozen moves that we didn&#039;t need to borrow or rent a truck for, and we&#039;ve helped several friends move. I just paid the truck off and I will never regret being the one that gets called on first &quot;Hey, can you help me move?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I own a truck and it&#039;s paid off, so the reason of &quot;getting out of debt&quot; doesn&#039;t play into getting rid of the truck. However, both sets of parents (including moms) strongly questioned my decision to get something other than a truck recently when I was looking to replace. Mainly because they grew up owning and/or loving trucks and can&#039;t imagine not having one at home. However, I use my truck for something that an SUV or even small CUV can&#039;t do maybe once a year. That&#039;s about 6 times since I&#039;ve owned it (really, though, one year I got a few tons of gravel dumped into it about 5 times, so it&#039;s more like 11). But even then, I can have that stuff delivered. 

After reading this post, I considered whether I should just sell the truck and recoup the equity I have left in it, but I would still need a vehicle (can&#039;t be a one-car household in our situation), so that money would end up going to something else. May as well keep what I own and love and know. And honestly, I don&#039;t get asked to help people move, even though I offer up my truck when I know people are moving. I think most of my friends tend to get professionals to do the work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use my new Odyssey for hauling home my thrift store scores and estate sales finds, and I couldn&#039;t have made a better choice! Plus, it&#039;s nifty for hauling kids and the mother-in-law all together when needed :)

					<description><![CDATA[I rent tools very rarely.  I like to buy them instead, like my power washer.  That thing gets used probably 100 times a year and renting one wouldn&#039;t make financial sense.  I can see the point behind renting if it is something that is rarely used, like a cement saw but everything I buy I make sure to think about how often it will be used, which helps with buyers remorse.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We rarely need a truck and many time, we can get that big piece of furniture delivered. 
I think borrowing or community renting is a great way to go. If you don&#039;t use it often, it&#039;s better to rent.]]></description>
