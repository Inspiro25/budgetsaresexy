					<description><![CDATA[I like this ratio too. It&#039;s a nice abstract way to compare situations without getting into all the details. It also feels like it&#039;s uniting the two &quot;sides&quot; of personal finance - earn more (increase net worth) or spend less (decrease expenses). They&#039;re really two sides of the same coin and either will work. Both works even better though!

I&#039;m on the low end with a 3.5. Not as high as I&#039;d like, but not bad all things considered. Projecting out to next year, I should easily blow past 5. Woo! Look at me go! It seems like things should pick up a bit now that I made it past the typical &quot;getting started&quot; gauntlet of expenses (car, wedding, house, etc). Also a second car because city buses are evil. EVIL.

And completely off topic, but I have to share with a fellow PF nerd, because no one else will care! My mortgage payment just adjusted and is now $997, which feels so much more awesome than $1,002.]]></description>

I think anyone who&#039;s figured out a way to be that happy at a job has hit a jackpot! Haha.... Good for you! :) And that the place you&#039;ve found also still has a pension??? Double jackpot! I don&#039;t know how much or not you&#039;ve saved/invested already, or what your expenses are/etc, but I&#039;m sure if you sat down and ran the numbers and projected you&#039;d be able to figure out a decent game plan :) I think as long as you&#039;re always aware of your financial snapshot, and can adjust as time goes on, you&#039;ll be fine. But you def. gotta stop and run the numbers for a bit so you get that good grasp sooner than later.]]></description>
