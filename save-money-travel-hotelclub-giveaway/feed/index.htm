					<description><![CDATA[As a mother of 5 kids, eating out on trips is a huge part of our budget.  I always scout out the area restaurants for early bird specials.  I also do not like order off the kids menu for my 3 youngest kids.  I usually ask how large the adult portions are and see if it can be shared by 3 kids.  I will also ask them to divide the one plate onto 3 plates before they  bring it to our table.  I say it makes the kids feel like they all are getting the same amount.  This usually has the server make sure that the plates all look about even, as to think the kids will be throwing a fit if someone gets more than the other.  Sometimes the plates come back with more on it, than the regular adult plate would have alone.  
At the hotel, I make friends with the breakfast crew, and desk people.  When I explain, that I do not want to take up 2 tables for my family, if they would be willing to allow me to make extra trips back to the breakfast area and to my room to feed them.  I never take what they will not eat.  ( they might eat the apples later that day, but we do not waste the food)  When we leave the hotel at any time, I make sure my kids walk and tell all workers they see, hello and thank them for all that they are doing for them.  Not all my kids are just walking right up to them, but the rest will just wave and smile.  Also, ask the locals for the best untold area, for eating, shopping or just plain local entertainment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My best tip for saving money on travel? Stealing.

No, seriously. Maybe a better term for it is &quot;snagging,&quot; but whatever you call it, it&#039;s saved me hundreds of dollars when I travel (and I travel a lot).

So how do you &quot;snag&quot;/&quot;steal&quot;? Step 1) Scope out any and all opportunities for free food. This includes your breakfast buffet (tiered fruit tray? SCORE!), food spreads at conferences or all-day meetings, and those free packets of coffee in your hotel room. 2) Place &quot;snagged&#039; items in your backpack or purse (discretely of course). Be sure to load up on quality items like bottled waters and portable foods that will tide you over when you need a snack later, like bananas, apples and granola bars. 3) Remove snagged items from your bag when you&#039;re hungry or thirsty and you&#039;re not quite sure when your next meal is.

Snagging has saved me at least $15 a day in impulse food purchases and expensive bottled water when I travel. Some call me cheap, some call me a thief, but I just call myself opportunistic :)]]></description>
