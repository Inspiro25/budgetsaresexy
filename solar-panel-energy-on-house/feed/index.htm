I am not certain but I did read something the other day when researching solar power in S. Calif that you would not have power when the power goes out unless you had added equipment not typically provided with a solar panel install.  So if that is important to you, that would be a question to make sure to ask.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, but we all need to realise that adding Solar in their home is an asset that will raise the future valuation of their residence if / when they come to a decision to sell. With the environment the way it is going we cannot disregard any product or service that presents no cost power at no cost to both the consumer and more importantly the environment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in Northern Michigan. Very sad I cannot find a solution like this for me I know it snows and the panels will get covered however the solution to this is easy add a clear heated layer this would melt any snow.  

Guess I&#039;m out... sadly]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Paul, those are all great questions - which I have no idea about ;)  I do know there are other companies out there that offer solar panel leasing and buying though for sure, I just haven&#039;t researched them.  I bet some Google searching will get you some good answers. Sorry I can&#039;t help more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So if I understand this lease situation correctly, Solar City has nothing to do with the relationship with the local energy provider—in may case, SoCal Edison—who will pay me for producing more energy than I consume, i.e. &quot;banking.&quot; And this will, in turn, help offset the monthly Solar City bill, correct? And btw, SC surely is not the only company providing this sort of 0% down long term lease option, yes? 

Also, anyone know of a website that provides info on what the energy buyback rates are, company by company?

Thanks for all the info!! Paul]]></description>
