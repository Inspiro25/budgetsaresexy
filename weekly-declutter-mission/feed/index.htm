					<description><![CDATA[&#039;Just discovered your blog and am completely addicted! Seriously, it&#039;s becoming a problem-I have a bunch of stuff I need to be doing right now....can&#039;t ..set...phone down! Especially tuned-in to clutter issues as we are moving soon and nothing is stupider than moving a bunch of crap that needs to be thrown! I just started utilizing an app called UFYH (Unfuck Your Habitat-for real :0) and it is awesome for motivation and breaking up projects into bite-sized pieces, tracking your progress, encouraging you, etc. But never mind all that. Just try it cuz the name. Trust me :)

Thanks for all your terrific ideas. Please keep it up!]]></description>

Amen, brotha.

If you ever start a $$$ blog over there, you totally need to do a series on all the madness you saw as a loan officer :) It would be fascinating to read!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a loan officer from 2005 to 2013, so I witnessed the height of the crazy and the depths of the pain.  125% wasn&#039;t uncommon, but 110% was almost standard back then.

Cudos on the progress with bills.  My wife and I cut cable a couple years ago and the only thing I miss is SEC Football.  We&#039;re on antenna as our internet is really slow, but I&#039;m kinda glad that my 10 month old will grow up on PBS and Andy Griffith re-runs instead of the trash on TV today.  

I tell my wife all the time that it&#039;s not a sacrifice, it&#039;s addition by subtraction.  You make gains in your life by what you cut out, not what you add to it.]]></description>

Thanks for stopping by! Sucks about the card stuff - I&#039;ve had to get three cards replaced in the past few years due to theft and hacking, not fun. At least with credit cards you don&#039;t get any funds pulled out of your account so it&#039;s easier to get resolved than using debit. Though I see the appeal of not using credit cards :)]]></description>
