					<description><![CDATA[I drive a 2010 Honda Civic.  I was paying $163/month with Liberty Mutual, and JUST changed over yesterday to $115/month (knocked down to $105/month paying in full for the year) with Geico - same coverages.   To avoid the 5% fee on the total premium for leaving a policy early - I&#039;ll start this up in June 2018 (2 more months of the higher rate makes more sense than the 5% fee).
Grateful it was suggested to shop this rate with Geico, another carrier offered me a lower rate, but I had an outstanding issues from 2016 that needs 2 years to wipe off my insurance record - argh!   Motivation for even safer, more aware, driving!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting site, but I don&#039;t like that they made me give an email and phone number to see my score. I just want to look, not get sales calls. Fortunately I was able to use a burner email and phone number.

My number ended up being 915 with a rate of about $50 - $140 depending on coverage. It did look as if what was included in their &quot;minimum&quot; did not include the legal minimum required for my state, namely uninsured motorist insurance.]]></description>

Yeah, he got lucky and bought a Master Mechanic&#039;s project car.  So the body of the car is old, but almost everything under the hood was new when he bought it.  He was able to buy it for $4K only because he was likely one of the few people around who could take it and finish putting it back together.]]></description>

Totally! Very important considerations!

I didn&#039;t include just to keep the post more focused on the tools here, but if you&#039;re specifically asking me I&#039;ll have to go look it up now :) (It&#039;s been a while!)

Here we are:

-- Comprehensive and collision coverage with a $200 deductible
-- Car replacement assistance ($10 extra for 6 months),
-- Bodily injury @ $300,000/$500,000
-- Property Damage at $100,000
-- Uninsured Motorists Bodily Injury @ $300,000/$500,000
-- Uninsured Motorists Property Damage @ $100,000
--  Personal Injury Protection @ 2,500 per person 
--  Medical Payments @ $5,000 per person 

And then I have Umbrella Insurance as well that helps cover all REALLY crazy situations....

My wife&#039;s car insurance is a lot different too since her car is much older and not as valuable, but yeah - hopefully this gives you a better look :)]]></description>

That&#039;s an interesting catch actually - that they can&#039;t tell if you have other types of insurance w/ these companies that could lower it drastically! I&#039;d imagine once you clicked over to the insurer&#039;s site though and went through the process it would all come up and be included, but yeah - only if it doesn&#039;t scare you off initially :)]]></description>
