					<description><![CDATA[1. Id put it my pocket and use it for normal every day things, nothing special.
2. Id be surprised and in disbelief since I didn&#039;t think u were a theif. Id ask the story of it and after listening to it could either give the money back and think less of u or accept we&#039;re both imperfect and keep it.
3. I don&#039;t cry, I&#039;m disappointed in myself and look forward to crunching the monthly numbers to figure out how that happened.
4. Cause it brings security and allows me to do stuff I like to do. And u can tell a lot abou people in how they attain and use their money. Plus I&#039;m always interested in ways to get more money for less work.
5. I like turtles...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.  Since our budget is in tact and happy I would probably give it to the fiancé to help her buy a plane ticket to her friends bachelorette party.
2.  Give it back
3.  Crying is such a strong word.. I just mope about.
4.  I like the &quot;Richest Man in Babylon&quot; idealogy. Money will grow itself. It&#039;s like planting a tree and watching it get bigger and bigger.
5.  A proctologist walks into a bank to deposit a check. He reaches into his shirt pocket for a pen to sign it, and pulls out a rectal thermometer instead.
&quot;Oh, great&quot;, he says, &quot;some asshole has my pen.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.) I would give the $100 to charity/church.
2.) I would ask who you took it from, so I could give them the $100 out of my pocket.
3.) It hasn&#039;t happened yet, but if it did, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. There is enough &quot;fluff&quot; built into the budget that savings can suffer to pay any real expenses.
4.) Because, for the first time in I don&#039;t know how long, I finally realize that I have some. Like more than what I really need to survive on. So, it&#039;s nice to give it away or help those that need help.
5.) Two men were walking in a field, talking as they went. They came across a large hole. They stepped to the edge and peered in. One man looks at the other and asks &quot;How deep do you think the hole is?&quot; The other replied, &quot;I dunno. Let&#039;s throw something in and listen to it hit the bottom.&quot; So, they each find a rock in the field and throw it down the hole and listen. No sound. With a puzzled look on their face, they find a larger rock and throw that down the hold. Nothing. Then one notices a large stack of railroad ties in a pile. Each grabs an end of the tie and they walk over and throw it in the hole. Once again, not a sound was made. Then, all of a sudden, a goat runs and jumps into the large hole. They look at each other with a puzzled look and continue on their way. Later they meet the farmer and he asks, &quot;Have you seen my goat?&quot; The two men reply that a goat ran an jumped into this large hole. The farmer replies, &quot;Oh, thank goodness. That&#039;s not my goat. My goat was tied to a railroad tie.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. $30 for iPad apps, the rest would go toasted random stuff like a jewelry organizer, coffee, and a haircut

2. Blast! You jerk! 

3. I don&#039;t cry, but sometimes i get really frustrated and wish injustice had more money. 

4. I ink we talk about money because it&#039;s therapeutic. We all encourage eachbother one-way or another.

5. So this kid was walking down the street with his dad and saw a telephone booth. &quot;What&#039;s that?!&quot; he asked his dad. 
&quot;Well, son, that&#039;s a telephone booth. You put change on the machine and you can make a phone call.&quot; 
To which the kid replied, &quot;Wow! That&#039;s awesome! If we had those everywhere, we wouldn&#039;t have to carry our phones with us all the time!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Little bit late here, but I&#039;ll give it a go!
#1 - Just because it came from you, since you are all about the giving, I would pass it on down to one of the tornado victim teams here in Mississippi.  The Missouri tornadoes and Mississippi floods have turned attention there (rightly so), but people here still need a bit.
#2 - After I&#039;ve already given it away?  Good thing I didn&#039;t spend it on myself :)
#3 - No, but P.O.&#039;d at myself I do become (yoda style language)
#4 - Because it feels like winning when finding ways to save money, keep more money, and giving away money.  Some people get a high from shopping (spending money).  I think I get that same feeling by making it and saving it.
#5 - From a friend who always has the corniest jokes - &quot;A blond goes into a bar and orders an appletini. The bartender says, &quot;You wanna open a tab?&quot; The blond looks at him and goes, &quot;Duh. If I&#039;d wanted to do that, I would&#039;ve stayed home. Besides, I prefer Mr. Pibb.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;If I gave you $100 in cash, right now, what would you do with it?&quot;
Send it to the Red Cross for the tornado victims. It&#039;s not that I wouldn&#039;t like to get $100. It&#039;s that I sure as heck don&#039;t need it as much as the folks in Joplin do.
   &quot;What if I then told you it was stolen?&quot;
I&#039;d make you sit in the corner. After I shaved your head.
   &quot;What happens if you go over budget? Do you cry?&quot;
I never go over budget...but if I did, I would sell photos of your shaven head to make up the difference.
   &quot;Why do we get so excited to talk about money?&quot;
Because money is like sex: Everybody wants it and few people would admit they get all they need.
    &quot;Tell me a joke :) If you don’t have one, tell me something awesome instead.&quot;
I&#039;ll share several of my favorite dumb jokes:
Q. What did the salmon say when he hit his head on the concrete wall?
A. Dam.
Q. What&#039;s brown and wrinkled and lies at the bottom of a bell tower?
A. The Lunchbag of Notre Dame
Q. How many fashion photographers does it take to change a light bulb?
A. &quot;Just one more!&quot;
Knock knock. / Who&#039;s there? / A pileup. / (Finish that one yourself, and it MUST be finished aloud.)]]></description>
