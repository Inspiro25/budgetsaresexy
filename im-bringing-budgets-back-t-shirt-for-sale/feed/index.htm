					<description><![CDATA[Love that they&#039;re now available! Just have to figure out which size and color. Plus, women&#039;s shirts can be tricky, like do the women&#039;s run small? Either way, I&#039;ll figure it out and get one. And maybe some for friends :)

Also, looove the &quot;budgetsareboring&quot; site! I totally clicked through.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a couple of Brad&#039;s shirts! I LOVE the looks I get when I wear mine. I don&#039;t think people expect to see shirts talking about debt (One of mine says &quot;Debt Sucks&quot;).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the explaination.  Since I passed the big 5-0 in age, I now know how my Dad felt when he didn&#039;t understand the slang of the day.  I&#039;ve never even listened to a Justin Timberlake song so couldn&#039;t figure out the play on words.  But play a Elton John or Bruce Springsteen song and I can lip-sinc every word!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Norman&lt;/b&gt; It&#039;s a take on &quot;I&#039;m Bringing Sexy Back&quot; - a Justin Timberlake song which gave me the idea for Budgets Are Sexy. Originally it was just a shirt for me cuz I liked it so much, but when we got over 30+ comments from people &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/random-financial-nuggets/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;saying they wanted it too&lt;/a&gt; on an older post, it was pretty obvious we should start there w/ these ;)  I&#039;m sure one of the next designs will be more &quot;Budgets Are Sexy&quot; branded, so hold onto your dollars...

@&lt;b&gt;Suzanne Cramer&lt;/b&gt; -  Thanks!  Glad you like them!
@&lt;b&gt;Anna&lt;/b&gt; -  Haha, that&#039;s why I linked to it - so y&#039;all curious Georges will click ;)]]></description>
