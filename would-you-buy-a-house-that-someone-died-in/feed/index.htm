I thought they had to, but after some quick googling it looks like there&#039;s only a few states that are required to disclose deaths. The rest are not, unless it was a &quot;violent death&quot; that had occurred there and/or if anyone specifically asks if someone had died on the property (ie you can&#039;t flat out lie about it!). Came across some interesting articles about how many elderly people end up dying in their homes, but of course I&#039;m totally fine with a peaceful grandma spirit living there - just not the freaky ones!! :)]]></description>

Yikes - this is a freaky story.  Maybe they should add this question to the Property Disclosure paperwork!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My family and I are looking at homes to buy in a city about an an hour and half away from where we live. Well one of the homes caught our attention right away. Not only for the low price for a 4 bedroom 2 1/2 bath,or being a brick home in a nice neighborhood. But as soon as we stepped on the property, I immediately felt a sense of uneasiness and creepiness. My husband and I walked around the backyard and I felt like someone was watching us. I went straight back to the front of the house only then meeting up with my teenage daughter and she too felt uneasy. We both went the front door and we come upon a scripture from the bible written in black marker on the edging of the door. We both say out loud, that&#039;s weird, why would someone put that there. After that point I was attempting to look into one of the Windows in front that I held myself  back and made my way back to our car. My husband comes and says to me, why did you come back to the car. I tell him I just wanted to leave because that house doesn&#039;t feel right. We were really considering to contact the agent to see inside but after feeling what we felt, I no longer wanted to go back. Well more to the story, I told some friends of mine about the house and how I felt and I was not interested in trying to get it even for the great price that it was. One of them says would I mind giving her the address because she might be interested. I did and no sooner does she come to me and says that she typed into the internet what happened at that address. Well a murder did. A woman shot her boyfriend. The news  said she was leaving him, he was depressed and he was said he was going to end his life, but instead started beating her and she shot him several times. Come to find out, this only happened last year (May 2018) So just knowing that how our feelings were being at that house turned out to be because of someone being killed there was enough for us to say, no matter how low the price or how beautiful the house is. We rather just look somewhere else.]]></description>

Yikes! I&#039;d be more okay living there than I would in the same house where someone died, but still gives me the heebie jeebies either way - bleh. I guess in the grand scheme of things people have died in spots all around us over the hundreds of years though, so probably not that different than what you&#039;re describing, other than you know for a fact it happened and the story behind it :( 

If it freaks you out too much I&#039;d just keep looking around until you find another suitable place as there are plenty without deaths occurring (that you know of :)). It would be pretty hard/stressful to get all built and moved in and then realize you&#039;re not comfortable :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about if someone passed away in a house from a fire? But...it was due to not putting the cigarette out correctly...and...the house has since been leveled. The lot has been empty for 5 yrs. There were 4 young men living there. Three of them were okay, but one died of asphyxiation (I believe in his sleep). He was 28 years old. I&#039;m thinking of purchasing the land to build a new home on. But the thought that someone died there, when it was a mistake, still &quot;haunts&quot; me. What would you do?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bought a nice little place that I quickly found out was the site of an ax homicide where the victim was cut into pieces in the house and buried on the property. I gotta say that from the night I moved in I felt there was something to the place, it was odd. It wasn&#039;t a bad or a good feeling, it was just like the house had a sort of &#039;presence&#039; to it. Nothing that ever scared me but it was comparable to feeling watched a lot. That didn&#039;t bother me as much as the psychological dimension to it, while I am neutral on the topic of ghosts it was more of the thought of where things happened and what had happened that really bothered me over time. I had this feeling that I had to build a &#039;safe place&#039; in my room, like I couldn&#039;t imagine falling asleep on the couch because of the proximity of where the living room was to the location in the house where the murder took place. Paranormal forces or fear in the mind? Not sure, regardless, there are people I know that could live in a place like that and feel alright and not think too much about it. For me, my imagination runs a little wild. Decided to move elsewhere. I feel all states should have laws requiring disclosure about these sorts of things. The previous owners never disclosed it but I feel they should have. Anyway. To each their own.]]></description>
