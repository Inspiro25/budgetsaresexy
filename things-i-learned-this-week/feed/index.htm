					<description><![CDATA[I installed one of the small rectangular pet doors for the same reason. It worked well except for my daughter decided to stick her head in it and got it stuck! Took some work to get her head back out but it didn&#039;t happen again and still kept her from the stairs. Love that style!]]></description>

So cute, right??

You can find it at Amazon! Pretty easy to install, at least if you have the right tools :)]]></description>

What&#039;s nice is that it looks like a smaller forum too so maybe not as chaotic to sort through (I can only last so long in the bigger subs, haha...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A coworker told me about the personal finance subreddit, but I hadn&#039;t heard about the one for the financially challenged - learning something new about PF is always a win!

Hahahhaa.. hadn&#039;t heard that one about the low pants!

I remember Kris Kross&#039;ing it out and wearing them backwards to school though for a while when they were hot :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, 
I’m going to miss these posts every day. 
Anyways, #5 in my end of Southern Ontario is rumoured to mean “drugs sold here”. I have more of a feeling that, in today’s times, it’s kids playing and trying to see if they can get their shoes stuck. Kinda how we used to twist up the swings. I know, “in my day” if we’d lost our shoes like that, we’d be going barefoot for a while! /s 
It’s probably like the rumour about wearing low pants. Was it really a jail invite???]]></description>
