Can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t catch this article beforehand ^^

It&#039;s quite a timely thing, as I was thinking about our discussion of 2y ago about going part time at work... it&#039;s happening these days, and it&#039;s crazy fantastic! Thx for your hint back then :D

Talk soon!]]></description>

Ahhhhh A hearty welcome back to you too Yvonne! What a whopper of a first comment! :) Glad your net worth has skyrocketed over the years - amazing how easy it gets once you get going and let time work its magic, eh?! Here&#039;s to many more magical years (and blog posts) ahead!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never commented before, but this feels like a reason to celebrate! I&#039;ve been following this blog since at least 2016 (I just scrolled back through my net worth tracking tabs to check). I can&#039;t even remember how I found my way to this corner of the internet, but you were the blogger who introduced me to the FIRE movement and made me into a person finance junkie. I had a one-sided competition with you to see which of us would get our net worth to 1M first (I think you won, but our net worth has doubled since then so I&#039;m thankful for the motivation!). I was bummed but proud for you when the blog got acquired, but I&#039;ll admit I&#039;ve missed your writing! It was a happy surprise to come back from vacation with several J$ posts in my feed reader. Welcome back and long live Budgets are Sexy!]]></description>
