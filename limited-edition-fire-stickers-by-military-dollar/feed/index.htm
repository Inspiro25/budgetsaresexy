Hey Wes,

Yup - people who get these blog posts emailed to them directly can also enter via email, so that&#039;s why their answers don&#039;t show up here - sorry :( They are always randomly selected though so everyone gets a fair shot at winning.]]></description>

J. Money, I wanted to see what the winners were going to do with the stickers but I don&#039;t see them on here. Was there another way to enter the drawing besides writing in the comments?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would put stickers on my water bottle, that I carry around almost everywhere, and then the rest on my laptop. Hopefully, could use as a conversation starter as well as to be held accountable. 

I would give the second set to my sister. One, to give us another thing to bond over LOL, but also because she is just now in her 20s and I hope she would be reminded to make the best financial decisions for herself!]]></description>
