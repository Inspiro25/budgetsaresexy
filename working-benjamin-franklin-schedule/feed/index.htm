Dang, yeah - looks like that original article is now offline. I just updated the post, sorry :(

The juicy part was that screenshot of B. Franklin&#039;s schedule though :)]]></description>

That&#039;s great...good for you.  I consider myself a night person, too and am not sure that I can do it everyday.  But, I think I am going to try and do it on my own, without the help of the dogs.  Today has been really productive, I have unloaded so many wonderful things that other people can&#039;t seem to live without (AKA...my crap) and made a haul ($102) and son, Kash Jr. ($19).  Also, found .29 at the parking lot where I meet people, so $102.29.  It&#039;s really rare to find change anymore....most people don&#039;t have any cash.  So, that was cool.]]></description>

Holy crap! Haha...

YES. No doubt in my mind I&#039;ll keep it up. In a strange way, 5 am now actually EXCITES me. Like, I actually get happy the second I hear it which is one of the craziest things out of this experiment haha... I consider myself a night person!]]></description>

Interestingly enough, I&#039;m SOOOO drained by the end of the day that I could care less about TV or even working for that matter. Which I actually love, since work is constantly on the mind when you&#039;re self-employed and ONLINE for that matter. The internet never sleeps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok...been up early the last two days...4:30-5am.  I&#039;ll be honest, it wasn&#039;t planned...the dogs keep getting me up.  But it truly is amazing how peaceful it is.  I got some extra reading in, took your drawer challenge, did some work on the budget, took pics of junk to unload, put them on yard sale site and made $47 by 7:30.  Woohoo.  Maybe I should do this everyday.  Do you think you&#039;ll keep it up?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm, no room in this lifestyle for TV!!  I wonder how many folks just can&#039;t/won&#039;t do something like this because they are too plugged into their TV entertainment.  Now that&#039;s a waste of time!!]]></description>
