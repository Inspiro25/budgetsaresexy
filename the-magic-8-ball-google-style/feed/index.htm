					<description><![CDATA[Oh geez. I can only imagine what you&#039;d get with the porn references.

And I&#039;m a movie critic in one of my categories. One can perhaps only imagine what kind of searches I get XD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Rainy-Day Saver&lt;/b&gt; - grammar police grand canyon - hahahahhaaah....what on earth?  I bet they meant to delete have of that before hitting submit. if not, we better watch out! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Young Mogul&lt;/b&gt; - glad you liked, yeah i&#039;ll try and do them more consistently.  def. fun for me!
@&lt;b&gt;Favor&lt;/b&gt; - You owe me a beer :)
@&lt;b&gt;Peter&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for being awesome!
@&lt;b&gt;James&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll have to click the link there and check it out...pretty cool - it will tell you where you fit in with your age group, and then also with the amount of money you earn - this way you can get closer to the variables.  It&#039;s not an exact science, but it gives you a nice idea of how your net worth is matching up.
@&lt;b&gt;MyFinancialObjectives&lt;/b&gt; - haha, you&#039;re not alone my friend!  i&#039;m trying to do my best to disregard them all, but it&#039;s just too damn interesting :)
@&lt;b&gt;simple in france&lt;/b&gt; - hey, you are supposed to share these weirdo responses with us ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Keith @ LifeTuner&lt;/b&gt; - haha, I guess your SEO people are better at it than we are...our searches give us laughs, but yours bring in the profit!  boring seems to bring in more revenue from what I&#039;ve noticed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hah this is such a cool idea!  not only were those interesting questions, but it was also interesting to see what people googled to get here.  I spend a lot of time analyzing my stats, so maybe that&#039;s why I thought it was cool.  Nevertheless, cool post!]]></description>
