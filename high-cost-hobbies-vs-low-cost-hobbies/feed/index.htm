					<description><![CDATA[A slightly tangential topic could be the concept of owning hobby stuff vs. renting your fun. I am a huge advocate of renting vs. owning (in regards to entertainment). A dollar goes much further this way. Sure, there are some hobbies that require the ownership of certain things but almost always there are places that will rent the experience for a nominal fee. some examples:

1. Owning a vacation home is nice but renting a vacation experience does not tie you down to a particular location. (trust me on this one, after the fun wanes, it can become a burden to go to your vacation spot. gotta mow the lawn, gotta repair the roof, etc. the vacation becomes more of a maintenance exercise)

2. Owning a boat makes sense if you live on a body of water. If you, like most of us, do not it could be much more cost effective to rent. Not needing to winterize, tow, store, register and the hundred other things boats require is worth it. Just like the vacation property, an owned boat starts to feel like a second job over time.

I have rented vacation homes all over the world, speedboats, houseboats and pontoon boats. Sometimes being a &#039;hand&#039; on a headboat is fun as well if you like deep sea fishing.

I also own a (soon to be sold) rental house in N.C at the beach and recently donated a 25&#039; sailboat to the boyscouts (seascouts). I&#039;ll never go back.

The point is, think about how many times over the course  of a year you will actually engage in an activity or hobby (and where you want to do it) and determine if owning and maintaining the stuff you need to do it is worth it. Where I live, most boats sit under a tarp 6 months out of the year but alas, the payments are required for all 12. This could apply to golf, skiiing and scuba as well as movies and videogames. I think Gamefly will rent a game for relatively cheap. 

Another quick example. I have found, believe it or not, that flying to Vail for a ski trip and renting the skis/snowboard is a more cost effective experience than owning and going local (Here in the Northern Virginia area) and about 1,000 times more fun than skidding around on man-made ice sheets. I don&#039;t go that often but when I do, I want it to be memorable.

					<description><![CDATA[You played professionally? That is awesome man!  Did you ever catch my guest post by my prof. online player last year?  Here&#039;s the link - maybe you know him?

Least expensive: watching movies and blogging.  yeah, def. blogging.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My high-cost hobby is martial arts.

I will point out, though, that hobbies can also be an important networking tool.  For example, I try to make a point to join the guys for lunch at least once a month.  It&#039;s an opportunity to talk off-the-clock, build connections, and even build a career.  Golf, from what I understand, can do many of those things.

And yet, I&#039;m not a golfer.  Le sigh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Roberta I knew I could count on you to defend golf as a &quot;potential&quot; low-cost hobby.  At my age, though, I still think it&#039;s very hard to call it low cost.  Victoria and I have not put in the money to buy a decent set of clubs (I have a $130 set!) and she doesn&#039;t even have a set yet!  One day we will play regularly tho!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice article.

I have always made the distinction between &#039;caviar&#039; hobbies and &#039;paper plate&#039; hobbies. I enjoy both but not for the reasons I once thought. I have friends I go fishing with and friends I golf with. I enjoy the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center (looking forward to Beethoven- Symphony No. 9 this fall) as well as the tractor pull at the county fair. Different crowd, different friends but both are immensely entertaining. The Symphony tickets for the whole family are just marginally more expensive than a 3D movie and a thousand times more memorable. The County fair was quite expensive because of my kids affinity for funnel cake and cotton candy (adds up!) 

I agree with Roberta Nyquist&#039;s post. There are almost always a way to do what you enjoy on the cheap. When looking for Hobby accoutrements, craigslist is your friend. (it&#039;s not used... it&#039;s thoroughly tested.)

					<description><![CDATA[Golfing is one of my most favorite activities and it doesn&#039;t have to be expensive. No, it isn&#039;t as cheap as getting books from the library, but there are ways to indulge in golf at a pretty reasonable price. The initial cost of the clubs can be expensive, kind of like the snowboarding. Plus, a person needs to keep a supply of golf balls, which can be expensive depending upon which ones you purchase. Or, you can find them on the golf course, like my husband does. He has found enough golf balls to supply both of us for years! There are a few discount books that I purchase which give &quot;buy one-get one free&quot; discounts (like the American Cancer Society discount book - $25 and the money goes to a charity), which really make the game reasonable on a budget. Look for on-line discounts or in the newspaper, and golf during non-primetime, like late afternoons/early evening. Golf at the smaller golf courses outside of metropolitan areas, especially when you are just beginning to learn the game. They generally are far cheaper, less congested, and are generally easier to navigate, which also builds confidence. In fact, a person can get a season membership at these courses generally for a reasonable price. Get a part time job on the weekends at your favorite course. Most courses offer free or drastically reduced greens fees just for working a few hours a week. Not only will you get free/cheap golf, you will be adding to your bottom line and increasing your budget. My philosophy is that if there is a will, there is a way. You just won&#039;t be golfing the TPC.]]></description>
