I send monthly debt reports to my wife - what we call a &quot;debt snapshot.&quot; It contains a copy of the debt tab and the net worth over time tab of my money spreadsheet.

I also have my Mint account - which is linked to all of our spending accounts - send alert emails to her email in addition to mine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great story, Eric...

...somethings are well worth spending money on. 

As someone who has ridden buses in Ecuador with your girlfriend, I can say you definitely made the right call. :)]]></description>

Haha yup... Malls were THE THING back then! Probably still are if you&#039;re a teenager :) There&#039;s only so much hanging out you can do online until you actually need to see someone in person (where you can then get back online and share all about how you&#039;re now hanging out at the mall - hah!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved the story.

I knew I had found the one when I went Ice Skating with my now wife for our first real date in college.  We needed to get some water afterwards, so instead of me stopping at the convenience store for the long drive home, I went into the grocery store and walked out with a 1 gal jug that cost $0.30.  I was pretty proud of my find and she appreciated it.   She also proceeded to tell me how much she hated the mall, which &quot;going to the mall&quot; was still a thing in the year 2000 (cue Conan O&#039;Brian music)]]></description>
