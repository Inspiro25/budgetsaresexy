Blaine,

You got it.  Most pooper scoopers only offer service for front or back yard. Most people only let their dogs use the back yard so there should be very little clean up in the front.   The idea is to differentiate yourself from the competition and provide a little added value.  I try to add value by doing little things that go a long way; free front yard clean up, additional pet related services, and very good communication.  It pays off and keeps the person who tries to take away your business for a few dollars less from succeeding.]]></description>

That&#039;s a great tagline.  Might need to keep that in mind.  When I was first starting out I would randomly take pictures of strange poops in customers yards and share them with our notification email... &quot;Your yard has been scooped.  What has your dog been eating? (insert picture) Humor does go a long way in the poop business.]]></description>

I was shocked as well Brian.  I never had a problem with picking up my yard but I&#039;m thrilled that other people dislike it enough to pay me to do it for them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing. I actually really like this idea. One thing I didn’t understand. The pro tip. ?

Pro-Tip: Offer free front yard scooping with every scoop. Doesn’t take long, adds value and separates you from the competition!

Does this mean charge for back yard only and then do front yard free? I guess there is usually not much poop in the front yard. Ok, I might have just explained it to myself. Lol. 
Great side hustle idea!
Thanks]]></description>

Interesting!! 

I didn&#039;t even know people *didn&#039;t* clean up their dogs poop and instead hired people, haha.... But hey - I guess they&#039;re adding to the economy and hustlers like us! :)]]></description>
