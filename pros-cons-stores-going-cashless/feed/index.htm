					<description><![CDATA[Maybe in large cities cashless is reasonable, but in my very rural part of Canada, cash is still very much a part of everyday life. For me, the options for internet at home are expensive satellite service or expensive phone data plans.

					<description><![CDATA[Pardon me for saying so but, I find America years behind other Western nations. You will never need cash in many of them and it is almost obsolete in some already. We have a local panhandler with an app on his phone to receive donations, because no one is carrying cash anymore.  Used smartphones are cheap and free wifi signals are quite common.

					<description><![CDATA[J, we run a Retail/Experiential venue in Los Angeles and we have gone completely cashless. For the first week we were open, we took cash but the % of sales were 8-12% cash transactions. It took hours a day to count drawers in and out and make sure procedures were in place for breaks, etc. We went cashless 3 weeks ago and have never looked back. We accept all major cc/debit/apple pay. We have not had any push back on this decision from employees or customers.]]></description>
