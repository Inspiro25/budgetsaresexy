					<description><![CDATA[Firearms are a good investment if you&#039;re interested in investing in a hobby of shooting. There&#039;s many clubs out there to help people get started. IF you&#039;re investing in them for personal protection, there&#039;s so many variables (like crime rates, the liklihood of your home/apt being broke into, your ability to shoot well under pressure), but ultimately if it&#039;s buying a gun vs losing your life, yes. A very good investment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually know a fellow who has a room full of antique firearms, along with other old military stuff, like World War I and older. Whether it&#039;s a good investment or whether he&#039;s just a nut, I&#039;m not so sure. :-)

That&#039;s the first thing I thought of, but then it occurred to me, were they wondering if firearms were a good investment, meaning, is it a good industry to buy stocks in?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This came in on mine two days ago: &#039;Can a mouse eat a tree?&#039;
It linked them to my story about my Christmas tree soiled in mouse pee.  I hope I was of some help.

Here was todays: &#039;sexy nakid red heads&#039;
Although I am a redhead (and I think I&#039;m pretty damn sexy) I don&#039;t think I have any stories about being &#039;nakid&#039;!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Kellen,

That statistic was from a very bad study. No statistically significant results.

@J, I&#039;m not an &lt;i&gt;avid&lt;/i&gt; collector, but I have connections.   Gimme a shout and I can probably hook you up with someone who can meet your needs.  :)]]></description>
