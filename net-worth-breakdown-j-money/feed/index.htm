(a month later, I know) Honestly, I wasn&#039;t even trying to time it. I just realized I had some money and I should do something with it. It was in the summer of 2008, sometime in August. I picked a very one aggressive fund and one conservative fund and split my money between the two.

Then September rolled around and the whole financial system collapsed. Great job Eric... Luckily they each did what they were supposed to do, the aggressive fund dropped like a rock and the conservative fund went down but held it&#039;s own. As the market kept dropping, I kept moving funds from the conservative fund into the aggressive fund. Did it several times until....I had no money left in the conservative fund and my aggressive fund was worth half of what I started with.

Fortunately there was a bounce some time later, don&#039;t remember when and my value shot up since I was 100% in on the aggressive fund. I sold everything when I broke even finally... and subsequently missed out on the biggest bull market ever. Great job again Eric..

Fortunately real estate far outperformed the market so I would have missed out on that if I had been all in on the market.. 

Interesting ride to say the least.]]></description>

Nope - I&#039;m done trying to time the market. Even if you know when to get out you never know when to get back in again to recoup the losses. I&#039;m in it for the long haul so even if a bigger crash IS looming in the future, it&#039;ll just mean more opportunity to scoop up everything on sale while waiting for it to go back up again! As long as you believe the markets solid for the long term I don&#039;t ever suggest cashing out and back in again... If you believe it&#039;s all going to crap and the markets are failing, then by all means - do what you have to do :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should move your entire stock portfolio to cash, this last rally is a typical dead cat bounce in a bear market. The strongest rallies to the upside always occur in bear markets. You are celebrating something that will disappear soon. The crash coming withing the next year will be much worse than the 2008 crash, that was just a warm up!]]></description>
