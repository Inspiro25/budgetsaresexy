@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, SO. TRUE.  And tougher to sneak work in when your family (and wife) is telling you to quit it :)  Nate called me 13.2 times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[*sigh* I haven&#039;t been to the outlets in Delaware in more than 10 years!  Which is kind of sad since I just live in NJ and it&#039;s not even that far away. ;-)

Glad you had fun!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back, J$ and good to have you back (although the guest posts were good). I am on sort of vacation as well - though writing is being done and some othert stuff arranged. Apart from that I managed to get myself in hospital and have a needed surgery - went well and am recoverying at home (our other home on the Balkans). Still not entirely up to par but getting there. So, exciting but not in the right way may be!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, well tell them I love &#039;em for it!  And that they should give it a shot themselves - even if just for a weekend ;)  It really is fun - if you can get away with it.  I&#039;m glad you got a chance to visit the family!  It&#039;s nice once you&#039;re ON vacation, but kinda stressful leading up to it.  I&#039;m trying to keep my vacation mindset though and see if I can translate it into a daily schedule... so far, it&#039;s not working ;)
@&lt;b&gt;ShoeGal&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, have fun wherever you&#039;re going! Is it wrong that I feel jealous? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  Totally get him one!!! :)  It&#039;s awesome.  I don&#039;t have a clue as to which detectors are better, or not, actually myself - but I CAN say that I&#039;ve used cheap to medium quality ones (based on price, at least) and most of them work just fine and are similar.  You def. don&#039;t need a top of the line one to get going.  I&#039;d look for a used one in the $100 range.  Maybe $50 as lowest, and $200 max depending on your budget.  But either way, you don&#039;t need a top of the line brand new one :)  (and very interesting about that bottled water article - only skimmed it, but will go back to read later. Thanks!)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Jeez, and I thought I was bad! 99 hours is no joke, for real.  Tell him to man up and take you somewhere! :)  Even 1 night away at a bed and breakfast or something - those are the best.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Yeah, you are gonna have a helluva good time - Italy rocks.  And so do many places outside the U.S., so enjoy it all my friend!
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Go go go!!  Even if it&#039;s just a road trip for 2-3 days somewhere close and relaxing :)  I got your back!
@&lt;b&gt;Rafiki&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that may be true, but if I don&#039;t get used to not having Mr. Workaholic around, I&#039;m gonna have no time for myself anymore and eventually lose out in life.  I&#039;m sure I can find a happy medium though if I try hard enough :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kody @ Financial Money Tips&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, I totally understand that feeling.  As long as you don&#039;t wait TOO long to take a break, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine :)  Hard work def. needs rewarding though, so don&#039;t forget!  It sucks stopping work for a bit, but our bodies need it sometimes... and our minds.  It&#039;s amazing how much MORE work you can get done - especially creative work - once you get back from a vacay.  You turn into a SUPER you! Haha... thanks for stopping by, my friend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back and it seems like you had an awesome vacation. The metal detecting seems like fun, not a good side hustle but fun none the less. Seems your vacation was awesome though. I also doubt you could live without Mr. Workaholic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back, J. Money! Sounds like you had an awesome trip. I totally know what you mean about just falling into the habit of working, working, working and never stopping. Except for a few days at the cottage and a long weekend to visit my sister, I haven&#039;t really taken a vacation in well over a year, and it&#039;s starting to show! I think I&#039;m getting stir crazy. Must go somewhere!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a fun vacay!  I have been begging my husband to take me any where over the last month.  Only because I was working 11 hour days all so I could take two weeks off for surgery.  The week before surgery I ended up working 99 hours straight!  I figured making up the time before surgery would be way easier than after, but damn 99 hours sucked!  Maybe I can get my surgeon to send me to a spa for the healing properties.]]></description>
