					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I wish I would have read this before today!!  But you are spot on, this 10-2 or 10-5, whatever a person picks,  JUST PICK. Thats the key. Thank you sooooo much. This might just get me out of my funk, while getting a major goal accomplished. I mean, two (2) years is going to go by anyways, might as well accomplish something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, this 10 minutes for 2 years idea is such a great challenge. It reminds of something I read once. Don&#039;t be deterred by time. It passes anyway. In other words, 2 years sounds like forever but before you know it, it will pass so you might as well accomplish your big goal. Your reward grows with your effort.]]></description>

yup! very inline with those books!

fantastic idea with those Sunday blocks set aside like that... makes Mondays a lot less scary I bet too haha...  Also doesn&#039;t allow you to procrastinate that long as the most you&#039;d have is 6 days until it&#039;s Sunday again! ;)

(I actually really enjoy Mondays btw because I take the weekends off from working out and all work/projects in general, so Mondays I get to jump back in and get productive again! which is a lot easier to do too when the kids are back in school ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad you put out examples, because I was thinking what should I be working on?? Thankfully I do many of the things you listed as a daily thing (organizing, working out, reading, checking on finances, etc) but I also use every Sunday between 9-12 to make my life easier for the week, whether it&#039;s drafting emails to  potential clients (or city council regarding things we need done) or bike maintenance. What else is there to do on a Sunday between working out and lunch?? 

Thanks for sharing this, 10 minutes is easy and it&#039;s so true the years will pass anyway. Kind of reminds of that book Tiny Habits or Power of Habit]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are so hilarious. I always LOL my way through your blog entries. Love it! 

This advice is dead on and much needed. I will begin this challenge today. Writing a book I&#039;ve been putting off. Thank you, J-Money!]]></description>
