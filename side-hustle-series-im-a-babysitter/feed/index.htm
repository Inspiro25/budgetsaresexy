					<description><![CDATA[I still babysit now and then. A few years ago I did it more often because it was like getting paid to study: I&#039;d put the kids to bed at 7:30 or 8 p.m. and then do course reading or my Spanish homework. Here in Seattle I&#039;ve been paid $10 to $12 an hour. 
I used to tell parents I was the best babysitter EVER because I drove myself there and back, I didn&#039;t turn on the television, I read stories and played games, I straightened up the living room and kitchen after they were in bed, and I never called boys (not even once).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for giving us the inside scoop ME!  Totally had flashbacks being a babysitter myself... back when I lived in Korea.  and I had to take cabs everywhere not understanding the language! (and for some reason my cabbies ALWAYS fell asleep at the stop lights... so freaky).

@Clare - glad you enjoy them :)  More to come!]]></description>
