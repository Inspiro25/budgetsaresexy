yeah, I don&#039;t think bonds are actually FDIC&#039;d anywhere though... 

(just googled: &quot;The FDIC covers the traditional types of bank deposit accounts – including checking and savings accounts, money market deposit accounts (MMDAs), and certificates of deposit (CDs)&quot; // https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/faq.html )]]></description>

It really does seem like a great place for it, so long as you don&#039;t mind having extra accounts around :) (I&#039;m so minimalist now I can&#039;t bring myself to do it haha...)]]></description>

Excellent use for them!! I&#039;ve been saying for years that someone needs to DUMB DOWN phones again for those who don&#039;t want to (or can&#039;t) use all the fancy ones these days, and glad it was Republic Wireless who came through :) Not surprisingly either!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WorthyBonds initially sounds fishy, but I guess they&#039;re legit. Not FDIC insured, but instead SEC. They got a link to their SEC filings at the bottom of their webpage (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1699834).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Worthy thing sounds very intriguing. Tempted to plop some of my emergency fund in there since I can get double the interest rate I&#039;m getting at CIT Bank. I&#039;ll definitely do a little more research on it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Relay is great! I have been a Republic Wireless member for years and got the Relay recently for my grandparents to use since they could not handle a complicated cell phone. Now we can keep track of where they go and if they need something it is easy for them to contact us.]]></description>

Ahhh great catch! Haha... It does sound badly worded like that, doesn&#039;t it??! 

Just updated the post to clarify it more - thank you :) And to answer your question, I do not know how it compares to others, but similar to any other apps that cost money every month (Digit, Acorns, etc), my feeling is that if it gets you to START INVESTING it&#039;s 1,000% better than not doing anything at all. And for less than the cost of a coffee I&#039;d say that&#039;s a bargain :)]]></description>
