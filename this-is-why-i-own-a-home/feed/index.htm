We actually did look for something more &#039;compound&#039;- like. =) In our metro area, zoning restrictions are pretty strict when it comes to &#039;accessory dwelling units&#039;, so we would have had to purchase commercial real estate to find something like that, or else move into a rural or unincorporated area. Even for the house we bought, with a built-in &#039;multigenerational living&#039; suite, there are alot of rules around what we can add, and what would make it a &#039;multifamily dwelling&#039; which isn&#039;t allowed in our area. Like, my mom&#039;s suite can&#039;t have a private entrance. I don&#039;t get why there aren&#039;t more regulatory carve-outs for intergenerational families and their living arrangements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh, your house is GORGEOUS now!! I love it.  We own our house and I do prefer owning for many of the same reasons you listed.

Hi D, I do remember 2008 and 2009.  I lived though that and it taught me to be a risk manager.  I think that the best way to learn is to experience.  I am glad that I had the experience and I did not lose my shirt during the last down turn.

It depends on the area that you live in.  I was fortunate enough to live in an area that saw real estate more than doubled since 2007, the year that I bought my first house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your home is beautiful, but I value using my time for other endeavors. The ability to let the problem belong to the landlord and not worry is important for my stress-level. 

I was also raised a military brat, and don&#039;t see the value in roots. None of the kids who had lived on the same block their whole lives had the curiosity, resilience, or easy ability to fit in that folks who moved frequently did.]]></description>

I have a solution for you...  buy a compound.  That way your parents can be in a smaller out building, you can have the main house and the third building (have to have 3 buildings to be a compound IMO) can be used to run your internet empire.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[During my married years I/we owned a condo, a trailer and a house. Now I am divorced and own nothing. However, my midlife-fairy-tale-romance fellow owns a house that&#039;s paid for. He loves, loves, LOVES not having a house payment. 

Maintenance is, indeed, a bear. But he&#039;s handy and I&#039;m sorta handy, so we can find our way through most problems without opening our wallets too wide. In fact, we&#039;re about to embark on a small deck-building project. Since it&#039;s for utility (i.e., how to get out the back door and into the yard) rather than for glamor and backyard entertaining, we&#039;re talking an extremely basic platform set on pier blocks. It will still cost a lot because (a) wood is expensive and (b) everything in Alaska is expensive. But we&#039;re frugal-hacking it by cashing in for Home Depot cards from several rewards programs, hitting the Habitat ReStore for odds and ends and, yes, doing the work ourselves rather than paying the $2,000 to $2,500 price quoted by several professional handymen who eyeballed the plans.

Here in Anchorage, once you hit age 65 the first $150,000 of appraised value is not considered in terms of property tax assessment. So I tell my partner (who turned 65 last year) that the taxes he ISN&#039;T paying will cover the rest of the cost of the deck. Which is good, because the washer and dryer are at least 18 years old and could go on strike any day. Maintenance: Feh!]]></description>

I looooove the idea of having my parents live with us one day! My mom is totally on board with it (we&#039;d have to go back to owning in this case, but it would be worth it), however my dad is not so hot on the idea... something about wanting to enjoy his retirement on his own terms and not being shacked up with little kids, pssh... :)]]></description>
