					<description><![CDATA[J, have you thought about using password phrases as a trigger? Make your passwords a goal you want to accomplish so every time you log into your laptop, download an app, etc. you&#039;re reminded of a different goal you have set for yourself.

					<description><![CDATA[Love the post, J! I&#039;m a huge fan of visual cues (or physical triggers as you call them). They have been so powerful in my life. I loved reading the comments, too, because your readers offered some super creative ideas for making them...the paper chain is cool and your painting is AWESOME! 

Thanks for sharing my coasters and reminding me to drink more H2O :)

Cheers,
Ree]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great reminder.  I recently started using the Lift app on my phone and that has worked pretty well.  I figure the phone is one thing we ALWAYS have on us so why not get reminders to do the things we should be doing.  Love the debt links idea as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this! I also need to stay more hydrated. Seems like I&#039;m living off of coffee and wine. :) For me, I want to make my debt payoff process more visual, so I think I might implement those chains and a calendar. For me, I have my vitamins in the kitchen. I see them, I remember to take them. I also have post-its, sticky notes, and reminders. I&#039;ve recently started timing my posts and how long I work on things to keep everything on track.]]></description>
