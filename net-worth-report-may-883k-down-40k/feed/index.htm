No website and paper??! That is pretty bad! Haha...

But none of it matters in 2 more years!! That&#039;s a damn good goal to have before pulling the trigger on FI. Super inspiring :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to add a comment about &quot;...we’ll be keeping the *value* of our house the same as our purchase price in our net worth reports since that’s literally the market value of it right now ;)&quot; 

I keep mine at the purchase price, minus 7% to cover commission and closing costs.  I figure that is a better representation of what I&#039;ll get out of it when I sell.

I&#039;m currently on 15yr mortgage, and am now aggressively paying it down.  The goal will be to pay it off in the next 2 years, for ~4 years total.  My FI number is a bit fuzzy with my kids heading to college, but I want to be free of the mortgage to reduce sequence of return risk, and improve cash flow in case I do cut back working after the payoff.  

I&#039;m still investing in 401ks, but post-tax investment money is going to the mortgage for these two years.  In that timeframe mortgage vs investing seems like a wash, since this isn&#039;t the long term horizons that allow the market time smooth out ups/downs.  

Hopefully your new servicer is good.  I&#039;ve had terrible ones in the past (including one with no website, and paper statements every month.  Ugh).  Mine just switched to Chase, which is much nicer than the last.   A principal only payment is very straight forward on the website.]]></description>

Nice!! I 2nd that strategy too because the more you&#039;re *excited* about something the more motivated you stay! Whether it&#039;s house or savings or a combo of the two and anything else... As long as it moves the needle forward somehow you really can&#039;t go wrong :)

Thinking hard on that 10%/year goal now too - I really like that challenge :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good luck with the aggressive mortgage payoff -- you can do it! I&#039;ve set a rough goal of 10% of our purchase price per year. It took us 2 years to save a 20% down payment, so 10%/year. We&#039;ve lived in this house for almost 3 years and are on track to hit 50% equity at the end of the summer. As the interest keeps going down, more and more is funneling into the principal. I&#039;m so pumped! This is for sure stretching me a bit, but I go back and forth between mortgage payoff and non-mortgage savings goals (in case of baby fund, etc.). This jumping back and forth makes me feel like I&#039;m making progress all around and I don&#039;t get burnt out over-focusing on one goal.]]></description>

Nice!!! You&#039;ll get to celebrate all over again then once you cross back over :)

We have met one of our neighbors and he seems super cool so far... also with kids too, so hopefully that means some good playmates for mine!]]></description>
