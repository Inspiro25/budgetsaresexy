					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re absolutely killing our &quot;good debt&quot; thanks to my research and tweaking and we will have it paid off in 6 years total (2 to go still). Also, we live in Australia... The &quot;median house price&quot; around here is a cool $500,000 or so and that&#039;s the type of house we bought too. If you&#039;re interested swing by the site one time, I guarantee you&#039;ll learn a thing or two. We even have an incredibly sexy mortgage planning spreadsheet budget! ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just received our statement and we paid $6,331.10 in interest. It consoles me to see that our beginning balance for 2012 was $211,611.40 and our ending balance for 2012 was $88,987.77. We paid $122,623.63! Our mortgage payment is $1770.79 and $1,500.00 of it is going towards the actual principal now. I&#039;m so happy to have decided to kick a$s on the mortgage this past year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha -- wow, an eye-opening reminder on how much one truly pays to own a home!  I will be in the market for a house over the next couple of years, and will remember this post when calculating my payments :)

As a renter with no student loan debt and someone who pays off my credit card in full every month, I&#039;m not sure I paid any interest at all last year ... but that will be sure to change in the next couple of years!]]></description>
