					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, me too Alexis!  I&#039;ve actually brought that up in the past with them but I&#039;ll be sure to give them a 2nd dose of it ;)

@Samurai  - Oh yeah dude, they treated us like VIP out there!  Just how you&#039;d expect from USAA ;)  We were the first group to try this conference out but I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;ll be doing a lot of this kinda stuff down the road.  I&#039;ll let them know you&#039;re interested as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s cool man!  Did they pay for ur flight and hotel?  I&#039;ve been a member for 16 yrs, and my parents for 30+ yrs now.

Can you ask your rep to drop me an email?  I love USAA and do plenty of business with them.

Thnx!]]></description>
