					<description><![CDATA[Important to know when to take the foot off the accelerator. We have to learn to listen to what *feels* right.

P.S. love the emphasis on giving back :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friend does jigsaws. She&#039;s currently addicted to the ones that DON&#039;T have the photo of the finished jigsaw on the box, but are of the same scene at night/back or forwards in time/of the point of view of someone looking at the scene on the box from another angle etc.
Sounds way too hard to me!]]></description>

the latter, of course!

i decided a long time ago to just write about whatever&#039;s bubbling on my mind, and then whatever type of audience that brings is the right audience for me :) not as good for &quot;business&quot; probably, but much more fun and authentic &#128077;

(and i miss your blog posts man, they were great!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; Mainly because I don’t think about money as much now that things are on track, but also because I continue to treat it as a “job” instead of more of a hobby.

I can for sure feel that, even my “job” never really “paid”.  It’s easier to tell when someone’s writing an article because they feel they have to, versus having something inside you just can’t wait to get out.

I haven’t been thinking about money either, which has meant less money blogging.

When you write do you have an audience in mind? Or is it more based on what you think is interesting and being exciting to share (that’s the vibe I’ve always gotten from you)?]]></description>
