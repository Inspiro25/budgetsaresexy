					<description><![CDATA[I beat it three out of four times, and it is fairly easy to beat if barely beating the market is your goal.  I just sold when the market hit 110% the very first time and then bought the first time it dropped to below 110%.  Then I never traded again. Most of the time in a normal market almost any time in history that works, but only if you stop trading for the rest of the game. I only slightly beat the market but I did beat it most of the time.  I also only beat the market by a fraction of a percent, but my goal was just winning.]]></description>

It does seem awfully greedy to hold out for that extra million when you put it that way....  :)]]></description>

I get it!!

And exactly why I dumped all my retirement stuff in the day after that first drop thinking I was so smart, only to then watch it continue to fall, lol....

Always so hard to tell when is the  *best* but I do think generally you&#039;re better just putting it all in and letting it ride since long term it&#039;s all going to be working in your favor... You might just come away with $9,000,000 instead of $10,000,000 ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just like in really life, some people will beat the market and think they are geniuses. They might even do it a couple times in a row!

Once in a while I can win a coin flip. Sometimes I can win twice in a row.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In having to think quickly about what decision to make, I keep messing up and selling when I think there&#039;s a trough instead of a peak. I can&#039;t keep my head on straight!! Buying and holding is definitely easier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m on the flip side....it&#039;s annual bonus time so I&#039;ll have a larger sum of cash on hand soon.  Do I dump it all in at once?  What if the market drops more?  I&#039;ll miss out on even cheaper buys!  Perhaps I&#039;ll split it up and invest 25% over 4 days.  Maybe I should do each 25% weekly.  This could be the beginning of the next big crash and I want to put my cash in at the lowest possible point.  Does that hoarding some now to wait? But what if I wait and then the market jumps back up in a day and I miss it?  Or I dump it in quick so I don&#039;t miss it, but then it repeats a drop, but in double time!   (I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll dump it all in as soon as I get it, but these are my daily thoughts during the anticipation time)]]></description>
