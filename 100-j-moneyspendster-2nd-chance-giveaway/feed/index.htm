					<description><![CDATA[I spend all my money on my girlfriend.  I go to school full time and also work full time but all the money that I do make is wasted on her. We go out to eat constantly and she orders the most expensive thing on the menu. See, I&#039;m fine with that but it is the fact that she only takes two bites out of it and says full.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wasted my last ten dollars on a cab for me and my kids to go to the doctor because it was cold outside. I wish I had walked or caught a ride because I ended up needing to fill a prescription for myself that my insurance didn&#039;t cover and I felt so stupid that I, ironically, was ten dollars short of getting my medicine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG we all waste a crap ton of money ;)  Incredibly interesting how different we are though.  Some people consider fancy cars wastes of money, while others vending machine snacks.  Guess that&#039;s why  we call it &quot;personal&quot; finance, eh?!

&lt;b&gt;*Giveaway Ends Tomorrow!*&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well today I am helping my parents host a garage sale. My husband &#038; I brought a few of our items as well. One of them was a weight bench set that I had really wanted him to use. It was almost brand new &#038; he sold for a ridiculously low price. That could&#039;ve gone to the current moving expenses!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently spent several thousand dollars on dental work. It needed to be done so that is not where the waste was ... the waste is that I didn&#039;t take the time to find dental insurance that would really help me out before I went ahead with the procedures. I wish that I had spent the time rather than the money!!]]></description>
