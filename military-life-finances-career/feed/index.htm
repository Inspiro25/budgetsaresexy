					<description><![CDATA[Was the 20k in debt from credit cards or did you have to pay off things like vehicle notes as well? We are trying to get all of our ducks in a row to enlist. My husband (age 31) and I (age 30) are not the norm either. Enlisting at this age is rare, but we are excited to be a part of the Force! Thanks for this post! Loved it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kalen!!! What a wonderful read! I am so very proud of you and your family. Your accomplishments and knowledge you have gained is truly an inspiration. 
My husband and I have been working the last couple years to pay off our debt so we can then build our &quot;home&quot; We have a beautiful vision of buying land and building a home were our children grow up and were we live more off the land. GO GREEN!! I now know who to turn to for questions or guidance if we have any questions on how to make this happen sooner. 
Thank you for your willingness to share your story. 

Again, so very proud of you and family!

					<description><![CDATA[Great Post!  I was at Lackland AFB too, back in 1978.  Went on to Barksdale AFB.  pay was a bit less then.  Much of my family was in.  Nephew just got out of AF Academy, now is on a scholarship at Walter Reed to be an MD.

People like the military now, back in 78, it wasn&#039;t the case.

Congrats!!!]]></description>

If you want to make it work it will! If you are going the Officer route, you will make quite a bit more pay and housing allowance. The experiences alone are worth it and when you add in the benefits, it&#039;s hard to beat! Good luck with your choice!]]></description>

Thanks! I love me some USAA! It is different depending on the specific situations. I know AF who have been basically screwed in ways like you me mentioned. It&#039;s all in how you look at it, but yeah sometimes it can suck. I know many single Airmen that complain about living in the dorms. At least they are living for free, but it&#039;s no dream home. Thanks for sharing another point of view and thanks for serving.]]></description>
