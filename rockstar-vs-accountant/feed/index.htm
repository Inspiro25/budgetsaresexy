					<description><![CDATA[I miss rockstar Julie sometimes! She was the life of the party and always the person who you could call to have a good time! Now I&#039;m totally the accountant. Great idea about living in the moment and paying in the moment. It&#039;s super smart to not give the rockstar side of you access to credit cards. I think I might use that tip going forward!]]></description>

We once spent $43 on a shot of whiskey. The hubs said it was good. But there were a few times that I found my mind drifting to &quot;What the hell!&quot; over the next 24 hours. It was over our half million net worth celebration weekend. But ignorance is more blissful!]]></description>

We have a place in town that serves caramel rolls the size of my head. But then I need a bread bowl with potato soup to go with it. Then my inner rockstar needs a nap. It&#039;s a slippery carb slope.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes the old carefree college party kid me just wants to break out and live for the moment. It&#039;s difinitely hard to contain him sometimes, as fun as he was, he liked blowing ever dollar at the bar, partying, and taking drunken trips (Vagas, California,Florida, spring break destinations).

Although the old carefree college party kid me, had few expenses, no budget, and zero financial goals. Which is why as I get older its good to keep him locked up, except for one weekend a month, ill let him loose and have fun, haha.]]></description>

GOOD LUCK!!

For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;ve never regretted &quot;experiences&quot; either like this and choose it over $$ almost every time. I think the main variable is *how often* you do experiences like this? If you&#039;re seeing concerts and taking trips every other month, then it&#039;s probably worth curtailing. However if it&#039;s every year/cple of years, then it would be hard to turn it down :)

A 3 month extension in car payments doesn&#039;t sound like the worst thing in the world to me, but it&#039;s you who has to pay the bills so good luck! Haha... Let us know what you end up deciding :)]]></description>

All about the *priorities* with this one. Which do you want more, Rachelle? Nice ride or fat cash cushion? No right answer either way, but one probably speaks to you more than the other :) At the end of the day it&#039;s YOUR life so you gotta do what you gotta do!]]></description>
