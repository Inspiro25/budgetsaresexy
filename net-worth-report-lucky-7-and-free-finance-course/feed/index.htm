					<description><![CDATA[What a nice net worth growth for the month!! Great to see your different strategies paying off, and an inspiration for sure. Also great spot on the pocket watch!! You&#039;ve also inspired me to finish selling my clutter that I&#039;ve been procrastinating on. It all adds up!]]></description>

Ah, no we didn&#039;t get to the hula pie. Actually Dukes was so busy the night we strolled past - we got there at 4.30pm expecting to put our name down and wait a couple hours for a table... But they told us it was so busy they no longer were adding people to the wait list.  Waikiki is PACKED with tourists who have been waiting til covid slowed down to travel.]]></description>

Possibly, J. Let&#039;s see how the first one goes :)  It&#039;s actually a light read, even with length. :)  Then we&#039;ll see what questions come of it from there.]]></description>

I second this request for info on real estate syndications, and I am happy to hear that you are already on it.  If you are concerned about article length, do you think you might prefer doing a real estate syndication &quot;mini-series?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-report-lucky-7-and-free-finance-course/#comment-323413&quot;&gt;Spike&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Spike! Yep, I actually just finished typing a post about real estate syndications, it&#039;ll be published in a couple weeks. (i&#039;m trying to slim it down, it&#039;s 2600 words and barely gets into the good stuff!).  Anyway, this specific $50k was invested into a deal which closed in March, so it&#039;s a new purchase with not many updates yet. It was a *private* offering for a portfolio of residential buildings in Florida. My syndication post will cover how I find both private and public opportunities like this.

No vehicles included because I don&#039;t really consider them to be assets contributing to my investment portfolio. I guess they are technically &quot;assets&quot;, but so is all the furniture in my house, and I wouldn&#039;t include that stuff either.  Everyone does this differently, there&#039;s no right or wrong answer in what to include.

Cheers Spike, have a great weekend!]]></description>
