					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always found that the devil is in the details, tracking your expenses paints a picture with the data points. I&#039;ve been buying the family groceries for years and I figured we were spending at a certain level but the rigorous tracking had dropped off... when I looked again somehow the spending had gone up almost 25%

The basics... know what you spend then spend less than you bring in. 

Great story, thanks for sharing Kylee and J Money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot to Kylee for sharing this! It must have taken a lot of courage for you to write about your loss, but us readers are very grateful that you shared.

In addition to money tips i found it very helpful that you shared tips in how to relate to someone who has lost someone. I find this very challenging, but will be able to now have some idea of what to say. Thanks!]]></description>
