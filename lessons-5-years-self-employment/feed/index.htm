the good thing is that any of us can become millionaires if we let time work its magic (and start early!) :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great! Love that you went about your business for the day as &quot;two-face&quot;. It&#039;s amazing looking back on how your thinking changes over time - even a short 5 years. Looking back on myself, 5 years of change means getting married (which is definitely a psychological change).

Good luck in the future and looking forward to more great posts in the financial independence arena!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I still want to be a millionaire (and I really still want to be stinking rich - minus the stress of getting there and I may be 90 before I even build a decent stash - aka, debt sucks). 

But two things stood out that made me chuckle, as i have similar traits:

Lack of  iPhone, lottery tickets, cable (okay, I still have the iphone)
And now wanting a tiny house. haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$,

Congrats, man! Love the picture. Epic!

I know firsthand how challenging (but also how rewarding) it is to cut it online. We&#039;re making our dreams come true in real-time. It&#039;s pretty awesome. 

Keep it up. Can&#039;t wait to see the picture for the 2020 you. :)

Cheers!]]></description>

Way to only work 20 hours!!! I&#039;m getting closer to it as the years go by, but still pretty far away. At least until we move to a two-income household.]]></description>

Haha yup! And is something most wannabe self-employed people don&#039;t even understand until they go off on their own. I sure as hell didn&#039;t. And I often miss just having 1 boss too! You always have to make so many decisions when you&#039;re on your own.]]></description>
