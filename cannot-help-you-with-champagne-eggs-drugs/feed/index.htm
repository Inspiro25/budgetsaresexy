					<description><![CDATA[Your drug story reminded me of a story of an elderly couple I read in Facebook. the couple bought a shrub from a sale and grew it. Unknowingly, the plant they have been taking care of is a cannabis! They only learned about it when the police authorities told them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J.,

You had me spit on my computer from busting out laughing.  No, I wasn&#039;t a stripper, I only baked crackers.  Seriously, crackers.  It was that boring!  Maybe that is why I was given drugs, because everyone was always bored or something. 

I also get people telling me about the times they did drugs, even if it was last week.  Not sure if I look like someone easy to talk to, or I just look interested in drugs.  hmm, makes me wonder...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That would be an interesting topic to post about, a &quot;druggie&#039;s&quot; budget. Similar to the above, but with some more detail, including retirement plans (you know, retire and move to Columbia, that kinda thing). LoL!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[True story. I used to work at a outsourced call centre which means agents have no assigned seating. You sit at a different station every day. One day I came in for my evening shift and found a piece of paper at my desk with a budget. It looked something like this:

rent 250
food 150
smokes 40
weed 75
bus tickets 40

You can&#039;t really fault the guy as he did make a budget.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Adam Hathaway&lt;/b&gt; - I try and not bring it up if possible, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! How much did it cost you? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - (bah dum ching!)
@&lt;b&gt;Savvy Scot&lt;/b&gt; - You know what&#039;s funny about that? I actually NEVER get stopped at the airport! I think it&#039;s too obvious if they &quot;randomly&quot; search me, so they end up NEVER searching me :) It&#039;s actually kinda awesome. And I make a point to always spike up my hair every single time too, just because of that.
@&lt;b&gt;Pauline&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhh.. yeah, I guess it could have been that too. I never responded back though so I guess we&#039;ll never know! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jackie&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Now THAT would have been more interesting :)
@&lt;b&gt;20&#039;s Finances&lt;/b&gt; - I can&#039;t complain, you paid me top dollar! :) (And nah - I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve seen my pic? Though the druggie ones have always in in person anyways so ofcourse they have...)
@&lt;b&gt;David@SkepticFinance&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that is awesome. You might as well just hook up a deal w/ the REAL dutch diamond guy and start getting paid for all your referrals ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB @ Finanical Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I get quite too when I&#039;m mad and people know right away cuz I&#039;m never that quite! ;) And now you have me guessing about your old side hustle? Hmmm.... stripper? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was given drugs more than once, and from a medical marijuana businesses. Yeah, do I LOOK like I am into drugs.  Not like any of you know what I look like HA!  Maybe at the time I did, because of the side-hussle I was doing. 

Usually, I just get mistaken for being mad, when I am really just arguing and trying to state a side or something I like.  People don&#039;t understand if I a mad, I don&#039;t say anything, because I don&#039;t like my temper to run things.

My favorite is when I am mistaken for someone, but someone the person likes HA!  I have been mistaken for both a person someone doesn&#039;t like and a person someone does like.  I must have a twin somewhere I don&#039;t know about. ;)]]></description>
