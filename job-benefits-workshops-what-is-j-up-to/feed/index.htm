					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/job-benefits-workshops-what-is-j-up-to/#comment-306589&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Matt! I&#039;ll share the healthcare options and stuff soon! It&#039;s tough to talk about, because everyone&#039;s health needs are very different. I am fortunate that I don&#039;t visit the doctor much (knock on wood), so the value for me is all about insuring against big accidents (impossible to predict!). 

Since I was born and raised in Australia, I paid $0 in healthcare costs for the first 22 years of my life! With this privileged upbringing, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever feel satisfied with the healthcare situation in the US. I&#039;m a spoiled brat!  More to come on this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the extenion! 

I would love to hear your take on the healthcare benefits over what you&#039;ve seen in your history. We have the majority of our health care covered in Canada so it would be interesting.]]></description>

Congrats on crushing the 100k mark J! It&#039;s great to follow and benchmark against higher net worths - but keep it mind it all comes down to daily habits and steady contributions.  I&#039;ll share more on the 401k overview shortly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on getting your contract extended and being eligible for benefits!  I&#039;m curious what kinds of questions you asked your 401k administrator, though.  I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;ve been leaving something out in my own 401k analysis.  :-)  J Money&#039;s net worth articles were absolutely my favorite articles, so I would love to see something like that again here.  It was nice to have something to high level benchmark to, even though I am much further down on the dollar amount scale than he was.  It has been amazing to see the curve on my net worth graph begin to take a similar shape as I passed the $100K in investments mark a few years ago. Even though you said you current income is small, that might be helpful to see for those who are earlier in their journey, have more modest incomes, or who have/may be considering basic real estate.]]></description>

I really like the NW updates on your blog Josh. And I like that you go through the extra effort to convert to USD, even though you&#039;re in the UK. Keep it up mate. Have a great weekend!]]></description>

Thanks DGuy! I can imagine insurance is at the top of the list given your health surprises in the past. Reading your stories is helpful and inspires me to be better about health insurance. Cheers!]]></description>

Cheers Beau.  Insurance is just a part of life. We&#039;ll figure it out one way or another!  Yep I&#039;m excited to start thinking about 401k options. Will be sharing for sure! Have a good weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on renewing the contract!
You are doing a great job and making no attempts to imitate J Money, which I love.  You are blogging as your own person. 

Great that you will be beginning to share partial net worth update and things like that. On my blog they are my most read posts and I think they are what a lot of people check out FIRE blogs to actually see. Nothing wrong with keeping a few things private!

Best wishes!
Josh]]></description>
