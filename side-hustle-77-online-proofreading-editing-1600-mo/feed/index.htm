I think anything you can do to learn more would be beneficial - whether it&#039;s a paid course or just practicing a little every day :) maybe you can start by reviewing all your friends&#039; facebook posts, haha...]]></description>

Agreed. It really isn’t as easy as it sounds sometimes. Glad it made you interested in the possibility at least.]]></description>

Very true, most bloggers don&#039;t have the means to afford proofing. Most of my work ends up being with companies or content creators that have A LOT of material to put out. I really enjoy blogs though, so I started there hoping it could work. Luckily for me, it did. 

And great advice about adapting proofing styles. There is definitely a change in style depending on the client. Glad the photography side hustle is working out well for you!]]></description>

Sounds like an interesting way to make a living. Must have been difficult at times because we all know how ridiculous the handwriting of some doctors can be. Luckily, I&#039;ve been able to keep my side hustle going by being annoying and correcting grammar, but I at least try to keep it to emails instead of comments.

J, do I need to go back 10 years into the archive and start working my up?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this was the first in the side hustle series where my ears (or eyes?) perked up when I saw it, as it&#039;s something I could actually see myself doing. That being said, having been an editor, I can appreciate that it isn&#039;t easy money, and I doubt I&#039;d have the time to devote to it. I&#039;ve found it to be a highly undervalued skill. It&#039;s one of those things like writing that many people think they can do, but they can&#039;t (at least well).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, two new side hustle posts in a week&#039;s time! Christmas come early! haha 

Love it. I&#039;ve done some proofing and paid for some as well. I can see why a lot of bloggers said no though. It&#039;s an expense that doesn&#039;t necessarily generate ROI. People expect a touch of grammar and spelling issues on blogs and are generally forgiving - but someone seeking a professional service would be less so. 

Learning to adapt proofing styles is key. I did some freelance work for a college friend of mine who started a web design service - he paid me well and I could do it kind of whenever as long as I got it done by a particular date. But I learned quickly editing for business clients is different than newspaper editing - one has to use a lot of diplomacy and also really understand the audience. The first site I worked on had a lot of jargon and it was crucial to know if their potential clients understood/expected the jargon or not. Eventually my friend got a pretty sweet university gig so shut down the business but it was nice work while it lasted. 

Proofing/copyediting can be a great side hustle. Still not as good as my photography side hustle but so far it&#039;s second place in the rate I&#039;ve earned.]]></description>

Haha...

You would not have liked this blog a decade ago when I first got started. Every other sentence had at least two errors in it and I refused to use capitalization for some reason :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a great writer by any means, but my job for 32+ years was a medical transcriptionist.  I made doctor speak into something another medical professional could understand. My personal pet peeve is lose/loose.  It drives me nuts, but I say nothing because I find people who correct people&#039;s grammar and spelling on line are annoying, but I do cringe!]]></description>
