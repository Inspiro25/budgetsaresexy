That&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking too :) Just not sure if I can be totally cool with such a low hourly wage?? Would be an interesting experiment at the very least... maybe I could do it at Xmas or something when it&#039;s on a temporary basis?]]></description>

That&#039;s funny - you&#039;re the second person to tell me within 24 hours to think about public speaking :) I do think I&#039;d actually be good at it, but it&#039;s just the farthest thing I really want to do to be honest... partially out of the anonymous thing, but more so that it just doesn&#039;t sound interesting to me, haha... I guess I prefer typing things out :)]]></description>

Oh man, I hear ya. Don&#039;t know all your details so can&#039;t guess as to what type of money you&#039;d need to leave your home, but I&#039;d def. run the numbers and figure it out before trying so ;) It&#039;s great your expenses are already covered! That&#039;s usually the hardest part.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/self-employed-with-ants-in-my-pants/#comment-124175&quot;&gt;Done by Forty&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks! Glad you found the article refreshing :) All I usually hear/read myself is all the awesome benefits of working for yourself and/or at home, and it&#039;s not always everything people seem. Though I do think people have to experience it for themselves to see if it fits them or not - I would have never thought I&#039;d be considering a 9-5 again, but time and situations change! Always gotta be paying attention to what makes you happy and not over the years and work on adjusting. Even when it&#039;s annoying, haha...]]></description>

Yeah, it would be pretty interesting to see how/if I could adapt to a &quot;real&quot; job again, haha... I haven&#039;t formed *too* many habits in the past two years, but I&#039;m sure it would be a pretty big change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should find a really awesome side job on Craigslist like I did one time. Back when Spider-Man 3 was coming out in theaters, I was hired to be Spider-Man in Wal-Mart as they launched the line of toys. I was there for like 4 hours, and at one point a little boy (probably 5) walked up to me and said, &quot;I drew a picture of your Spider-Man.&quot; Not only was it the cutest thing ever, but the picture was even pretty good!

Summary: If you wanna have fun, be Spider-Man!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also recently gotten pretty complacent with my job/side hustles. So, I started a Mary Kay business! haha It&#039;s been fun learning about it and I am excited to see how it goes. Another time that I got antsy, I started mystery shopping. That is fun too and I still do it so that I can get to see free movies and eat free dinner :) 

When I get antsy again, I want to go to a bar tending school and learn how to be a great bartender. That would be a fun side gig, I think :) Good luck with the ants in your pants! I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find something awesome to do! Im glad that I am not the only one who gets antsy and then finds another job. lol]]></description>
