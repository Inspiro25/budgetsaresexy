					<description><![CDATA[I live in London, UK and I&#039;m a plus size girl.

I&#039;ve completed some fit modelling jobs for a few plus size retailers out here and enjoyed it. They were just regular stores, but they valued the models, as we really helped them to create their clothing lines.

It does involve standing around for long hours, changing garments quickly, giving good feedback to the designers and being friendly and personable.  Also, you can&#039;t be shy about your body as you could be in front of several designers (male and female) and/or models. 

I&#039;ve fitted underwear, tights, shape wear and general clothing and I met some nice ladies. Sometimes it would be a solo job and sometimes I would work alongside several models of different sizes. Occasionally you could keep some of the clothing. 

One of the best things was that you didn&#039;t need any prior experience, you just had to have the right measurements and the ability to maintain your weight.

I found the jobs by replying to ads online and I&#039;m still registered with a couple of agencies here in London.  It pays decent money and it&#039;s a job I would happily do all day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there any way to find out where these design houses are located if you do not live in NYC? I live near Raleigh, NC, and I&#039;m gonna go out on a limb and assume that we don&#039;t have anything like that down here in the sticks ;)  But I actually fit the requirements almost to a tee, it would be great if I could find something like that around here!!  Thanks for the great info!!]]></description>

There is definitely a market for petites. Not every line uses them, but if a particular brand knows that it has a large petite client base, it will bring in a petite fit model :)]]></description>
