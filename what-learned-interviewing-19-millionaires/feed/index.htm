					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting to note that you ended your post with curiosity. It&#039;s something I&#039;m definitely trying to develop more of in my life--asking people questions about what they do, wondering how much income/expenses a local business has. I always learn a ton from these interviews. Thanks so much for the great article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was such a good post and great read. Cannot agree more with all of the above lessons especially on be willing to take risks and always try to educate yourself.  Things around us are constantly changing and we need to change with them.

Thank you for taking the time to share your findings and lessons with us. It is truly greatly appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My motto is you can find mentors in strange places. One of my Life Advisors is an old school PF blogger who has done amazing things and lives a wonderful life - we met through money blogging. One was a C-Suite exec most of his adult life in the comics industry - we met because I’m a comics nerd. One is in her 70s, born during the war and lived an amazing life and career and in her retirement she does more than any of us does in a week :) - we met through my husband’s hobby. 

They have all played key roles in reaching me to negotiate and navigate my career but not one of them work or worked in my industry. Knowledge and experience is powerful stuff so you don’t have to limit yourself to just the people who work in the same field as you. 

And I disagree with the notion that self employment is the only way to millionaireship because I started my career making less than $30k a year and we managed to join the double comma club with only minimal side hustles. We’ve both seen the dark side of self employment so we’re under no illusions that self employment is the Golden Ticket. It can be if you have the right idea, the right drive, the right luck, and the right fallback. But it’s really not for everyone. 

The key is knowing that your money earned from traditional employment needs to work for you too, it can’t just be you working!]]></description>

Great points on owning your own business. I do think it&#039;s possible to hit a million with even just one person making the numbers you mentioned. It might take longer as an employee to become a millionaire, but it will happen (as you mentioned, assuming costs are under control and savings are invested).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting points - thanks for sharing. The theme of owning your own business or not being an employee is something a number of other articles and sources also emphasize.

You did mention the banker who still works, but it seems the way to quicker - not necessarily easier though - is owning your own business.]]></description>
