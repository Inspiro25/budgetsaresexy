I think you&#039;d be crazy to leave where you are lol. I wish i could find something like you have! I&#039;m in a &quot;queen suite&quot; in a lower class extended stay hotel. I love my rooms ( I have a bedroom and living/kitchenette/dining room which has a 2 burner stovetop,an apartment size fridge, microwave and a sink that is about a foot square)  The only 2 things i would change are I would like an oven and a ground floor unit (my 4 yr old grandson stays sometimes and downstairs neighbors complain about him running around) My rent now that i dont have to pay taxes runs $900 for 4 weeks but $250 more on months with 5 weeks. It&#039;s also in a very bad area-not safe outside after dark]]></description>

I&#039;m noticing that the Extended Stay America website never actually reveals the correct total rate when you put in the approximate dates of your stay. For example, for a 2-week stay it&#039;s giving me a rate of $2,532.01. Lol. The website says that the shown price reflects the applied discount, but we know that ESA absolutely does not charge that much for only 2 weeks.]]></description>

Don&#039;t kid yourself! There are many reasons your kids can be removed; you don&#039;t have to do anything wrong if you have an ex spouse or someone who is willing to go to any length.  My son was removed when he was 14 because &quot;I wanted to be his friend and not his mother&quot; Anyone with a teen knows that&#039;s when they want to act out; first his thing was I wasn&#039;t working so I couldn&#039;t support him (was temp disabled)so I went back to work; then it was I was working and couldn&#039;t watch him. Finally he was removed when he was told he had 3 months to get his grades up (he would go to school and air and flirt with girls and do no schoolwork in class). I had him in counseling and tutoring; he didn&#039;t believe they would take him so he continued not turning in his homework or doing schoolwork.When this problem began I tried pretty much everything I could think of short of going and sitting in his classes finally said&quot;OK, you don&#039;t want to do your work, I&#039;ll let you suffer the consequences and fail 9th grade.  Imagine my horror when he was passed anyway with D&#039;s and F&#039;s!!  So he learns there are no consequences for not doing anything. .. Then I&#039;m blamed for him not getting his grades up. Sorry for the rant just saying I&#039;d always been told you had to do something bad to have a child removed; NOT TRUE!]]></description>

I am looking to go back to living in a motel but they have gone up so much! I loved in one for about 2 years until 2012 then moved with a friend. I haven&#039;t been able to find less than $40/night which works out to around 1350/mo! How can I get that lowered? They add tax which brings it to 1600/mo. I can&#039;t afford that on SS!]]></description>
