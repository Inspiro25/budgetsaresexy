					<description><![CDATA[Hello J. Money,

you&#039;re not alone. I don&#039;t look at share prices, either—what&#039;s more, I even disabled the automatic display of the total portfolio value in my online banking and thus stopped closely tracking my net worth. I wholeheartedly agree with the four points you made (invest when the money is there/never try to time the market/a good investment is a good investment/daily fluctuations don&#039;t matter in the long run).

When I have money to invest, I look up the share price to find out how many shares I can afford given the current price and my amount to be invested, place the order, and that&#039;s that. Then I write the data (date/price/number of shares) on a piece of paper, put in in an envelope safely tucked away, and retrieve the envelope with all my manual records once a year to update my master excelsheet.

Even without the exact net worth number, I know that I&#039;m still years from retiring. But then again I&#039;m only invested in plain old boring low-fee ETFs and perfectly happy with that. Why should I bother now with the details?]]></description>

That&#039;s an excellent hurdle to not have to deal with... And I swear more people would invest if they knew there were places where transaction costs are waived :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post!

I really don&#039;t try to time the market either. Like you say, my 401(k) is completely automated and I try not to look at it very often. Maybe once a month I will login to my 401(k) account (primarily for entertainment purposes) but I don&#039;t plan on making an changes anytime soon.

I do have a regular brokerage account too. I use one of the commission-free brokerages now which makes it easy to dollar cost average into individual stocks. I buy 3-5 shares at a time without worrying too much about the price.]]></description>

I hear that..

See if one of these articles might help you?!

https://jlcollinsnh.com/2014/11/12/stocks-part-xxvii-why-i-dont-like-dollar-cost-averaging/
https://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/05/22/stocks-part-xviii-investing-in-a-raging-bull/

My personal opinion is to use the money however you&#039;re already using your own money in terms of strategy/goals/etc. It&#039;s a larger number than normal but your goals have probably remained the same, yeah? I&#039;d also just sit on the money for a while too and let it all sink in which usually helps calm the nerves a bit as well :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, J, about the winning, but I&#039;m actually looking for advice  I&#039;m used to handling the normal amount of money we get each month but having a bunch to invest at once and not screw up is a little overwhelming.]]></description>

YES!!! And that *dead people* often have the best returns too because they&#039;re not looking or taking action, obviously! Always fascinating to see, haha...
