Bummed to hear they took out your match at work. I guess it&#039;s better that they play it safe and reserve funds if it means staying in business and keeping everyone employed.  Yep, I&#039;ll be watching out for any little gotchya&#039;s along the way with this 401k. From what I can tell all the fees are disclosed and there&#039;s no additional cost for choosing your own funds inside this 401k.  Cheers Lanny!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice job and congrats!

Following the S&#038;P 500 for you was golden.  All fees still the same?  I assume you&#039;ll be finding that out, as I am sure you&#039;ll be monitoring the account like a hawk!  My employer took away matching from COVID and not sure if we&#039;ll go back any time soon.  Stinks, I loved that 4% match : )  

Keep us up to date with how it goes, looking forward to it.

3 x 401k&#039;s?  Can you roll them over into just 1 account?  Embrace your crazy - it&#039;s what makes life fun!]]></description>

Thanks, Joel!  I hear you on the rebalancing.  I believe some plans will allow you to automatically rebalance your investments if you want, but not all.  I can also empathize with the simplicity.  My own 401k&#039;s are...not simplistic.  When I first started working in a different field than I&#039;m in now (I&#039;m a year or two older than you) I thought I&#039;d diversify by just picking between 8-10 different funds in my company 401k&#039;s. And I have 3!  But I am working on paring things down more over time.  Even with everything I know now, and a CPA license, I can still rationalize my crazy with the best of them!]]></description>

Looking back, I probably was told what to do. But I either ignored it or thought I was smarter than whatever advice I got. Now I am playing catch-up! Oh well, better late than never!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really wish my company had auto-enrolled me in their plan when I started. I had my head in the sand and was justifiably worried about paying the bills, but smaller percentages are barely noticeable because of the pre-tax benefits. Sometimes you just need to be told what&#039;s best for you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/my-new-401k-plan/#comment-306650&quot;&gt;Shaun&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Shaun!  Since I&#039;ve already maxed out my ROTH IRA&#039;s, the traditional IRA isn&#039;t an option for me. I could work out a SEP IRA situation, but then i&#039;m limited to a max of 25% of my income (which is quite small). So this 401k, as bland as it is, probably is the best option.  At least I get to lower my taxable income this year - I&#039;m planning to do some capital gains harvesting in my taxable accounts which is nice :)

As for calling the HR team to complain... I&#039;m gonna wait until I&#039;ve been employed for at least 2 weeks before I make a scene :)  I definitely will bring it up though - I&#039;ll even work overtime to help them evaluate options that are better for all!]]></description>

Whether people use financial advisors or not, self education is always important. The more we learn and take ownership of our finances the better off we are. I used to find this stuff so confusing (still do haha) but I&#039;m slowly getting better and better. That&#039;s great about VINIX - it&#039;s almost identical!]]></description>

This is the first time I&#039;ve had Vanguard options inside a 401k. I&#039;m stocked for sure. It could be much worse!]]></description>

Cheers J! I guess the reason I chose SP500 is because of simplicity. The more I try to piece meal things or build my own portfolio, the more likely I am to screw it up for myself. I was hoping for something I could just set-and-forget. No rebalancing, no doubting myself later, no additional fees..   You&#039;re probably right about more exposure to mid cap and small cap could be good. But since sp500 covers ~75% of the total stock market, I think the performance is close enough to each other.   Another thing I could have chosen is the target retirement fund for 2065. It has about 55% VTSAX and 35% total international market. Fees are higher, but I wouldn&#039;t have to rebalance would have access to more stocks.]]></description>
