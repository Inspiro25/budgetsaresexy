					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, well you will soon if you keep on managing that money well!  Just a matter of time, my friend :)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that&#039;s awesome.  I can&#039;t wait until we&#039;re BOTH mortgage-free and can live a totally stress-free life forever when it comes to money!!  I&#039;m sure other things will pop up and piss us off every now and then, but once we knock out the beast of it all, I&#039;d be more than happy to put up with issues fewer and more scattered around ;)  All hail debt freedom!
@&lt;b&gt;Devan&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats bro!  That&#039;s great!!  It def. seems like you&#039;re on track as far as saving and making a lot, which are the two major things you can control - unlike the stupid housing market that has sucked both of our monies out.  Never know when it&#039;ll turn around though and go in our favor and then DOUBLE our net worth awesomeness! Haha... so keep it up :)

As for your email - can you send again?  I&#039;ve cleared out my entire inbox so if you haven&#039;t seen anything from me I either never got it or it went to spam or something, and I apologize for it!  Send it over again, my friend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J,

I have just started following your website and the updates on the monthly net worths. This has inspired me to create my wife and I own net worth. We are -58K networth due to our house in Florida being way under water although we make good salaries - household income 150K and save around 2500 monthly and invest right at 10% of our incomes. I emailed you earlier in the week however haven&#039;t heard back from you. Look forward to learning more from you website and blogs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You said it yourself how time flies.  Now combine that with your mortgage payoff strategy :)  You will own your home outright sooner than you think!  As for myself in regards to networth, we have been going on a shopping spree to update our home that we neglected for the last five years trying to pay it off first.  Lately what we make is what we spend, so no networth changes.  Funny that I live in Las Vegas and we are breaking even :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greetings!

After reading your daily blog for a number of months now I have finally taken the very first step in creating my own Net Worth spreadsheet.  I have made attempts in the past but had always let it go since I was mostly concentrating on credit card debt.  Now the credit card debt is gone I feel watching the Net Worth spreadsheet grow (hopefully!) each month will keep my interest for the long term.  As one who prepares budgets for a living, I can&#039;t tell you what a great tool they can be, regardless if it is for business or personal use.  Just wanted to say hi and thanks, I enjoy your blog very much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - I think you&#039;re right, which is the major sucky part w/ gold right now - too dang expensive.  But I guess if you were to look back at all the years before us, everyone was saying the same thing too ;)  So I figured I&#039;d just jump in and let it be so I can experience the process.  I guess only time will tell if that was a smart move or not ;) Plus, I don&#039;t plan on getting any more anytime soon - 1 is enough to quench my curiosity.
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME!  Good for you on getting started with them - they&#039;ve really helped me put thingsin perspective over the years :)  To answer your question on taxes, no, I don&#039;t, haha... but my accountant IS pretty good about helping me wherever needed. I think it&#039;s just part of the whole game - the more you earn, the more you usually pay in taxes (I say &quot;usually&quot; cuz I know a lot of millionaires/billionaires figure out ways to get around it more, but I don&#039;t know what that entails really, or if it&#039;s even an option for me)
@&lt;b&gt;brooklyn money&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD!  Totally a smart move for sure, just takes a lot of sticking to your guns and really pushing forward.  Which anyone can do if it becomes a high priority :) Not sure if you&#039;ve checked out my post on it or not, but if not here you go - give it a read! &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/mortgage-payoff-plan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2011/09/mortgage-payoff-plan/&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Yes! A ton of fun!
@&lt;b&gt;Young Professional Finances&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks so much :) Hope yours is doing just as well too!
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww that&#039;s great!  Huge gains my ma, keep killin&#039;t it!
@&lt;b&gt;Leigh&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks :)  I think tracking this stuff every month is super important, no matter how scared or not you may be (and there&#039;s plenty of months where you get excited to do it too!). If there was anything I could go back in time and change, it would be to start tracking it all from day 1.  It really encourages you to keep improving it even if it&#039;s more phychological than anything else.  Our minds def. work in interesting ways sometimes :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that&#039;s pretty good! Your net worth updates are so motivational and make me wish that I was seeing $5k+ increases each month!

Running the numbers always scares me a bit too when a lot of money moves around in the month, but I&#039;m glad your numbers turned out okay!]]></description>
