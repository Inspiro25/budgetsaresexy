Maybe success = happiness, plain and simple? can include anyone and everyone regardless of their situation or how they define happiness? Interesting way to dissect it as you have - got my brain thinking more too now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice J Money. I think true success is when I feel well satisfied and have achieved my goals. It is also a true success when I can share my knowledge with others so that they can as well achieve true success. That&#039;s what I am aiming for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I struggle with this.  Honestly, actually - in a spiritual/philosophical sense - I&#039;m not sure there is such a thing as success.  Defining it in terms of health or fitness would rule out the infirm and disabled.  Defining it materially or financially rules out any hope of success for large swaths of humanity.  Defining it in terms of time damns the elderly and terminally ill.  Many people will remain single or can&#039;t procreate or lose their family members - or have troubled ones - so even defining it in terms of being able to give love seems unjust/unnecessary.  

Yet all humans can achieve contentment and happiness - enlightenment, if you want to go there.  Some amazing inspirational stories have been recorded by those without any &quot;success&quot; or wealth in terms of physical or material or even familial achievement.  So clearly there is more to it.  I should probably dwell on this fact a little more often.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As far as I&#039;m concerned, you totally nailed it on what success means! My top priority are the people I love, no contest. Spending time with them and not having to worry about money while I&#039;m with them are the dream. When it comes down to it, I guess my desires are fairly simple, haha. 

The only one I would add for myself is helping others. I don&#039;t think I could ever be completely fulfilled unless I felt I was contributing something positive to the world. (cliche, I know) Thanks for the post. I thoroughly enjoy your retrospective side ;) hah]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just like to see my daughter achieve.  I love watching her learn to swim, ride a bike, read, and other things.  I find it far more satisfying than an extra $1,000.  I&#039;ve got the money thing down and rolling, but success often comes from being able to spend time doing what I want with my family.  I also like trying new things, that excites me even if they don&#039;t succeed.  Life can be fun and successful even during failures.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting how much our definition of success evolves over our lifetimes. I&#039;ve settled up a current definition that&#039;s pretty close to yours. I do often wonder, though, if my definition will change as I get older]]></description>
