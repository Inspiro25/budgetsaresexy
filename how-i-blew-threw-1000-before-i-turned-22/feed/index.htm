That is true. It could have been worse - I could have blown it on crack and strippers, right? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, in all seriousness -- paying for rent in advance is hard when you&#039;re a college student!! The WORST was needing to put down a security deposit as well as the first months&#039; rent. That meant that you had to come up with 2 month&#039;s rent, all at the same time ... that could easily be $1,000 or more, right then and there, just with that! For a college kid, that&#039;s a ton of money. 

So, my point is -- don&#039;t be too tough on yourself for &quot;blowing&quot; $1,000 in a few weeks as a college student, especially if part of that money includes rent.]]></description>

Haha I gave all of those away except for the Peanuts ones. My fave cartoon strip. Eventually I kicked myself and gave those away too only a few years ago. I wish I could have all that money back!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel like although this story is a little extreme, there are PLENTY of young adults who can relate. Who doesn&#039;t spend all the money they make right away when they&#039;re young? All the while thinking that $1000 will last them forever. I am a student and I can definitely spend $1000 in less than a month on bills and groceries alone, no going out and no recreation. It&#039;s also seemingly impossible for young adults to save anything at all, and they usually have NO savings and NO rainy day fund. 
Hopefully reading an article such as this and some of the feedback can open up their eyes to the importance of saving and money management.]]></description>

Have you ever calculated how much it would have all added up to? ;) I don&#039;t know if I could stomach it, haha... I&#039;m sure you had a killer bachelor pad though!]]></description>
