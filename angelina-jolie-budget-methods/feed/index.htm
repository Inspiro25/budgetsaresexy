					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, You have some knack to have hunted out even Angelina Jolie&#039;s budgeting strategy. Guess now it&#039;s clear how she is one of the celebrities who really is synonymous with charity. 
Some people might think it&#039;s easy to have this kind of a budget allocation at that income level, but the more you earn, higher the temptation to slip into extrinsically motivated materialistic tendencies of keeping up appearances. It takes an effort to stick to a budget, irrespective of your income level.]]></description>

I prefer to go off of my after tax income.  For 2017 I&#039;m looking at 45% retirement/after-tax investing, 22% housing, 6% travel, 6% transportation (vehicle loan, insurance &#038; gas), 6% food, 4% pet expenses, 3% Emergency Medical savings, 4% utilities (cellphone, gas, electricity), 1% entertainment (Hulu, Netflix, etc.). That leaves 3% left over for whatever]]></description>

I think everyone does it differently :) Some merge it when it comes to saving/investing (for exactly the reasons you mention above), while others do after-tax. Like when saying they put X% of their paycheck towards their house or car or groceries, etc. No real hard answers out there so really just a matter of picking a style to track yourself and then keeping it consistent from there. That way you can track progress using a baseline!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are people using gross income or net income when using these %-based strategies?  I always wonder how that works since since a big chunk of ours comes out pre-tax for 401k, HSA and giving.]]></description>

I am certainly not going to try to disagree with Warren Buffett, because he has obviously done extremely well for himself. My personal approach is to give 10% all throughout my journey toward financial independence. When I reach FI, I will up my giving as much as my situation allows.

Personally, I cannot think of anything that matches the thrill of helping others who are in need, especially when it is done in secret.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I were going to compare myself with Ms. Jolie currently, I would use gross pay and considered my taxes as giving, since they go fund Government services, albeit a large portion to military spending (still creates jobs/demand for goods and services).
