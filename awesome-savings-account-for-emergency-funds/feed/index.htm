It&#039;s super low, and not worth it without the bonus:

0.10% if your account holds $25.00 – $999.99
0.50% if your account holds $1,000 – $4,999.99 
(and then for some odd reason it goes back to 0.10% if you have more than $5,000?)]]></description>

Sorry you feel that way. I rarely mention religion or politics on the blog - just thought it was a worthy company that a lot of people would find helpful :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an excellent promotion and way to start saving! 
The thing I like most is it pays out a 10% ROI!!! How many places are you getting 10%??? (If you find one let me know ;)
The main point here is to actually START savings and the $100 is the icing on top. Also some banks run promotions like this, however it&#039;s very hit or miss.]]></description>

I wasn&#039;t going to comment on this post because I really didn&#039;t have much to say about a review of a bank.  BUT...Your hypocrisy Interested me.  In that, you seem to have no issue with the ONLY path to salvation being being through Jesus (you did say you are a christian, right), but you &quot;draw the line&quot; on a bank giving out rewards because people have chosen to believe in something...  Honestly, they don&#039;t even check, its not like you need a baptism certificate or a letter from your pastor with proof of church membership or anything like that.  Stuff like this exists for all religions, races, etc...  Its not meant to make anyone feel bad about themselves.  In fact, I would argue that your overt disgust and criticism of an innocent thing like this has done more to dissuade any on the fence reader of merits of Christianity in general.

You are taking the love thy neighbor principle of Christianity and twisting it into something it&#039;s not.  Too me, It seems to me the end result of this entire thread is totally obvious,  the morale of this story is that you should take a hard look in the mirror, look really deep past your eyes, lose yourself in your thoughts, then in the moment when you look into your own eyes again and you catch back up to reality, it is at this moment, at this precipice of self reflection that you should take the opportunity to get over yourself.]]></description>
