					<description><![CDATA[I find that I don&#039;t need coupons as I don&#039;t buy much that uses coupons. You can&#039;t buy fruits and vegetables with coupons. I usually buy generic detergent that sometimes has a coupon attached. My grocery shopping includes the fruit and vegetables, sometimes chicken and mot much more. I&#039;m not a vegetarian although I rarely buy meat. Even the household items I purchase don&#039;t have coupons. I don&#039;t buy air fresheners or boxed foods, expensive detergents or fabric softeners. I&#039;m a pretty basic buyer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m not sure if being frugal makes anyone more “attractive”, but it definitely is a good habit to develop. I totally follow 3 of the reasons you listed here. Here’s why they work for us. Reason #1: While friends have suggested my husband and I upgrade our house, we love not having a mortgage and the freedom that gives us. Plus, we put the savings towards our retirement. Reason #2: Having a smaller house allows us not to buy so much “stuff”, because there’s nowhere to put it! Bonus: we use the stuff in our house! Reason #3: We’re intentional/mindful about how we spend our money. We look for quality over quantity, so when there’s something we really want (like our canoe or furniture), we look for products that will last a long time. I love being frugal!]]></description>

haha! Check Costco, and i believe Whole Foods carry it. Only problem is they might charge a lot.  I would ship you one of my tubs but my wife would never forgive me. :)]]></description>

I&#039;m on a hunt here in CT for that sauce now - never heard of it - but it looks like it&#039;s getting a pretty good recommendation from Joel &#038; his wife :)]]></description>

I don&#039;t want to name any names.... But someone (who I am married to) has consumed about 7 of the tubs of sauce already. :).  Some we froze, and we gave a couple away too to neighbors.

Gift cards on first dates are awesome! They need to be used sometime!]]></description>

Love it! I&#039;ll have to look up some of these!  Milk around my house only lasts a couple days, because I work from home and have about 6 bowls of cereal every day :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good points.  Except I have read several articles on how expiration dates don&#039;t really need to be followed.  Now of course, I&#039;m not talking on perishable items.  However, you can use expired milk as &quot;sour milk&quot; in pancakes, waffles - I do it all the time.  You can also eat expired yogurt if it smells okay.  You can look up these articles if you wish.  Also, things can be kept in the freezer for very long periods of time.  I like watching organizing/homemaking Youtube channels and they always talk about throwing out expired foods.  If they only knew.  lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha agree with Steveo that the expiration date is merely a suggestion. Speaking of which, how are you going to eat all that sauce!?

I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve used a coupon on a first date, but definitely a gift card. Is that better?]]></description>

I personally disagree with these, doing all of these allow you to save more which is the basis of frugality. 

Taking a look at the first one &quot;Not leaving a tip&quot; is a great way to save an extra 1-50 dollars. 

&quot;Not paying when it’s your turn <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/274c.png" alt="❌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&quot; is another great way to potentially save yourself a couple hundred, it&#039;s alright to lie to friends or a date and say you forgot your wallet. There&#039;s no shame in doing it, money is money and it just so happens that friends come after. 

&quot;Eating expired food <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/274c.png" alt="❌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&quot; A number is just a number, there&#039;s tons of people who eat &quot;worse&quot; food than expired foods. 

&quot;Relying on others to pay <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/274c.png" alt="❌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&quot;, As with the &quot;not paying when it&#039;s your turn&quot; one, this is one isn&#039;t wrong to do and one we should actively encourage especially for men on dates with women. The feminist movement allows for female empowerment, it&#039;s time they start using it. I don&#039;t want to name hairs here but there&#039;s a certain political figure that can fix this problem entirely. 

Skimping on hygiene &#038; self care <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/274c.png" alt="❌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&quot; Remember in the 1800s when people took a bath once a week in a river? We should apply that today! Waterbills are at ATH&#039;s so you should be investing that money rather than spending it on a bath. 

Honestly a pretty good article disregarding the afromentioned, good job Mr Joel I look forward to seeing Monday&#039;s report.]]></description>
