					<description><![CDATA[I do not condone cheating, but I am all for the legalization of sex work. I should know as I have done it for a few years now. Most of the men I see are millionaires and billionaires who are single. They see me as they like choice without commitment. They treat me with kindness and fondness that is hard to find in a “civi” relationship. Since this is a finance blog: Here are the real numbers. $200 is actually very low end. The average start at $500 and the high end averages $1500 an hour with multiple hour bookings. It isn’t for the middle class and at the high end it’s very professional. It’s a fantasy and everyone I know isn’t disallusioned to what it entails. I would consider myself on the more up scale end of the spectrum. Accounting and budging for an escort is paramount for her retirement and future. Our professional life is truly limited and thank god I have a MBA to fall back on. Considering the fantastic opportunity at the high end, I would tell any girl I know to quit her 9-5 and give it a try. You can pick and choose who you see and you don’t have to see attached men. In my world, I make the rules.]]></description>

&quot;my sin was lying about what I was doing. If you’re unhappy in your marriage, fix it or leave.&quot; Here you admit that lying was wrong, and that the better (and honest) approach is to &quot;fix it or leave.&quot; Truth and love do, I believe, need to work together in a marriage. When you say that complete honesty did &quot;more harm than good&quot;, I wonder if you mean that it brought about confrontation? Confrontation is actually a good thing. It can be very unpleasant and trigger all sorts of negative feelings, but if healthy confrontation can be developed (over time, with practice, lots of error along the way), it will be one of the best things you can have going for you in a relationship. I&#039;m glad you&#039;re being honest with your wife. I think that sharing with her about your past will help build in a new accountability for you - since you do admit to &quot;missing the thrill.&quot;]]></description>

As I stated, the lying was the worst part of what I did. I wanted to keep my family together, but I was deeply depressed about my marriage. Years of personal and couples counseling did nothing. If I could go back and do it again, I would have just left then hired escorts. Yes I used protection every single time and no I was not having sex with my then wife. That was the problem. As for the &quot;lack of professionalism&quot; I am only speaking as a client. I know what I felt made a better experience and what didn&#039;t for me. Selling drugs, upselling, etc are, in my opinion, unprofessional and extremely dangerous.]]></description>

I had thought that same thing about my first marriage. I figured once I got older things would just settle in, They didn&#039;t. It was a terrible marriage and I&#039;m glad to be out. I have found total and complete honesty to do more harm than good. I have been as honest as I can be with my wife. I&#039;m not sure what telling her more would accomplish.]]></description>
