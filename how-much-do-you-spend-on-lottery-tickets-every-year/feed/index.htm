Love that you track how much you spend/win/lose on it!! I wonder how much it would affect others if they did the same too? Or if they&#039;d still keep on playing regardless?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lottery officials are catering to people&#039;s desires to win really big amounts of money rather than reasonable/moderate ones.

When the CA lottery first came out it was 6 numbers &#038; no mega. The jackpot was smaller (about $3M to start &#038; incrementally increased by about $1M per week. In those days it was held once a week. typical payout was $5 for three numbers, about $40 for four numbers &#038; $1500 if one hit five numbers...all 6 reaped the jackpot. People won regularly in those days though the payouts were smaller &#038; after about 4-5 months when the jackpot hit $20M, there would be lines everywhere at liquor &#038; convenience stores. The good old days.

Now it is hard just getting a mega number though the payout are way larger. It would be nice to see several people split/win those multi-hundred million dollar jackpots as $10M apiece should cover most bases in people&#039;s lives. No need to be greedy or a spendthrift.

% on CA scratchers have also gone down...in 1995, I spent about $1700.00 on scratchers and had an eventual return of $1100.00 for about a 40% loss. Today it&#039;s roughly a 65% loss so I play far less.

Depending on one&#039;s perspective, winning BIG is either a &#039;miracle&#039; (aka God&#039;s plan) or a mathematical anomaly (if one happens to be an atheist).

Both schools of thought continue to play the lotto &#038; scratchers regularly.]]></description>

On the website, you determine which game your want to play, what your numbers are (they&#039;re fixed throughout the subscription period; you can choose your own or have them automatically generated), how many draws per game, do you want the multi-lier, and how long you want the subscription to run. 

I recently discovered that I can have it auto-renew, which is awesome! Can you imagine having your numbers hit only to find out afterwards you forgot to renew? That would be awful! It&#039;s set up to auto-renew every two weeks for $12. If I have winnings in my account, it deducts from that to pay for the renewal.

For the hard-core players, they have an option to set up a maximum daily withdrawal. I can&#039;t imagine being that level of addictive, but I guess it&#039;s a real problem!]]></description>

An online subscription?! How does that work? Do they randomly send you the numbers via email or actually mail you print tickets?! I&#039;m intrigued!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have an online subscription to the Mega Millions, which is about $4/week, so $208 for the year. I have yet to win anything higher than $50, but the amount of joy I get *imagining* how I&#039;ll spend the money is worth the stupid tax.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We play the big powerball/megamillions if they go over $300 million, but usually only buy one ticket for our household (you can&#039;t win if you don&#039;t buy one, but your odds don&#039;t increase significantly enough if you buy more than one).  We also like to buy a few scratch-offs for holidays/birthdays, but usually limit it to $20 for birthdays and $5 for mothers/father&#039;s/valentines/anniversary and then maybe another $20 or so in Christmas stockings.  With the few I buy for other family members for similar holidays/birthdays, we maybe spend $250 a year on scratch-offs which isn&#039;t too much, and maybe another $50 or so a year on the big number draws.  

I do agree that one can go overboard, and I don&#039;t win enough to justify spending more!  Especially since considering all that money we spent ($300 a year) and we don&#039;t have much to show for it!  But it&#039;s entertainment, so we view it as such. And it&#039;s healthier than eating an ice cream cone, ha!]]></description>
