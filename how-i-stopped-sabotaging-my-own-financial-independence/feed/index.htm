					<description><![CDATA[Just getting around to reading this post. Really appreciated this post. Sabotaging myself has been and continues to an issue with me.  I have “mindlessly” managed my financial (and to say manage is a real stretch) throughout my adult life.  Often thought i’d Make for a good study case. Latter half of last year after discovering The budgets are sexy blog I calculated my net worth and found I was pleasantly surprised that it was not zero. Since that time have been mindfully spending time on my finances.  Haven’t been a complete zero over the years but certainly could have done a whole heck of a lot better by making better decisions. My journey continues.]]></description>

MonkWealth - Thank you for the kind words.  Agreed, getting control of my fear was a big part of my success.  To be completely honest, its a work in progress.  Every year with new goals, I have the same conversation with myself about fear.  In the end, if fear is the only reason I don&#039;t do something, well then that is not good enough.  :)]]></description>

Excellent point. Your kids are lucky ones.
I know there isn&#039;t, and &quot;buck up&quot; is surprisingly not efficient, how about that ;)
It&#039;s baby-steps, like you, one after the other. In an effort to rethink work-life balance, I went part-time a month ago (I work 45 fewer minutes a day), and it&#039;s helping me move forward with other things.
I hear you on the stealth wealth. Where I live, what you make in a month is deep in hush-hush territory, even with close ones. I recall my aunt&#039;s reaction at Christmas when I told her about going part-time... Not doing that again anytime soon.
I&#039;m glad to start now, as well]]></description>

Nita - Thank you for sharing.  Its tough to self motivate.  I wish I had a magic formula to share but if there is one, I haven&#039;t found it.  For me, it started with wanting better for my kids (and that meant not relying on child support).  Once things started falling in place, I would challenge myself to do better than I did the year before.  The first few years I was surprised at how much I could do.  Sadly, I also learned that I should not share my success with my friends.  It put a strain on many relationships (friends &#038; family).  I learned to be proud of myself, quietly.  You will know when you are ready and that is personal for each of us.  Do I wish I started earlier?  Sure do.  But I am also glad I didn&#039;t start any later.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;In my 20s and 30s, retirement age seemed like a thousand years away.  It’s easy to put retirement planning aside in favor of other more immediate goals and priorities. This is the beauty of the FIRE movement and why I fell in love with it. It takes away the unknown future and puts the future within reach – if you want it.&quot;
Just wanted to say it: with this you pictured why I&#039;m here exactly.
I have been lucky enough not to suffer from #2 in the long run, but I&#039;m still stuck with #1 - mostly because no one around me expects from me anything else than what I&#039;m doing already, so I have to motivate myself to do more and I&#039;m not there yet.
The steady growth of your net worth within the last 6 years is absolutely impressive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for that post. I read and re read it because I sense there’s a lot more to absorb than what’s on the surface of your words and journey. Also, thanks J for posting the charts and commentary BEHIND her story. It gave me much needed context. I immediately went to her page by the way. Well done Pie Lady. 

I have my own struggles and also worry about my adult children ( as single parents tend to do) but I’m hoping leading by example will remedy everyone’s mindset a bit. Thanks again.]]></description>
