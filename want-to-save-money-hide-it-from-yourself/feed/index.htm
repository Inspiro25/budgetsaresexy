It does sound confusing, but if it works for you then def. get back to it! :) I know a friend who opened up an account way across town so it would be annoying to go to on purpose (and he didn&#039;t get access to online stuff) so that way he wasn&#039;t tempted to touch it. And then every paycheck he had a portion automatically xfered there which forced him to save :) So that could be another route too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am terrible with fast purchases. See something online, paid for and in the post. I have auto transactions, but when i run low on my wage account, I debit the others. BAD IDEA! So, from todays paycheck, I get paid every week on a thursday. Which is also hard, as weekends I compete with my horses. So I am now going to set up an account maybe with another bank, where i DD every week, and do not have access to it.. maybe. My other idea, is to completely limit my spending.
But the major thing I am paying, and I don&#039;t need to, is too many transactions. I have an accoutn which allows 6 free transactions per month. So I am going to try to not spend anything each month except the things I need to, so maybe transfer once from my wage  accountper week (4 / month)  , and then once in that new account, into another accout (fuel), another accout, rent/board/living 4 x /mnth, horse shoes are only 1nc a month, so can let money build up in another account. This seems really confusing, but have had it work before... just have to get back into having dollars rather than cents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice!! There you go!  Something new I&#039;ve started doing is cashing in money for $2.00 bills whenever I go to the bank :)  I&#039;ve found it&#039;s MUCH harder to spend those than other bills, so I end up just storing and storing them for one big stack of money, haha... and although they&#039;re only worth $2.00, it feels like they&#039;re worth a lot more and you could probably sell them for $3.00 if you ever wanted anyways ;)  Ya gotta do whatever works!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have always had trouble saving money because I really like to shop. If I don&#039;t have money in my wallet then it&#039;s not as hard. I decided to try something different recently, I have these individual small envelopes and I put cash in each one and seal it up. Once their sealed up I put them someplace I don&#039;t usually look in or think about. So far so good, I haven&#039;t touched it! : D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I like that too :)  And totally true with your 401k and IRA!  Once money goes in there it&#039;s THERE FOR GOOD and you don&#039;t get tempted to mess with it (unless you&#039;re in retirement years, of course).  It&#039;s a great method to follow indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m finding that my 401(k) and IRAs are the best places to hide my cash - since I can&#039;t get it back out for a very long time, I hardly notice that the money is gone each month. Having an online savings account is also AWESOME for hiding money, since then I can&#039;t see it when I sign into online banking to make sure nothing fishy happened in my checking account - I only check on my online savings accounts once a month to record the interest transactions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure how much you&#039;ll recognise Swedish income tax policy, but my last employer failed in his obligation to pay income tax out of my wage. Instead, every month when I received my full wage, I had to reserve the tax amount myself. 

That doesnt sound awful, I&#039;m sure, but when you&#039;re used to disposing what money is in your account as you wish, it&#039;s hard to be strictly forced to save. I&#039;ve had savings targets before but it&#039;s different, because you can always say to yourself, this month I can save a little less so that I can do X. With the IRS breathing down your neck, that savings account was non-negotiable. So every month, my wage would come in, and I was forced to shave off 30%. 

Then I phoned the IRS last week to find out that with all applicable discounts, my tax rate was nearer 12%. After a few months of part-time work I suddenly had thousands of kronors (or hundreds of dollars) disciplinedly squirreled away that could be fed straight into my proper savings account. 

So next time I need to reinforce my savings account? Hire someone to break my legs if I don&#039;t.]]></description>
