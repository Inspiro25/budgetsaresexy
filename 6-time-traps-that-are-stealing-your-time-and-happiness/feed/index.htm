hey Gary!  I also noticed that the new IOS update makes it so that other iPhone users can see when you are on DND mode. So they think twice before texting you and wanting an immediate reply. DND and Airplane mode have helped me tremendously this past year when writing and focussing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year I discovered that putting my phone in Airplane mode helped the fast-depleting battery on my old iPhone, and then made it a point to keep it Airplane mode when you want solitude, like doing deep work, on a hike, or cooking. I also use the Do Not Disturb when I need to look something up but don&#039;t want to be inundated with notifications. 

Great post Joel, enjoy your holidays!]]></description>

I have the same issue... setting boundaries for myself.  I&#039;ve noticed a really cool thing happening as I&#039;m working on my time boundaries... I&#039;ve started to observe and respect other people&#039;s time more, which in turn helps them respect my time more. It&#039;s an interesting echo effect :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ooooh lots of good points.  I have trouble with saying yes too much rather than setting time boundaries.  And then I wonder why I don&#039;t ever have time to sit down and read a book.  It&#039;s especially challenging when people push back or make us feel guilty for not saying yes.  In the abstract, I realize that&#039;s disrespectful on their part, but in the moment it&#039;s still hard.  Something I need to work on, clearly.  :)]]></description>

Another cool book I read years ago was &quot;In Praise of SLOW&quot; by Carl Honore. It really got me slowing down and enjoying the tiny moments many people speed right past.  Cheers Olaf, have a great week dude!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am guilty of being unable to sit and do nothing, and it is something I am working towards being better at. 

I find it quite perplexing that it is such an issue and that I feel poorly at times when I have nothing to do. But, it does make sense when I reflect on the fact that society is constantly pushing for more More MORE. Thanks for the mindful post, Joel!]]></description>
