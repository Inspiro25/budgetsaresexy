					<description><![CDATA[We have a card for our household, one for me, and one for my husband who also consults outside his regular job. Recently he got one for rewards to use for his main job when he travels. Anyway, that is enough to keep track of let alone 1497!!!! Crazy! I&#039;m curious if he only uses one why the others haven&#039;t been closed due to lack of activity. I&#039;ve had that happen to me because let&#039;s face it when you&#039;re issued credit that card company wants to see some use of it or it doesn&#039;t behoove them to service the account from their end.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have 3 cards that I actively use, but looking over my credit report last year I found that my old military card was increased to a limit of $7K WTH? haven&#039;t used it in years.

... and duh, a card I got for paying on a dental procedure at 0% interest is considered a real credit card. Who in their right mind would continue to use a card that has 26% interest? 

I had been on a mission to find a credit card (for SO) that pays you back 3% on gas and 3% on groceries and gives you a sign up bonus of $200 with only a $500 spending requirement and guess what, I found it:) Sweet!
Paid off every month of course.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think it takes 6 months for scores to move - either up or down. I believe it&#039;s a constantly changing one. (Though not sure how they work in the UK?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have two current accounts, one with a limit of £2000, and the other with no overdraft facility. I also have three credit cards, with limits of £900, £500 and £1200. I would love to have more, but i have to wait six months for my credit score to go up i think?]]></description>

Yes, that would be the ideal route - however most people don&#039;t use it :( 

I went back and made a note to password-protect the spreadsheet at least... good looking out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the love of all that is holy, DO NOT add a tab to your unsecured spreadsheet listing the names and passwords of all of your accounts. 
Instead, invest in a password manager and USE IT to generate secure passwords and keep track of your sites.
Then, thank me later when your information isn&#039;t easily cracked because of simple and crappy passwords.]]></description>
