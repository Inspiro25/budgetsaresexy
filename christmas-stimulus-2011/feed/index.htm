					<description><![CDATA[If I had an extra hundred this year, it would go straight to my youngest. Newly out on his own, and working hard to learn this budgeting thing... An extra hundred for him to not have to worry about (or to put into his budget, his call to learn *grin*) would be great. 

This year I looked at all the black Friday things to see if something jumped and I wanted &quot;ooo me me me me!&quot;... and nothing hit me. It was a weird feeling knowing I am happy and content with exactly what I have.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really thankful that whenever I need money I get it. It&#039;s almost magical, that God or the Universe give it to me at the perfect time. 
I&#039;m hoping that you will be part of this magic Mr. J. Money.
I&#039;m considering to start a blog and would appreciate if you would find a way to pay my first domain from your giveaway money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/christmas-stimulus-2011/#comment-261262&quot;&gt;Debi Henson&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m thinking that the question was to say how I&#039;d spend the $100 if won.  We are in dire straits, so it would go to living expenses.  This time next year, God willing, will be different though!]]></description>

It has allowed me to vastly improve my own life - but most importantly, has enabled me to volunteer as a debt counselor in my local community. I am so thankful every time I see how our work help struggling families find a path forward.]]></description>
