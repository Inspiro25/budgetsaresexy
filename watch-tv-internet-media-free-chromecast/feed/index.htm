					<description><![CDATA[Hi. Thanks for the blog. Very informative. To clarify, I can cancel my cable/wifirouter acct and purchase a chrome thingy for a one time fee, and stream by way of Republic  Cell/WiFi service?  I have an outdated ROKU on my second tv so, the replacement expense may be required for a more current ROKU.  My smart tv is with only two apps, Disappointing as I hoped to serve the web on it. One of those learning experiences. It does have ROKU and VUDU apps.   Anyway, Ive been paying cable bill for wifi internet and basic cable. I could live without the basic cable channels to save money if I can stream on GC and Netflix.  Since I also have a tablet  maybe casting would be good, if my tv is worthy.  I do wonder about going over with data usage and fees once my cable acct is cancelled.  What do you think? 
Thanks again for the great read.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a great article! I&#039;d add ArkMC for iOS/Android or Mac. I use this app for streaming my pics, videos, music to different compatible devices that use dlna. It&#039;s also very comfortable because it&#039;s wireless and you don&#039;t have to use any adapters or cables.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have not paid for television in over 13 years, and then it was under protest. I have been happy with streaming media. I have found that using Opera browser and placing all the free streaming media channels I could find with google searches I was able to place them all into one folder on my browser on opening it. 
For shows that my wife and I like to binge watch, I use Aviator browser and go on to sites like putlocker, with that browser if you don&#039;t have a flash player the stream becomes a download without needing a torrent app.
As for saving on my phone, I have been with the big V for a while, they have this new plan that works for our family since we like to keep our phones for as long as possible, once the phone is paid for in two years interest free, it comes of the bill, also we sparingly use 3gb data between 2 phones and get a teachers discount/state employee discount through work.
As for WiFi at home, I am able to access internet for free from the business downstairs that seemingly has no restriction to access for the exception of a password that is freely given to anyone that is a customer.
As a side note, I am able to go to my public library and borrow for free any DVD, CD even Wii games. They even have new releases.
The laptop we use for watching our shows is about 10 years old Toshiba Satellite that I refurbished myself with a new OS, new HD, new power pack and battery, works great.]]></description>

We live in an apartment and Northern California we were paying over $100 per month on cable TV. I bought an outside antenna at Walmart and mounted it on a piece of PVC pipe and my patio. Now we get 85 over air channels for free. For 799 we get Netflix on a Roku box I bought on sale for $50. We have plenty of movies and over the air TV to watch. We save $125 per month.]]></description>
