					<description><![CDATA[I have to second the info about the emergency kit, especially the crank flashlight. We have an LED lantern with batteries and a crank for recharging, built in radio for emergency alerts AND you can use the crank to recharge your cell phone (which would eliminate the worry about your dying iphone). It only cost us $20 at Walmart.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hopefully you survived the storm with electricity intact.  You reminded me of the difference of power outages in the west versus colder areas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the grid gets overwhelmed here on hot days due to all the air conditioners running so there can be power outages.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember some years back this happening and so we decided to go to the beach since for some of Mother Nature&#039;s breezes.  It was nice to get away from our TV, ec. and be outside.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Watching the news... they&#039;re showing pics of DC. I don&#039;t envy you one bit. The rain storms around here can get pretty bad, and we do get some flooding in the Sacramento area, but no snow really. We did lose power for over a day a few years ago, and that was terrible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha! We are getting slammed pretty hard in VA this year too. I love it but have to admit that my fear of losing electricity hit me harder now that most of my work involves the computer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we lost power for about 6 hours the other day and I felt like I almost hit full panic mode. LOL Not really but it was almost like getting an unexpected punch to the groin. LOL Okay, not really again, but you get my point...I hope! Let&#039;s just say I was kind of lost during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made me want to take a nap though. Great post J as always man!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J: My wife is full-term. This storm freaks me out! Two of my very large Japanese maples are probably dead ($3000 value each) and a large window was cracked. And it&#039;s a custom size Anderson. Ugh $500. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of my pine trees lost 50%+ of their branches and now I have some very ugly trunks that will probably need to be torn down too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve been cranking all of our furnaces on full blast 24/7 to get the house a little warmer just in case.]]></description>
