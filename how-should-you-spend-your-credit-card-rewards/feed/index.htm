					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, that&#039;s a great way to manage it too. Our USAA card does the same thing with our rewards - just knocks off part of our bill every year once time, it is pretty sweet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m usually not interested in any of the gifts offered through my rewards program, so I just opt for the cash. Since I pay my credit card balances in full every month, I just apply the rewards to the credit card balance. I find it&#039;s a good way of not wasting it on things I don&#039;t really need. I don&#039;t think of it as &quot;I have some extra bonus cash in my checking account, what can I spend it on?&quot; I think of it as &quot;OK, my credit card balance is now $175 instead of $200, that&#039;s pretty sweet.&quot; And I pay off that $175 at the end of the month and continue spending/not spending as I normally would.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hehe, indeed! I think my AMEX rewards can be used on Amazon too actually, now that you mention it... I should check next time I&#039;m on to see how much I have!

Give your babe a kiss from me! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our rewards allow us to directly spend them on Amazon so that&#039;s usually what I use to pay for diapers. It&#039;s nice using them that way directly on Amazon because for most of my other options I&#039;d have to wait until I reached a certain threshold to redeem them but I can spend the full amount of rewards at Amazon whenever I want. Comes in handy when you have a kid who&#039;s not yet potty trained ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Nice timing! Though I don&#039;t see how much you made in that post? I&#039;m sure it&#039;s alot knowing you, but now you&#039;ve got me curious :)
@&lt;b&gt;Erica&lt;/b&gt; - Ahh... I guess that&#039;s good and bad, haha... gives you straight up cash but then &quot;spends it&quot; before you get a chance to do so otherwise! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - I bet a lot!
@&lt;b&gt;Emily @ evolvingPF&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a nice way of doing things too.
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Look at that! Perfect timing :)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Aren&#039;t both of those the same thing?? :)
Hope you all had a wonderful holiday week! Thanks for always popping over to my blog :)

@&lt;b&gt;Johnny @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - I freakin&#039; love Macaroni Grill, esp. the atmosphere. Feels so warm and cozy in there!
@&lt;b&gt;Judy B.&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Awesome :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, I like that actually :) Nice &quot;rewards&quot; during the year rather than waiting at the end to have fun - that works!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah, perhaps :) But is that necessarily a bad thing? Asking for permission to spend on yourself?
@&lt;b&gt;Wayne @ Young Family Finance&lt;/b&gt; - That works too! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your advice, or lack thereof. It is a personal decision! We like to just use our rewards money as part of the money we use to pay off the credit card every month. It&#039;s like a little discount on life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It kind of sounds like they&#039;re asking for permission to spend the money on themselves, which isn&#039;t good :s I don&#039;t personally have any rewards cards at the moment. If I did the money would be going towards paying off the last of my new to me car. If I was in the same position as I was a couple months ago before my car died, I&#039;d probably use it to pay for a little bit of shopping and stocking up on Boxing Day.]]></description>
