Here you go!

http://podcast.affordanything.com/listen/page/10/

The first 26 or so episodes feature me in it, and then I left the show and Paula took it over from there :) It&#039;s also now called the &quot;Afford Anything&quot; podcast and just released the 100th show! 

You can see why I left the show btw here:

Glad you like!

Nothing too exciting out there I&#039;m afraid in terms of interest/earning outside of accounts you wouldn&#039;t want to touch for a while (ie investing), however if you&#039;re looking to just stash as much away as possible, try out &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/digit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Digit.co&lt;/a&gt; - they analyze your spending and will save a few dollars for you every few days into a separate account that it knows you won&#039;t miss... 

You can see my review of them here if you&#039;re interested:

YUP! Exactly! Lots of built in flexibility there - I like that idea a lot. Provided you&#039;re diligent enough to in fact pay more down when you&#039;re able to and don&#039;t end up spending it elsewhere :) That&#039;s the only nice thing about the 15 year loans besides the rate - forces you to get it paid off in time, haha...]]></description>

Haha... yeah, the old mortgage vs investing debate. Two sets of pros and cons, so gotta go with the one that excites you most - at least in my opinion. Or the one that actually gets you to *take action* for that matter! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the tip of getting a 30-year mortgage but making payments as if it were a 15-year mortgage. Yeah, the interest rate will be slightly higher, but I like to consider that a premium for insurance against some kind of setback--I could always revert to the 30-year payment if, for example, my household income were slashed due to a layoff. The HUGE upside of course is the mortgage will be paid off far sooner!]]></description>
