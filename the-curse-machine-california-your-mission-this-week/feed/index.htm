					<description><![CDATA[Just stopping by to see how much your swear jar accumulated - and so I&#039;m late to the break a bad habit game, but I&#039;ll think of something and do it next week. I should probably aim to count to ten before reacting - that seems to be my problem today! (Huh. I should probably start TODAY, then... I guess).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - haha... go for it, toothbrush girl :)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - I came SO CLOSE to eating m&amp;ms today!!!  Barely caught myself - whew... watch out, it&#039;s not going to be easy! :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, sure.  But only if you start next week then before you forget ;)  And happy birthday!
@&lt;b&gt;Diana&lt;/b&gt; - Wow that will be nice!  I used to be hardcore about Starbucks too, but was actually okay with it since it was one of the few places I spent my money.  Haven&#039;t been in weeks, but only because of proximity issues (too far from me now).
@&lt;b&gt;Molly&lt;/b&gt; - I LOVE IT!!!  Even if you slip a few times, I think you&#039;ll be good once you get going :)  Puts you in a much better mood, as well as those around you.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Good!  1 down, 5 more to go!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... just keep your mouth shut then ;) 
@&lt;b&gt;Ally&lt;/b&gt; - You can do it!! It&#039;s def. very scary indeed, but having any heads up at all is def. great for planning - even just a cple weeks.  Start saving and make this week the perfect one to start NOT spending :)  Maybe if you&#039;re &quot;on a mission&quot; it&#039;ll be easier for you?  It usually is for me!  We&#039;re here for ya, friend!
@&lt;b&gt;CrystalH&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Yes, and it&#039;s only 1 week so you can treat yourself next Tuesday - hehe...  thanks for participating :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, yeah I bet!  Never heard of eating more part, but I think it&#039;s a valiant project to take on :)  I&#039;ll be checking in soon to check on your status! (and good idea w/ free toothbrush @ dentist, haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Eating breakfast makes you cranky?  Or you&#039;re saing if you STOP eating breakfast?  either way, don&#039;t be cranky :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jon &#124; Free Money Wisdom&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! I know a lot of people who swear by drinking lots of water... I try here and there, but the crazy amount of peeing always ends up holding me back.  Just can&#039;t take so many trips!
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Yes, you concentrate on your major life change there, haha...  I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re reading blogs this week! You trying to distract yourself? ;)  Big CONGRATS!!!  Exciting!
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re def. right on that -- it&#039;s temporary.  Soon enough all will be back to normal and you&#039;ll be a fit machine ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Emily Sara&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, thanks!  I like to do it at random times when I&#039;m moved :)  Helps alot having others working on stuff around me too!
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;m caling it now -- if I slip, it will DEF be because of Easter candy... but it will be by accident!  I gotta make sure to tell Nate and his kids about my goal so they can stop me in time ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just want to say that I think it&#039;s awesome to start a challenge for yourself at different times of the year. So often people will get hung up on an event (like New Years) and not think to try for their resolution later on. Stick with it, J Money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now that I&#039;m home, I find myself snacking more throughout the day. Easter chocolate really doesn&#039;t help at all either.

I&#039;m going to stop biting my nails.  I read somewhere that the habit of biting your nails makes you eat more.  I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s true, but I&#039;m using it to motivate myself to stop.  It&#039;s hard, it&#039;s a lifetime habit.]]></description>
