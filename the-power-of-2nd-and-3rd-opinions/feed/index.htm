					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been over a week and I&#039;m still giddy from passing inspection!!!!

@&lt;b&gt;CityFlips&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh I like that! I do the same when getting crappy managers on customer service calls - I just call back at a different time until I get someone with a better attitude ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, and it sure would help w/ the ladies!
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Trust is most def. key with body shops.
@&lt;b&gt;MainlineMom&lt;/b&gt; - Me too! Esp when it&#039;s mine :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brad Chaffee&lt;/b&gt; - I know, that&#039;s the only thing I DON&#039;T miss about VA! Haha... I really want to move back there actually.
@&lt;b&gt;Fred Schebesta&lt;/b&gt; - You the man!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Win-Win after the annoyances ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Frugal Rich Life&lt;/b&gt; - Damn, great job on that.  I always forget about Yelp.  Plus, it seems everyone here in the DC area just complains all the time and I get tired of hearing all the negativity - even if they&#039;re justified.  Although maybe when it comes to mechanics I&#039;d pay more attention.
@&lt;b&gt;sandy @yesiamcheap&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... yeah, it was more for the time spent and these other things they did in order to bump up the price I had to spend (I needed to reach the $450 total limit so I could get the waiver if I failed).  I could have actually gotten a mechanic friend to do it for me, but then I wouldn&#039;t have any receipts to back it up :(
@&lt;b&gt;michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch.  Yeah, never been a friend of Jiffy Lube&#039;s.  Now, the &quot;Lube Center&quot; on the other hand is hot.  I think they&#039;re a DC area chain, but they&#039;re usually pretty good.  And SUPER friendly which is refreshing.
@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - I promise people will like reading your blog too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Serendipity&lt;/b&gt; - Great job!
@&lt;b&gt;doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh I think I&#039;ll need you to come over and check out all the lights that are still ON in my car! haha... &quot;Service SSS&quot; &quot;Check air conditioning&quot; etc etc,  haha... one step at a time!
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - haha... LOVE your 11 year old!  you should have him guest post for you one day :)
@&lt;b&gt;Everyday Tips&lt;/b&gt; - Hate that feeling too - even when you get a good deal you kinda wonder if you&#039;re getting ripped off :(
@&lt;b&gt;BruceBucks&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah dog, do it!  I guarantee you&#039;ll get a lower price.
@&lt;b&gt;Pretty Unfamous&lt;/b&gt; - Nope, in MD they have separate stations set up specifically for Emissions :)  Gotta go elsewhere to fix it, which is kinda good and kinda bad.
@&lt;b&gt;Andi B. @ Modern Tightwad&lt;/b&gt; - For sure, good point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something that helps with mechanics is don&#039;t ask what&#039;s wrong with the car, because then you&#039;ll get a laundry list. For something like not passing smog/DEQ ask them what the minimum repair you can do that will most likely get you to pass. The difference between those two questions can be immense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Was the $3000 price tag at the shop you had the emissions test done? If so, they probably get away with charging higher prices because most people are too lazy to go anywhere else to fix their problems!  But great job with looking around. I&#039;m glad it saved you a bundle!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is a great reminder. My wife and I are looking for new tires, and I went to Discount Tires to get a quote. I shouldn&#039;t just settle for that original quote, I could get another estimate from Evans tire, and propose them the quote I received from Discount Tire. Make the two companies fight a little for my business.  Thanks for the reminder.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh it is a giant pain to call around, but it is almost always worth it.  I hate when I get a mechanic&#039;s estimate because no matter what, I feel like I am getting ripped off.

Great job- enjoy your savings!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My car needs some transmission work that my mechanic is telling me will cost at least $1500.  My 11yr old just advised me today to get a second opinion.  I listen to J Money and my 11yr old- you are both SO smart!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is that saying ... &quot;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder?&quot; ....

Yeah well so is the damn bill!  Automobiles are the biggest sham in this world aside from a government job!  They have issues and codes that only can be read with equipment that mechanics have.  Each mechanic is going to tell you a different damn story.  Makes me sick, so I bought a damn Check engine light reader myself, read the codes in and do some research on google to get the real story straight. 

Good thing you got that next opinion there J$.  Didn&#039;t want to see the Caddy go bye bye!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This happened to me with my old Toyota. Pep Boys told me my oil pan was smashed and my axels were severely damaged ( ummm) and it was going to cost 1,200 to repair. I took it to a different mechanic and it turned out the gasket on the actual pan was stripped which was 30 bucks. And my axels were fixed for 150. Add some labor and I was at 270. Pays to shop around, especially for a car.]]></description>
