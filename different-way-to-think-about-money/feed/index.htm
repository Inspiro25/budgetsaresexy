well, I only remembered like 30 of them when I first published the post, and then over time I recalled others (and started new gigs as well!) and continued to update the post.

But yeah - it looks like I&#039;m averaging a little over 1 job per year of my life :) I&#039;m now at 40 jobs total, boy...]]></description>

It sure did taste good. First of all it was fresh corn from her farm and nothing is like fresh picked food. Second, it was the first time I was trading medical services for food and the experience itself was very much fun. Even the thought of it still makes me giggle. She thought I made her day by taking corn as payment, and to this day I think she made my day by offering me corn instead of payment. I don&#039;t remember payment methods of any other patients except than her for the 13 years I practiced and had an office. She sure made an impression.]]></description>
