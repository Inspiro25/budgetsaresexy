Yeah! Do it sooner than later, and get a friend who&#039;s good with tech to help :) Switching over was one of the best moves I made but there was a lot of things to figure out that I didn&#039;t know jack about... One of my friends, Grayson, helps out with this stuff if you want to ping him: http://www.debtroundup.com/hire-me/]]></description>

I was blog stalking you, looking for the post that launched your career when I found this comment.  Yikes!  I&#039;m currently on Blogger and know that I&#039;ll eventually migrate over to WP and I&#039;m not looking forward to it.   Any tips for making the move?]]></description>

Hey! Haha... yeah - all my comments got wiped away when I moved over from Blogger years ago (remember them?) so looks like I sucked during the early years of blogging - hah.

Lovely to see you here in either case, friend! And a very merry blogiversary to you too! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks man :)  Great idea about saving the ones you want to spend more time on later too.  I&#039;ve been skimming a lot these days (off the iPhone) and if I don&#039;t mark it for later use I forget to go back.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#039;s to another 2 years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know when I had found yours, but you&#039;re blog is one of the last ones that I will read in my reader everyday.  Which is a good thing, because I want to save the best for last knowing that I won&#039;t be just skimming over it because it is simply a new credit card or another post about spend less than you earn.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the posts that are as fun to read and it will continue to grow!]]></description>
