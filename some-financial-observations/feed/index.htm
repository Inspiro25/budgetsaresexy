Haha - you can make the hat yourself! Make it a date night :)

(And good way of thinking of it too to hire others for things - I like that)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I forgot that a sitter left your kids unattended by water!!! AGH!  

Not gonna lie, I want that dinosaur hat. Does she she babysit adults?

To me, it does not feel like cheating to use my money to complete certain tasks. I do not have every skill in the world and I only have so much time and energy. I think of it as contributing to the economy. I can focus on my business if I am not too busy trying to master many little skills that I could easily pay someone else to complete.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money,
I have some random foreign coins sitting around in a box from when I traveled around Europe, like 20 years ago before they switched to the Euro. For all of the help I&#039;ve received from your financial blogs, I&#039;d love to send them to you as a small token (get it?) of my gratitude. Shoot me an email if you&#039;d like.

Me too, friend :) And the people I was referring to above were mainly the ones who go around bragging about how fancy or expensive their new kitchens or additions were as if they were doing all the work themselves. With enough money ANYONE could make stuff look great! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry about hydrant accident.  I&#039;d say use a sharpie or spray paint since the paints chips doesn&#039;t look that huge.
Man good find on the sitter, hopefully you can keep her for while.  She&#039;s pretty creative with the Halloween costumes especially using tissue boxes for dinosaur feet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;ALL&quot; we did was open our wallets for our reno? Do you not understand how painful that was for me??? ;D I kid. Not about the pain. It was painful. But we are not cool or handy enough to emulate Mr 1500&#039;s house DIY and we only had 12 weeks to completely make over a whole house so DIY was not an option. We did learn so much about houses, guts and all, going through this though, I&#039;m glad we worked with the person that we did. 

All joking aside, I completely understand losing interest once you took the &quot;easy&quot; way out. So often we forget that the journey is the point, more than the end goal, when we get used to doing it the easy but $$ way. I&#039;m glad we&#039;re in a community where it&#039;s easy to remember how to get back to our roots!]]></description>
