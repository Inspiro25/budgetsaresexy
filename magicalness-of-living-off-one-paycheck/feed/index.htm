					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Savvy Scot&lt;/b&gt; - Go for it! You can always spend it later if you change your mind, right? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ Afford Anything&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... is that actually not a real word? If it isn&#039;t, it should be!
@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - Well good that you&#039;re on the right track now and DOING something about it :) That&#039;s the hardest part really - realizing you&#039;re in trouble and then ACTING on it. A lot of people tend to just hid their heads in the sand, so congrats on starting the process :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carlos Sera&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I wouldn&#039;t turn one of those down if you&#039;re offering ;)
@&lt;b&gt;K.K. @ Living Debt Free Rocks!&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!! What a great month to kick it all outta there too - December is my favorite :) You better invite me to your blog party!
@&lt;b&gt;Alexis Marlons&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! You totally should :) Once the savings start adding up over time - and you don&#039;t touch it - everything really seems to fall into place. That was the hardest thing for me to realize a while back - that you always have to be moving FORWARD with money or you&#039;re on the wrong track. This is why I always review and pay attention to my net worth updates. If I start seeing a trend going down I KNOW for a fact I need to make a change - rather than me *thinking* I need to make a change or not. For years I thought I was saving and doing good but the numbers told me differently ;) So good job if you can start focusing on it more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m excited for you!  I agree that being able to live on one paycheque is the making for a very sound financial future.  The hubby and I will save around 50% of our after tax earnings once we kick debt&#039;s ass to the curb in Dec 2012...I&#039;ll be throwing a blog party when that happens!  Essentially we&#039;d be able to live off of one of our paycheque which is a very nice feeling.  Also kudos to making a concerted effort to spend time with your son :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live on one paycheck.  Its not easy.  Its probably how I got into deep doo doo!   These days I can&#039;t / don&#039;t charge anything.  I am beginning to be quite the planner/cutter backer in order to have fun.

Its not easy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha... you guy sure did like to attach to that car section didn&#039;t you! :) All great comments for sure though, so thanks.

To answer your question(s) on why we need an SUV over a larger or other car, it&#039;s mainly because we could then use it for OTHER things too - like hauling stuff back and forth from stores, yard sales, thrift stores, consignments, etc. And maybe one day when I win my first storage unit auction! Haha...

We figure if we&#039;re gonna go out and buy a new (to us) car, then it might as well kill a bunch of birds with one stone. And an SUV or bigger would accomplish that - just not a minivan, yet ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Travis&lt;/b&gt; - COOL!! I like that idea!! And I think we could actually do that around my place too - I&#039;m gonna look into that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Walnut&lt;/b&gt; - See above :)
@&lt;b&gt;catherine&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a good idea too! Working part-time like that :) It&#039;s a hard trade off for sure at times (money vs time?), but we do the best we can!
@&lt;b&gt;Leah&lt;/b&gt; - See above :)
@&lt;b&gt;L Bee and the Money Tree&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe yeah? I try and not blog *too much* about him so it doesn&#039;t turn into a daddy blog, but it is getting harder over time as he affect so MUCH of our lives and finances! Haha... so I&#039;m glad you enjoy them :)
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! So far at least ;) We&#039;ll see how long this bliss can last!
@&lt;b&gt;@LisaLightnerLL&lt;/b&gt; - Haha oh yeah - having kids def. makes you realize how easier/simpler/more money you had back then! I&#039;m glad y&#039;all are living the dream schedule now though - congrats :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah doggy it will! You&#039;re a nice bf/fiance/future husband!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mandy @MoneyMasterMom&lt;/b&gt; - Haha no, but I DO like the voting idea for future stuff - thanks for the idea ;) And as of now that money WILL be going towards our 2nd mortgage still - I&#039;m excited!! I want to be like YOU!
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Good good, I love hearing that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - Haha okay, you caught me - It IS a need over a want ;) But for me since I don&#039;t want ANY new car or loans, I&#039;m making it a requirement that we get a car that does more than just get us from point A to B safely. It&#039;s gotta serve a lot of other purposes or else we might as well just keep using my larger Caddilac! As far as the $66k in savings, that will most def. be staying no matter what. I promised the wife :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB @ Finanical Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! And keep up blogging about how dreams can be done on the cheap! We really CAN live off less and have fun if we really wanted to - it usually just takes something outside of our control to force us into it ;) But the more we do it on our own before that happens, the better! Keep it up, my friend! - GO SCHOOL!!
@&lt;b&gt;Holly@ClubThrifty&lt;/b&gt; - Haha nice. Send us a pic when it becomes a reality! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Nooooo idea yet.. I go back and forth between a sexy fancy one (like Benz or Beemer), and then back to a more conservative one ;) I&#039;m pretty sure the latter will win, but for now I&#039;m enjoying keeping the dream alive, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! That&#039;s true too... I think I&#039;d sleep better with an extra loan on the docket than with thousands less in our savings, so if that&#039;s the case I&#039;m totally cool with the extra car payments. Plus, having payments usually gets you to not only pay them OFF faster, but also *appreciate* what your money has just bought! When it gets taken out in a large chunk all at once, you only feel the sting once and then it&#039;s onward with your life ;) With loans it&#039;s a constant reminder! Haha... Hope you have a great week over there, my friend :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yay, so glad your new schedule is working out so well for you guys!!

And your second-to-last paragraph is pretty much my personal finance mantra.  Living below our means has allowed us to deal with all the curveballs life has thrown at us so far, and the additional income we&#039;ll be getting from my husband&#039;s new job gives us even more options in terms of paying down debt, saving more, AND still having some money left over for the fun stuff.

And as you know, I tooootally get your aversion to car payments.  But honestly, if you can afford it and you can get a good interest rate, why not get something more practical?  I hate having those car payments, true, but it&#039;s a big relief to have cars that are (a) reliable and (b) will work better for our growing family. :-)]]></description>
