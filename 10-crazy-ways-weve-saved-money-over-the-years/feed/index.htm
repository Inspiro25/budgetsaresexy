I guess it depends if your family lives within 15 min. walk to some stores, services, park, safe routes for cycling and transit. That&#039;s the benchmark used in the urban planning world for liveable neighbourhoods. 

I&#039;ve been car-free for most of my life...past 45 yrs.  I didn&#039;t like driving and gave up license when I was 21 yrs.  I&#039;ve been cycling as part of my lifestyle for past 31 yrs. In winter it&#039;s transit, walking.

Grocery shopping includes a few key large ethnic supermarkets which are more cost-effective than same ingredients at a hipster store.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We do a prepaid plan from TMO, just over $30/month for two lines with unlimited talk and text &#038; 3GB data each. We bought our phones outright and brought them onboard. I&#039;ve been very happy with it and we save so much over a traditional phone plan. 

Although it&#039;s no longer a possibility for me due to moving further away from work, I lived without a car for several years and walked/biked/used public transit. It was great for fitness and the budget!

We&#039;ve stayed in the 900 sq. ft. &quot;starter home&quot; my hubby bought in 2013. The mortgage is under $500 with property taxes and home insurance included. Utilities are fairly inexpensive as well.

I use the library for books, DVDs, eBooks/eAudiobooks, etc...saves so much money!

I have been pescatarian for over 8 years. Good for the budget, better for the environment, fantastic for animal welfare, and excellent for health.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So many other companies that INCLUDE 4G and 5G for $15/mo.  Seriously check out mint they are on TMO.  Although, I&#039;m with you, when I was on wifi only it didn&#039;t seem that bad.  Almost everywhere you go there is wifi.]]></description>

Yup, still with them! But when they moved to DISH it got all sorts of wonky and my wife couldn’t take it anymore so she switched to T-Mobile too, lol… She now pays 3x what I do (!!), however her calls and texts go through seamlessly now while mine like to disappear &#128514;]]></description>
