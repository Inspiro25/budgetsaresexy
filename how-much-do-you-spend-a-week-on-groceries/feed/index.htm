					<description><![CDATA[$65-$75 per week.
PLUS I put $10-$20 per week into a savings account, which I use to purchase an eighth of a cow and participate in a CSA. These two things together cost $900. Altogether, it works out to be $345 per month. 

– Number of family members (including pets): 3 (2 adults, 1 toddler) + 1 small dog
– City of where you live: Between Philadelphia and Lancaster
– Does this include toiletries &#038; other non-food things? No. Also does not include dog food. We budget $85 monthly for those things ($45 for dog food and $40 for toiletries, household goods, laundry detergent, etc)
– Does this include alcohol? No. We budget $70 monthly for this.
– Does this include eating out? No. We eat out usually twice a month - once as a family (usually something cheap like pizza, burgers, etc) and once as a date night, and then couple nice coffees or ice creams each throughout the month. We budget $85 total monthly for eating out.
– These numbers make me: Proud!

We eat mostly organic and local whole foods. I love to bake too. I think we do fairly well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$295/avg per week 2018.  
Number of family members (including pets): __4_____
– City of where you live: ___Raleigh____
– Does this include toiletries &#038; other non-food things? _Yes____
– Does this include alcohol? __Yes, limited____
– Does this include eating out? __No___
– These numbers make me __Curious___  (happy? proud? frightened?)
I stockpile food!  I joke that we could eat for 2 months on what we have on hand.. and only have to buy perishables.  But, like your wife, I love to cook, most meals are made from scratch, and are more complex than what most folks that I know prepare on a daily basis.  We rarely eat out.  I keep saying I&#039;m going to scale back..    Maybe this year.  I have vowed that I will plan our meals with what we have on hand, until the freezers are scaled back.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am on a fixed income and I am trying to shrink the way I buy things. My only problem I have is that my son has Down Syndrome and on the Autism spectrum and for this, he doesn&#039;t like a lot of foods. I am constantly buying anything that is pizza related.. totino pizzas, hot pockets, pizza rolls, pizza puffs.. etc., this alone makes very difficult to try and buy more to last for the month. I don&#039;t know how to stretch the little I have to last..]]></description>

Oh wow - that&#039;s high! But nothing you can&#039;t change if you really want to! :) Take out alone is usually the biggest culprit for people. Maybe try a &quot;no spend&quot; month and see how it goes? (outside of bills/needs/etc)]]></description>

Well don&#039;t feel TOO ashamed about it - this is exactly why you&#039;re on $$ blogs! To help get it all better :) And those dietary restrictions are pretty tough as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[6 People
Suburban MD
Includes Household (TP, cleaners, etc)
Includes occasional Wine
Doesn&#039;t include Drinks Out and Eating Out.

Weekly Average, based on Monthly Actuals .... (whimper) ...  $425

It makes me feel ashamed and foolish, honestly.  I had us budgeted for $1,200 / month.  We&#039;ve got two celiac and three dairy intolerants, and the spouse only wants to eat organic.  But even then it should be way lower.]]></description>
