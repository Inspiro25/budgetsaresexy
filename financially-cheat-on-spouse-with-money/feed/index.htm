					<description><![CDATA[Hi There!  Long time no read!  I wont disclose my lack of worth for a long time because if a guy finds out how far I am in the hole (Sallie Mae) I&#039;d die a lonely cat lady!  So, I wont disclose until I&#039;m making some money.  However, I do have the resources to inquire about him, and I will.  A guy with a bad credit score and poor money management skills won&#039;t get far with me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh that&#039;s an interesting position to be in - esp if you both adamently want one answer over the other, I can see how bad that could be :(  I hope it all worked out in the end and your friend is okay now!
@&lt;b&gt;Kira&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, lots of hidden money secrets there :)  It seems you have good reasons for it though, I&#039;d probably stay hush on certain things too.  And I&#039;m sure I have in the past that I can&#039;t remember right now, esp when it comes to friends.
@&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt; - I agree - togetherness is very important.  With everythong, not just finances.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honesty is really best. When we think beyond partners, I would only hope my parents could be candid with me about finances, especially as they get older so I could honor their wishes if anything would happen. I don&#039;t think everyone needs to know whenever I buy a coffee but the big stuff should definitely be disclosed and financial decisions, when in a couple, should always be made and followed together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As the only earner in the house, I have not lied to my boyfriend about how dire the situation is. He knows the exact amout he has cost me over the years to the cent, the exact amount of my non-retirement savings (0!) and debt burden. He also knows what my  current net worth is all the time, since I keep track of that every month and share my little successes.

I have lied to my parents about money, though. My brother was in the UK and had a pretty long streak of unemployment after he graduated from a university there (about 6 months). I sent him about $3,000 and lied to them about it when they asked if I did. The truth has since come out, he has a good job and I am in the process of getting it back in the form of free trips to Europe :))) They also don&#039;t know what my current debt is. They do know what my current net worth is and how much I have saved in my 401K for retirement, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not in a relationship anymore, but definitely have lied about finances when I had to support a family member (like $4k or they would lose their car to the bank, therefore loss their job).

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, indeed - it can be fun :)  As long as you&#039;re happy!
@&lt;b&gt;JMK&lt;/b&gt; - I can def. see your point on that one - and it may be the case for other couples, I&#039;m not sure - but I know for us we make sure the house and retirement money and 100% of the big stuff is all covered first before we have extra to spend as we please with. Whether that&#039;s $100 a month or $1,000 a month extra - so when our retirement comes, we&#039;ll both be fine and maybe one will have a little extra more than the other - but that&#039;s their call.  I like to spend my side money freely w/out any hassles and I know the wife likes it too, it&#039;s been working like a charm for 5+ years now :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jerry&lt;/b&gt; - Amen, brotha.
@&lt;b&gt;Thomas - Ways to Invest Money&lt;/b&gt; - I think as long as both sides are in agreement it&#039;s a-okay ;)  If I have $10k more than the wife has, and for some reason she needs some for whatever, of course I&#039;m gonna help her cuz she&#039;s my wife.   And everything that&#039;s a *necessity* would have already been covered in our joint accounts anyways.  These side accounts of ours are just extras, nothing more. If we wanted we could just dump it all back into our joint savings and and spend it from there too if we want, but we like keeping that purely for doing stuff together and for house/etc emergency expenses.  But it&#039;s not for everyone :)
@&lt;b&gt;pedro&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the same kinds of lies we&#039;re talkin&#039; about here, but I am glad y&#039;all have a good system down that makes you happy :)
@&lt;b&gt;Yesenia&lt;/b&gt; - Very true, indeed :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff Crews&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I can get down w/ that.
@&lt;b&gt;C The Writer&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, are things now better for you and the cards? You workin&#039; on a nice debt plan? Hope so :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ Debt-Tips&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s understandable. Maybe you can just review things for a hot 15 mins once a month or something? Or at least refresh each other&#039;s memories on where things can be found if ever needed?  We try and do that here pretty frequently, but every now and then we forget and take long breaks too... I gotta get back into the habit of it again, so thanks for the reminder :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  We&#039;ll def. have to find each other once we&#039;re all there, that&#039;s exciting :)]]></description>
