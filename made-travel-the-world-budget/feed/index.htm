Great post, Chris and best wishes to you and Lori on this global adventure.  I have been to Kerala and it&#039;s called God&#039;s Own Country in India. &lt;a&gt; Their tourism website &lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start your research.  India itself has so many nice places to see even before you leave that country to see other Asian sights.  I wish you both the best in this brave and exciting sojourn to the world&#039;s many great sights.]]></description>

Time to start rocking those freelancing gigs now so you can carry them with you along your travels! And will help speed up the $$$ savings at the same time here :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing such a great story! I was thinking about leaving my job this summer to travel however after reading your story I have come to the conclusion that I most certainly do not have enough saved up for this.  I put aside one year&#039;s worth of expenses but forgot to account for the actual travel expenses, I suppose I was kind of hoping to fund my travels with freelancing gigs.  I do have two cute yorkies so maybe I will look into the pet modeling idea :)

Thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woah, two years of travel with your fiancee sounds incredible. I think you were smart to have vague outlines instead of concrete plans. Things can change so rapidly, including weather and desire. Bon voyage!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome story! #jealous

I wish I had done what you&#039;re doing when I was in my 20s or early 30s. Now some things at home are tying me down, but perhaps in my 40s I&#039;ll do a super travel experience like this. I suspect that will put me in a minority demographically, but that&#039;s ok, I don&#039;t mind being a bit of a weirdo.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/made-travel-the-world-budget/#comment-245636&quot;&gt;Fiscally Free&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m still a little sore about the repeal/replace efforts, so I won&#039;t comment here :-) But I hear you.

And totally agree about Centra/South America - we may end up opting to slim down the list of destinations in order to enjoy it more!]]></description>

Thanks! Our total savings for two years of travel is just north of $100K, but I hope that number is taken with a grain of salt - no one needs that much to have months/years of fantastic travel experiences (we just wanted to travel a certain way, so it was our personal goal)!

And we&#039;ll definitely do a recap after our first big trip (Asia - current in India!) this Spring to see how well we fared versus our budget. I&#039;m already noticing that we didn&#039;t budget in enough for country-to-country flights - some are more expensive than I&#039;d originally seen.]]></description>
