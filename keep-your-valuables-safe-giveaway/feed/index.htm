					<description><![CDATA[The one thing I would grab would be my computer tower.  Assuming of course that all my family is safe, the tower represents my life almost entirely.  It contains my financial information, my link to needed services (and Budgets Are $exy) and online communication with everyone, as well as a storage unit for family photos.  Yup, that would be my &quot;grab&quot;.  Thanks, 
Mike]]></description>
