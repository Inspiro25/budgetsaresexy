are you comparing the same model car though? and other expenditures that your coworker is paying too? if you&#039;re driving a BMW and she&#039;s in a Hyundai it&#039;ll be quite different ;)]]></description>

Agree with you 100%. It&#039;s all about doing what works best for YOU. Sometimes (most times) that&#039;s buying used, and other times it&#039;s new w/ all those great perks like you mentioned. I&#039;ve never driven a new one off the lot myself, but I know plenty of others who have who are pretty happy out it. So do your thang! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2 year old Honda CRV&#039;s were only 2000 less than brand new and were almost out of warranty on mileage.  And carried a higher percentage rate for the loan. With the new car 0% interest 0 miles I also got 5 complimentary oil changes and inspections for life of ownership. Free tire replacement if I run over a nail or have a blow out. Free fixing of dings if someone dings my car in the parkinglot for 1 year. Free key replacement. I intend to drive the car until it actually dies which is the only reason I bought brand new. I also am paying it off in 8 months.  It is not stupid to buy a new car in 100% of cases. It is however stupid for SOME people to buy a new car I would agree. Depreciation only matters if I intended to sell it as soon as I drove it off the lot or 30 days later, which is not the case so therfore irrelevant.  The last used car I had was 2 years old. Car fax was clean but after an incident where my daughter bumped into farm equipment while reversing the person I hired to fix it told me it was rearended and showed me the evidence. Which explained the thousands and thousands of dollars I poured into it over 6 years.  And the gas mileage I was robbed of due to engine problems that were covered up that the first 4 mechanics didnt realize.  I could have had a new car. Not to mention what my daughter went through with the used car she bought.  Ill never buy used again. My opinion of course. I already know you all disagree and that is ok. You are right for you. There is no firm right or wrong here. Its purely circumstance and certainly I have emotional bagage haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny!  

NB and I drive a 12 year old Civic with 230,000 miles.  And I love it.  I learned to drive in this car when it was my parents&#039; and I will continue to drive it until it falls apart on the road (which nearly happened a few months ago - timing belt broke).  NB does all our repairs and maintenance and our 12 month rolling avg auto expenses have never exceeded $25/month.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOVE THIS.  

I&#039;m driving a 2003 Toyota Matrix.  I love it.  I truly am happy with that car, and have been since the day that I stupidly purchased it brand-new.  Hopefully I&#039;m making up for my idiocy in driving it to the ground.  It just hit 170,000 miles, and it&#039;s never had a major breakdown.  It gets 35 mpg highway, and it takes a 50 mph rear-end collision like a champ.  I love the car, because I know it&#039;s not going to hurt me. (Those gigantic plastic bumpers have saved my life twice already!)

I had the windshield repaired today, and was waxing sentimental with the repair technician who commented that it was a great car (I hear this everywhere I go). It&#039;s like having an old dog--knowing its end is nearing, but not knowing exactly when that day will come.  I hope to get another 5 years out of it--and then I may just buy another one, just a few years newer. 

Side note: When driving an elderly car, use some restraint people.  Frequently I see a $500 car with $2,000 wheels and a $1,500 sound system.  When I see the inverse wheels-to-car-value ratio, my very first thought is &quot;this person is not saving for his/her retirement.&quot;  Oh, and the 1984 minivan with the big spinner wheels.... the wheels did NOT improve the &quot;cool factor&quot; of that vehicle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never really bought the depreciation argument. Who says that cars loose value? Despite what KBB may say about the value of my car, to me it&#039;s worth as much as it would take to replace it. I&#039;ve never sold or traded in a car in my life. Only junked them..]]></description>
