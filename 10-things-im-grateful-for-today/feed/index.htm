					<description><![CDATA[I am always supremely thankful for my supportive husband, friends, and family.  Specifically today, I am thankful that KFC has a $2 deal that includes a drumstick, a thigh, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, and a biscuit (that I&#039;ll eat at least half of whether Weight Watchers likes it or not).  :-)  Yay for a cheap dinner!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also VERY thankful for my healthy family &amp; friends too, btw. My wife pointed out that she was not on here, but I was trying to relate the post to finances!!! haha... so yes, honey, I am very happy to have you in my life ;)  (awwwwwwwww)

Some responses:

@&lt;b&gt;Niki&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah they are. Just ate 3 more today ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kristy H.&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s cute :)
@&lt;b&gt;Beckey &amp; Jeff&lt;/b&gt; - Woo! Never heard of that coffeee combo, pretty interesting.
@&lt;b&gt;Starla&lt;/b&gt; - hahahahha... love your great dane!
@&lt;b&gt;Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - True dat.
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - Grapes?  I&#039;ll give it a shot!
@&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth Hernandez&lt;/b&gt; - Yayyyy! And now it&#039;s Saturday :)
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m so glad you enjoyed this post - thanks for telling me!  Hope you&#039;re having a blast w/ the kiddies!
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, that&#039;s killer.
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel211&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  Skype is really REALLY good for that!
@&lt;b&gt;sarah&lt;/b&gt; - haha, I&#039;m not even going to ask what that last one on the list is ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah blogs!!! Going to check out yours after I post this :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh Diet Coke used to be my fave!  Gave most of it up a few years ago, but every now and then I indulge and feel a bit drunk after a D. Coke - love it :) And yup! Got the tunes but haven&#039;t listened to yet -- been hectic here.  Will soon tho, thx!
@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha.... dishwashers.  Yes, def. good :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nate St. Pierre&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!!!  Dude, seriously - we are going to ROCK. THAT.  It&#039;s been on my mind for hours now. Reall appreciate you too, bro :)
@&lt;b&gt;Peliroo&lt;/b&gt; - I like that you said living in America.  So many people have no idea how drastically different it is outside of this country, esp in the less-fortunate areas.  We didn&#039;t get to choose where we were born, so thanking our odds is very very important.  We do have it good here despite the stuff people complain about.  Thanks for the reminder :)
@&lt;b&gt;Shay&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;d rather be PLAYING basketball than watching it, but yeah - still good ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - You are too funny :)  I remember missing Ice after being in London for a week or so too.  Such a tiny little thing that brings joy!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - YES to being able to breath. Man, we are so blessed!  (and what the heck is Throwback Soda?)  Glad you enjoyed this post :)
@&lt;b&gt;Debra&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww cool!!  Expose that baby to lots of blogs while he/she&#039;s young and he/she&#039;ll grow up to be a president! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Debbie Beardsley&lt;/b&gt; - OH yeah!  that&#039;s where I got the idea from actually - Thin Mints!  mmmmmm...
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh I have to start taking those naps too actually - right after lunch?  the best!!  will be like kindergarten all over again, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;L.G.&lt;/b&gt; - Scary!!! Thank goodness all is good now :)  At least I think, all the way?

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nice to stop and show some gratitude once in a while.  I&#039;m grateful for:

1. My family including the most precious grandson!
2. Having a job I enjoy and pays pretty good throughout the recession.
3. Pizza!
4. A great cup of coffee in the morning.
5. Getting to meet so many great people online.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am also big time thankful for Skype. It allows me to see &#038; hear the people I love dearly despite the fact that I&#039;m living in Cambodia. Hella awesome. Oh, and I can call my 85 year old grandfather (who will not learn to use the internet) on his home phone for like $0.02 a minute - also hella awesome. 

Other things I&#039;m grateful for: my upcoming trip to the USA to see family and friends, the fact that I&#039;m on vacation right now, having a job I love, being apart of amazing side hustles (ahem, love drop!), + the incredible community I&#039;ve found online (you, Nate, + all of our twitter friends). 

Oh! Since I&#039;m in Thailand - pad thai + mango sticky rice for like $1 each. I&#039;m pretty grateful for that too.

Have an awesome weekend, J!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m thankful I got paid today.. I&#039;m thankful that I ETS&#039;d from the Army on the 28th of February, and wasn&#039;t told I have to work and not get paid.. 
I&#039;m pissed that my friends, most of whom have families will not get paid if a budget doesn&#039;t go through, and that my friends in Germany won&#039;t have a commissary to go get food at.. I hope this doesn&#039;t last too long, cause overnighting stuff to Germany isn&#039;t cheap!!]]></description>
