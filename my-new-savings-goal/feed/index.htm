					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;cg&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you though!  Maxing out both your 401k AND you Roth is genius, I 100% always recommend doing that :)  But I see your point on not being able to really touch it if you retired at 50.  In fact, I never even thought about that myself!  I think for me I&#039;m going to keep maxing both out until the day I go full-time by myself, and then see how much (if any) I have to play with/invest after all expenses are paid each month.  If I have a lot, I&#039;ll probably keep increasing my cash fund and nix major retirement ones for at least a year or two.... maybe I&#039;ll do the self-employed IRA. 
@&lt;b&gt;Serendipity&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, i love how we find all this stuff fun :)  we are so nerdy like that.
@&lt;b&gt;Moneyedup&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s an interesting way of thinking of things actually - what you&#039;re NOT saving for... I might have to use that as a future post, thx!
@&lt;b&gt;One Frugal Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah it&#039;s def hard trying to find the best way to enjoy your time &amp; money NOW, while at the same time doing it down the road too.  I don&#039;t think working for yourself is good for everyone (maybe not even 75% of the general population, BUT if you can find something you&#039;re passionate about and really make a living from it I am 100% about it.  And until we reach that goal we just gotta hustle like a mother ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah Smith&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  Let&#039;s both do it at the same time!!!  Not sure if I&#039;ll get my hands on another $25k by then, but it&#039;s well worth a shot :) We need to spend our time working for US, and not corporatins who profit off us like crazy and can fire us at any point in time.
@&lt;b&gt;Miss Jane&lt;/b&gt; - Saweet.
@&lt;b&gt;Jimmy&lt;/b&gt; - Damn, good job on that house paid off part!  That&#039;s really incredible esp these days.  Let&#039;s cheer eachother on to make $50k!
@&lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; - That porsche is a nice idea :)  Rental house is good too, I&#039;m just over the whole real estate stuff right now.  If you can rock it more power to you.
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Cash is most certainly King.  The more you have saved, the bigger your pool of options down the road!
@&lt;b&gt;Kay Lynn (Bucksome)&lt;/b&gt; - You and me both ;)  I&#039;m pretty sure I can last at least 2 months 100% by myself, but unless I start working out of coffee shops &amp; libraries I may start getting antsy not being around people.  If that happens, I&#039;ll have to submit my applications for Starbucks and/or a bartender position ;)  That way I can still do my own thing AND check off some of my dream jobs!

Here&#039;s the rest of the list too if you&#039;re interested in reading:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/10-awesome-jobs-to-try-some-day/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;10 Jobs I&#039;d Like to Try Some Day&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the information... I feel much better knowing that I am not alone in the rarity of building savings and living well below my means.  I have paid off my house last year and drive a 16 year old truck which has no signs of failing.  I have my 25k saved and was feeling &#039;funny&#039; that I had this saved while all my friends are in 50k debt or better.
I think I will try my goal of doubling my savings, much like yourself... if I get to that point, I can move where I want to live, find work, and buy another house.
Thanks again and great job. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The same exact thing, actually!  I love my job and love what I do - but I hate the corporate environment and the way people in my business act as if work is LIFE.  I know life is more than sitting in an office 50 hours a week, scheduling meetings and living live through email.  And so, my goal is to get to a point where I can work from home, work parttime, not work at all, or any combination of those things. ;)   I&#039;m aiming for the end of the year.]]></description>
