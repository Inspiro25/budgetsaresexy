					<description><![CDATA[Great article, it&#039;s scary to invest at first. The trick is to start slowly and build your way up. In my experience, anxiety around investing comes from not knowing WHY I was investing in what I was investing in. I used to let other people make my money decisions before me, and I used to get worried when the economy would go on a downturn. 

Now I know exactly what I&#039;m doing, so I don&#039;t get anxious when the markets dip. My advice to people who get anxious when thinking about investing is to do more study!

For most people, investing in a couple of cheap index funds is a GREAT option. This is an inexpensive way to get great diversification. And you don&#039;t have to spend 100s of hours tracking different stocks and you don&#039;t need a huge amount of money to get started!]]></description>

Oh wow!! Hard to really disagree with that too, if the $$ is being set aside for &quot;future business opportunities.&quot; At some point it WILL be spent, and only help increase y&#039;alls massive wealth too! So that should help you sleep better? :)]]></description>

The nice thing about businesses is it can be just as - if not better! - than IRAs and the like, so I give you mad respect for going down that path! Most millionaires/billionaires are businesses founders/owners :) Though of course the risks are much higher...]]></description>

Haha yup. I freaked out losing like $15.00 once, and now some days I &quot;lose&quot; $15,000 and don&#039;t even care! :)]]></description>

That would be cool, actually! Let me add it to my &quot;things to look into&quot; list... I could get down with that, as long as it doesn&#039;t come with a &quot;thumbs down&quot; button as there&#039;s enough hate in the world :(]]></description>

Haha - agreed :) I actually like the idea of calling it a &quot;cushion&quot; more too - it really is what it is since how often do *real* emergencies really occur? From the way people pull from it so often you&#039;d think it was a lot ;) (and I include myself in that group too!).

Great idea with the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario thinking, and about considering health stuff too... I know the younger we are it&#039;s the last thing we ever think about - even though health bombs can go off at any time :(]]></description>

I know, it&#039;s a sad realization but still very true :( You gotta find stuff to get at least a 6-7% return if you want any chance of retiring early - or hell, even on time. Unless again you&#039;re making bank or get lucky with an opportunity/business/lottery, etc. You can&#039;t get rich off cash, but you can certainly use cash to get rich!]]></description>

YES!!! Was just having this conversation with a 75 y/o at Starbucks the other day! And how everyone brushes him aside - especially with career-related stuff - even though his brain is full of stuff that takes us decades to learn. He was telling me how much he laughed at a recent grad that had started working at his company before he retired and how he was calling himself a &quot;specialist&quot; at the job because he got a degree in it :) My new friend was like, &quot;You come back to me in 30 years and then I&#039;ll give you the specialist certification&quot; haha...

					<description><![CDATA[Internet high five, LOLOLO! :)

I love cash baby cash! I can&#039;t get enough of it and am taking profits to pay for life. I can see the hesitation with investing now, so I would go a more conservative asset allocation e.g. 60/40, 50/50 stocks bonds.

Don&#039;t confuse a bull market with brains!
