					<description><![CDATA[Hi J.Money, I really appreciate u taking the time to write and share this article.The issue about &quot;How often a freelancers service is devalued&quot; struck a chord with me. I am a singer/performer. I cannot count the amount of times potential customers ask me to reconsider my price. Time after time it is the same however I know my worth. And eventually the right client knows that too!]]></description>

Man, I&#039;m glad. I started writing on a couple ideas I had and none of em really fit your blog until this one so I&#039;m glad you liked it. And the discussion was pretty interesting here, so why not :) you have some awesome readers!

@Aury
It is a great business. Not everyone has the mind to do computer work and everyone needs computer help now. When I ran my business full time, I did everything from networking to consulting on upgrades to training.

If you are considering going at it full time, an awesome book on the subject is: Start Your Own Computer Business ( http://amzn.to/dbwefc )

I read it and took a ton of ideas and advice from the book when I started my business years back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Computer repairs is one of the most awesome ways to start a personal, solo business. I absolutely love computers, and I&#039;ve been looking to study more ins and outs with it once I get myself a newer and better computer. My old one will sort of be my Frankenstein&#039;s monster. ;)

Solo self employment is a tricky thing since there&#039;s little room for cushion. Combining that with a side hustle is usually the best fallback, though.]]></description>

It&#039;s funny, they say do what you love and the money will follow but if you don&#039;t charge up to your full potential, you really can&#039;t sustain doing what you love. You will have to get another job and do what you love on the side, which is never as good :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh that is so true. It&#039;s way too easy to not charge enough or not believe enough in yourself. I think part of that is because things that we&#039;re used to doing &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; easy for us to do -- but they might be baffling to someone else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great points. I had an especially hard time determining my freelance rate. After my first few clients, I realized that I was providing something of real value to them and have since raised my rate. I&#039;ve yet to have anyone flinch at my rates because I&#039;m still a bargain since my overhead is so low.]]></description>

Thanks goodness for wives, mine does the same thing! Their loving support cannot even be measured.

@Sam

I do all kinds. Right now I am doing system administration, and do web design and software development consulting on the side. I also do some system administration consulting where I advise and perform network, server and system upgrades.]]></description>
