					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jessie&lt;/b&gt; - Hot damn, congrats!!!  It is all worth it indeed, my friend :)  Way to make me jealous, haha... keep it up!
@&lt;b&gt;JennyDee&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I hear ya on getting a new car -- mine&#039;s about to go too at any time and just dreading the idea of getting back out there and finding one I like again (which also fits the budget).  Hope you get a great deal out there!  Maybe your dream car will somehow magically appear at a low price ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I refied my house in December (closed in Feb) and was SHOCKED that my credit score was...779! I guess all that revolving credit I can&#039;t quite get rid of has paid off :/ 

Down to one credit card, but sadly, must now get a new car as mine is dying :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[809! 809! 809!

Sorry for the yelling, but I&#039;m just so excited to share that number with someone! While I have been pretty dilligent the last few years about requesting my credit report and checking for errors, I&#039;d never actually laid out the cash to get The Number...I figured it could wait until someday when I&#039;m in the market for a mortgage or whatever. I&#039;m still not ready to buy, but I&#039;m moving soon and the new landlord checked my credit score during the application process. I was absolutely delighted to see that pretty number on the paper. It happened at a great time, too, because lately I feel like I&#039;ve been suffering from frugality fatigue. All the saving and avoiding extra expenses and making dinner at home instead of going out was starting to feel a little stale, but finding out my score reminded me that it&#039;s totally worth it.]]></description>
