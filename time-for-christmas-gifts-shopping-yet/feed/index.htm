					<description><![CDATA[Nice! I&#039;m really loving that &quot;trading&quot; idea w/ gifts the more I hear it :) We used to do it every few years at parties and what not, but never at my own house. It&#039;s always so fun! And I&#039;d try and steal the lottery ones too - those were always my favorites as well.

Thanks for sharing! I&#039;m already missing the Christmas holiday so this is a nice refresher :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really horrendously behind in my reading but I wanted to share what we do.

When Christmas is spent with my family, the rule is if you&#039;re over 15, you bring two gifts worth approximately US$15-$20 each, and we do something similar to Travis @Debtchronicles above.  Pile them in the middle of the room, we sit in a circle, and draw numbers from a hat.  Person number one goes first and chooses a gift from the pile, but only by pointing and describing (so no squeezing and shaking). A child not involved in the scheme (they get their own gifts as usual, usually limited to $50 or so) delivers the selected gift which gets opened.  The second person (and subsequent people) then decide if they want to steal an already opened gift, or open a new one, but a gift can only be stolen twice before it&#039;s pronounced DEAD. If your gift gets stolen, you get another turn, and we work through in number order till everyone has one gift, whether dead or not. Then we work backwards in number order, stealing and unwrapping in amongst lots of hilarity. When there is only one unwrapped gift left in the pile, it is a frantic go around the group of &quot;what&#039;s dead?&quot; as opening the final gift means you&#039;re stuck with it and there&#039;s no more stealing.  The most stolen gifts are lottery/scratch tickets, and the teens involved usually buy two gifts they want, and the adults like to steal them to tease :)

A few years back, when one of my nephews was in his early teens and aspiring to be a chef, would spend the last few weeks of November making hoards of meals to pack into single serve containers, freeze them, and that would be his early combined birthday/Christmas gift to his two single (at the time) aunties living together who were usually too frantic to cook during December.  

As for gifting between myself and the other half, because our birthdays are in February and March respectively, and throw in Valentines, we spend about US$350-$400 to cover all three events. I didn&#039;t get a Christmas gift this time around, and my birthday marks possession date for our new home, I&#039;ve been told something great is coming after the move is done. I spent about $100 on his Christmas gift which came late, and I&#039;ll spend the remainder on something that he discovers he needs or wants once we&#039;ve moved. 

I&#039;m otherwise a grinch when it comes to gifts. I don&#039;t usually want them myself, so I don&#039;t give them, especially if I&#039;m not going to be there on the day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Where&#039;s your budget for Baby $? ;) Not that he really needs anything from you two... the grandparents are sure to spoil him enough for the whole family.

Anyway, I try to map out my Christmas spending in the first week or so of November. I&#039;ve already picked up one small gift and am plotting out what others might like. This year, I&#039;m only going to buy gifts for Mom, Dad, Baby Sis and Baby Bro. I might do some baking for when I visit friends in Victoria... but it&#039;s going to be a family-only Christmas for me this year! With that in mind, I&#039;d like to keep it in the $200-250 range.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;m1nt5&lt;/b&gt; - Nice work! That really is the best way to do it - pick up things throughout the year when you see stuff you know they&#039;ll like mixed in with being on sale! Cuz when you wait to the end, you get what you get!
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww... I shall second that ovation! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal @ Get A Copywriter&lt;/b&gt; - I think the $25 limit is a good and fair one. Plenty enough to find something really cool discounted down, or to even buy materials for to make something for them like you mention... A nice solid number :)
@&lt;b&gt;G. Jones&lt;/b&gt; - Heck yeah it is!! Maybe you&#039;ll motivate THEM to put getting out of debt up high on the priority list too! I think that&#039;s excellent - way to go :)
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahhaa... what do you call them if there&#039;s only ONE like I have? I like the posse idea! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, getting stuff locally and from cute little shops is awesome :) I find that enjoyable too.
@&lt;b&gt;Econowiser&lt;/b&gt; - I guess we like to mix the two? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Seth&lt;/b&gt; - Dirty Santa?? Is that a sexual term? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LB @ Finanical Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Actually you forgot someone else to buy for - ME! D&#039;uh ;) (And you were totally right - BEST. VIDEO. EVER.)
@&lt;b&gt;KitchenPenguin&lt;/b&gt; - There you go! Love that stuff!
@&lt;b&gt;GB @ In Budgets We Trust&lt;/b&gt; - Steal away! And soooo cool your friend runs a consignment shop! I&#039;m so jealous!!
@&lt;b&gt;Vangile Makwakwa&lt;/b&gt; - How fun! I have yet to visit Africa but it&#039;s on my list to do sometime in the near future :) I feel like it would be a nice drastic change from Europe and other places I&#039;ve been. Plus I gotta pick up some more foreign currency for my collection - woo!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a good idea :)
@&lt;b&gt;Megan&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!!! And even more so? Your bi-weekly craft nights!! I wanna join!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh Christmas! Probably my favourite holiday of the year.

My husband and I really emphasize home-made gifts for eachother, (winners so far: from him: portrait of us in pixels, from me: quilt made out of his old t-shirts) and we work together on making delicious foodstuffs and handicrafts for our friends. My family is hugely into gift giving but they&#039;re getting more and more into making things. 

I&#039;ve just started a bi-weekly craft night (wine and musicals -yes please) with some girlfriends which are dedicated to Xmas gift making. 

There is still some buying - mostly thoughtful trinkets or gags, and since I have 13 cousins and all of the associated aunts and uncles - that side of the family does an annual Secret Santa. One gift, $20 maximum. Most of our holiday budget goes into supplies - usually $150-$200 takes care of everyone on both sides as well as friends. The cost in time, of course, is astronomical - and that counts for a lot. But I try to just contrast that with the money I&#039;m not spending going to the movies or out for drinks instead. ;)

This post has made me so excited for Christmas - I can&#039;t wait now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow so glad I&#039;m spending Christmas in South Afrca this year and not in the Boston again. The culture in South Africa  is that kids get gifts and adults get each others&#039; company and laughter. So that being said I will probably buy my little cousin a doll and wine for Christmas lunch. I do think that shopping right now for your gifts is a smart move. You could probably get great deals on Amazon or eBay if you start looking now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing a lot of thinking about gift buying but haven&#039;t purchased yet.  That changes tomorrow.  A friend of mine runs a consignment shop and I just got a like-new designer bag (heavily discounted) put on hold for me via her page on Facebook.  Gift for my sis/matron of honor.  Been thinking of making home-made vanilla extract (w/ vodka and vanilla beans... super cheap) to fill some of the gaps in my budget.

I like the way you broke down your expected gift budget.  I&#039;m going to steal that idea, too, so thanks! :)]]></description>
