					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The 52-Week Savings Challenge&quot; - I love this one. But I do that backwards. First weeks of any challenge are normally easier due to novelty factor. So I take advantage of this. The challege gets easier every week which keeps me even more motivated.]]></description>

Hi Phillip, Colleen here from 365 Less Things. Sometimes &quot;things&quot; were collections of things like the pile of computer cords you spoke of here. I think we have had a few cable roundups over the last three years. Some things that were small or collected up in one effort got lumped together and called a thing. I think if I counted every little thing it would possibly added up to thousands. At the end of each year that I have been doing this (three years now) I have put a photo collage or slide show the decluttered items on my blog. It sure does look impressive when they are all lumped together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/personal-finance-declutter-challenges/#comment-113758&quot;&gt;David B&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi David, Colleen here from 365 Less Things. I have made several thousand dollars on the things I have sold on eBay, to friends and to other member of a local Facebook group I am involved in.

The biggest financial gain form my challenge was from of stemming to tide of stuff coming in. Basically I quit shopping. I only buy things if in absolutely need them.

Freecycle.org is a great way to get rid of things that for some reason aren&#039;t suitable to sell or donate. Just because something doesn&#039;t work doesn&#039;t mean no one would want it. People love to tinker with stuff and it is always best to try to find a taker rather than send things to landfill.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually inadvertently started the getting rid of clutter challenge but I even up the ante by trying to make money on the things that were at least useful even if they&#039;ve signed their purpose for me, I had a few old phone and electronics so I posted them on eBay made a few hundred bucks on them and now I caught the bug and have been going through everything on the house that I no longer need it use and plan to post the better condition items on eBay my wife thought I was crazy at first (she&#039;s s but of a hoarder) but now that she&#039;s seen the extra income shes jumped on board we also started the 52 week challenge via Facebook and are doing it separately at the end of the year we will pool it together to have double the savings]]></description>
