Haha yup! Kid stuff is a whole other ballgame :) But you&#039;re right that it&#039;ll take some damn good communication around it when/if the time comes...In fact, having an entire &quot;Life Talk&quot; is smart once you start getting serious with someone! The dreams don&#039;t always line up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is some great advice here and it is wonderful that you have been brave enough to ask for some. There is the elephant in the room though of children .. at 30 statistically this is a biggie for most couples. 

It is fraught for both men and women in many ways in terms of how to provide for them. If you guys do want kids, the issue of how to support them is key. Will the financial and physical care be shared equally, or is there an implicit expectation that you will have a more traditional division of labor? 

These can be very tricky topics to discuss but the process could blow some oxygen into the fears and motivations each of you carry. The skills of you and your partner in navigating these questions respectfully together and build trust will be a good starter for family life. There are no wrong answers, although perhaps some strong emotions on the way.

Also, it could be that building up your freelance business makes great sense in terms of having a sustainable basis for ongoing earning if you guys do start a family. Conversely, if you only have a couple of unencumbered years there may be a pressing need to build a stache.

Tanja Hester’s book Work Optional has some great thoughts on all these issues.]]></description>

That is a good point - they&#039;re both discussing this stuff super early on!!! Which I can&#039;t say for myself when I met my future Mrs!! Money was the last thing on my mind when we collided on the dance floor, haha... (thank God I happened to luck out with someone more frugal than I!)]]></description>

Thanks for the thoughtful reply, my man...

And I think for all future relationships you should ask your partner if they read Budgets Are Sexy religiously, and if they say yes it&#039;s safe to combine your finances, and if they say no - RUN AND HIDE YOUR MONEY!! ;)]]></description>

I think that&#039;s a fantastic route :) Start a &quot;house fund&quot; to cover all shared items, and then do as you please w/ the rest of the money! Whether you have lots of it left over or not!]]></description>
