					<description><![CDATA[What a good way to start the year. We need to be more informed if we want to achieve more this year. In this information age, if one is not informed, he will be deformed. The deformation may not be physical though, it is more of mental deformation. But the impact will soon manifest in the physical. Thanks for sharing the resources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the heads up for the budget tracking tool. I find some people find the exercise of producing their budget very easy and others struggle big time. This tool makes it easy enough while also providing a level of detail many users would previously have struggled to achieve. 

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/6-great-new-financial-resources/#comment-273872&quot;&gt;The Measure of a Plan&lt;/a&gt;.

An old family friend married in 1967 &#038; they rented a 1BR apt, 700 square feet, rent controlled. They lived in it till he passed away in 2009 &#038; she passed away in 2015. He retired at age 46 and she retired at age 48. Both worked long enough to have pensions. Both took on small daytime jobs. She drove/picked up kids from school &#038; he helped an elderly patient a few days a week. They managed this owning just 1 vehicle. They traveled &#038; lived comfortably their whole lives &#038; I heard she left $200,000 to a friend when she passed. Neither wanted the responsibility of owning a home &#038; were fine living in a small space. So to each his own. You have to live with whatever works for you &#038; do what makes you happiest. No one size fits all.]]></description>

I&#039;m right there with you.

Renting is low risk and low hassle -- pay the rent on time, and let someone else worry about the rest.]]></description>
