Good for you! Great mentality to have - it really is all about the *people* not the fancy stuff that costs a ton of money. I hope it turns out great and is a lot of fun!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My 40th reunion is next year. I&#039;m helping to plan it. I went to 10, 20 and 30 and had a great time at each of them, but I like that sort of stuff. My personal goal for this one is to keep it as cheap as possible so money not a valid objection to coming. The economy is tough and some of my old classmates just don&#039;t have the funds. Our class was a little over 400 people. I am hoping for at least 150 (including spouses) to show up after 40 years. We&#039;ve had very good attendance up to this point. I think we can commercialize it a bit with some ads and keep the cost down to $10 per person with a cash bar and some finger foods. I just want to see my friends, I&#039;m not really there for the food.]]></description>

Ouch! What % of people can afford $200? And out of those would *could*, who would CHOOSE to? That&#039;s crazy talk... I get that some people would prefer a fancier get together - I do myself at times - but the point is to reunite everyone together and catch up, the rest is secondary. So to limit the amount of participation with a rate like that is pretty sad. And $200 is the cheapest you mentioned - imagine if the votes go towards the highest??

What a mess.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My 20th reunion is coming up. Facebook poll set up where the cheapest option is $200 per person, for a banquet and maybe a picnic. The other options were a cruise and a more expensive cruise. They didn&#039;t take the feedback of &quot;Hey, that&#039;s crazy expensive, why not something a bit cheaper?&quot; very well. Needless to say I&#039;m not going. 

Someone even came up with a cheaper idea and we got radio silence from the planning committee, we were reminded that no one else had volunteered to be on the committee, then were told to just vote for the existing options. Like a bratty teenager planning their sweet 16 or bridezilla insisting on having *her* special day *her* way or else. Way to make it about your classmates and not yourself, a-hole.]]></description>

Amen sister!  If I&#039;m spending money for a family night out then I want it to be more enjoyable for the kids and my husband than a reunion!  Even better I want to spend the money so my hubby and I can go away for the weekend away from the kids!  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[High school reunions are a waste of money, especially my cousins. He was told that he had to pay $250 just to get into a country club and that was on top of the plane tickets, hotel costs and food.

					<description><![CDATA[I really loved my high school and college experiences and made really wonderful friends.  So far I have chosen to attend my 5-year HS and 5-year college reunions.

The HS one sucked but it was free - I was in town anyway visiting my parents for Thanksgiving and it was held at a bar (hence why it sucked).  I think the 10-year is in a better venue but probably also pricier.

For our college reunion we shelled out big bucks for travel (two cross-country flights) but the reunion itself wasn&#039;t very expensive (just the cost of the meals) and we stayed with my in-laws.  It was a multi-purpose trip as we were able to see family as well and we don&#039;t often get to see our college friends since most of them live on the coast we attended college on.

I&#039;m fairly sure I&#039;ll attend my 10-year HS reunion - same situation with being in town anyway, most likely - as well as our 10-year college reunion at least.  In addition to seeing old friends and catching up on what the schools are doing, they are great networking opportunities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if it would matter if we changed it to a COLLEGE reunion over high school? Or maybe we all stay in touch w/ those people more? (Probably... esp w/ Facebook - that totally changed the game! :))

Big thanks again to &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jason&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; for starting this discussion here and giving me a day off from blogging - you rock man.]]></description>
