					<description><![CDATA[As much as I would love to take you and Ms. Money out for beers if you were ever in Portland I don&#039;t think you&#039;re ever allowed to meet my hubbin. He too has an affinity for hip-hop, and just had to shave his hawk due to work. (Corporate, you know?) That much awesome in a room and the universe may implode. Eh, I&#039;ll risk it. If you guys ever make it out to the Pacific Northwest, look us up. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Back when I got tip money I would always put my first tips of the day in a random pocket in my wallet, knowing I&#039;d forget about it. Then when the hubby and I were out someplace and needed cash, I&#039;d start looking through my wallet and always find a 20 or some other random money. We called it the &quot;magic pocket.&quot; I don&#039;t get tips anymore, and I really miss the magic pocket because it most often blessed us with magic beer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a neat little trick for hiding money from myself which is actually really dumb. Sometimes when I use a different purse or handbag I purposely leave a £5 note or some coins in it. I forget about it pretty quickly but the next time I use that bag I&#039;m like &quot;SCORE!!! Free money!!!&quot;

So silly, since it&#039;s obviously mine in the first place but it&#039;s a nice way to make my future self&#039;s day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Too late for me to have a million by 30... man, graduate school really messes a person&#039;s wealth up.

I&#039;m a big fan of automatic savings.  I do wish online saving had better interest rates these days.  I&#039;ve been funneling more to my mortgage these days which is a little disturbing because I can&#039;t get it back.  There&#039;s a balance between making it difficult to access and making it really difficult.  But I don&#039;t want to put all my extra money in stocks, or in something that gains next to no interest.]]></description>
