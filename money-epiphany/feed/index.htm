					<description><![CDATA[Great motivational article and comments. I actually started my FI journey through motivational blogs like Milk the Pigeon and Brian Kim, and from there realized that there was no reason I couldn&#039;t live the life I wanted. So I got serious about my finances last year and started putting everything into getting out of debt. From then I&#039;ve paid off around $10,000 combined in credit card and student loan debt and should be able to pay off the rest in two years at most. I&#039;ve been socking away money in my 401K as well, and while not much now it&#039;s certainly growing. My next goal is to max out my 401K every year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My financial epiphany is ongoing and only kicked off 3 months ago.  But in that 3 months I&#039;ve managed to get things moving in a much better direction.  We paid off a nearly 600.00 payday loan and have tracked every dime spent in the last 3 months.  We are in the process of building a budget. This has been a process because we had no earthly idea what we were spending but we should have it locked down this upcoming month.  I&#039;m super excited to say that in that 3 months we&#039;ve managed to SAVE just south of 400 bucks.  This would have been completely unheard of 6 months ago.  Thanks for your help!

					<description><![CDATA[My financial epiphany was in 2014 when I stumbled upon MMM and ERE. ERE was too &#039;extreme&#039;, MMM gave me some ideas but I spent the most time reading your back catalogue of posts because, well, you made saving and investing sound like it was fun! :-)

Since then, I set up my own blog (which has just celebrated 2 years), stopped being an unnecessary consumer, increased my net worth by 65% and last month, my savings rate was over 60%! Go me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had my financial epiphany in 2013 when I thought I was about to be laid off, and since then I’ve bought 2 investment properties, gotten married to a like-minded woman, set a goal of total financial independence in 20 years, started working with a financial planner toward that goal, boosted our savings to over 50%, and set a date to quit my job.  Go us!]]></description>
