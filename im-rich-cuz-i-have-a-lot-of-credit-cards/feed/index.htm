					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I guess so!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ve never heard of baller?  We need to pump more hip-hip into your ears ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ Afford Anything&lt;/b&gt; - It probably is :(  Maybe my questioning him up will sink in?
@&lt;b&gt;Romeo&lt;/b&gt; - I like the way you think, sir ;)  And you&#039;re totally right - rich IS relative!  I guess if credit cards are uncommon or hard to get in someone&#039;s lifestyle, it *could* come off as more of a wealthy thing... all good things to think about!  (Will give you a shout out if I ever write that post.  But I&#039;m gonna hold you to the 200+ comments ;)  You better be ready to leave a lot!! Haha... just kidding.  sort of.)
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwwww, now THAT is scary.  I hope she bought land or stocks or something with it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;TJ&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, more awkward than if you got it at a strip joint?  All ones, baby! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Oh for sure, I totally agree that $260k is &quot;rich&quot; to a lot of people (including myself sometimes!) but to someone who&#039;s never seen my blog?  I&#039;d never think Credit cards = rich, but ofcourse that&#039;s also cuz of my upbringing I&#039;m sure.  Interesting stuff to think about either way :)
@&lt;b&gt;serena&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well first off I didn&#039;t come away with an inflated head or perplexed look (I know I write like that, but it goes out my brain the second after something happens), but I did question him and try to get more answers.  It didn&#039;t really work, but maybe he&#039;ll double think the next time it pops in his head?
@&lt;b&gt;Natalie @ Mango&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, right?  I like not being able to tell too whether someone&#039;s rich or not - I don&#039;t think it really matters more than just good ol&#039; curiosity.  It&#039;s not gonna change MY way of doing things ya know?  Unless I wanted to ask questions and learn *how* they did it to see if I can work on that too.
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff&lt;/b&gt; - YES!!! EXACTLY!!! I&#039;m one of those people that are doing the staring too! Haha... though I&#039;m always looking for celebrities or sports players ;)  It&#039;s kind a fun to be in that position as well, whenever I fly first class I&#039;m always feeling like a pimp! I could get used to that life ;)
@&lt;b&gt;quizshow&lt;/b&gt; - Good job!  I&#039;m glad you&#039;re working it all out :)  Are you still in debt, or have you wiped it all away?  Keep rollin&#039; with it either way!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favourite pretend rich? Sitting up front in a plane.  It&#039;s easier to sit in first/business on domestic flight with credit cards that earn airline miles than it ever has been before and you board first, so being in my mid-20s and sitting with my wife in 1A and 1C when a hundred people walk down the aisle past me.  I know what those looks mean.

On a side note, I still roll my coins in those paper wrappers, I find it helps me relax by being able to focus on a single simple task, and it was infuriating when I took my rolls to the bank and the teller ripped them open and counted the coins herself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, the old &quot;never judge a book by its cover&quot; saying rears its head again. I swear, I think of this axiom about once a week; there always seems to be something surprising lurking under the surface in almost any situation. Take Warren Buffet for example; he looks more like a kindly grandpa than one of the wealthiest men in the world. Mark Zuckerberg? Bill Gates? Donald Trump... okay, The Donald is a bad example: he pretty much looks like, well, what he is. I do think it&#039;s admirable, though, when somebody is well off and you can&#039;t tell; it means they are not boastful or showy about it. They probably don&#039;t go around showing off their credit cards ;o)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J Money, I hope you used that experience to educate that poor, misguided clerk! It&#039;s sad to think he associated credit with being rich. I would have taken the time to school the ignorant person about how you rrall6 should only have no more than one card....that you should never use credit without cash to pay it off, etc. Instead of walking away with an inflated head, and a perplexed look, use it as a teaching moment to the unfortunately misguided.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm...net worth of 260k in your late 20&#039;s equates pretty rich to me :)
As others have said before, it really is relative.  To the cashier who probably has a negative networth, you are truly ballin.  Also it is easy for us to obtain multiple credit cards on a whim whereas the cashier probably cannot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sigh... I agree with Trinnie. It&#039;s because of the benefits that I use my credit card. I bet the banks would love all of their customers to have that mentality... They would make a killing off of their credit card fees. I heard about this lady who racked up $50k plus on credit cards alone! Imagine what her fees are like!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, J, there WAS just a bit of sarcasm in my comment. ;-) But, on to reality. Rich is relative in the sense that there is no dollar amount that makes someone rich. Let&#039;s assume that the Auto Zone employee earns $25,000 annually, give or take. Why would someone who earns $100,000 not seem rich to them, just as someone who earns $400,000 may seem rich to the 100K earner. After all, the common mind set of &quot;what&#039;s rich&quot; is the ability to purchase grandeur things that is normally out of someone else&#039;s reach.  

In his culture or upbringing, maybe it&#039;s not easy to get a credit card, and to have a pocket full of money is uncommon (because its quickly used to pay bills), therefore you represented someone unique and &quot;financially together,&quot; or in other words &quot;rich.&quot;

Hey, here&#039;s an idea for a blog post that is sure to get you hundreds of comments: &quot;What does it mean to be rich?&quot; Just put your spin on it and make it fun. See what happens. Seriously. ;-P]]></description>
