					<description><![CDATA[I like your post. Income isn&#039;t the same as wealth because if you spend all your income, you cannot build wealth. Many people, especially athletes, get it wrong when it comes to income and wealth. That&#039;s why many of them go broke few years after they stop playing]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great article. There are so many young folks out there who think working on wall street (either at an investment bank or in private equity/hedge fund) is the best job you can ever get. You may get paid a ton, but you are sacrificing the rest of your life for money. 

After working in banking and at a number of different hedge funds, I can tell you that not every place is the same. You really have to love the work in order to succeed and make a lot of money. The stress, hours and lack of freedom add up over the years and cause many to burnout very quickly. 

Personally, I love the intensity and get to look at many different types of investments to see where I can maximize risk vs. reward. It is not for everyone however.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, now that&#039;s a post!  I should have read this earlier.  Kept meaning to come back to it.  

While the movies may stretch the truth, it seems a lot of them are right on par.  Not something I would ever want to be a part of.  

I had an auditing job right out of college that required us to be there hours on end during busy season.  I knew right away I wanted no part of that life.  The income wasn&#039;t even close to what you were making either.  Now, I&#039;m fine with a job that allows me to be home every day for dinner with the family and gives me a chance to work on my blog as my side hustle.

I appreciate you sharing this insight.  I often thought I sold myself short by not going for a more glamorous job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Chelsea. Thanks for letting us know what it was really like working on Wall Street. It had to be scary to go through that at such at young age but I&#039;m glad you got out early. I too invest in low-cost index funds and believe this is the best way to go to avoid the stress of watching each stock you own daily (I&#039;ve done that before as well, lol).

Again, thanks for sharing such an awesome story!]]></description>

Ha perfect so you already see the issue

The guys recommending dollar cost averaging won&#039;t even be able to listen to their own advice! More than half of them will sell creating a massive dislocation again. 

Will be fun to watch the next one. Small caps for everyone!]]></description>

50%+ is low. There is a reason mutual fund investor returns are dramatically lower than the returns of the actual funds! But whether those people are being their own PMs or investing in index funds, their panic is likely still going to get the best of them.

&quot;Be greedy when other are fearful and fearful when others are greedy&quot; is easy to say and tough to do. 

Hopefully, everyone that was just out of school in 2008 and got to see the crash and the following recovery will be smarter at sticking to DCA as investors. Though, as you said, all we can do is wait and see!]]></description>

Sure agree you&#039;ll make money if you dollar cost for 20-40 years straight.

All that needs to be said is &quot;we&#039;ll see&quot;

Easy to stay emotionally stable when the market is up every year. When it&#039;s down 50%, they miss dividends and have to dip into principal to pay bills... we&#039;ll see if the vast majority do not hit sell.

We&#039;ll take a friendly wager and say next recession 50%+ of personal finance advisors saying &quot;just dollar cost&quot; will lose their minds and draw down.

There were guys in their 50s-60s who dca&#039;d for 30+ years in 2008... they ended up selling. 

The good news is, buy the dip and buy small cap ETFs!]]></description>
