					<description><![CDATA[When i was a 16 my mother travelled to a small village in northern kenya where my grandmother was living. My grandmother got very ill and my mom ended up needing cash to cover medical expenses but the emergency cash wasnt enough to have her transfered to a city and treated. It was too difficult for her to access her money so i had to figure out how to send her the cash which was the most cash ive held in hand. Ended up withdrawing it from my own savings account (i had been saving for college), exchanging it for usd and then wiring it to the only service that would get it to such a rural location. But yeah the fees were absurd.]]></description>

you as a person have rights.  Your car, money or anything else seized by the cops do not have rights. so its a real pain to get anything back.]]></description>

hah - clever! i wouldn&#039;t have ever thought of that, even though I&quot;m a coin collector and half my friends are collectors only for the gold &amp; silver in the old coins! in theory you could just buy one rare one and then keep it in your pocket change :) (also would only need one buyer on the other end, although the junk silver/gold is much easier to convert on the other end and still retain a bulk of the value, which i&#039;m sure is why you went the way you did?)]]></description>

hell yeah it&#039;s a lot of money! i remember meeting a guy with a briefcase full of cash to buy my old car as well - i think for around $18,000? I specifically made him meet me in the lobby of the bank for security reasons, and then also to make sure the money was legit and had him hand it right over to the teller to pay off the car loan haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that&#039;s an amazing story. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d have the gumption to go through with that!

As far as I know, it&#039;s legal to transport any amount of cash in US airports, but you have to declare anything over $10,000. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s just a one-sentence &quot;declaration&quot;, or whether it prompts any sort of investigation, though.

With China, I&#039;ve read that an emerging issue is the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to get around limitations on transferring money abroad. That seems to be why they&#039;ve recently cracked down in this area. It should be interesting to see how it develops.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahhhh... the age old international problem!   I did it a bit differently.  I carried about $7k in cash and before I left I bought a lot of gold jewelry and diamonds...  then sold it when I got to the states.  For the WIN!]]></description>
