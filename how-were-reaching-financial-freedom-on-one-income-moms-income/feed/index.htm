					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Just one thing we say &quot;on the London Underground&quot; not &quot;in&quot; .

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Liz. What a beautiful story of making things work for the good of the  family. I know many Filipina nurses here in the US who are doing the same. The husbands go back to work when the kids are old enough to start primary school. Thanks for sharing your story.]]></description>

Thanks DD-the way I see it, you need to play the hand you&#039;re dealt. So like might have knocked me down, but im using it as a tool to inspire me. Instead of thinking about how much easier it would be if things were different, I&#039;ll do what needs to be done!]]></description>

Yep, located in the US. Health insurance is a big concern, because I can&#039;t go without it. Since the legislation is in such flux right now, I&#039;m not making a specific plan. I&#039;m going to wait and see how the laws are when I&#039;m older.]]></description>

That&#039;s awesome Betty! I hear you about medical conditions playing a big role in making the decision. My husband also has had to have surgeries &#038; other complications over the years, which makes working difficult. Sounds like you&#039;re doing great-keep it up!]]></description>

That&#039;s great news Dee! It&#039;s great to meet one of the women that helped pave the way for other families like mine to not just survive, but thrive. Glad I&#039;m not alone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on your progress and being a true inspiration for people. I can&#039;t imagine what that is like to go through so much in a short period of time. Most people can barely afford living with 1 income when they are single with no kids or 2 incomes as a family. Hope you reach FIRE soon, and keep inspiring!]]></description>

That&#039;s why I love the internet - we&#039;re in the minority in real life, but online we get to meet other families doing the same things! :) I&#039;m with you except I have decided to pay off the mortgage. Of course, that&#039;s my conservative side kicking in after all the bad things we&#039;ve been through. It&#039;s definitely NOT the financially optimal decision!]]></description>
