					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/consumers-life-in-30-bullet-points/#comment-140280&quot;&gt;Stefanie @ The Broke and Beautiful Life&lt;/a&gt;.

Ha ha, that one made me laugh. We all make mistakes I suppose!
I&#039;ve got an array of kitchen gadgets that go unused but most of them cost under £10 so it&#039;s not the end of the world, just clutter to get rid of!

I love the golf club choices by the way! I&#039;m an avid golfer myself, I have friends who upgrade their clubs every 1-2 years at a cost of around £1000 or more each time. I don&#039;t really understand this mentality, I am still playing golf with them and enjoying it just as much. They buy brand new Titleist V1&#039;s at £3 per ball, what an extra kick in the wallet every time you dump one into the water!!!! I can&#039;t be doing with that, if I find a ball I will pop it in the bag for later use, and therefore I am still only about half way through the box of 50 lake balls I got 2 christmasses ago. Again the bottom line is the same game is being played (and I presume the same enjoyment is being had) but a vast difference in the amount of money being spent, and this applies across all areas of life as you have expertly summarised. :)]]></description>

Excellent question Betsy. I&#039;ve posted my rather lengthy answer over at FrugalFringe.com. Look for the May 8, 2014 post entitled &quot;The Thelma and Louise Guide to Personal Finance.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish I had found you seven years ago when I lost my job and decided to live on a lot less rather than get another job I hated.  Still, I&#039;m happy that I&#039;ve done everything on this list except I own a smartphone since it makes my business much easier (google voice, whatsapp, skype are free and I pay $50 per month) and I bought a Nook HD when they were on sale for $79 just for fun. It amazes me how much better my life is on 1/4 of my previous income.  

Now I am following you because I need to create more income.  I love this blog.  You rock.]]></description>

Not craving stuff def. helps :) Though I&#039;m sure other areas you crave more than other people (which is totally fine - just goes back to &quot;conscious spending&quot; and choosing where to send your money, and where not to based on priorities).]]></description>
