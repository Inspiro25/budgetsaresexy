Agreed! And way to go and MAKE IT HAPPEN :) I need to get back to doing more philanthropy stuff these days... I went hardcore with Love Drop and then took a way too long breather from it. Need to start spreading the love again!]]></description>

I think you&#039;re fully aware of the difference between you and the others out there though - it&#039;s not important enough to you yet to prioritize, and thus you don&#039;t :) Maybe one day it will be and then you will start learning it, but for now keep on doing your thang my friend. It&#039;s not like Mandarin is one of the easier languages out there, haha... You should tell your in-laws to switch to Español :)]]></description>

Oh cool, thanks for the link! I was actually a bit concerned about that too (it being fake, which would be funny cuz it would be a faker faking a fake coin! :)) but hoped a dealer of 40+ years wouldn&#039;t risk pawning it off just for a few bucks. Though I am still new and very much naive to a lot of things with coin collecting...

Interesting about that exposed breast uproar too :) I&#039;ve read it in passing in some of the coin mags, but never really looked into much. Maybe I should only collect those coins with crazy backstories? Haha... They would all match my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/things-learned-at-first-coin-show/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hobo nickel&lt;/a&gt; that my grandma passed down to me :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice coin. Looks like a fun one to have in your coin collection. When you&#039;re older and have grandkids you can tell them the story of the Racketeer Nickel!

Hmm hmm the one thing I&#039;ve been meaning to do is learn Mandarin...for a few years now...but it&#039;s hard fitting it into a busy schedule. Plus honestly my motivation to learn it is pretty nil. My in-laws speak English but only conversationally. Thus...if I really communicate with them I need to learn Mandarin. My lack of motivation stems from my bad ear for languages, thus its hard for me to learn, and a fluctuating relationship with them. I know I can make time to learn it...but there&#039;s so much other (more fun) stuff to do! Plus while it will score points...then I will also perfectly understand everything they say. Not always fun right? And so...I&#039;m not realllyyy staying motivated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The one that I think bothers me the most is the &quot;lucky&quot; comment, or variations thereof.  The other day, when I mentioned to a friend that my husband and I will have our mortgage paid off next year (and we&#039;re 30), she said to me how EASY it would be with no kids.  The kicker?  She doesn&#039;t have kids either!  We&#039;ve been working our butts off!  But I guess they are just spending more now in preparation for having kids?!

Or another one I HATE: &quot;must be nice&quot;.  As in, &quot;oh must be nice to have a paid for house.&quot;  Yeah, actually it is quite nice.  But it wasn&#039;t very nice while we were paying it off.  We didn&#039;t just WIN a paid-for house. /endrant]]></description>
