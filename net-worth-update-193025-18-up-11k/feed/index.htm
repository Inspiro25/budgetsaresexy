					<description><![CDATA[Not sure when I&#039;ll be up in DC, but I&#039;ll let people know. Maybe February or March. :)
And that was my NW this week, so I&#039;m still behind you. Also, I&#039;ll have to take a loan out next semester for some things, so I&#039;ll probably lag behind for awhile. Still, I thought it was funny it was only off by a few bucks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Was just updating my budget (recently moved and I&#039;m having to alter some things) and I remembered you post about your net worth. Just realized mine right now is almost exactly what yours is. It&#039;s off by about $12. Kinda funny. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well, now I can&#039;t help but think of your name every time I sit down to do these :)  We gotta get together again sometime soon... maybe at a military blogging conference/show?

@&lt;b&gt;Deb&lt;/b&gt; - My bad!  Sometimes it&#039;s hard to tell via text if someone&#039;s being sarcastic or not - and I had been getting a few negative hits on the side so it must  have stuck that way to me. Sorry about that.

I did like what you just said though - &quot;It was more to make everyone feel good about their saving too.&quot;  That&#039;s a great point! Since I&#039;m not investing right now I have much more in the cash savings department, which others should keep in mind when comparing.  Hope you have a good weekend over there :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did not mean what I said as a knock on you or to make me feel any better about anything.  I was just saying that once you break it down, people commenting on here that say they could never save that much may also be saving 4, 5 or 6K in another fashion if they think about it.  It was more to make everyone feel good about their saving too.I also said that was a very high amount and that you did a great job.  You did not choose to read that part I guess.  I guess I won&#039;t bother with any analysis to your blog anymore.  Just keep in mind that your not the only one &quot;hussling&quot; and working your ass off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J,

Thanks for the shout out and so prominently in the opening line too! I had no idea when you mentioned it to me on Twitter that I would be in the first sentence. But, what can I say other than..... You make me sick! No....really, that&#039;s awesome that once again you are raking in the dough. I&#039;ve actually stopped looking at my own net worth updates every month. Instead, I just recalculate it all quarterly. Watching the change quarterly makes me feel better deep down inside because the increases are much larger that way! Anyway....keep up the great work. You&#039;re still my inspiration.]]></description>
