I think you should relay this over to them and see if they can roll it into an upgrade later :)

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE this app for tracking money.  However it sucks to track your budget and here&#039;s why.  I set up all of my spending categories, set up my checking and savings accounts plus multiple accounts to represent the accounts I want to pay off (i.e. my debt).  Awesome so far!  Absolutely LOVE seeing my daily balances in my checking account as well as progress in paying off debt!  So, checking and savings are positive $ amounts and debts are negative $.  Which leads us to the problem.  When I transfer money say from Checking to Car Payment, because I&#039;m transferring a positive amount into a negative account, the app won&#039;t recognize the transaction because it basically zeroes itself out (because the app ties spending categories to ALL accounts when it should just be tied to activity that happens in checking/main account).  Kind of a bummer because you can&#039;t get an honest overview of your overall categories and you can&#039;t see how much you&#039;ve put towards credit card debt on your budget because it doesn&#039;t register.  The solution would be to tie the budget categories to only transactions occurring in the main checking account and ignore the negative transactions into debt accounts.  Which is all fine I guess, because I only use this account to track spending on a day to day basis.  Would like to use budget feature once in a while though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been using this app since April 2013 and LOVE it.  I am able to plan out my spending and move individual events to another day if need be. I can see what my account will look like next month...5 months...1 year...5 years from now.  I have repeating events like paycheck and mortgage and then have specific events like coffee run or a special night out. I use it on my PC as well on my cell. 
The best thing on the market. 
Thank you.]]></description>

There are so many apps for productivity and money, it&#039;s not funny anymore. I am trying to find some that are simple and yet have all the features and I&#039;m resorting to use an excel for my web design tasks (after trying Asana, Trello, Freedcamp and others) and YNAB the old computer-based app or AceMoney. Will look into this calendar as well, but I really dislike the idea of paying for each app every month, when I am already paying for hosting, SEMrush and others that I need in my work.]]></description>
