I hope you do stick with it though - never know what the future can hold! Could go way up or come crashing down, but pros and cons to both sides :) In fact, if you&#039;ve still got 20-30-40 years to go you should hope for it to crash and burn right now so you can pile it in and then let it rise over the decades! Haha.... As long as you don&#039;t get scared and dip out :)]]></description>

Oh man, ain&#039;t that the truth! 7+ years paying down that thing and we *still* have $300,000 to go! Ugh.... at least we pay off more and more off that principle as time goes on though. Hope you and the babes are well! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The market is definitely getting choppy. I was just beginning to invest -- after paying off my massive student loans -- when the market started getting this way. It&#039;s a real bummer, as I missed many of the post-crash gains due to lack of funds. Oh well, here&#039;s hoping that Buffett&#039;s optimism is right and America is still and will continue to be the place to invest in.

As always, it&#039;s much appreciated to see and understand a real BIG budget. 

All the best,
Sam]]></description>

True, we only know the real deal when it comes time to sign that contract, but it&#039;s better than using numbers from Zillow or other sites at least in my opinion. And since your net worth shows all liabilities, I&#039;ve gotta include it ;) A great point to keep in mind though, so thanks for sharing it with us!]]></description>

Yes - because I never know how much money I&#039;ll have at the end of the year to invest as I hit my SEP Ira first which is tied to business income (I&#039;m self-employed). If I make bank  I can invest bank, but if I make pennies I can only invest pennies into it. Outside of my ROTH Ira which I usually try and max out too - but again, only if I have money at the end of the year to dump in there...

If I had it my way I *would* dollar cost average though - It really is the best way to go.]]></description>
