					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s still on my list to check out a financial planner myself.   I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d learn a lot from it, but really I&#039;m just curious to see how the whole process works and what not.  I have a hard time planning for the wayyyyy future than I do this week.

					<description><![CDATA[Timely post. My husband and I had our first conversation with a financial planner yesterday. When he asked our visions of retirement we were kind of dumbfounded. Of course, we&#039;re saving for it financially, but we never really talked about the details of how we want to live in retirement. Practical person that I am, I figured we&#039;d just attack it day by day with the stack of money we&#039;d saved. But now I realize that planning for specific dreams is a luxury and going to be fun! It will also be challenging. It will really help us focus and give us more specific goals than simply gathering as much money as we can. The financial plan we bought is pricey by my standards but I&#039;m starting to realize that the short-term payout will yield an amazing long-term gain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ LB - I can SO relate to your lifestyle!  We still catch ourselves doing the same, but setting aside just a little &quot;sacred time&quot; each day really does make a world of difference.  Just 1% (15 minutes) of your time spent being a couple in a quality way can make the other 99% much happier and more fulfilling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Debbie -  Wow, what an exciting time for you and your husband!  You&#039;ll definitely be entering unchartered territory as you hopefully cut the purse strings and have more time to really focus on each other and your wants.  I appreciate the kind words!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like fun!  My husband and I have been so busy with life and responsibilities lately we seem to just be going through the motions unless something comes up that must be done quicker.  I think a little dreaming sounds good after a busy day like today :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Do you ever daydream about how you really want your life to look?&quot; Uhm Yes!

Great ideas.  My husband and I are just about to get the last one through college and are doing this for the next phase of our lives!  It is fun and exciting.

Thanks for this post.  It is something everyone can use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Jason L - I&#039;m a big believer in written goals and, even more than that, accountability partners.  It&#039;s much easier to stay on track with your goals when someone else knows about them and asks you how things are going.  If you&#039;re married, your spouse should make a great accountability partner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ retirebyforty - It&#039;s actually pretty incredible how difficult it can be to really listen at times.  Life is SO distracting, and that&#039;s why I preach so much about those magical 15 minutes.

I&#039;d encourage you to really listen to your wife as well since she might just know what she wants. :)  But a little trial should be good to make sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Jon the Saver - Thanks!  It&#039;s all about action, but of course you have to be pointed in the right direction before you know where to apply your efforts.  I&#039;ve always been a hustler, but I&#039;ve found myself drifting off-course at times where I&#039;m working really hard but not towards a goal that I actually want.  This is true in money, marriage, fitness, career and so many other aspects of life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Angie - Right on!  We did a little too much dreaming and not enough planning early on too, to the tune of $54,500 in debt.  Then we got with the budget and were doing pretty well financially while we had concrete goals to get out of debt and save an emergency fund.  

But then...we reached those goals and got soft.  It took some &quot;dreaming time&quot; together to get refocused and ready to make our money work for us on purpose.  The dream was what refueled our intensity to pay attention to our money once again...it can be a viscous cycle! :)]]></description>
