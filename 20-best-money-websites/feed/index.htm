					<description><![CDATA[My favorite apps are &#034;Accounts&#034;, which is a check book register, but you can also add your savings accounts (which I do) and credit cards (which I use for all my spending money so I like tracking the balance every day).  Another awesome thing about the &#034;Accounts&#034; app is that it breaks down all your spending into categories (food, entertainment, clothes, etc).  You can even create your OWN categories, so I have a Beauty &#038; Health category.  It&#039;s SWEEEEEET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Bill Tracker app to keep track of my bills and their due dates, but you can also store your payment history, confirmation #, bill account #s, the phone # to the bill.  It&#039;s awesome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dont think it was mentioned, but I could be wrong due to my young professiona A.D.D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.Bing.com/travel is an amazing tool to use to gauge flight prices for round trip tickets.  They base it off historical data and what other people are searching for to tell you if the price is going to go up or go down with a confidence rating.  Try it out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My money is on iXpenseIt.  Had it since last year and making full use of it.  The best one in terms of ease of use and packed with customization features.  I also use the budget feature and it has helped me stay incharge and not get drained.  Recommended to any who is serious about controlling their expenses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always use the HomeBudget app. It&#039;s a bit pricey ($4.99) but it&#039;s worth every penny - http://appshopper.com/finance/homebudget&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the websites, I tried Mint but it doesn&#039;t really work for me. Feed The Pig - http://www.feedthepig.org/ - looks interesting and I&#039;m gonna give it a try.]]></description>
