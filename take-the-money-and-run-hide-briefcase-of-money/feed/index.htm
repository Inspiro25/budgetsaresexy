					<description><![CDATA[If the show was still on and my husband and I were picked, and we knew enough ahead of time, I would call my brother who lives in cotton, have him meet us either at San dims canyon or azusa canyon. We would give him the case to take and put it in our house and lock our door. We would then drive around up in the canyon. During the time that we were in custody we would just tell them that we had it when we went up in the canyon but that we did not have it when we left the canyon. We would certainly not be lying.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, a lot of the contestants TRY that! :)
@&lt;b&gt;PokerBabyy&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh, yeah - that def. makes sense.  Though is much harder ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Darwin&#039;s Money&lt;/b&gt; - Oh that&#039;s a good one!! I like that!
@&lt;b&gt;Natalie @ Mango&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that&#039;s easy -- They spend $100,000 a show, but make $1,000,000 in advertising revenue! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Gene&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Now *that* is a plan, sir.  I can totally get down w/ that.  Not sure you could pull it off all within an hour, esp since you can&#039;t pre-plan ahead of time (like, all 3 of your friends would a) have to pick up the phone, and b) Get to where they need to be, and back, all in time) BUT if it all went smoothly it&#039;s a helluva good idea :) I like that a LOT. You win the most creative so far!
@&lt;b&gt;Basil Siddiqui&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, looks like the rules say it can&#039;t move now - so there goes that :(
@&lt;b&gt;South County Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Right?  That would def. do the trick.
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, esp if she puts it in one of those  haunted houses or something ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Maybe we&#039;ll find out one day? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Scott&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I&#039;d challenge you just to watch how crazy it would be ;)  Maybe you&#039;ll get lucky and the producers are reading this?]]></description>
