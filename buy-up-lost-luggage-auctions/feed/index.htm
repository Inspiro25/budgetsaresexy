					<description><![CDATA[That is actually a really cool idea!! Now I&#039;m tempted to buy a bag, sight-unseen, just to discover what random goodies I&#039;ll find inside. I agree, I&#039;d pay extra to buy a nice designer bag, on the hopes that it could contain some pretty swanky stuff. At the very least, I&#039;ve have a great designer piece of luggage! Hmm ... in fact, maybe I should just do this the next time I need to buy luggage? ...]]></description>

Awwww, well when I go and visit then I&#039;ll have to make sure to have DOUBLE the fun to help make up for it ;) And I won&#039;t stop until I find something cool for you too - how does that sound?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been to this unclaimed baggage center! (I even wrote a post about it: http://www.budgetblonde.com/2011/01/i-lost-my-bags.html) We went out of our way to drive through there on my way home to Louisiana from Virginia one time, and I regret to say that I was pretty disappointed. It was not nearly as cool as the videos said, and I didn&#039;t buy anything. Sad times!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was training in Alabama back in 2008 and decided to stop at Unclaimed Baggage on the way to the Jack Daniels Distillery (Which is well worth the tour, as being a dry county, you cannot taste, so the tour has to be really good!!).

I spotted a rain jacket with the Vancouver 2010 Olympics Logo on it for $15. Being from Canada, I thought it was a funny find in Alabama.  It was brand new, tags intact, probably bought at YVR immediately before being lost.

When I got home I searched on-line and found this was a technical waterproof wind-breaker from Sunice worth $130!

Not a bad mark-up for a half-hours work!  

I still get a chuckle every time i put that jacket on :0)]]></description>

True.  I should make it a point to check it out the next time I have an extended visit home. Thanks for the reminder of that place!]]></description>

Look into it and then blog about it! I&#039;m sure people can&#039;t connect with their luggage due to incorrect addresses or people missing (dying?), etc etc. things get lost all the time at the post office too and then returned like 30 years later or something, haha... guess both parties just gotta do their best to figure it out and at the end of the day call it a loss... I&#039;m sure the passengers get some type of compensation at least, so it&#039;s not a total loss.]]></description>

Well the plan is to turn around and sell all the stuff you didn&#039;t like - in theory anyways. Just more of a hassle unless you REALLY find something killer in there like a diamond ring or something.]]></description>

Cool! They&#039;ve been around forever it seems so would be interesting to see what you think of it now vs then. Perhaps a new blog post for you? :)]]></description>
