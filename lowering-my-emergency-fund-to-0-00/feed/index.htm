					<description><![CDATA[I love this article! We&#039;ve got about $40k, which feels amazing! Our expenses were about $5k/month, but I&#039;ve been waiting on recalculating them as both kids started daycare 3 days per week this summer, but one will switch to 5 days of daycare in the fall, and the other one will go to public kindergarten. I&#039;ve also got one more installment payment that I&#039;m due at the end of September for $22k from the sale of my business. I&#039;ve been chasing bank bonuses and am on track to earn $1,000 this year relatively easily, but we&#039;ve been paying 4% interest on my wife&#039;s $35k student loans, so it doesn&#039;t take a genius to figure out that $1,000 in bank bonuses is less than $1,400 in loan interest!!!

Our plan once I receive the next check is to eliminate her student loans and then put a lump sum into my 401(k) to supplement the ongoing contributions I&#039;m making to ensure I max it out for the year. That should still leave us about $15k in reserves. We&#039;ll probably keep that because we are very behind on retirement savings and don&#039;t have much we could access if we needed to.]]></description>

I think there&#039;s no harm in trying... and then if it doesn&#039;t work out or you feel too troubled at night, change it back. I&#039;ve identified about $10k because that&#039;s what I *think* I&#039;ll feel ok with. But who knows, if I can&#039;t sleep at night ahve have anxiety every day, I&#039;ll go back to cash.

As for putting 5k at a time, I personally think the lump sum approach is better. But you have to decide for yourself :). Good luck and congrats on the stocked up brokerage account!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joel! Fantastic article. I also have maintained a 5 month cash emergency fund, barely making anything with a &quot;high interest&quot; savings account from Capital One. I have a taxable brokerage account that is 100% in stocks that contains about 3 years worth of living expenses. Crazy thing is, I used to keep 20% of my brokerage in cash for that elusive &quot;buying opportunity.&quot;  A few months ago I wised up and threw it all into the index funds because everything just kept going up and I was missing out!

I am having more trouble psychologically with the cash emergency fund though. From a pure mathematical standpoint, I know I am losing out, but it still feels like a safety net/security blanket. What do you think a good strategy is to move this to stocks? I was thinking maybe to move the cash to stocks $5K at a time until I get to $10K and then maintain that moving forward. Thoughts?]]></description>

A little bit! Some of it deviated from VTSAX and went to more speculative stuff, which has cut into those gains haha. But long term, it should prove very fruitful!]]></description>

Keeping a little to cover cashflow issues is smart... I&#039;ll admit the &quot;$0.00&quot; is just a dramatic statement - in reality there will always be a few bucks in there to keep minimum balances.

I like the idea of calling the bank and negotiating account fees!]]></description>

Given the recent bull run, it sounds like you&#039;ve already made money on your emergency fund?  I agree, the 5-10k might be the best balance for me too.]]></description>

I think 48 hours is very doable. It might be a very stressful 48 hours, but doable nonetheless.  To each their own :)]]></description>

Awesome. That&#039;s the beauty of being in a good financial situation... You can focus more on peace of mind and freedom, vs. squeezing every single cent out of investments. My wife and I are still trying to find the sweet spot where we can sleep well, and also make the most of our assets. Cheers Fern!]]></description>

That&#039;s my thinking also. Actually, my margin line of credit from TD allows for same day WIRE transfers. So technically I think I could get a huge pile of cash within 24 hours if needed.]]></description>
