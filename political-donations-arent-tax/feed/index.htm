					<description><![CDATA[Its about time, with the Supreme court allowing non living endities the right to use its unlimited resources as a source of speech that is Policial advertising and not requring disclosure of source providor to put in  misinformation disguised as supposed news to mislead the public on records of the candidate or half truths  that spin peoples minds to actualy vote against thier own interests  its past time that Lobby groups are taxed to return funds to  the general fund to help recover from the past actions of  both elected and appointed political  hacks.

Between the National Chamber of Commerce, Corperate interests, union groups and National interest groups such as Oil Lobby groups Fracking Lobby groups and all the other 501k groups that attempt a twist regardless of its lean Liberal / Conserivitve  Left or right.  and the sMear groups like swift boat folk or Moral Majority  they all have strong political slants and go beyond facts to attempt to prove  thier view as the ONLY VIEW that should be correct  Back to the Middle of the road or be doomed to more extreamist acts.

Personally I believe  any political donation in excess of 50 dollars should be taxed at 50% and those funds applied to  half to the National debt the second half to pay off the bonds sold to social security by past elected officials for trust funds that they currently hold returning social security to the black. All parties caused the debt so this limit on the over all volume of ads would only be fair while reducing the misinformation by subchaper groups and lobby spinners.]]></description>
