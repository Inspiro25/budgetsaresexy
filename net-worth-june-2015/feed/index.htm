					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great that you pay ahead one month on all your bills. I have actually done it by 3 months as a form of emergency fund. 

I only have one payment not on auto pay because the bank holding my loan only seems to accept them if you have a bank account with them. Anyway, I ran out of envelopes and &#039;missed&#039; my payment last month, but no panic because I&#039;m well ahead!

By the way, that&#039;s a nice looking chart!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job on another successful month for you my friend! You have inspired me to start doing the same with my net worth too! I&#039;ve been tracking privately for a while, but starting to make a blog post each month makes me start to go more in depth and I think that&#039;s a good thing! Thanks for the motivation, one day I&#039;ll be where you&#039;re at!]]></description>

Did you do half and half? or focused on the bigger amount... thank you!]]></description>

For sure - I&#039;m not even going to log into my investments until the month is over, haha... it&#039;s crazy out there!

And I think we just hit 170 this week - woo! Lots of bloggers giving up the goods!]]></description>

Just put a bunch of money into a brokerage account, started a Betterment account, AND rolling over my retirement funds into an IRA from my ex-teaching job!!]]></description>
