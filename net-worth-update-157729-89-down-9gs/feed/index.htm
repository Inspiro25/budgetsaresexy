					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks :) As for our cash sacing goals, I kinda and kinda don&#039;t have a plan there.  In general I&#039;m trying to save save save for when the time comes to go 100% on my own &amp; work for myself.  So in theory, we&#039;ll stop saving that much until that occurs.  Now, if I don&#039;t go down that path one day then no - no plans on what to use it for.  Probably paying off the mortgages more than we are now, but def. not trying to do it aggresively.  I&#039;d much rather have $300k in the bank than $300k less mortgage debt, at least for now :)
@&lt;b&gt;Darren&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it&#039;s actually kinda convuluted right now but in a nutshell the 401(k) matches will be disappearing for sure.  I certainly took advantage of it while it lasted :)
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! We certainly plan to.
@&lt;b&gt;Laura&lt;/b&gt; - Hey Laura!  GREAT questions indeed, and I&#039;ll have to echo what StackingCash has already said - it&#039;s always best to first contribute up to the company&#039;s match in the 401(k) plan first.  Then, if you have the leeway, usually the Roth is the next avenue but it depends on people&#039;s personal situations.

To be honest, the first thing I&#039;d do (after the 401k match) is build up a nice fat Emergency Fund.  A few months worth of expenses, or maybe a nice round figure like $5K OR $10K, and THEN back to the investments.  If you guys dropped a lot into your house, it&#039;s more important to have liquid money you can touch NOW if needed rather than money in the future - does that make sense?  Either way it&#039;s great you&#039;re looking into this stuff now!!!  I started myself once we bought our first house so I totally get what you&#039;re going through :)
@&lt;b&gt;Single Guy Money&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s a good thing we don&#039;t need that money anytime soon ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Samurai&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, whatever you say big man.  If I cash it all out now it sure turns into cold hard cash ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah?  Oh man, if I had the money I&#039;d invest as much as I can while it&#039;s low again...a dream for those waiting to jump back in - at least I think so.
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! 360 months?  So basically the same as owning a home ;)  Quite an accomplishment though!  And great answer to Laura&#039;s question too.
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! Exactly.  Our nest egg may go down a bit but we&#039;re picking up future stocks cheaper!  Pro and con to all, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;dreams are more fun than paying off mortgages&quot; Love it! haha...I may have to tweet that ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t pay that mortgage down aggressively either just because your goal/dream is working for yourself.  It just makes sense to keep those cash reserves, and dreams are more fun than paying off mortgages :).  Just don&#039;t look at the interest section of your mortgage statements or you&#039;ll feel the pull to pay it down!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice Recap.  Seems as though almost everybody has been taking a hit in their 401k&#039;s lately.  For you and me however, I actually view this downturn as an extremly positive thing.  The market could be down for the next 5 years and I&#039;d be happy.   Why?  Beacuse I have (like you) 30-40 years until reitrement...All the down market means is that I am getting stocks for cheaper!

Also, Impressive emergency fund!  That takes some true discipline to hold an emergency fund of that size for so long!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Laura, most financial advisers will tell you to contribute to your 401k to get your companies match and then fund a Roth IRA.  Please be careful about what specific types of investments you pick in your retirement accounts, they can make you or break you.  Even though I&#039;m anti investing these days, I would probably recommend one of the 3 big mutual fund companies for your Roth IRA, Fidelity, Vanguard, and/or T.Rowe Price.  Oh, depending on the interest on your house, it sometimes is a good idea to pay it off faster than the typical 30 years most people do.

J. Money, like you there&#039;s nothing like looking at a fat savings account.  Especially after your recent work drama.  I forgot where I saw it but someone mentioned having a 360 month emergency fund.  That&#039;s what I&#039;m working on :)  You should too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow dude, you losing over $10k in your 401k last month makes me feel much better about the $4k I lost in mine. It sucks and I know it will eventually come back but patience is not one of my strong points.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. I&#039;ve got a question that maybe somebody can help me out with? I&#039;m sitting down this month to look seriously at our finances and work at making wise investment, savings, etc. decisions. Which is something my husband and I have been lackadaisical about. We just bought a house, though and a lot of our cash savings went into that. Anyway, its kind of the wake-up call we&#039;ve needed to get in action re: personal finances.

Anyway, my question is related to 401Ks and IRAs. My husband is able to contribute to a matched 401K through his employer, which he does. We need to up it to maximum matched, I think, but otherwise ok. I work for the city and do not have the option of a matched 401K. I do contribute each month to a pension plan and the city contributes to that on my behalf as well. I have a 401A (or somesuch) that is not doing very much at all. I don&#039;t even know if it is worth it to continue or if it makes more sense to focus on an IRA for myself? Or perhaps I should be pursuing both options? Does anyone have any suggestions? I am a total newbie at this and reading all the net worth accounts recently have made me think...

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know that you&#039;ve mentioned that your company isn&#039;t doing the best. Is that why they stopped matching your 401k contributions?

From 100% to 0%... that would not be pleasant!]]></description>
