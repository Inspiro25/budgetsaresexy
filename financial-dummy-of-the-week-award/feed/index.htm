Eek - good catch!

Does your bank allow it to be connected to another account there where it will auto. xfer over $$ to avoid fees? I have that set up with USAA so it dips into my savings account if i ever overdraw the checking and love knowing it&#039;s in place. (And love that you wear an evil eye necklace too! gotta ward off all that negative energy out there! &#128514;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOVE your eye ring! I wear an Evil Eye necklace every single day.

Back in May I overdraft my checking account for the first time in years because I didn&#039;t realize several transactions hadn&#039;t processed. I was SO upset. 

Luckily, I transferred money from a separate online savings account and it came over same day so I didn&#039;t have a fee or anything, I was just disappointed I even did that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG, mood rings!!!! What a throwback!


I decided to put a little play money into individual stocks for the first time ever. My intuition was saying &#039;no not right now&#039; but the market kept going up (this was late  last year) so I jumped in. And then not long after... you know where it went :S]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I overpaid for a used item of furniture on Craigslist, but I&#039;m not fretting it since I probably made the seller&#039;s day by not shopping around for it! Couldn&#039;t beat the convenience factor (was in the neighborhood) so I&#039;ll pay the upcharge haha. My philosophy is that if you know it was a mistake then it wasn&#039;t a mistake but a learning opportunity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazon will let you return items to Kohl&#039;s (in most, if not all, areas) and you don&#039;t have to box it up or prep it for shipping.  Just submit the return request through Amazon, put the items back in its original packaging, and drop it off at the Amazon desk at Kohl&#039;s.   They&#039;ll even give you a $5 Kohl&#039;s shopping credit for that day.  Easy!]]></description>
