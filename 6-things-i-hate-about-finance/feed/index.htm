Yep, same boat, don&#039;t mind doing my own taxes....I must not hate it considering I do them a couple times a year to ensure I&#039;m near where I need to be and adjust my withholdings to match :).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My family kept encouraging me to create a will, and I kept procrastinating. Eventually I stumbled across http://willing.com/ which made it really easy and took away all of the hurdles for me. I&#039;m no lawyer, but it seems good enough for my money (free!) to at least have something in place. Hope it helps some of you remove one more thing you hate from your life! :)]]></description>

Nice of you to help your mom out! I need one of you for here ;) They harassed me for months to provide proof that my two kids weren&#039;t receiving income. I was like &quot;Umm... cuz they can&#039;t even talk?&quot;. I considered uploading pictures of them to prove they were babies but didn&#039;t want to piss anyone off :) So I kindly reminded them of their ages and eventually it was acceptable.]]></description>

Haha... I do have half of that problem (been waking up at 5 am for 90 work days in a row - thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/learned-working-like-benjamin-franklin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt;!) but can&#039;t say I need to report anywhere other than my laptop :) Until you hit financial freedom though you&#039;re never truly &quot;free.&quot; I pretend I am cuz I blog for a living but there&#039;s still $hit to do and money to be made... I&#039;d die to just have fun blogging away my thoughts and not take care of any other sides of the blog/business!]]></description>

No worries at all - I&#039;m glad you stopped by! I always wonder how good or not they are, but man - $2,000-$3,000 is just sooooo much. Can&#039;t wrap my head around it even though logically it all makes sense. (And def. worth it if the $hit does hit the fan sooner than later!). Thanks for sharing the real-life insight :)]]></description>

&quot;Money&quot; your wife is a &quot;saint&quot;.....Just had a meeting to discuss health insurance plans to replace my &quot;grandfathered plan&quot; and I felt like I was at a car dealership. The vagueness of coverage, terms, spending limits, exclusion and inclusions was mind boggling. IMHO the most important terms to understand in coverage &quot;aggregate and separate&quot; under member responsibility. It seems my old plan may actually be better....You could start a blog JUST about this topic!]]></description>
