					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry you had to go through such a disorienting experience. I hope that it has truly helped you become who you&#039;d like to be and let you stop fussing about what other people are doing. There is so much freedom in not &quot;needing&quot; to judge other folks and their choices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kudos for turning this into such a positive experience.  I&#039;ve learned that some of the hardest things I&#039;ve gone through turn out to be the biggest blessings.  Those life-changing experiences gave me so much more purpose and meaning to the life I live today.  Now, I can go through my days with so much more intentionality.  I look back with so much gratefulness for those soul-searching lessons learned.]]></description>

Hi Caroline - these transitions can be challenging but they can also bring upon a change for the better. In my situation, I am now very thankful to have been fired and am working towards building the life/work situation of my dreams. I’m still figuring it out but I am actively looking for new biz opportunities - somewhere between “working” and spending time with family. Best of luck with your own transition. If you are interested, I wrote a post titled “Starting Over” that addresses some of this. Take care]]></description>

Couldn’t agree more Bernz. It’s rare when I take a trip and don’t learn something about myself.  I look forward to the day I have something new to lead and you are absolutely right, i’ll be doing so with a completely different perspective.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing story - thank you so much for sharing. I feel like I&#039;m often fighting very hard to avoid being pulled into that place where your job becomes your identity, resisting being made a &#039;leader&#039; of a business. And its for exactly the reason your story highlights - I like my job, and the people -
 I just don&#039;t want to become my job. 

Congratulations on the exciting journey ahead of you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing.
I am facing a similar dilemma , without the abrupt announcement, and I am struggling with it ! 
I am trying to prepare myself for what&#039;s coming, I have worked for my company for most of my life, but I am not sure where to start?
Glad to see you are managing well:) Are you working at all or just &quot;retired&quot;?]]></description>

Hey Menard - I still think fondly of my old colleagues and friends and don’t wish them any ill will. Furthermore, while I’m not at the company, it was my “first born” and don’t want them to suffer any “bad” publicity. Just wanted to let you know my thinking on keeping the company name out of the post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the post. Wish he had mentioned the name of the company though. In the end, it doesn&#039;t matter what your level of power, wealth or prestige-- we are all the same (e.g. we all go to the bathroom to poop). When I was still working in the Philippines, we had to address our bosses with &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;M&#039;am&quot; as a sign of respect. I was so used to this aspect that I brought it with me on my first job in the U.S... Wish someone had warned me of this because I&#039;ve been addressing my 29 year old manager with &quot;Sir&quot; the first month of my employ (which he probably enjoyed).]]></description>
