This is absolutely why I love the power of the internet to create wealth and earn a 100% online living. You can do all of this from anywhere or the comfort of your home without 0% real-world human interaction. Affiliate marketing, blogging, buying and selling is today&#039;s new new of &quot;stable employment.&quot; :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read through the No.1 &quot;How a Spreadsheet Changed My Life&quot;. I suppose quite many people tried to track their money, but most of them failed. The success depends on how serious we take it. The author broke down his money into 12 categories with short term and long term aims. At the same time, he also invests to keep his wealth growing.]]></description>

Haha yeah - it crashed so much stuff!! Even knocked my entire email newsletter off, for not only that day, but others too because it couldn&#039;t get past it to pull newer items in the feed, ugh... Learned how to avoid in future though, so at least that&#039;s good (maybe for the &quot;this is what a BILLION dollars looks like post? Haha...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love these, didn&#039;t see a couple of them before even though I&#039;ve been scouring your site. 

Hit my first $100,000 this month (net worth).  A little late to the party, but better late than never, I guess.  I&#039;ve been putting $ in my 401k since I was able to, and I have coworkers my age or older who&#039;ve never contributed, and I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re thinking.  But I still feel like *I&#039;m* not doing enough!  

Thanks for all you do!  I found your blog simply looking for reviews of Acorns, and now I&#039;m investing more and tracking everything.  You help people, man, and that&#039;s so awesome!]]></description>
