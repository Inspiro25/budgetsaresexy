					<description><![CDATA[I keep track of all my raises (so just base income) so I can remind myself how far we&#039;ve come :) But I don&#039;t share that, it&#039;s just a reality check for myself. I do like grabbing the info from the IRS too, occasionally.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That income graph is a neat idea!  I should pull my husband &#038; I&#039;s data and see how we compare. He went to school for 2 years and then to work, while I did a bachelor&#039;s degree, worked for 4 years, then went to grad school for my master&#039;s. He&#039;s also 5 years older than me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A while back I added a &quot;annual income&quot; chart to our google spreadsheet. It was fun watching our two salaries leapfrog from 2007 to 2014 (until my wife&#039;s company realized what a badass she is and got to paying her appropriately; she&#039;s maintained a significant lead over me the last few years!).]]></description>
