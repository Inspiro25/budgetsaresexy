					<description><![CDATA[Aww I love this!

My word for the year is SHINE (both helping others shine, and myself) and a big part of that already has just been voicing to others what they mean to me.]]></description>

Yup - exactly! takes me a while to formulate my thoughts so having that additional time is great. And i&#039;m digging your Thursday thankfulness too! That&#039;s cool! Wouldn&#039;t have ever thought about dropping notes in mailboxes but it works magically :) Would make for a great project for *kids* to do as well for those houses they like - i&#039;m going to make a note and see if any of mine are up for it next season &#128591;]]></description>

YESS!! Beautiful idea! The *least* expectedness of it all the better :) And the nice thing about it is that it can be done at any place and any point - not just the holidays!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I sporadically do something called Thankful Thursdays, where for 1 month I find 4 people in my life to thank on. Thursday. I used this in December to thank some of the neighbors with great lights displays. When my friends and I were walking if a house made us stop and go &#039;WOW&quot;, I&#039;d note down the address and pop a quick note in the mail. One person even sent us a holiday card back!  Very rarely do we decorate the outside of our houses just for ourselves...so I wanted folks to know we appreciated their efforts.
I like your plan because you can make the connection in the moment and still take time to thoughtfully construct your message.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J!  Working on a version of this in our house. Trying to acknowledge &#038; thank those invisible people who keep life moving. Recently did this at the airport…..at Christmas - the TSA guy mindlessly staring at that X-ray screen. Super-surprised to be acknowledged and even more surprised to receive positive affirmation from someone on the other side of the screen!  Hopeful that we made his day! ……Happy New Year!]]></description>
