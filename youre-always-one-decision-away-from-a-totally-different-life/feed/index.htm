					<description><![CDATA[The most minor decision that led to a major life change: I decided to go out for Chinese food instead of ordering pizza one day back in 1987. I ended up running into a guy I dated in college and hadn’t seen in ages. We just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary this year!]]></description>

Very nice!! Way to change the course like that even though it &quot;cost&quot; you an extra year! Not the easiest choice to make at the time I&#039;m sure :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the big decisions for me, was switching from a Bachelor of Science track to a Bachelor of Commerce track, and ending up taking an extra year to finish college.  If I hadn&#039;t done that, then the timing would have been &quot;off&quot; and I wouldn&#039;t have been in the right place at the right time, to hear the advertisements for a 9 month course that promised to turn you into an IT professional.  At the time the radio ads were playing, I had been working for about a year after college, and was HATING my job - so I was ripe for the plucking and signed up - which led to my current career and my awesome life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What changed my life was agreeing to take a staring role in a play as a teenager. I was a painfully shy nerd. But I could act, who knew! And by Stepping out of my Comfort zone my life changed forever. I became a risk taker and got a hot girlfriend and made a lot of money as a leader. That one decision  changed everything!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lots of things were life-changing in hindsight but I have no idea what we&#039;re doing today that will be life-changing tomorrow :) Most of my things are small decisions that turned out to be huge or really significant in our lives. 

Case in point: I sent a handful of treats to a colleague I&#039;d never met before because I felt bad that she had to work on a weekend, because of my unreasonable boss, and that sparked the beginning of a 20 year (and counting!) mentor relationship and friendship. I didn&#039;t even know that&#039;s what sparked her decision to become my friend and mentor until she told me ten years later!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this! It&#039;s funny to think about a parallel life we could be living if we had made a different choice. I think I&#039;m definitely going to do this exercise. There have been some HUGE moments that shifted everything for me. You tend to have a lot of stories when you&#039;ve reached the ripe old, I mean mature age of 49. lol]]></description>
