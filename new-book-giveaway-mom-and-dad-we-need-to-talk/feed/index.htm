12!!! WOW!!!

Hopefully it&#039;ll mean people can chip in and share the responsibility at least once time! (And *before* time too, while they&#039;re young/healthy as you mentioned)]]></description>

At least y&#039;all have knocked out some good pieces of it!

Those scammers are horrible... I don&#039;t know how you could do that to another person, no less the elderly. I&#039;m glad you were able to alert her to it :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m fairly young and my parents are both under 60 so it hadn&#039;t been a topic I&#039;ve thought of discussing until recently. The topic of long term care has recently come up with a relative who is over 100! At this point, the conversation is very difficult for family members to have but it has sparked a ton of interest for me to have a sit down with my parents while everyone is happy and healthy! Especially important to have it now since I have 12 siblings, each with their own opinion...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My parents (74 and 75) have always been pretty open with me and my brother (mostly me though since I live closest/see them the most) about their finances.  They&#039;ve got their wills ready, and update/review them every 3-5 years.  I&#039;ve been added to some of their checking/savings accounts, and given POA over financial decisions because I&#039;m physically located closer and more easily able to handle bills and whatnot that might come in if they ever end up incapacitated at the same time.  My brother has been given POA over medical decisions because we figured I&#039;d be more emotionally unable to make certain decisions that may need to be made.

With all that said though, it&#039;s past time for my mom to hand over the finances to someone else, my dad, at the very least!  She&#039;s handled their finances throughout their 49 year marriage, and he&#039;s got NO CLUE what the state of their checking account is.  Her memory...is not good.  And her trust in the goodness of people....far too naive!  A couple years ago (tell me if you&#039;ve heard this one before...), she answered a call from &quot;Window&#039;s tech support, we&#039;ve noticed something going on with your computer and need access to it...&quot;.  Needless to say, once I finally discovered what was going on, that little adventure cost her somewhere in the neighborhood of $2500-3000, a new computer, and a closing and reopening of all their bank accounts (which reminds me, I better check to make sure I&#039;m added to those!).  Dad on the other hand is more &#039;worldly&#039; and likely wouldn&#039;t fall for one of those calls and wants all the bills set up for auto-pays, but she can&#039;t handle change very well with her memory.  He wants to learn how to do the bills and taking things over from her, but she&#039;s become so regimented in HOW she does the bills (again, she doesn&#039;t handle change very well) that anytime they sit down for her to teach him it just ends up in frustration and fights.  So, to keep the peace, he buries his head in the sand about it all.  BTW, she gets incredibly defensive when you bring up the memory issues, and how she should maybe let someone else take over...fun times!

Sorry for the rambling story, from the first paragraph it sounds like they&#039;ve got their crap together, but then it devolves into a bundle of issues!]]></description>
