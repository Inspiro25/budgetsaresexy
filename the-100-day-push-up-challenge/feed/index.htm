Interesting about the hand stands! Do you just do them for a certain amount of time? do you do them walking? are they supposed to work out similar muscles? Can I ask like a million more questions???! lolol…]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pumped to be a part of this. For a long time, I was doing 40-50 pushups a day, but then I switched to doing hand stands about a year ago and stopped with the pushups. Now that I have handstands under control, it was time to switch back. 

But man, 100 push ups really knocks your arms and chest out. I might have to do some of these inclined ones that Sarah is talking about to get a rest day in heh!]]></description>

YES!!! BEAUTIFUL!!! I&#039;m looking into pullups and other exercises for the next challenge too... I really want one of those bar things that you put in the doorways, but there are NONE on our main level where we hang out so would have to put it in the bedrooms and not sure that&#039;s as helpful :( I&#039;ll figure out something tough, I want to keep the momentum going! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite being quite physically fit in many ways, I was never able to do proper pushups. So beginning of 2021 I decided to start where I was and set out doing 30 pushups (3 sets of 10) every morning. First few weeks were inclined at the kitchen counter and I worked my way down from there, utilizing steps on my staircase. Now I do 30 strict pushups every day on the floor while the coffee brews.  I’d like to do the same thing with pulls ups but I need to figure out a way to modify inside my house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, there’s an easier way to knock out 100 push-ups a day or more.  Every time you walk through a doorway, knock out 10.  You will be amazed at how many you will do daily.  BaS!!!

P.S. Just don’t do it in the bathroom.]]></description>
