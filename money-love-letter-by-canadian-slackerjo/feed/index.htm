					<description><![CDATA[Oh man.  was. this. funny.

PS - feel very, very lucky that you got a $1 bill.  They are very, very rare these days!  Canadian Tire money, however, is rather prevalent.  It&#039;s actually going to be in a guest post I have later this week.

I must make sure not to overtip strippers due to the lack of appropriate bill.  There are a lot of jokes about flicking change at strippers here... heh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone for the great comments. Sometimes I take pencil to paper and weird things happen.Perhaps I should not lick the lead in the pencil first?

The Canadian $1 coin (known as a Loonie because of the etching of a loon on the coin) just celebrated its 25th birthday. There is now an entire generation of Canadians who know nothing of $1 and $2 bills and perhaps are over tipping strippers as we still have $5 bills.

If you look up Loonie on the Wikipedia you will see this note:
&quot;This article is about the coin. For the Canadian dollar as a currency, see Canadian dollar. For a mentally ill person, see lunatic.&quot;

Oh Wikipedia, it&#039;s a fine line.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this with us. I don&#039;t think I would be able to come up with so many funny things, even if I tried. Sorry, I&#039;m not sharing one of my dollars with you (unless you need it for Baby $$). I&#039;ve got a mortgage principal pay off extravaganza going on here!]]></description>
