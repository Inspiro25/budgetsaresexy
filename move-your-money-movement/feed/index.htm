					<description><![CDATA[I know BofA has a ton of ATMs, but most Credit Unions are in a network together. I can use any CU ATM from nearly any other CU. It works out fine. As for the trouble of switching, it&#039;s not that difficult provided you have your financial stuff in some kind of order (and i&#039;m assuming your readers do).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I moved my money to a smaller bank, but because I got a better home equity loan rate than BnA offered.  The lack of branches hasn&#039;t bothered me.

I think its a case by case basis.  In cities its probably easier to move.  In smaller places, not so much!]]></description>
