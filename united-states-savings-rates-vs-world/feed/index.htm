					<description><![CDATA[Sexy!!  Love spreadsheet calculations ;)

Was actually just reading Money Mag last night, and they said the average American is saving only 3% now??  Not sure how these numbers differ so drastically, but either way 3 or 10 is still not enough.  It&#039;s damn better than 0% though! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am actually surprised the rate is 10%!  It scares me that we are not saving enough since our social security system is not great and most companies are getting rid of pensions.  This means we all have to finance our own retirements.  Right now we are only saving 10%, but in the past have been between 15 - 25%.  I actually added a line in my excel monthly/yearly expense/income summary that tracks our actual savings for the year/month.  This way I always know exactly where we are at for savings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahahaa.. I love it. &quot;The key is to get other people to spend money while you are saving. That way the economy improves and you have enough for retirement. :)&quot;  (And congrats on staying strong at 50%!  You&#039;re gonna be there in no time!!)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh be careful w/ that though!  I did that in 2008 and then when all housing prices crashed I couldn&#039;t take out my money anymore!!  I didn&#039;t &quot;lose&quot; my $10,000 per say (it just paid down the HELOC) BUT I lost access to it.  Hopefully we&#039;re all over that mess these days, but just a fair warning ;)  It was actually one of my very first blog posts! Haha... &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/operation-heloc-bad_12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Operation HELOC: The Bad&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - COOL!!! Your man does stand up comedy??  He TOTALLY needs to do a Side Hustle post with us! It would be awesome because not only is it interesting as HELL, but it would be FUNNY! Haha.. right?  Ask him :)  Pleasssssse!
@&lt;b&gt;Corey @ 20&#039;s Finances&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  Keep it up! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; -  Huh... saving too much can crap out a Nation?  Never really thought about it that way.  Though it&#039;s not gonna change me for continuing to do it ;)  If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned over the years, it&#039;s that only WE care - and have the power - to make sure we&#039;re okay financially.  As long as we continue pushing forward and trying to better our own situation, as it makes sense, we should be fine later.  Doesn&#039;t mean we stomp over anyone or anything like that, just that we make sure we got our own backs ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - I know right? Wouldn&#039;t THAT be heavenly :)
@&lt;b&gt;fabulouslyfrugirl&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I can&#039;t even imagine.  That&#039;s GREAT you got to experience it there and have that better understanding!  Gonna go over and check out your blog after submitting these comments :)  Thanks for stopping by.
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.. no, it&#039;s called LIVING YOUR DREAM!!! :)  So proud of you!!!!  Welcome to the dark side, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Neo&lt;/b&gt; - AGREED!!!  GREAT question!! And you&#039;re not bragging at all, just putting your feelings out there - that&#039;s what we love about blogging!
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - I think you&#039;re on to something there :)  Better to make sure 100% that you&#039;re fine, but doing it YOURSELF than relying on others (or other organizations).  Worst case you&#039;ll then have double the money! Woo!
@&lt;b&gt;NICOLE C.&lt;/b&gt; - Nice work!  That is a LOT of savings!
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - I think he&#039;s making his own insurance ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, we all start somewhere right?  I hope to join you in 5-7 years :)  Well, I&#039;ll still be blogging, but I want to give up all the other annoying stuff, haha... always gotta be working towards a goal!
@&lt;b&gt;Monica&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, well I hope you find that job soon then!  And that it&#039;s MUCH better than the last one :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@matt @yana. I am with you guys. I have firends who spend every dollar that comes in and I am baffled by it!

@stackingcash.  I have plenty of insurance I just don&#039;t have much faaith in relying on my employer to keep paying me and I don&#039;t want to sacrifice the fun in my life if I do lose my job hence I save like crazy to insure I don&#039;t get burned.  Plus insurance reallly won&#039;t help with job loss]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is very difficult to say because comparison between countries are next to impossible. For instance, 18% of my pay cheque goes before I see anything in my bank account (on my pension scheme and on National Insurance which in the UK gives access to different benefits). Does this count as saving? It should because a lot of savings in the US are in pension funds. On top of that we put aside 20% or over (depends on the month). Problem is: my financial awakening took a bit of time so now need to run very fast. I do want to be able to leave employment in 5 to 7 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope the 10% saving rate is on top of the money that we save for retirement. 

So, up to now, I contribute 9.5% (plus employer match) into my 401(k), 8.4% after tax money into ROTH IRA. Then I save 12.9% after tax money for emergency and car fund.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Neo, I hear you on that.  I was most comfortable saving 30-35% of our income, which is not at all a large income.  A very close friend of mine whose household income is at least double what our is does not care much about saving.  The biggest difference I see between her and me is that she has full faith in promises, such as pensions, social security and work-related benefits/investments.  I, on the other hand, have minimal faith in promises.  I think it&#039;s both a matter of faith, and an inability to imagine financial needs that are not in the present moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Melissa - That&#039;s exactly the boat I&#039;m in right now. Negative savings, for the lose. Job freedom, for the win.

@Neo - The contract I was working on just got moved to India, and I can&#039;t imagine being most of my coworkers. Except for one who had had a stroke and was legitimately spending a large percentage of his money on medical bills, the rest of them were spending money on crap they didn&#039;t need and not saving a dime. Didn&#039;t they realize how easily they could lose their jobs? It&#039;s hard to feel sorry for any of them, since I was working the same job and was still able to save up a sizable emergency fund, while also paying off all of my private school loans. Was it fun? Not usually. But I&#039;m sleeping a lot better at night than they are, I&#039;m sure.]]></description>
