You can get the same result with either sending one extra payment per year (great use of a tax refund) or if that feels too big.  Take the amount of one months payment, divide by 12, and add that to each month.   (If your payment is $1200 / send $1300 instead.  $1200 pmt/12 = $100 -&#062; add $1200 pmt plus1/12th and send $1300).  
All have the same effect.]]></description>

Thanks, J! I&#039;ll let you know how it goes. :)
  
Stephanie - awesome! I hope it&#039;s helpful for you. There&#039;s something very liberating about a &quot;no spend&quot; month. I&#039;ve done 6-8 &quot;no spend&quot; months in the past where I&#039;ve tried to cut everything except &quot;essentials&quot;. It definitely helped, but I also found I expended a lot of mental energy deciding what was essential, and then rationalizing things that were on the borderline. I also didn&#039;t really track my spending either, so although I saw positive results overall, it didn&#039;t change my behavior long term. For this year, I&#039;m tracking in my planner every night what I&#039;ve spent that day, and aiming for 50% no spend days a month means I don&#039;t have to rationalize quite so much - I&#039;ve either spent money or I haven&#039;t. It&#039;s cleaner for me, and I feel more accountable and can celebrate the win of a no-spend day when I mark my planner at the end of the day. I&#039;m still early into the challenge, but I&#039;m definitely finding it fruitful so far. It&#039;s like a game, and it makes turning down those extra/mindless cups of coffee, ice cream (boo!), dining out, or whatever worth it.]]></description>

And that&#039;s perfectly okay!! Owning is NOT for everyone, and even for those who can afford it (like those who prefer to invest in other places instead). It&#039;s all about finding your own comfort levels and then being strong enough to stick to them :)]]></description>

I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH!!!

Will you both come back to let me know how it goes, please?! :)

I&#039;ve never tried a literal no spend day/month before, but I kinda like the twist... Similar to drinking I find it&#039;s much easier to just do completely without than tempt yourself with exceptions :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read this book more than a decade ago when I was starting my personal finance journey.  I still automate many things, especially savings.  I also went to a couple of David Bach&#039;s seminars and learnt a lot.  One thing I have not done though, is to be a home owner here in the US as I relocate internationally every few years.  However, I have property in my home country whose value has continued increasing faster than I expected.]]></description>

Leah, as February starts soon, I’m getting ready to begin a no-spend month. That means only needs, like milk (some people suggest buying in quantity and freezing it, but I HATE frozen, thawed out milk), fresh veggies/fruit, and medical co-pays. You get the idea. I like how you’re tracking your no-spend days!  Last time I did this I made some huge discoveries about myself, and found that some needs are really, truly, just wants. Yes, I CAN survive when I run out of my fav flavored coffee creamer. No-spend month is a very serious endeavor for me as it points out in glaring detail my not so great habits, yet gives me an opportunity to grow my money-handling skills. 
I can’t wait to hear how you progress as the year wears on; I specifically do a month so I can evaluate and then decide when I can do it again. Cheers girl!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice list! One important caveat: You can&#039;t just decide to send your mortgage payment like that. Your mortgage company has to allow it. It&#039;s a great tip, but it does require checking to see that they allow it. Some, realizing what a great tip it is, charge you to set it up to do it, and some don&#039;t allow it at all.]]></description>
