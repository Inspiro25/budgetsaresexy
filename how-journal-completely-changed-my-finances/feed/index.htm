					<description><![CDATA[Great article and very insightful. #1 things I tell everyone I find struggling in life is to &#039;write it down&#039; but maybe I should tell them to start &#039;keeping a goal related journal&#039;. Hah]]></description>

We own several ETFs and gold/silver stocks, cryptos and some long-term dividend.  Mr. Dragonfly is an avid reader on precious metals and has been tracking several companies throughout the years and have various portfolios on their performance.  We are not stock analysts but we do our homework before we put in money.  We cashed out some bullions at our local jewelry stores and got the market value back, and more.  It&#039;s a good investment with gold/silver.  
We have recently started downsizing - selling several furniture that we no longer need.  It&#039;s liberating to see my room/floor.  This is not a long-term strategy but it brings a different feeling when you can part with &quot;things&quot; - the &quot;what you own, own you&quot; is valid.  You feel free when you are no longer &quot;owned&quot; by anything:-)]]></description>

LOVE that you guys give each other bullion like that!! (And even more so that it&#039;s in form of coins, as an active coin collector myself :)). Was just thinking the other day that it would be a good way for me to diversify more and maybe even include in my net worth... Feels silly to include a &quot;coin collection&quot; in there, but maybe just the silver/gold values since they&#039;re easily liquidable? I wouldn&#039;t go as far as cashing out stocks and putting all into gold/silver, but a % can def. help diversify more :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We bought each other precious metals pure silver or gold coins (.9999) as gifts these days.  One they appreciate over time, two they are tangible and actually feel like you own something together, but most importantly, we look at these coins as our retirement pocket money.

I wholeheartedly agree with your claim - what you write becomes your life.  My father was a very active journal writer and he passed that passion to me.  I often look at what I wrote - goals and comparing notes - it propels me to not just sitting on my butt after a 10-hour work day but just keep going to accomplish what I need to do.  Thanks for the validation :-)]]></description>
