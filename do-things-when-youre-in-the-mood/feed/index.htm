Yes - hustle while AT work, haha... Or at least on your lunch hour if that&#039;s looked down upon there ;)

You can also do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/learned-working-like-benjamin-franklin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Benjamin Franklin schedule&lt;/a&gt; with me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This rings a little too close to home, hahah. It&#039;s almost crippling how much I can&#039;t work when I&#039;m not in the mood. Like clockwork, my brain will shut down around 7 or 8PM each night and there is no hope of working more, hah. In college I was able to use this to my advantage by getting up super early and powering through my homework and other work for a solid 5+ hours. But now that I&#039;m working 9-5, I&#039;m finding it MUCH more difficult to perform at my best without adhering to my internal schedule. One of the (many) downfalls of working in an office, haha. Any tips for how you dealt with it when you were still part of the 9-5ers?]]></description>

It&#039;s def. easier when you work for yourself or even at home vs a traditional 9-5 (or better - when you&#039;re financially free, yes! :)). But no - I usually sleep 6&#039;ish+ hours, esp as I&#039;ve been doing less hustling in the evenings to try and get away from work so much... those hours above are just when I&#039;m really REALLY good at things :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you only sleep 5 hours per night? Must be that coffee you have in the evening. This is very wise advice. To the extent that we&#039;re able to follow through on doing things when the mood strikes, it&#039;s a good idea in every way to follow through. But if I get motivated to, say, my budget when I&#039;m at work . . . not such a good idea. Another reason why financial freedom is so appealing. Being able to follow through on what we&#039;re in the mood to do at any given moment is VERY appealing.]]></description>

I also can&#039;t believe you only sleep 5 hours a day. Ouch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right on.  I&#039;m lucky enough to be able to create my daily schedule.  I&#039;m much more productive when I&#039;m in the mood for a task or activity whether it is work, yoga, networking, cleaning, yard work, etc.  I do work every morning when my brain is ready to go but some days that&#039;s it and other days I feel like working all evening too so I do!  Go with flow!]]></description>

Well you DO need to be in the mood for that or it won&#039;t be optimum either, haha.... (though usually when you get going you get in the mood much faster than other items ;))]]></description>
