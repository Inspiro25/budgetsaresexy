<p><strong>So I’ve been working on a new project lately, and it&#8217;s officially live :)</strong></p>
<p>It has nothing to do with personal finance (*gasp*), but it is something that could help save you a ton of money &#8211; and grow faster! &#8211; if you run a business. It also heavily relies on AI, so if you’ve been trying to figure out the best way to harness it in this brave new world this could be the trick.</p>
<p>Introducing&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5238" src="https://jmoney.biz/wp-content/uploads/youbots-logo.webp" alt="youbots logo" width="373" height="94" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>YouBots.ai</strong></a><strong> &#8211; A suite of <em>advanced, powerful marketing tools powered by AI!</em></strong></p>
<p>My partner in crime has been <em>obsessed</em> with AI this past year &#8211; to the point he even changed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natestpierre/" target="_blank">his entire career</a> around it! &#8211; and after watching him build out customized &#8220;bots&#8221; for companies and selling them for thousands of dollars a pop, I asked him why he doesn&#8217;t just package them all up under one roof and offer them up to *everybody*? Kinda like the world&#8217;s first AI marketing agency, but only at a fraction of the price?</p>
<p>He paused for a few seconds leading me to believe it was massively stupid, haha, but to my surprise he eventually shot back with, &#8220;this is the best idea you&#8217;ve ever had &#8211; we need to build it.&#8221; Lol&#8230; Okay!</p>
<p><strong>And just like that YouBots was born :)</strong></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t say I ever imagined myself doing anything around AI, but it was one of those instances where it just clicked and I knew I&#8217;d regret it if I didn&#8217;t go for it. So we&#8217;ll see what happens! We already have a number of paying clients, and it&#8217;s been fun as hell working on the branding and building out the site&#8230;</p>
<p>Just look at these cute little robots!!</p>
<p><a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5233 " style="border: 2px solid #CCCCCC;" src="https://jmoney.biz/wp-content/uploads/bots-1024x860.png" alt="youbots" width="700" height="588" /></a></p>
<p><strong>At any rate, if you run a business and wanna see if these bots can help YOU, check out <a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>our site</strong></a> and let me know what you think. It&#8217;s set up so that anyone on your team can use it without needing to know a thing about AI, prompt engineering, or even software development.</strong></p>
<p>Our target audience is small-medium businesses who wish they had a bigger budget for hiring (both people and marketing agencies), so we&#8217;ve priced it with that in mind and one of our clients is already saving $4,000/mo. It&#8217;s beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Check it out &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouBots.ai</a></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re currently offering a <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>one-week free trial</strong></span>, then <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>50% off the subscription cost </strong></span>while we&#8217;re in beta. No credit card required for the demo, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to over here! How about you? Anyone else dabbling in AI or working on a new project? Would love to learn all about it :)</p>
<p>Your long-time, non-AI powered, friend,</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I should note that while AI<em> can</em> do big huge amazing things to make your life and work better, I don&#8217;t believe it should be a substitute for YOU. To me it&#8217;s meant for *enhancing* your work, not replacing it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>I’m about to introduce you to a frugal living rule I started using almost a decade ago.</strong></p>
<p>It’s saved me untold amounts of money.</p>
<p>And to be honest, it’s without much sacrifice at all (none, in some circumstances).</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">It’s called <em><strong>The Half Rule</strong>.</em></p>
<p>I only wish I&#8217;d discovered it back in my early 20s when I could’ve really used it!</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;ll help you fight inflation. It&#8217;ll cut your grocery bill down without having to stop buying the products that you like.</strong></p>
<p>And you&#8217;ll start to have some money left at the end of the month.</p>
<p>While it can’t be used on everything, it can be used in more cases than you think.</p>
<p>Ready for it?</p>
<h2>What is the Half Rule?</h2>
<p>The Half Rule means cutting the amount of product you use <em>in half</em>, and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>Does it still perform like it should? Then keep it at the new, half-level. Do you need to add a bit more to it? Go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll likely always end up using less than you were before, causing you to have to buy a replacement product less (and saving you money).</p>
<p>I started playing around with this over a decade ago. and I can&#8217;t tell you how much money it&#8217;s saved me (without having to buy generics or go without).</p>
<p>You see, I&#8217;m going out on a limb here, but I think we all use too much product.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">And there are three main reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturer Recommendations are Inflated</strong>: Manufacturer recommendations are often asking us to use more of the product than necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Habits are Hard to Break</strong>: We have developed a habit of using a certain amount of a product, and it&#8217;s hard to change habits. (J$: This is me!! I need to work on this!)</li>
<li><strong>Product Inflation is a Real Thing</strong>: We&#8217;re experiencing product inflation, where we think to get the same amount of pleasure out of something, we need to use more of it (has anyone increased their Starbucks size to grande, for example, to get the same degree of pleasure they used to get from a tall?).</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested this rule out by cutting in half my use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shampoo</li>
<li>Laundry detergent</li>
<li>Dryer sheets (I’ve cut them in half to no bad effect for <em>decades</em> now)</li>
<li>Cooking oil (started <a href="https://amzn.to/4hJ0VR3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using an oil mister</a> instead of pouring it)</li>
<li>Restaurant meals (I typically take 1/3 to ½ home for lunch)</li>
<li>Bagels for breakfast (I started eating half a bagel at home, instead of a whole one)</li>
<li>Starbucks order size</li>
<li>Glass stovetop cleaner</li>
<li>Tape (when wrapping gifts)</li>
</ul>
<p>And those are just the easy ones you can start with.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>TIP:</strong> to save even more money, pair this Half Rule with my <a id="m_-6435506520908895220OWAf7e429eb-2fb4-4fe2-a6d1-8f2f80e12fe0" href="https://www.frugalconfessions.com/save-me-money/mini-savings-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.frugalconfessions.com/save-me-money/mini-savings-challenges/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1739979841816000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FLxE70T3VjL55zgZ_CKfx">Bank It! Saving Money Challenge</a>.]</em></p>
<h2>Why is the Half Rule So Effective?</h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">When you change a few things here and there, or something by a <em>little</em> amount, it’s not really noticeable to your bank account.</p>
<p>Not enough to make you want to keep doing it.</p>
<p>By cutting your use of many things in HALF, you quickly see the change to your money.</p>
<p>Imagine having to buy 10 products <em>half</em> as often – that&#8217;s a significant change to your spending.</p>
<p>And with these current prices?</p>
<p>Yeah… you’re going to notice.</p>
<p>It starts a ripple effect of savings – one that you can control.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>TIP:</strong> you could then use your extra savings to <a href="https://www.frugalconfessions.com/budgets/how-to-get-one-month-ahead-on-bills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get one month ahead on your bills</a>!]</em></p>
<h2>A Specific Example of Where This Paid Off</h2>
<p>Most of us don’t want to take a close look at how we’re using products, because it&#8217;s become a habit.</p>
<p>And habits can be hard to break.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no different from you in this.</p>
<p>But many times, the money we need to actually increase savings is being <a href="https://www.frugalconfessions.com/spend-less/list-of-spending-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent on our habits</a>.</p>
<p>For example, I love <a href="https://amzn.to/3X4NUsK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint soap</a>. I use it to create foam hand soaps for each of our bathrooms.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">I was filling up half the bottle with the semi-expensive peppermint soap, and then the other half with water.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even blame this one on a bloated manufacturer recommendation; when I finally looked at the instructions, I noticed that I was only supposed to use 1 part soap to 3 parts water.</p>
<p>It was all me (product inflation? Habit? Not really sure).</p>
<p>I changed. Now, I’m buying Dr. Bronner’s refills less often.</p>
<p><em>Ka-ching</em>!</p>
<p>When you bring awareness to how you’re using a product, then you can make a change.</p>
<h2>Is The Half Rule for Everything?</h2>
<p>Again, this rule does not work for everything.</p>
<p>But I would argue it works for MUCH more than you will initially think.</p>
<p>For example, you can’t fill up your gas tank halfway and still commute the same number of times to work.</p>
<p>Never, <em>EVER</em>, cut a prescription in half.</p>
<p>And you won’t catch me eating ½ of a single serving size of yogurt.</p>
<p>But why waste your money on a daily, caterpillar-sized amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush when a dentist-recommended pea-size will do just fine?</p>
<p><em><strong>Take a handful of products, cut your use in half, and see if anything changes. You might be surprised. I know I was.</strong></em></p>

<p>So right as I went to hit &#8220;publish&#8221; on this post, I got hit with a 2nd great credit card tip so you&#8217;re gonna get a two-for-one special today ;) Neither of which, btw, I&#8217;d ever heard of before in my 15 years doing this so of course I had to share!</p>
<p>The first comes from my friend, and fellow blog reader, Win (real name!), in response to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/stupid-subscription-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my $500 subscription mistake</a> I shared recently, and as he stated this would have most definitely prevented it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;I ask my credit card company for a new card with a new number every year. That cancels any services that I pay for automatically. The service contacts me and I decide if I want to give them the new credit card number.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>HAH! Brilliant!</p>
<p>I asked him to explain more as I was intrigued as hell by this (was it really just to cut down on subscriptions?? Or was it more of a security hack?) and here&#8217;s what he wrote back:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I tell you the story about my daughter losing my credit card? I let her use it for shopping. She called and said &#8220;I lost your card! I&#8217;m so sorry!!&#8221; She didn&#8217;t understand that I&#8217;m not liable if someone finds my credit card and uses it. (&lt;&#8211; True Fact!)</p>
<p>The next day, I called the credit card company and canceled it. They sent me a new card in the mail. It took 7 to 10 days. I think the pony express was faster than that. :)</p>
<p>Disadvantages? If you have any online payments like cellphone, Verizon will send you an email saying your credit card didn&#8217;t work. You have to contact them to give them your new number. I&#8217;ve been doing it for a few years. No problems, but I don&#8217;t make many online payments from my credit card. I pay electric, natural gas, etc from my bank account.</p>
<p>I do think it&#8217;s a good security idea. There&#8217;s a big biz in stolen credit card numbers, so changing your number every year should help.&#8221;</p>
<p>(<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> So it looks like some card companies already do this automatically! Per a reader: &#8220;I just had something decline for my apple subscription and it turns out that my wife&#8217;s apple card automatically changes their number every 6 months!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>Ok so yeah &#8211; definitely good for security, but what a great way to force yourself TO REVIEW all your subscriptions each year too. </strong>And it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s just a calendar item that pops up and you can brush it off  &#8211; with this route you literally have to take action *right then and there* or the service you&#8217;re signed up for will be canceled!</p>
<p>Such a great idea, and for a few solid minutes I actually considered it&#8230; Until I realized I have over 25 places my card is connected to (10&#8217;ish bills + 15&#8217;ish <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/3-tricks-i-do-to-make-me-a-more-charitable-person/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charitable donations</a>) and there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d want to deal with that every year <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Def. works best if you only have a few accounts linked up and/or the patience of Mother Teresa.</p>
<p>Now onto the second hack&#8230;</p>
<p>This one comes from my personal proofreader, and blog fan, Lenny Bron, whose trick is a little more invasive but doesn&#8217;t require any major changes like that first idea:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>I have a new trick I&#8217;ve started ever since my C/C was electronically stolen a few months back (Chase is great at catching that stuff, btw). </strong></p>
<p><strong>I set my phone to get alerts every time the credit card is used <em>at all</em>. So now I know if something weird gets charged (even if it&#8217;s a subscription I no longer need) and I can cancel whatever it is right away or at least call the bank to stop the transaction. </strong></p>
<p><strong>So far, the system has been working well! And plus I can monitor if any of those pesky hackers are using my credit cards again!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>Another great tip at least in theory! It forces you to review all your charges EVERY DAY which is even better in the &#8220;paying attention&#8221; department! Of course, that can get annoying fast if you&#8217;re a big swiper, so it would be interesting to see if Lenny&#8217;s still doing this a year or two from now ;) Perfect for those who rarely use their cards though, or even better: those who only keep cards for *emergencies*! You&#8217;d know there&#8217;s something concerning going on fast in this case!</p>
<p>(<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> A follow up from Lenny: &#8220;You can definitely set limits on the amounts you get notifications about. So if you’re not worried about anything spent under $100, then you can have the system ignore those. Also, you can choose what kind of notifications you get. If it’s something I want to see right away I let it notify me on my phone, but you can also just set it to notify you by email so you can pick and choose how you get notified (definitely will be less intrusive if you don’t want your phone going off all the time). &#8221; Good to know!)</p>
<p>And btw, on the topic of Lenny, I gotta promote his side hustle here <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-77-online-proofreading-editing-1600-mo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a proofreader</a> as he&#8217;s super fun to work with and great at catching all those pesky misstypings of mine (or even made up words, like misstypings!! Don&#8217;t you edit this one, Lenny!!). He reviews all my posts for me, and as you can imagine has a lot of patience ;) If you run a blog or small business and can use an extra set of eyes on things, be sure to reach out to him: <a href="https://theblogproofreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TheBlogProofreader.com</a></p>
<p><strong>So there you have it! Two great tips to consider!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Let me know if any of these ideas resonate with you and/or if you&#8217;re already doing them&#8230; And feel free to pass over any other creative hacks you have incorporated into your financial life as well! They&#8217;re all super helpful and you never know how much of an impact they&#8217;ll have on others!</p>
<p>Big thanks to Win and Lenny for letting me share their ideas here, and huge thanks to all of YOU for always reading. Will see ya back here again soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><em>FYI: Lenny proofreads my posts *after* I publish them, so if you come across any errors today that would be why! I&#8217;m too lazy to send them to him first to proofread ;)</em></p>

<p>A <a href="https://jordangrumet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogger friend</a> of mine recently came out with a new book, and it&#8217;s centered around one of the things that occupies my brain way more than I care to admit ;)</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of life.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>And apparently I&#8217;m not alone, as this &#8220;purpose anxiety&#8221; apparently affects 91% of people! Crazy!</p>
<p>So odds are you&#8217;ve struggled with this too, which makes this book a perfect read &#8211; and giveaway! &#8211; for everyone today. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Purpose Code</a>&#8220;, and here&#8217;s more about it via Amazon:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The Purpose Code&#8221;<br />
How to unlock meaning, maximize happiness, and leave a lasting legacy</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68352" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg" alt="the purpose code" width="426" height="658" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-194x300.jpg 194w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-550x850.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-324x500.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></a></p>
<p>Purpose can change your life.</p>
<p><strong>Having a sense of purpose has been scientifically proven to help people find happiness, longevity, and health.</strong></p>
<p>But lots of us are also worried about purpose―purpose anxiety has been estimated to affect as much as 91% of people.</p>
<p>What’s going on? And how do we do purpose the right way―to unlock all its many benefits, set goals in life, make a mark and journey from anxiety to legacy?</p>
<p>This question set hospice doctor and writer Jordan Grumet on a quest, and The Purpose Code shares his remarkable findings to help you change your future forever. The result is a self-development book like no other.</p>
<p><strong>It turns out that we fundamentally misunderstand purpose and the role it plays in our lives. In fact, there are two different types of purpose. One will lead to anxiety and disillusionment; the other will lead to connection and lasting legacy.</strong></p>
<p>In The Purpose Code, Jordan will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chart a course for you to reach happiness through understanding the deep human truths behind the concepts of Meaning and Purpose (including life review therapy and simple ways of healing generational trauma)</li>
<li>Equip you with a practical and proven framework for unlocking your real purpose, and show you the life-changingly enjoyable way to climb to goals, regardless of your situation in life</li>
<li>Arm you to differentiate between the two types of purpose when finding life purpose (and show you the hidden reasons why one is always more fulfilling than the other)</li>
<li>Set you on the way to building a genuinely lasting impact long after you’re gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding happiness has never been about creating big audacious goals that we may or may not be able to achieve. True contentment comes from filling our lives with enriching activities that lead to connection and, ultimately, legacy. Swap grand but ultimately empty success books for this small goals book, and begin creating your true purpose today.</p>

<p>Just had a randomly refreshing chat with a fellow coffee shop goer, and as things tend to go we ventured into finances and the words that came out of his mouth were outstanding, lol&#8230; So much so I had to stop him mid-sentence a couple of times to make sure I got his phrases right! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here were some of the highlights from our convo, in *his own words* as best as I can remember&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h3>&#8220;I would rather play chicken with my bills than with my savings&#8221;</h3>
<p>Instead of spending on &#8220;wants&#8221; first like I&#8217;ve done all my life, I flipped it around and now SAVE first and pay bills second. Then if there happens to be anything left over, I use that to buy any &#8220;extras&#8221; I might want.</p>
<p>I went from not being able to save $1,000 and a credit score of 580, to having over $13,000 in the bank and a score of 730 within one year!</p>
<p>There were a handful of things that led to this, but it was mainly <em>re-ordering my priorities</em> and paying myself first that got me going in the right direction.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system of managing my cash flow&#8221;</h3>
<p>Another reason I was able to save so much this year was because I drastically changed my management system. Instead of having everything in 1-2 accounts, I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is I spread my accounts across multiple banks that all serve a specific purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have one account for my short-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my long-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my bills</li>
<li>And then one account for my spending/wants.</li>
</ol>
<p>My business banking looks similar: one account for savings, one account for bills, and another account for taxes (I pay quarterly). It&#8217;s a lot to manage, but it&#8217;s brought so much peace and savings.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I threw away my debit cards&#8221;</h3>
<p>The first thing I did when I started re-arranging everything was to move all my savings into a brick and mortar bank that had no online access. This way the only way I could access my money was by going there in person. I did get debit cards, but I immediately cut them up and threw them away.</p>
<p>This has immensely strengthened my discipline, and partly why I was able to go from $1,000 to $13,000 so fast. It took me over 30 years to save my first $10,000 and now the hardest part is over!</p>
<h3>&#8220;I spend a lot of money looking for women&#8221;</h3>
<p>Over the course of 3-4 years I&#8217;ve spent $40,000+ looking for love, or about $1,200/mo.</p>
<p>Part of that goes to dating apps like eHarmony (which I initially balked at as it cost me $300!), but most of it comes from just doing my best to be &#8220;visible.&#8221; So lots of eating out and hanging with friends, visiting bars/community events/etc. You have to put yourself out there if you truly want to meet people.</p>
<p>I initially felt bad about spending all this money with no savings in the bank, but later I realized I was prioritizing what I wanted and I became okay with it. Now I could have been more *efficient* with the way I went about it, but I am proud to say it worked out in the end and I will be getting married at the end of this month! Ironically, to a woman I found on eHarmony!!</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This was the most interesting part of the whole conversation, haha&#8230; As someone who met their partner years before online dating and apps came around, I&#8217;m always fascinated by the mixture of tech and love. And really how much dating seems to cost in general??! And I&#8217;ve surely never met anyone who has TRACKED IT ALL, lol&#8230; Probably exactly what I would do if ever back in that situation <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>So basically, yeah &#8211; most stuff we&#8217;ve heard before, but in much more entertaining ways ;)</p>
<p><strong>1) Save first, spend later</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Build a system that works for you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Make yourself more &#8220;visible&#8221; when you want something. </strong>Whether it be love, business, career, you name it. If you&#8217;re not putting yourself into the position to *receive,* you&#8217;re limiting yourself! Nothing great has happened sitting on your couch &#8211; you have to put yourself out there and tell the world what you are looking for!</p>
<p>(This is exactly, btw, why I choose to do my projects out of coffee shops. I never know who I&#8217;ll run into or what type of magic might happen! And surely this blog post would have never been created, so who knows what you would be reading right now??! Lolol&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>At any rate, all good things to think about as we head into the new year here :) </strong> Will you consciously place yourself in situations which allow you to get closer to your goals or farther away from them? Are your management systems still serving you okay, or is it time to blow them up and start from scratch? Where will you be putting that first dollar from your next paycheck? If it isn&#8217;t to YOU, you need to re-read this whole blog post! ;)</p>
<p>Your F.G.A. (Financial Guardian Angel),</p>

<p>So in an attempt to become more minimalist over here &#8211; AND &#8211; raise a little money for my cold and hungry homeless friends, I&#8217;m tackling one of the hardest areas known to entrepreneurs:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR HORDE OF DOMAIN NAMES!! </strong></p>
<p>Which, of course, are ALL awesome and worth MILLIONS of dollars if we ever get them off the ground, but as Derek Sivers is fond of saying &#8211; <a href="https://sive.rs/multiply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ideas are worth nothing unless executed</a> ;) And, well, despite how much I&#8217;d love to execute on <i>ALL</i> of these I&#8217;m pretty sure if I haven&#8217;t done it in the past 10 years I never will&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>But maybe YOU could use one of these?! Perhaps one of these domains is the missing puzzle to finally getting your own passion project off the ground?!</strong> </em></p>
<p>If so I&#8217;d love to make a deal with you today!! You donate some money to help replenish my <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/community-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Fund</a> (that goes 100% to my poor &#8211; yet positive! &#8211; friends living on the streets) and I&#8217;ll give you a domain name of your choosing in return :)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a win-win-win!!</p>
<p>Here are the domains up for the taking:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2><del>#1) PFBloggers.com</del> <span style="color: #008000;">Gone! Enjoy it, Tom!</span></h2>
<p>This is an old school one picked up during the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/why-i-fired-myself-from-rockstar-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Finance</a> days of 2013, and we were going to use it for our community&#8217;s first Blog Directory. We ended up merging it however with RF itself so it never became its own standalone site, but I&#8217;ve held onto it ever since just in case I wanted to build out another directory again&#8230; which sadly still doesn&#8217;t exist in our space, even after all these years :(</p>
<p>But maybe you could be the one to get one running again? :) It&#8217;s a perfectly direct name for one, right?</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, after plugging it into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080805182025/http://pfbloggers.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>, I found it was actually at one time a home for financial creators back in 2008!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080805182025/http://pfbloggers.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68052" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pf-bloggers-network-old.gif" alt="pf bloggers network" width="502" height="130" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The Personal Finance Bloggers Network (PF Bloggers for short) currently consists of 7 blogs that write about personal finance and frugal living. We are not finance professionals but just normal people with goals for a life free of debt and worry.</p></blockquote>
<p>How cool is that?  You might even recall some of the original founders of it if you&#8217;ve been around for a while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wide Open Wallet</li>
<li>Our Fourpence Worth</li>
<li>No Debt Plan</li>
<li>Master Your Card</li>
<li>Living Almost Large</li>
<li>Girls Just Wanna Have Funds</li>
<li>Get Rich or Die Trying</li>
</ul>
<p>I miss these guys&#8230; some of the founding fathers (and mothers!) of our industry!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2>#2. PFChat.com<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>This was another domain we were going to use for the <em>forums</em> of Rockstar Finance (2014), but also got merged into one main hub&#8230; But what a short and sweet name for an online community??! Or even a portal or blog attached to a business or app or something in the financial space? It would certainly make for an easy to remember redirection url too, though of course in my opinion it&#8217;s strong enough to live on its own :)</p>
<p>This is gonna be the one that&#8217;s hardest to depart with as I still very much love the name and want to hold out hope that eventually I&#8217;ll make use of it!, but again if I haven&#8217;t touched it in 9 years then odds are I&#8217;m not going to&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2><s>#3. MoneyLatte.com</s> <span style="color: #008000;">Now Gone!! Thanks, Jessica!</span></h2>
<p><s>Okay &#8211; now this one is my favorite out of ALL my unused domains, and 100% what I&#8217;d build my next blog on if I ever needed to start a new one from scratch&#8230; Just think of all that organic traffic you&#8217;d get from talking about saving money on coffee ad nauseam! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></s></p>
<p><del>But seeing how I ended up <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/j-money-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying BudgetsAreSexy back</a> for good, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have the energy to manage another one, although I have been tempted with sharing short &#8211; quick &#8211; bites of finance to help people start their day better (similar to what caffeine does to you! Heyo!), so for that route this would make a perfect home, but again will I ever pull the trigger on it??! Probably not.</del></p>
<p><del>So it&#8217;s all yours if you want to steal my idea!! :)</del></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67971" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coffee-gif.gif" alt="coffee gif" width="352" height="361" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2>#4. DebtDrop.org</h2>
<p>I love this domain so much too. And even dubbed one of our projects &#8220;<a href="https://communityfund.lovedrop.us/debt-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debt Drop</a>&#8221; back in the day when I used to partner up with Melanie Lockert of <a href="https://deardebt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DearDebt.com</a> to share some love&#8230;</p>
<p>We used to go around anonymously paying off chunks of debt for people, and then picked up this domain in case we ever wanted to make it an &#8220;official&#8221; project. After 2-3 years we took a break, but alas I&#8217;ve been renewing it ever since and quietly holding my tears back as it sits there collecting dust <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f622.png" alt="😢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Out of all the domains this is the one I&#8217;d love to see someone take over the most and continue putting out GOOD in the world as we still need so much help out there, specially around debt. It&#8217;s so crushing to people!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2>#5. <a href="https://squidpantsinternational.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SquidpantsInternational.com</a></h2>
<p><strong>Now this one is *NOT* on the table, but oh how I wish it was&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Click it if you dare, but here&#8217;s what my biz partner Nate St. Pierre once publicly shared on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/natestpierre/posts/pfbid033B1Jdqmb7XLeKVRpB7BED4MmDcihcppZgVJjqBRrLvAvX5q2gQKBVo42VToFrZ19l" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t save things, and I&#8217;m not sentimental. Nor do I pay for things I don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>BUT.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jmoneyyyyyy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Money</a> and I were doing our <a href="https://lovedrop.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Love Drop</a> national tour in 2011, we had to buy a URL for a new site we were building, and Jay had to help me with the name. For whatever reason he just wouldn&#8217;t do it, and I told him that if he didn&#8217;t give me his thoughts by the end of the day, I was just going to name it Squidpants International.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t, so I did.</p>
<p>I bought the URL and put up a picture I took of him that day buying a lottery ticket and telling me why he was too busy to help me with the name. What you see is the entire website.</p>
<p>Here we are, 13 years later, when I get my annual bill for renewing the URL, and I continue to pay for it, just because the joke still makes me laugh whenever I think about it. Also because it brings back many good memories of working together, stressing out, laughing a lot, and putting some love into the world <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f5a4.png" alt="🖤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Happy website anniversary, you jackass.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><strong>So sweet, isn&#8217;t he?</strong></p>
<p>What I <em>should</em> do is actually use one of these domains for a Spite Site a la <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVQp9vSytOE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry David</a> so I don&#8217;t have to hear about this every year, haha, but seeing how I&#8217;m the nicer of the two I shall respectfully take the high road ;)</p>
<p>You sure are clever though, buddy!!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>At any rate, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got today! </strong>And I&#8217;m proud to state I haven&#8217;t bought a *new* domain name in years, and even more smartly &#8211; I no longer buy them while drunk!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Let me know if you&#8217;d like any of these, and more importantly <em><strong>if you&#8217;d like to contribute to my Community Fund.</strong></em> It&#8217;s the toughest season out there for my friends on the streets, and I can promise that every last dollar goes directly to them because I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s literally handing it to them! (Or buying them coffee/clothes/hotel rooms/etc)</p>
<p>Click this button to donate through Paypal (you don&#8217;t need a Paypal account to do so), or DM me on the side and we&#8217;ll find another way to make it happen. (I know I have a Venmo somewhere too&#8230;)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>Not a new idea, but just another visualization and reminder.</p>
<p>Wealth, feeling like you have plenty, is an equation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wealth = Have ÷ Want</strong></p>
<p>If you have nothing, then focus on having some.</p>
<p>Once you have some, the easiest way to increase your wealth is to decrease your needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have 10 but want 100? You are poor.</li>
<li>Have 10 but only want 5? You are wealthy.</li>
<li>Have 10 but are happy with 1? You are <em>very</em> wealthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making money depends on other people, so it’s harder. It’s not entirely under your control. It’s an outer game.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing what you “need” to be happy is easier. It’s entirely under your control. It’s an inner game.</strong></p>
<p>I used to look for ways to make money, but I haven’t done that in years. Now I keep looking for ways to want less.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><em>Derek is one of my favorite thinkers and just came out with a new book full of short passages like this: <a href="https://sive.rs/u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Useful Not True</a>. He&#8217;s one of the only authors whose books I actually KEEP after reading!<br />

<p><strong>&#8220;I just wrapped up a 10 &#8211; 2 challenge. Here’s how it works &#8211; You work on a long term project for 10 minutes a day &#8211; every day &#8211; for approximately 2 years. The thing is, you have to work on the project every day. If you travel, you have to either improvise or do make up work for the days you missed. I even use a stopwatch to make sure I work on the project for a full <span class="il">10</span> minutes. You’ll be amazed at what you accomplish!”</strong></p>
<p>Love it! Super easy sounding, right?!</p>
<p>And if I whip out a calculator here, hold on one sec&#8230;  It looks like it actually adds up to&#8230; <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>7,300 minutes</strong></span>!! Or roughly <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>122 hours</strong></span>! WOW! Imagine dedicating that many hours to *one* single goal of yours? What would you be able to achieve?! How better off would you be? Physically/mentally/professionally?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to fathom the number of things we let fall by the wayside just because they&#8217;re &#8220;too big&#8221; to start, so let this be the kick in the ass you need to actually GET GOING on a dream that you may be putting off. Or even just something annoying that really needs to get done but you know will take forever! Lol&#8230; Literally stop reading this right now and get going if you already have it in your head &#8211; I promise it&#8217;ll be better than reading the rest of this post <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If nothing crosses your mind, let me throw out some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review your finances every day </strong>(expenses, credit cards, budget, net worth, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/stupid-subscription-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscriptions</a>, insurance, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/i-froze-my-credit-and-it-was-stupidly-easy-and-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit score,</a> credit <em>report</em> &#8211; plenty of things you could keep tabs on and improve)</li>
<li><strong>Declutter your entire house</strong> (each drawer, closet, *gasp* garage!)</li>
<li><strong>Get a new job/promoted</strong> (research, apply, improve skills)</li>
<li><strong>Get a new girlfriend/boyfriend/friend</strong> (same examples as above <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</li>
<li><strong>Write a book!</strong> (might feel choppy with only 10 mins applied, but you&#8217;ll probably find you&#8217;ll spend more time once you&#8217;re &#8220;in the flow&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>Start a passion project</strong> (blog, book, TikTok, <a href="https://cointhrill.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coin collection</a>!)</li>
<li><strong>Work out every day</strong> (go for a walk, go for a run!, lift some weights, do some yoga, play some basketball &#8211; you only have to do it for 10 mins!)</li>
<li><strong>Work out your <em>mind</em> every day</strong> (meditate, read, crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles! (Remember that time <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I got obsessed with them</a> for like two months??! Man I went bonkers&#8230;))</li>
<li><strong>Study the bible</strong> (my friend who came up with this 10-2 idea did exactly this &#8211; used his time for the past two years to devour the bible and create a &#8220;spiritual warfare database!&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>Weed/Garden/Landscape</strong> (after a month you&#8217;ll probably just be *maintaining* from that point on!)</li>
<li><strong>Learn a new language</strong> (Spanish? French? HTML?)</li>
<li><strong>Learn something else entirely new!</strong> (Programming, Video Editing, Baking)</li>
</ul>
<p>The options are endless&#8230;</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t care who you are, everyone can spare 10 mins a day towards something that&#8217;s important to them. <em><strong>The years are going to pass anyways,</strong><strong> why not get something extra out of it with minimal effort?!</strong></em></p>
<p>I found the perfect book too yesterday for tracking it all:</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4fTeWun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68291" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary.jpg" alt="one-line-a-day diary" width="500" height="649" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary-231x300.jpg 231w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary-550x714.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary-385x500.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I scooped it up at Goodwill as a future gift to my sister (it was only $2.99!), but now I&#8217;m thinking I need to keep it for myself, lol&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>But how perfect is this for tracking?! Each date has a small section to jot down quick notes, and they&#8217;re stacked on top of each other so every year going forward when you come back to the same date you can see the previous years&#8217; notes on it. Which hopefully will keep you motivated and inspired!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an inside page so you can see exactly what I&#8217;m talking about&#8230; And yes, I just wrote in it so it&#8217;s officially mine <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68292" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside.jpg" alt="one a day diary - inside" width="480" height="729" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside-197x300.jpg 197w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside-550x836.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside-329x500.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>So you can see there&#8217;s a section there for each of the 5 years, so over time you&#8217;ll be able to reflect on the previous years&#8217; successes and notes and you don&#8217;t have to keep getting a new journal :) In fact, you could even turn this into a 10-5 Challenge if you <em>really</em> wanted to! Haha&#8230; And I just found it on Amazon too in case you want one for yourself (currently $15):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://amzn.to/4fTeWun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Line A Day: A Five-Year Memory Book</a></p>
<p>But really, you can use anything to track this &#8211; what&#8217;s important is just that you do! Use a Notes app, staple some blank papers together, or use a good old fashion Google Doc, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; just track it however is most natural to you.</p>
<p><strong>And as you&#8217;ll see, I&#8217;ve already started this challenge :) Which for me is to do *one thing a day* for someone, or some place, that helps them.</strong> I had been trying to get to a WEEK in a row of helping someone each day &#8211; and even pulled it off once (see the PS at the end!) &#8211; but if I could accomplish it for 2 YEARS straight that would be amazing.</p>
<p>And on Nov. 6th you&#8217;ll see Day #1 was completed! I gave a microwave to my friend Debbie whose old one just broke down (it had been sitting in my basement for 5 years!), and then I called my mother &#8220;just to check on her&#8221; and not to ask for something which is usually the case <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And since I had extra room there at the end, I made a note that we had won our league&#8217;s soccer championships (and I scored in it!), so that future me will be reminded of the feat a year from now.</p>
<p>Now some days I already know I&#8217;ll have trouble finding someone to help, or maybe not even be IN THE MOOD to help!, so on &#8220;off&#8221; days I&#8217;ll carve out the 10 minutes to simply strengthen my *mindset* overall, whether by reading or brainstorming or even by meditating &#8211; that way with each passing day I&#8217;m even more *conscious* about the mission. The more you practice doing something, the better you get at it right?! And we have 7,300 mins with this challenge so we&#8217;re gonna get GOOD!!</p>
<p><strong>So yeah &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty stoked about this, and hopefully you are too :)</strong> Spend a few minutes thinking it over today, and then tomorrow get right to it and start tracking it all. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s something big or small or somewhere in between &#8211; just get crackin&#8217; and feel good about it!</p>
<p>Remember &#8211; the time is going to pass anyways, so why not get something out of it? And I want to hear all about it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64642" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-signature.jpg" alt="j. money signature" width="186" height="75" /></p>
<p>PS: The one week I accomplished this!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1:</strong> helped serve a community dinner for our homeless friends</li>
<li><strong>Day 2:</strong> helped give out free food and veggies at our local food bank</li>
<li><strong>Day 3:</strong> gave a buddy of mine a haircut as he was low on funds, and also just really doesn&#8217;t like going to barbers! (And if you&#8217;re wondering, yes &#8211; I gave him a mohawk!! I can&#8217;t be trusted to cut anything else! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</li>
<li><strong>Day 4:</strong> helped my church archive old documents in their archives room &#8211; not only fascinating to hold and touch old artifacts, but to learn the overall process of *properly archiving* too!</li>
<li><strong>Day 5:</strong> helped a friend get a website off the ground and move her childhood dream further along</li>
<li><strong>Day 6:</strong> brainstormed marketing and fundraising ideas for a new garden opening up in our city</li>
<li><strong>Day 7:</strong> co-led an after church youth session &#8211; the scariest of all as a) I don&#8217;t know or fully understand the bible at all (!!), and b) pre-teen kids are so awkward and quiet and really don&#8217;t like to talk, haha&#8230; Though I did find a secret weapon: snacks!</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a pretty fantastic week, but also exhausting&#8230; I&#8217;ll have to be careful of my energy levels and find ways to self-care throughout the next two years so I don&#8217;t accidentally burn out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/stupid-subscription-mistake/" title="My $507.34 Ridiculous Mistake!" rel="nofollow"><img width="480" height="270" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/laptop-gasp-gif.gif" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="laptop gasp" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p><strong>I&#8217;ve been doing something really really stupid for the past 5 years.</strong></p>
<p>Not only have I been paying for a subscription that I never ended up using (!!), but over these years it&#8217;s also increased by 300%+ and I didn&#8217;t even notice it!!</p>
<p>What a dummy!</p>
<p>This service I&#8217;ve been throwing my money at for the past 1/2 decade is <strong><em>Avast Premium Security</em></strong> &#8211; the antivirus software &#8211; which I&#8217;d never used my entire life, but have a vague memory of one day caving to a promo thinking it was a smart move.</p>
<p>Followed by another vague memory of remembering I needed to *activate it*, but then promptly forgetting about it and never actually DOING IT (yet continuing to pay for it as if I had, and letting one year roll into the next year and then into the next, and on and on for a total of 5 dumb years &#8211; ugh!!)</p>
<p><strong>So that was mistake #1: not even activating the service.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mistake #2 was then blindly paying the invoices year after year</strong> assuming that a) Past Me already did the research and verified it was worth it (nope), and then also that b) the software must be working because I never did get any viruses! Lol&#8230; So why cancel a good thing? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Then we have mistake #3: not realizing that each year the rates WENT UP.</strong> And I didn&#8217;t even notice it. Or check it out. Until I did one day, and, well, realized it was now 300% higher than when I first  signed up for it! Wow&#8230;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I found when I finally sorted through my email receipts. Which is super embarrassing to even type out (!!):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2019 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;">$29.99</span></strong> (the promo deal for 1 PC&#8230; though 6 months later they &#8220;upgrade&#8221; my account to cover 10 devices while also providing &#8220;better coverage&#8221; &#8211; something I couldn&#8217;t opt out of, even if I were onto their scheme. This &#8220;special&#8221; was valued at $69.00, giving the grand illusion I had saved $40 since I only paid that initial $29.99! Which is how they slowly got their claws in <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</li>
<li><strong>2020 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;">$79.99</span></strong> (the &#8220;upgraded&#8221; promo now being over, it goes back to the $69.99 price tag + an extra $10 for good measure &#8211; effectively DOUBLING the initial price point!)</li>
<li><strong>2021 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;">$89.99</span></strong> (creeps up another $10 bucks&#8230;)</li>
<li><strong>2022</strong> <strong>&#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;">$95.39</span></strong> (and then a bit more &#8211; &#8220;due to taxes&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>2023 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;">$105.99</span></strong> (and then even more&#8230; But it&#8217;s okay, because this year comes with a &#8220;free gift&#8221; &#8211; 3 months of <em>Avast SecureLine VPN</em> which probably made me feel good enough at the time to not question any of it, even though of course it&#8217;s something I also didn&#8217;t activate.)</li>
<li><strong>2024 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;">$105.99</span></strong> (No extra fees this year, but I still let it renew without question&#8230; Until  a few days later when I thought to check on it!  And realize not only wasn&#8217;t I using it, but I never even needed it &#8211; as evidence again of not getting any viruses this whole time lol&#8230; So I cancel it immediately and shake my head at how long I let this happen right under my nose&#8230;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And I gotta say &#8211; I don&#8217;t blame Avast at all here. Outside maybe their tricky &#8220;upgrade&#8221; scheme there in year 1.</strong> It was my job and my job only to know what, and why, I was purchasing, and then from there consciously paying attention to the fee creep each year. All things I blindly ignored.</p>
<p>And to their credit &#8211; they gave me a refund for this year&#8217;s charges as soon as I asked for it, and I noticed they even shot me &#8220;1 month out&#8221; reminders that the service was about to renew each year too. So I basically had DOUBLE the opportunity to pay attention every year!!</p>
<p>But as we all know we can get so used to subscriptions that we don&#8217;t even challenge them assuming Past Us did the work already, but even if it *was* the right move and beneficial for us back then, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s right for us NOW. Life changes, needs change, and PRICES CHANGE!</p>
<p><strong>So do yourself a favor and look over your c/c statements as soon as you&#8217;re done reading this to make sure you still want and need whatever subscriptions you&#8217;re currently signed up for too.</strong></p>
<p>I bet you&#8217;d be surprised at some of the costs compared to when you initially signed up! And if you&#8217;re not happy with any of them, cut &#8217;em! Or try to negotiate! Whatever you do &#8211; don&#8217;t keep your head in the sand like a jackass (me) and assume that what you needed back then is what you need right now.</p>

<p>What a perfect truth right there.</p>
<p>Where else could you even start? The past is gone no matter what you desire, and I suppose you could start in the future, but we all know that will never happen, lol, so you gotta start right now wherever you are ;) We&#8217;re only guaranteed THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE anyways, and what a gift it truly is!</p>
<p>Everything in life has brought you to this very exact article right here, and lucky for me you&#8217;re reading whatever I type right now&#8230;</p>
<p>I could say:</p>
<p><em><strong>I am a poopy head!<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>And you read it! Lol&#8230; Or even:</p>
<p><em><strong>Saving is so sexy that my life has changed forever and now all the ladies love me.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>BOOM! And now:</p>
<p><strong>The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance than dance.</strong></p>
<p>Okay I&#8217;ll stop <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But seriously. Everything has led you to this one point where you&#8217;re able to start anything new because of how life has unfolded. Maybe it&#8217;s a career choice. Maybe it&#8217;s a new relationship. Maybe it&#8217;s getting your finances together for the first time and this is the first blog you&#8217;ve ever stumbled onto (sorry about that!). Whatever the new journey is you can only start NOW as there&#8217;s no going backward, so please don&#8217;t beat yourself up over it.</p>
<p><strong>The important thing is that at least *the light bulb went off* in the first place!</strong> Do you know how many people wake up in their 50s or 60s and still haven&#8217;t paid attention to their debts or health or worse &#8211; their dreams?! I WISH I could have started saving in my teens vs my 20s or got excited about working out and yoga in my 20s vs my 40s, but thank God I started as soon as everything clicked.</p>
<p>You must begin where you are, there is no other way.</p>
<p>Now you might think this quote came from a philosophy book or maybe it was something Oprah once said, but it actually came from my favorite yoga book: &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z8zN7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoga Girl</a>&#8221; by Rachel Brathen:</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3Z8zN7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68034" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book.jpg" alt="Yoga Girl - book" width="455" height="587" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book-233x300.jpg 233w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book-550x710.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book-388x500.jpg 388w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great read mixing in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yoga_girl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her story</a> along with killer yoga poses, and it&#8217;s chock full of epic one-liners that not only apply to yoga, but to life &#8211; and particularly money! &#8211; too. I re-stumbled across it again on my bookshelf and totally forgot I had dog-eared a bunch of these lines which I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading.</p>
<p><strong>And in the spirit of crossing my <a href="https://imetyoutoday.com/namaste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY</a> doing yoga (255 classes later &#8211; what!), I present them to you below in hopes they inspire you just as much as they did me :)</strong></p>
<p>Most are copied as-is, and others I&#8217;ve tweaked to better prove my financial hypothesis here, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">********</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to change anything about who you are to start <del>a yoga practice</del> paying attention to your money.&#8221;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yes! You simply <em>take notice</em> one day and actively start looking at where all your money is going. Your debts, your bills, your income &#8211; everything. You don&#8217;t need to *change* any of it right away, you just stop and start *noticing* and getting the lay of the land!</p>
<p>Once you know what you&#8217;re dealing with, then the game plan can be activated from there. But it doesn&#8217;t require changing who you are, and in fact, over time it should help you become a BETTER version of yourself! Because the more confident you get in your finances, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/sexy-underwear-money-trick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the more confident</a> you get in all other areas of your life <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44a.png" alt="👊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Be the best you can be.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Most of the insecurities we struggle with come from thinking that things should be different from reality. But reality reflects exactly where we are right now, and all we can do is strive to improve!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to know every step ahead of you to be able to move forward.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>All you need to know is the general *direction* you want to go towards, and then you put one step in front of another and let <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/no-coffee-challenge-mode-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forward momentum</a> carry you from there. It&#8217;s not as complicated as we often make it out to be! Just do one little thing, and then another, and then another.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Much of what we <del>eat</del> spend in a day is simply a result of boredom!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Yup! You gotta do your best to not put yourself in situations where it&#8217;s easy to cave. And one of the best ways is by putting yourself into more positive situations than negatives. I remember when I first started blogging I immediately had less time to go to the mall and aimlessly shop, and BOOM &#8211; half the problem was immediately eliminated just because I kept myself busy! I replaced bad habits with good habits, and the same holds true with my time these days as well&#8230; Hitting the gym has replaced staring at a screen all morning, volunteering has replaced wasting time dawdling around, and finding more veggies and foods I equally enjoy has replaced more sugary ones. As the saying goes, idle hands are the devil&#8217;s workshop.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The thing that hurts us in the long run is our mind, not our body.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>So absolutely true&#8230; Our mind is the most dangerous thing there is. This quote by Marcus Aurelius sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.</p></blockquote>
<p>This has to be one of the biggest bugs in human development! We spend too much time caring about what others think about us!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Trust in your own ability to create magic.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>100%. Put those beautiful skills God gave you to work. No one else is going to do it for you!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Practicing naked is extremely liberating. Love your body. Think about all that it does for you every day.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Haha okay this one might be a stretch, but we all know budgeting naked does make it way more fun ;) I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Naked and Afraid episodes too here lately, and there&#8217;s something beautiful about going back to the basics of both nature and survival. Similar to loving ourselves just for who we are, we should be very much loving our bodies just the same!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Be kind to yourself!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>You will without a doubt make mistakes along your financial journey, so don&#8217;t even pretend you won&#8217;t. Just expect them and do your best to be patient with yourself! Treat yourself like you do a best friend or family member. Again, you are worth it!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The goal is serenity. Balance. Truly finding peace in your own skin.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The whole point of working so hard on your finances is to one day NOT have to work so hard on them! In fact, once you&#8217;re financially free you don&#8217;t even have to THINK ABOUT IT anymore! It&#8217;s ironic, yes, but also magical. Peace with your finances = peace in many other areas in life too.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Worrying is praying for what we don&#8217;t want to happen. Focus on what you want, not what you fear!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Positive thinking can go a looooooong way with this stuff! You&#8217;ll not only reach your goals faster, but you&#8217;ll feel better generally when you&#8217;re more optimistic! Most things we&#8217;re afraid of never even come true.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-55717 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/peaceful-dude.jpg" alt="peaceful dude" width="550" height="340" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/peaceful-dude.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/peaceful-dude-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Other great lines for life in general:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Life is not as serious as your mind makes it out to be.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Yup! Laugh a little!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Don&#8217;t judge your life as good or bad. Love what is.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Acceptance is an underrated super power. The moment you stop pretending or wishing, the better you&#8217;ll be able to see the beauty in what<em> is</em>. <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/no-coffee-challenge-mode-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meditation helps immensely</a> with this.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Remember that you are the only one suffering by clinging to the past.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>And you can&#8217;t change it no matter what you do!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The first thing you do in the morning should not include social media or e-mails!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Gosh I wish everyone realized this&#8230; And especially IN BED! A sacred space for you and anyone else laying there with you. Not only does it let *the outside world* set your tone for the day, but it doesn&#8217;t even let you fully wake up and process life before you get the day started :( You&#8217;re immediately blasted with the world&#8217;s problems before you even get out of bed!!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Allow yourself to feel.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a place for action and moving on, but first &#8211; just feel. The highs, the lows, and everything in between.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Do no harm, but take no shit.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>So good  :)</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The only thing that matters is how much you love&#8230; your purpose on this Earth is to love.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Gosh this one is just so beautiful&#8230;  What a world if we all focused more on this than ourselves. I think about this often, and is partially why my last tattoo was a heart where I constantly see it and get reminded to do exactly that: love.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-68036 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/heart-tattoo-hand.jpg" alt="heart tattoo on hand" width="404" height="437" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/heart-tattoo-hand.jpg 461w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/heart-tattoo-hand-277x300.jpg 277w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>I hope this has inspired you at least a little today :)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the book, you can usually find it at your local library (it&#8217;s a popular one!) or of course over at Amazon: &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z8zN7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoga Girl</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s one of the few books I keep on my bookshelf <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>See ya back here again soon.</p>
<p>Namaste,</p>
