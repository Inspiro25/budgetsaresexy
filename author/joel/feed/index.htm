Got some big news to share‚Ä¶</span></p>
<h2><strong>I&#8217;m Taking a Sabbatical‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve written 172 articles for this blog in the past couple years, and there‚Äôs 1 overarching theme I hope has shined through‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs that </span><b>life is more important than money.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, there‚Äôs no better time to practice what I preach and disconnect from work for a few months while I shuffle priorities around. Hanging with my family is my new full-time job, and I‚Äôm going to stop blogging here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs sad stepping away from Budgets Are Sexy because this has been a dream job. And I honestly don‚Äôt know if or when I‚Äôll get back to an awesome position like this. The next chapter for me is scary in many ways‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><b>‚Üí Scared about money:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even though my wife and I have more than most people in life, dropping one of our incomes (while our expenses are increasing) is going to put a large dent in our finances. We will have a negative savings rate this year.</span></p>
<p><b>‚Üí Scared about future work: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is my second ‚Äúcareer break‚Äù within a 5-year time frame.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">My mind is filled with all sorts of *irrational* thoughts like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúwho the fuck is going to hire me again after this? I have zero skills to offer anyone, ever.‚Äù </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">These aren‚Äôt realistic or true thoughts but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt have them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, even with all these fears and unknowns, this move is still a no-brainer decision for me. We have to take a leap of faith. And, there‚Äôs plenty to be excited about too!!!&#8230;</span></p>
<p><b>‚Üí Excited about a new challenge!:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tackling scary new things in life usually results in more good outcomes than bad ones. You never know what you‚Äôre going to be good at unless you try. So, I‚Äôm excited to try.</span></p>
<p><b>‚Üí Excited about a work break: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabbaticals result in a lot of personal growth and valuable life epiphanies. I‚Äôm looking forward to taking a step back and reassessing passions and work options.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Show Must Go On!</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the owners of this blog haven‚Äôt quite figured out a new direction just yet, I‚Äôve done my best to line up some good content for the next little bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budgets will feature some of my favorite oldies from J$ himself, so you‚Äôll be receiving those posts in your inbox for a while.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you, thank you, thank you. I‚Äôm extremely appreciative to you all for reading my dribble over the past few years. Thanks for your comments, replies and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôll still be blogging daily over at </span><a href="https://5amjoel.com/5am-emails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my personal site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to stay connected and receive my overly positive daily epigrams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodbye, all. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f622.png" alt="üò¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2021-annual-review-and-roi-of-my-rental-property/" title="2021 Annual Review and ROI of My Rental Property" rel="nofollow"><img width="600" height="367" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/home-mortgages.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="home mortgages" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/home-mortgages.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/home-mortgages-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yo, yo! Good morning, peeps!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just got my annual profit and loss statement for our rental duplex, and thought I‚Äôd share last year‚Äòs results with you.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Spoiler alert**‚Ä¶ After all calculations, we made only $89 in cash flow + loan paydown, but the property appreciated about $46k last year. In total, our ROI was about 42% for 2021.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year around tax time I do a full property review, calculate the ROI, and note down all the good and bad stuff that happened through the year at the property. I recommend this annual review practice to anyone who owns a rental (even though it‚Äôs boring, keeping good notes is always helpful later in life!).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, here‚Äôs what the P&amp;L Statement shows for 2021‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64469 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Screen-Shot-2022-02-04-at-11.19.30-AM-e1645160792586.png" alt="" width="600" height="734" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**There are 2 misleading things about this statement&#8230; The first is that it doesn‚Äôt include our mortgage, annual taxes, or insurance. So I‚Äôll calculate all that stuff separately. The other thing is the $16,000 ‚Äúother expense‚Äù I circled in blue, which I‚Äôll explain in a bit‚Ä¶**</span></p>
<p><b>INCOME: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, we had 100% occupancy and 100% rent collection. Every investor&#8217;s dream! This duplex rents for $1,975 per month (for both sides total), so that adds up to $23,700 for the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we got an unexpected $1,100 from an outstanding rent settlement back in 2018. So our total income was $24,800.</span></p>
<p><b>EXPENSES: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had pretty mammoth expenses this year‚Ä¶ Mostly due to the new roof (insurance paid for most of it) and a new A/C unit. Here are the biggest expense categories listed on the P&amp;L statement:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Management fees</b><span>: We pay our property management company 7% of all collected rent. Seems like a lot, but it‚Äôs actually a really good deal compared with the average property management fee countrywide.</span></li>
<li><b>Commissions: </b><span>Our property manager collects a renewal fee when our tenants renew their leases. This is one-quarter of 1 month‚Äôs rent. (If a tenant leaves and they have to find a new one, they charge a little more, I believe half of 1 month‚Äôs rent.)</span></li>
<li><b>General repairs and maintenance:</b><span> This is mostly toilets, sinks, doors, appliance repairs here and there, etc.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Capital expenses:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There were 2 large capital expenses this year, which were the new roof ($11,000) and new A/C unit ($4,800).¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Landscaping: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seems like a lot, but it works out to be less than $15 per week. The lawn company comes every 1-2 weeks depending on the season and mows the front and back lawns.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>A/C and plumbing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before getting the new A/C unit, we had a couple annoying repairs, and the plumbing issue was a bathtub that was draining really slow.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>OTHER EXPENSE:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There‚Äôs a line item for ‚Äúowner contribution‚Äù on the form. This isn‚Äôt actually an expense ‚Äì these are funds that I transferred to my property manager to pay for the A/C unit and roof bills. They shouldn‚Äôt be counted as ‚Äòincome‚Äô and need to be removed from the statement total.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that‚Äôs not noted here is the </span><b>insurance refund check</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I got paid as reimbursement for my roof claim. It‚Äôs missing from the P&amp;L statement because it was sent to me, not my prop manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here is the *actual* profit and loss for the year:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$24,800 ‚Äì Income</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(-$22,145) ‚Äì Expenses</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$8,690 ‚Äì Insurance reimbursement¬†</span></p>
<p><b>TOTAL:¬† $11,345</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side note, this is why I encourage investors to thoroughly comb through statements and cross check all their numbers. If I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, at first glance it would seem like we made a $18k profit this year‚Ä¶ But the real number is actually a lot lower.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, moving on‚Ä¶ Now let‚Äôs look at the other 3 big things that I pay separately for this property. These are taxes, insurance, and mortgage interest.</span></p>
<h2><strong>PITI: Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the things my property manager doesn‚Äôt pay for, so they‚Äôre not included on our annual P&amp;L statement:</span></p>
<p><b>Mortgage payments:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $7,938.60 in total</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2,949.99 was principal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4,988.61 was interest</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Property tax:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $5,206.89</span></p>
<p><b>Insurance: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,061</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the mortgage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">principal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn‚Äôt technically an ‚Äúexpense‚Äù (this is how much our loan balance has been reduced by) I‚Äôll need to remove that portion from our overall expense tally.</span></p>
<p><b>Total (without principal paydown): -$11,256.50</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, now let‚Äôs add this all up and see what the *real* total profit was for 2021&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64470 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Screen-Shot-2022-02-04-at-1.45.08-PM-e1645160783701.png" alt="" width="600" height="411" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welp, all in all, this duplex made me and my wife about 89 bucks last year ‚Äì </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before appreciation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whomp whooooomp. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="üò≠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a comparison, here is my </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2020-review-roi-rental-duplex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full review from 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; That year we made $7,497 in profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I think about what went wrong in 2021 compared with 2020, I can pretty much sum it up to 2 major events:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2021 </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/insurance-claim-rental-property/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we had a huge hail storm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This resulted in us needing a new roof. Since our insurance paid for a replacement, we were only responsible for the $2,300 deductible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September one of the A/C units blew up. This cost $5,000 for a new unit with installation and 10-year warranty.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those 2 things didn‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôd almost have a repeat performance of the prior year. Funny how it only takes a couple things to go wrong for all of your cashflow to be wiped out for the entire year.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Our Saving Grace: Appreciation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote about this </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/duplex-updates-big-value-increase-new-roof-and-missing-rents/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a couple months ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Ä¶ We ordered an appraisal of the duplex, which showed a new valuation of $266,225 (as opposed to 12 months earlier at $220,000).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So even though we had a neutral-ish year for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">income minus expenses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we still gained $46,225 last year from property appreciation.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Total ROI for 2021</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To work out the total ROI for 2021, I‚Äôll take the income gains ($89) and add them to the appreciation gain ($46,225), then divide this by the equity I held at the start of 2021 ($110,950).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">($46,314 / $110,950) = 0.417.¬† </span><b>So, that‚Äôs about a 42% ROI.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty ridiculous how leverage works in your favor and can supercharge your ROI. When I bought this place originally in 2015, cash flow was my main goal. But I realize now the power of appreciation if you can choose a good location.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone else out there do nerdy annual reviews for their rentals? Care to share your stuff from the past year?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheers,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Joel</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/10-millionaire-spending-habits-how-do-you-compare/" title="10 Millionaire Spending Habits &#8212; How Do You Compare?" rel="nofollow"><img width="600" height="399" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-coffee.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="millionaire coffee" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-coffee.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-coffee-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing yourself to others is harmful and self-destructive.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But LET‚ÄôS DO IT ANYWAY haha!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="ü§£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Because it can also be very fun and interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though seriously, when we look at others, we usually see the </span><b>best version of them and compare it with an average version of ourselves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It‚Äôs unfair and inaccurate. So keep this in mind as you read through the below stats. You could be a statistical outlier, and that‚Äôs OK! (I am, in many ways.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found the following statistics while tooling around on the </span><a href="https://richhabits.net/archived-articles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Habits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website. The site founder, Tom Corley, has surveyed hundreds of extremely wealthy and poor people throughout his life to better understand their habits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I like about studying </span><b>habits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it‚Äôs less about the current position that someone is in‚Ä¶ Rather, it paints a picture of who they are over time and where they‚Äôre likely headed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 10 habits of millionaires. And for funsies I added commentary on the ones I do/don‚Äôt relate to (spoiler alert: I have 7/10 of these habits currently <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f605.png" alt="üòÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</span></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #1: 88% of Millionaires Read 30 Mins or More Every Day</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as comparisons go, I‚Äôm off to a bad start! :( If I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôve probably only gotten a couple hours of reading in during the past few weeks. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, can we include blogs and reading finance news on the Internet?&#8230;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If so, I definitely do that 30+ mins each day!</span></p>
<p><b>Here‚Äôs more breakdown on the 30 mins reading per day:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63% listen to audiobooks during their commute.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">79% read educational, career-related material.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55% read self-help books, articles etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">58% read biographies of successful people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">94% read current events.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51% read history.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 11% read for purely entertainment purposes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Habit #2: Most Millionaires (67%) Watch Less Than 1 Hour of TV Daily</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, 63% of wealthy people spend less than 1 hour daily ‚Äúsurfing the Internet.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess I FAIL in this category, too. Wife and I usually spend about 1 hour watching TV each night, maybe a little more if we‚Äôre hooked on a fun series (like our most recent fav, Ted Lasso). But, this TV habit will be kicked shortly when we invite a little one into our home and all our free time disappears! ;)</span></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #3: Most Rich People (86%) Like What They Do for a Living</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woohoo! I definitely align with this one. I love what I do for work currently ‚Äì and so does my wife!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably the most interesting thing I learned about this survey question is how the financially struggling people answered‚Ä¶ While most ‚Äúrich‚Äù people liked what they did, </span><b>96% of ‚Äúpoor‚Äù people said they did NOT like what they did for a living.</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprising? Not surprising? Maybe when you have financial stability it changes the way you perceive your work?</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #4: 76% of Millionaires Exercise at Least 4 Days a Week</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes sense. What‚Äôs the point of accumulating a bunch of money if you‚Äôre not healthy enough (or alive) to enjoy spending it!? Investing your money coincides with investing in your health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I work out at least 4 times a week. Lately, it‚Äôs been more like 6 times a week! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="üí™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (Again, this habit will probably go out the window when we have kids haha.)</span></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #5: 67% of Millionaires Said They Were ‚ÄúFrugal With Their Money‚Äù</strong></h2>
<p><b>Other frugal stats for millionaires:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30% of wealthy people clip coupons</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8% shop at thrift stores!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dispels the myth that rich people splash around money without thinking. It‚Äôs actually the opposite&#8230; Most wealthy people are quite intentional with spending, looking for added value and discounts wherever possible. My wife and I are proud to say we align well with this spending habit. We love us some Goodwill bargains. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="üòç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #6: Most Wealthy People (55%) Spend Less Than $6,000 on Vacations Each Year</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, crap. Not only did my wife and I blow $8k+ on vacations last year (</span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/11-20-to-fly-to-hawaii-and-other-vacation-hacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4k on our Hawaii trip alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but this year we‚Äôve got $10k in our travel budget! Oooops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, this is a habit I‚Äôm OK not conforming to. Vacationing is something I want to incorporate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into my life, not less. Well, that‚Äôs how I feel today&#8230; Maybe I‚Äôll be singing a different tune later in life. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm curious to hear what </span></i><b><i>your</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> average annual travel budget is.</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #7: Wealthy People Do Not Buy Lottery Tickets (94%)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 6% of surveyed wealthy people buy lottery tickets. Whereas, </span><b>77% percent of survey respondents who struggle financially play the lottery weekly. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="üò¨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I don‚Äôt play the weekly lotto. But we love going to Vegas every now and then and playing craps (at the cheapest table we can find). Gambling can be fun‚Ä¶ But not as a lifestyle!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ooooh this reminds me, I have to write a post about a book I read called </span></i><a href="https://amzn.to/3FMmWuz"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Luck Factor</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has a great section on ‚Äúlucky‚Äù people and how they pick lotto numbers.)</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #8: 81% of Wealthy People Use Credit Cards With Reward Options</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, yep, yep! Credit card rewards are a no-brainer. Wifey and I have a handful of rewards cards that give us cash back, travel points, and other free goodies ‚Äì all for doing regular spending. (We pay off our CC balances every month before any interest kicks in, so these rewards are technically ‚Äúfree.‚Äù)</span></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #9: Most Millionaires Buy Used Cars</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they can afford to buy new cars, 87% of wealthy people said they never purchased a new luxury car in their lives. 44% said they purchase a used car every 5 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found our 2010 Prius about 6 years ago on Craigslist. Still runs great! In fact, it‚Äôs about to hit the 100k mile mark soon and join the mileage-high club.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you driving these days?</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Habit #10: 65% of Millionaires Have Built 3 or More Streams of Income</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is kind of obvious when you think about it. Most people with a net worth over $1mil would have their assets and income diversified somehow. Stocks, bonds, REITs, rental real estate, home equity, side hustles, business ownerships, W2 incomes, Social Security etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I have more than 3 streams of income and plan to always have our nest egg spread out across multiple investments. This is a habit that was drilled into me at a young age ‚Äì never put all your eggs in 1 basket!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, there you have it. Millionaires read a lot, are fitness freaks, they don‚Äôt watch TV, never go on vacations or do anything fun&#8230;. They are like boring, frugal robots. (And if you don‚Äôt follow along, you‚Äôll be financially doomed!) Just kidding. Like I said at the beginning ‚Äì these are great habits to reflect on here, but don‚Äôt take them all too literally.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think? Notice any familiar habits with your own life?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a great week ahead,</span></p>

Woohoo!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After stacking about 15 into my shopping cart, I took a celebratory photo and sent it to my wife‚Ä¶ She was very proud, having taught me most of the deal-hunting tricks I use today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don‚Äôt know about you, but I think </span><b>being frugal is a cool thing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It‚Äôs something we should celebrate more and share more with the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs some cool stuff you may not know about why being frugal is awesome‚Ä¶</span></p>
<h2><strong>Being Frugal Makes You More ‚ÄúAttractive‚Äù <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f618.png" alt="üòò" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/92-percent-of-americans-consider-frugality-an-attractive-quality-according-to-new-survey-findings-from-slickdeals-300669928.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey done by Slickdeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a couple years ago, </span><b>92% of Americans consider frugality an attractive quality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a partner or potential partner. 92%, yo!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, 79% of people think it‚Äôs ‚Äúperfectly acceptable&#8221; to use a coupon on a first date! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="ü§Ø" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Woohoo! Keep on clippin‚Äô, you handsome couponers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also talks about the difference between being ‚Äúfrugal‚Äù and being ‚Äúcheap‚Äù&#8230; While frugality is a turn-on, being cheap is a turn-off!</span></p>
<p><b>Being frugal:¬†</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying off-brand items <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2705.png" alt="‚úÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking deals and using coupons <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2705.png" alt="‚úÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching movies &amp; drinking alcohol at home instead of going out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2705.png" alt="‚úÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Being cheap:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not leaving a tip <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/274c.png" alt="‚ùå" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not paying when it‚Äôs your turn <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/274c.png" alt="‚ùå" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></li>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Frugal Habits = Comfortable (and Earlier) Retirement</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Personal Capital released a survey to find out ‚Äú</span><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/what-does-it-mean-to-be-frugal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have Americans Become More Frugal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù? The short answer is YES! And for good reason‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><b>Here are the key survey takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90.4% of respondents claim to have ‚Äúfrugal habits‚Äù</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The No. 1 reason they adopt frugal habits is ‚Äúto save for future investments‚Äù</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those who have adopted frugal habits, 50.7% are now considering early retirement!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow. ‚ÄúEarly‚Äù retirement is one the rise! It‚Äôs not just a pipe dream ‚Äì more and more people are getting their financial lives together, using frugality as a cornerstone.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Mindful Spending Means More Value For Dollars</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine Joe and Steve each have $100 to spend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe buys tickets to a ball game ($50), hot dogs ($20) and some items at the stadium gift shop ($30) on the way out. In all, Joe spends $100 to experience a ball game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve is more mindful with spending‚Ä¶ He buys tickets to the same ball game ($50), but eats food at home beforehand ($0) and doesn‚Äôt buy souvenirs ($0). Then, the following weekend, Steve buys tickets to another entire ball game ($50).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both friends spend the full $100, but Steve‚Äôs frugal habits allow him to experience 2 ball games where Joe can only experience 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spending less </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on things that don‚Äôt provide long-lasting value means you can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on things that do provide you value.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Frugal Humans Help the Environment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f331.png" alt="üå±" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30e.png" alt="üåé" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you buy less ‚Äústuff,‚Äù humans manufacture less ‚Äústuff.‚Äù When humans manufacture less, we use less of the Earth&#8217;s dwindling natural resources. Quite simply, really.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that humans use more natural resources each year than the Earth can actually generate within the year? Doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out that this is not sustainable, and one day, all the resources will be GONE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a frugal mind-set and lifestyle can help reduce your environmental footprint. Living in excess and consuming more than you need is the opposite. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f645.png" alt="üôÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h2><strong>DIY Projects Increase Your Resourcefulness</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can grow things yourself, make things yourself, and fix things yourself‚Ä¶ you are less dependent on others. And isn‚Äôt that what we are all kind of shooting for ‚Äî independence?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm not talking about doing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yourself in life. There is a balance between DIY and outsourcing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But frugal people understand that the more problems they can solve with their own two hands makes them more resourceful and gives them more options and control.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Frugality Improves Social Connections</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes people are afraid to admit they are frugal‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre worried others might shun them or cut them out of future invitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I‚Äôve experienced the opposite! The more open I am about my lifestyle, the more people I seem to connect with.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs refreshing when other people admit they are trying to save money, get a good deal or waste less. Frugality actually brings people together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of being frugal is sharing, swapping, giving and receiving. All these activities improve social relationships. Think about Buy Nothing groups, co-op organizations, and even potluck meals. Sharing is caring!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you reckon? Do you think being frugal is cool? Or is my vision warped? (Could also be the cheap sunglasses I‚Äôm wearing, which I got for a bargain. Just sayin‚Äô <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="üòé" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you all an awesome Friday and great Super Bowl weekend!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her plan is to continue working full time as a teacher during the day, plus take on a full schedule of graduate classes at night. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crazy, I know!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it‚Äôs also very inspiring‚Ä¶ Because she doesn‚Äôt </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">need</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more schooling (she doesn‚Äôt even really need to work anymore if she doesn‚Äôt want to) but she‚Äôs doing them both anyway because that‚Äôs what she enjoys and wants to do in life. Also, this specific master&#8217;s degree + special ed credential will unlock even more possibilities and challenges within her field of passion in the future.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, this post isn‚Äôt about how awesome and smart my wife is (there aren‚Äôt enough words to describe that), this is about how we are planning to pay for graduate school. Or rather, how *</span><b>her parents* have offered to pay for her grad school.</b></p>
<h2><strong>Accepting Big Gifts as an Adult Feels Weird ‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we started sharing her plans for grad school late last year, my wife‚Äôs parents‚Äô eyes lit up!&#8230; They‚Äôd been saving for her college education their whole life and proudly put her through undergrad with the intention of paying for more schooling if she wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 10 years ago (before we were married), my wife started grad school but stopped halfway through to pursue other stuff. So, her parents think it‚Äôs only fair that they continue paying for the remainder of her education now because they had planned to and never finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if I‚Äôm being honest, I feel a little uncomfortable accepting their offer. I wasn‚Äôt raised with an option of free college </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(don‚Äôt get me wrong, I come from an extremely privileged background ‚Äì my parents gave me everything *except money*)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so it feels strange accepting a gift of this size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, my wife and I are self-sufficient adults now. We have earned and saved our own money to pay for the things we want to pursue in life, whether it be vacations, lifestyle upgrades, or continued education. I feel it‚Äôs our responsibility.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why let someone else pay for our stuff when we can afford it ourselves?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you might be thinking‚Ä¶ </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúJoel, this isn‚Äôt a gift for YOU, this is a gift for your wife. It‚Äôs between her and her parents.‚Äù </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while yes that‚Äôs a valid argument, we actually both benefit financially from this. My wife and I share everything in life ‚Äì our money, our passions, our successes, struggles‚Ä¶ everything. A gift to her is a gift to me. And vice versa.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do I Feel Awkward Accepting Gifts?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need to grow up and get over this feeling. So I‚Äôve started asking myself WHY I feel weird getting gifts‚Ä¶ And most of my reasons are pretty dumb now that I write them out:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>I don‚Äôt like feeling ‚Äúin debt‚Äù to other people.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I don‚Äôt know why, but whenever I get a gift, I feel guilty until I can give back something equal in return. Especially big gifts‚Ä¶ Like, if a friend got me a gift worth $500 for my birthday, I kind of feel obligated to spend $500 on their birthday, even though that‚Äôs way more than I would regularly spend.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>I have too much pride and ego.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These are things I‚Äôm learning to swallow more and more as I grow older and get more mature. But I‚Äôll admit, earning and paying for my own stuff myself makes me feel better than just getting things for free.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Maybe deep down I don&#8217;t feel worthy?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are 7 billion other people on this planet who probably deserve gifts more than I do. No matter the gift size, someone out there needs it more than me and my wife.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>I don‚Äôt want to be a financial burden on others.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having parents pay for stuff feels like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the opposite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of financial independence. (Although ironically, receiving money brings us closer to FIRE because we can save more.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>I‚Äôd rather be the giver than the receiver.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I‚Äôm getting better at this as I grow older‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm realizing that part of giving IS receiving. Refusing gifts robs the other party of the very feeling that I love.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, that was a lot of sharing my feelings. I know this is a first world problem and you probably think I‚Äôm an ungrateful little shit. Believe me, I know how blessed I am in life and I 100% acknowledge these are good problems to have. I‚Äôm just sharing my situation and being honest.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Accepting Gifts and Changing My Mind-Set</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sooooo‚Ä¶ long story short, we are accepting the parents&#8217; offer and they will pay for grad school. My wife only has about 12 months of classes left to complete her degree, and she found an online university that‚Äôll cost about $20k all in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And going forward, I‚Äôm releasing my bottled feelings of guilt, embarrassment and discomfort when receiving gifts‚Ä¶ Instead, I‚Äôm converting all those feelings into gratitude, appreciation, celebration, and respect for the gift givers. Generous parents set amazing examples, and their acts are teaching US how to be more generous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, my wife and I hope to pay forward all the blessings we receive in life. Perhaps we should add some more funds to our </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/giving-stock-ugma-custodial-account/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nephews‚Äô UGMA gift accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Actually, maybe we should start setting aside money for our future adopted kids‚Äô education?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any of you out there received massive gifts from your parents? Would love to hear your thoughts/feelings if you‚Äôre open to sharing.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was chatting with a friend the other day about publishing net worth reports online each month&#8230; He was like, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄùDude! That‚Äôs a dumb idea because what if the stock market crashes and you lose a whole bunch of money publicly? Wouldn‚Äôt you be really embarrassed?‚Äú&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can understand why he thinks this way ‚Äì after all, the main mission of this blog is to help people </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">grow more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> money, not lose it‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BUT‚Ä¶ the lesser-known (yet equally important) mission of this blog is actually to </span><b>help people be happy and live the best life they can, regardless of how many dollars they have.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, my wife and I lost a whopping $35k in net worth. On the surface, that looks very sad and embarrassing‚Ä¶ BUT, the reality is </span><b>our happiness hasn‚Äôt really changed, nor has our lifestyle‚Ä¶</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still make and enjoy delicious meals together</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hang and laugh with our friends, same as always</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our hobbies are the same</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our family loves us just the same</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We go to work, exercise, do our chores, and relax on the couch together before bed every night, the same as usual</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there‚Äôs nothing really to be sad about, even with so much red in our ledger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm not sure if you are feeling crap looking at your net worth this past month‚Ä¶ But I encourage you to focus on your day-to-day life and the small things that provide you daily joy. You‚Äôll realize that life is still quite good. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The stock market (out of your control) doesn‚Äôt dictate your happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, here‚Äôs how we took a $35k loss last month‚Ä¶ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f447.png" alt="üëá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f447.png" alt="üëá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f447.png" alt="üëá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h2><b>Net Worth as of Feb 1, 2022: $819,282</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary of our assets and liabilities:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64436 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Net-worth-Feb-1-2022-e1643951018850.png" alt="" width="600" height="409" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broad U.S. stock market had the worst monthly drop since March 2020. This is the main reason our assets dropped in value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get to the individual account breakdowns, here are a few other money-related things that happened in January.</span></p>
<h2><b>January Money Moves&#8230;</b></h2>
<p><b>Irregular expenses:¬†</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We paid our annual property tax bill for our rental property. This took $5,321.44 from our property float account.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our cell phones are on a group family plan, and we pay a family member in 6-month installments&#8230; So this cost us $540 in January $90 total per month for our 2 cell plans)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spent $496 on ‚Äúhome improvement‚Äù (a.k.a. furniture, rugs, and kiddy stuff in anticipation of a child living with us soon ‚Äì more deets to come on that soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f973.png" alt="ü•≥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Extra income and savings:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn‚Äôt really drive much in January, so we only spent $39 in gas for the car! (and right now the tank is still about ¬æ full).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hustled my butt off and made $2,625 for extra contract work for my employer last month (and it looks like there‚Äôs some extra opportunity in February too!)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We made some big moves with our Venture X credit card‚Ä¶ Booked a FREE hotel night for a wedding in June ($300 value) and also got awarded about $1000 in travel credit for hitting our minimum spend.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Detailed Account Breakdowns</b></h2>
<p><b>Cash Accounts </b><b>(-$7,041)</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The major decrease here was funding our Roth accounts for 2022. We still have more than $20k in cash reserves, some of which will be invested this coming month. :)</span></p>
<p><b>Rental Property + Reserve Account</b><b> (-$4,764)</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apart from our ~5k+ property bill, this rental was actually cashflow positive last month. Here are the rental income and expenses‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,975¬† &#8212;¬† Incoming rent from units</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(-$138)¬† &#8212;¬† Property management fees</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(-$617) &#8212;¬† Garbage disposal fixes, bath/shower plumbing issues &amp; other maintenance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(-$661)¬† &#8212;¬† Mortgage principal + interest</span></p>
<p><b>$559¬† &#8212;¬† Total rental gain this month</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Note: I don‚Äôt track the monthly ups and downs in property value for this rental. Sources like Zillow and Redfin are too unreliable for my property type, so I only do a value update once a year with a full CMA from my real estate agent.**</span></p>
<p><b>Real Estate Syndication (no change in value):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We received a $880 dividend in January, which doesn‚Äôt change the value of our ownership share. But it does count to our overall investment return. Since we‚Äôre coming up on the 1 year mark for this syndication, I‚Äôll have to write a longer post about how this is all performing. So far, it‚Äôs crushing initial expectations.</span></p>
<p><b>IRA &#8211; Regular:</b> <b>(-$12,076)</b><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took about a -6% hit on this account due to stock market volatility. It would have been worse, but the last couple trading days in January were quite nice for the overall stock market.</span></p>
<p><b>IRA &#8211; Roths:</b><b> (+$4,813)</b><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early January, we contributed $12,000 to our Roth accounts. The reason we max out both our Roth accounts early each year is because we believe </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing-what-to-do-with-a-pile-of-cash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lump sum investing beats dollar cost averaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> *most of the time.* Investing at market peaks is scary, but it beats trying to time the market (which I suck at!!)</span></p>
<p><b>Joint Brokerage Account:</b> <b>(-$18,343)</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It stings to see this account with such a massive dip, especially after I just invested $35k in December after the sale of our 3rd rental property. Oh well, we still have a balance over $300k and a long investment horizon.</span></p>
<p><b>*NEW* Solo Roth 401(k):</b> <b>($-578)</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is my new </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/solo-401k/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solo 401k with TD Ameritrade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which also has a Roth component). My plan is to max this out in 2022, but the sucky thing is contributions have to be done via wire transfer or mailing in a physical check.¬†</span></p>
<p><b>HSA: $4,743</b> <b>(-$305)</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No contributions of withdrawals from this HSA. All of the funds are invested in VTI (total stock market index) which is why we took a 6% hit this month.</span></p>
<h2><b>Breakdown of Liabilities</b></h2>
<p><b>Rental Property Mortgage: </b><b>(+$252)</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little by little, month by month, our mortgage is being paid off by our tenants. Principal paydown is an often overlooked benefit to owning a rental property, but it‚Äôs one of my favorite consistent additions to our wealth each month.</span></p>
<p><b>Credit Card Balances:</b><b> (+$2,459)</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since my wife and I pay off our credit card balances each month before the due date, I‚Äôm thinking of removing this line item from our tracking sheet going forward. Although it‚Äôs technically a ‚Äúliability,‚Äù I can just minus our CC debt from our checking account balance because that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs paid from anyway. Thinking of slimming down these NW reports in the future for a more simple read!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, my wife and I have no other debts at this time! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="üòé" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs all for now. Cheers to a *hopefully* profitable February for everyone!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onwards and upwards!</span></p>

This topic has been discussed over and over within the FI world, and with good reason: side hustles are both interesting and a chance to make some extra moolah!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I&#8217;ve always had a love/hate relationship with the idea of side hustles. Often I hear about someone&#8217;s side hustle and I think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;dude, that&#8217;s just a boring second job &#8211; who wants that!?&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other times I&#8217;m like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;yee-ha, that sounds cool! Even if it pays crap, I want to try it&#8221;.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why my hesitation? I think it&#8217;s because I see side-hustles as both a potential outlet for passion, and a potential trap for disappointment. Let me explain:</span></p>
<h2><strong>What I love about side hustles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s a chance to spend time doing something </span><b><i>you are good at and enjoy</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the primary benefit in my eyes, as hopefully money doesn‚Äôt dictate our lives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s a chance to make some extra $ in your life, potentially with tax benefits superior to employee compensation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having 2 sources of income adds a back-up in case your primary job slips. Or, your side hustle could potentially grow big enough to be your main gig.¬†</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What I don&#8217;t like about side hustles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often it&#8217;s just a second job. You end up </span><b><i>trading time for money doing something you dislike</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, I personally don&#8217;t enjoy cleaning floors, so I&#8217;d call a night-gig as a janitor a second job, not a fun side hustle. This wouldn‚Äôt add happiness to my life.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes turning your hobby into a ‚Äòjob‚Äô can kill the passion. For example, if I sold my painted rocks on Etsy, it might bring a few hundred dollars a month in revenue, but it completely kills the joy I get from giving my art away for free.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why do I feel this way?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, I personally feel a potential trap to miss out on life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a real-life example: during college my brother worked a night gig at a bank, reviewing mortgage applications for a year. This was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tangentially</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> related to his college studies and he made a small fortune for a college kid. Cool, right?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, he tells me he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúmissed every sunset of 2006 at the age of 23‚Äù</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That supposed small fortune of money is now inconsequential to him, and he&#8217;s never going to be 23 again. In hindsight, he says the tradeoff wasn‚Äôt worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I </span><b><i>LOVE</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hearing about side gigs and second jobs that allow people to live more of life, not less. I do believe that side hustles can be a tradeoff worth making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs a happy example: my friend works for a pharmaceutical company, and she can pick up work at CVS as a pharmacist on Sundays (earning double-time!). For a few years in her early career she worked on Sundays at CVS, even though her primary job paid well. She never relied on this job, and she eventually bought an investment property and left that side gig. She‚Äôs happy with the trade-off she made, and genuinely enjoys what she does.¬†</span></p>
<h2><strong>So what‚Äôs a good side hustle?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my mind, the ideal side hustle would be </span><b>both</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highly enjoyable and lucrative for the time input. In reality, I think many side hustles end up being a tradeoff between one or the other, which is just part of life I guess. And since life is full of tradeoffs, let‚Äôs not get discouraged when searching for a great side gig.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Side hustles of my past ‚Äì the good, the bad and the meh</strong></h2>
<p><b>GOOD: Freelance bartender:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I used to serve drinks at weddings when I was in my early 20‚Äôs, when my primary job was sales. I loved it! Pouring drinks, laughing, even dancing with people who were all celebrating ‚Äì what‚Äôs not to love? But eventually I kind of grew out of it and focused on my sales career. I guess life moved on, but I have great memories from that time!</span></p>
<p><b>BAD: ‚ÄúFamily conveyor belt‚Äù.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In hindsight, this is more funny than bad. As a young teenager I took on a paper route. Unlike the movies, where a cute kid rides a bike to deliver newspapers, this job was delivering junk mail and it wore out the whole family! Mum had to drive me to pick up thousands of flyers, my 3 siblings and I set up a conveyor belt system on the kitchen table, and then as a family we packaged hundreds of stacks of different junk mail for delivery. The job paid almost nothing, and it literally took all 6 of us (parents helping too) to achieve the crazy-high quota of junk mail delivery I had. We all laugh about it now.</span></p>
<p><b>MEH: Second job at Post Office</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I spent 6 months working nights doing postal sorting in my youth. Similar to my brother, I made what I thought was a buttload of money at the time. But I worked every night, ignored my friends, and missed out on some opportunities to enjoy life at that age. I have no regrets, but won&#8217;t be doing a hustle like that ever again.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Side hustles I wouldn‚Äôt mind trying</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Part time tax preparer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì I like this idea because by helping others file taxes, I can take on work seasonally as it suits me. It helps others and is a valuable, marketable skill. I‚Äôm a nerd and I find taxes kind of fun.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Nursing home assistant </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äì a friend of mine picked up casual work caring for elderly during college while studying to be a Registered Nurse. Casual work paid well and the experience was valuable after she graduated. I do volunteering now, and can see myself stepping up to a caring role some day. Maybe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sports umpire </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äì 2 different friends in my life have been football umpires, and both really enjoyed the job. In one case it was Australian football, where the umpires need to run A LOT! Not sure if I‚Äôd be fit enough.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Side hustles I probably will never try</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Medical experiments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A friend of mine took part in a few drug trials during their college years for a few dollars. She ended up getting a weird unexplainable rash from it. The compensation was small. I‚Äôm all for medical advancement, but not sure I‚Äôm ready to sacrifice my health.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MLM‚Äôs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever had a call from a friend who wants you to try a new product, and then start selling it too? I can‚Äôt fathom selling to my friends and family, no matter how good the product or service is. I know MLM‚Äôs work for some people, but they‚Äôre not for me :)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>AirBnB my house or spare bedroom</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the reasons my wife and I are </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/selling-our-rental-properties-2-down-2-to-go/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling our rental properties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to get out of tenant management and dealing with renters. No matter how much we can make, renting out our home brings on too much stress for what it‚Äôs worth IMO.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What do a lot of successful side hustles have in common?¬†</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a few things.¬†</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucrative side gigs often exploit a unique skill or qualification a person might have, which usually allows them to offer services that demand a premium over minimum wage. Often that skill or qualification was gained from their primary job.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The side-gig often brings a benefit to a person‚Äôs primary job. This means that there are non-monetary benefits from the side-gig, like hands-on experience or widening your network, that are in turn leveraged by the primary job.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think side gigs are often temporary in nature, like my pharmacist friend who worked toward a goal with her second job, achieved it, and then moved on.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FI people love the book ‚Äú</span><a href="https://amzn.to/3CKR4EY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Money or Your Life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù by Vicki Robin. Among other things, it discusses similarities between work and hobbies. One takeaway for me was that if you don‚Äôt consider getting paid, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can get from a job can also be found in a hobby. That means passion, achievement, teamwork, socializing and serving others ‚Äì all of these things can be found when you‚Äôre working for free!</span></p>
<h2><strong>So, are side hustles worth it?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess at the end of the day it all depends on your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side hustles are a great opportunity to learn, follow our passions, and hopefully earn some extra $ on the side! But also, I often suspect that if we put that extra effort into our primary job or career development, we might be able to increase our primary income without a side hustle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So personally, here‚Äôs my advice: if you need extra money and are looking for a side hustle, start by looking at your primary job. Can you put in the hours for a promotion or job change? Or is there a related service you can offer? Working in an area you already specialize in can lead to more income.</span></p>
<p><b>If not for money, think about your passions. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a way you can find casual work in this passion? If you never make any big money from your passion, will it still be time well spent? Probably!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don‚Äôt forget &#8211; the world always needs more volunteers, and trust me there will be a rewarding role you can fit that is always worth your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you all a great week ahead, doing what you love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Joel</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**End of post!** </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="ü§£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just kidding. My editor won‚Äôt let me publish a 5-word post (even though ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù really is the simplest answer to the question), so I‚Äôd better add some color commentary‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><b>When the stock market is crashing ‚Äî&gt; you should do nothing.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect that many of you already know this. But, even though you know it, you might still be thinking in the back of your head, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúMaybe this ‚Äúcrash‚Äù is different from ones in the past? I‚Äôm more experienced now, so maybe I can make some small changes to limit my downside? My portfolio is different from other people‚Äôs, so I am allowed to rebalance a little bit‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm selling ALL my stuff, maybe I‚Äôll just sell a few stocks and buy them back at a lower price later?‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not bad to be thinking these thoughts (I think them, too). It‚Äôs human nature to try to actively solve problems when we foresee shit hitting the fan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, history tells us that </span><b>the more human intervention your portfolio has, the more money you lose.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if your adjustments are made with brilliant research and good intentions, they have a higher chance of negatively impacting your overall performance.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Other Thoughts About Stock Market Crashes‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no particular order, here are some other notes and stories on this subject:</span></p>
<p><b>It‚Äôs a good time to ‚Äúplay dead‚Äù:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fidelity did a 10-year study of all its client accounts from 2003 to 2013. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know which investors had the BEST account performance?</span></i> <b>Dead people!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Or people who had ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù about old accounts.) When accounts were left untouched, they had better growth. So don‚Äôt touch yours, mkay!?</span></p>
<p><b>When in doubt, LEARN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To fill the time while you are NOT touching your accounts, start reading and learning. I‚Äôm not talking about consuming panic news and social media. I‚Äôm talking about studying the good ol‚Äô fashion fundamentals of building wealth. Read some of the top personal finance books that have stood the test of time. Or, check out some notable new books:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now I‚Äôm reading </span><a href="https://amzn.to/34agdh1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trillions by Robin Wigglesworth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It‚Äôs about how index funds were created.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out </span><a href="https://gumroad.com/a/679367795/bTEOH"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Mastermind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This book is written by 30 of my fellow FIRE bloggers and influencers. Different topics, different perspectives, and I even wrote one of the chapters! BTW, if you do want this book, </span><b>order with discount code ‚ÄúBUDGETS‚Äù for 30% off.</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (This ebook also has a 100% money back guarantee if you don‚Äôt like it! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f92b.png" alt="ü§´" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>We are all in this together:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> During a market crash you might feel scared, alone, and poor. But the truth is that everyone is in the same boat as you ‚Äì myself included! One of the reasons I publish my net worth each month is to show you that I practice what I preach. In a market crash, I will lose considerable value in my assets (I‚Äôve lost more than $50k in the last 3 weeks alone). It might get worse, but I won‚Äôt be selling any investments. You are NOT alone in a crash.</span></p>
<p><b>This has happened before, and it will happen again:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The stock market has experienced dozens of crashes and corrections over the decades, and it&#8217;s bounced back from every one of them. Since I‚Äôm only 37 years old, I will probably experience 5-10 more MAJOR crashes in my lifetime. Maybe even more. But, I will also experience an equal amount of MAJOR bull runs and heroic comebacks. As long as I stay invested, the growth will always be bigger than the crashes. I just need to ride everything out.</span></p>
<p><b>You can‚Äôt outsmart a crash:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sometimes people think they can use market crashes to their advantage. But, this rarely works out because </span><b>nobody knows where the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù of a crash actually is.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In fact, even if you DID know when the exact market bottom was during every major crash over the past 40 years, you would still come out with less money investing at the bottom vs. investing consistently regardless of highs and lows. Read this easy-to-digest comparison from my buddy Jeremy at Personal Finance Club: </span><a href="https://www.personalfinanceclub.com/how-to-perfectly-time-the-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to time the market perfectly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>You won‚Äôt lose any real money, **unless you sell**:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if stock prices plummet, you haven&#8217;t technically lost anything as long as you continue to hold your investments. You still own the same number of shares in the same companies, so keep holding them until value rises again (it will).</span></p>
<p><b>The ‚Äúbright side‚Äù of sequence of returns risk:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A multi-year market crash is one of the biggest risks to people who have just retired. BUT, a multi-year crash can actually be</span><b> the best thing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people just starting their investment journey! </span><a href="https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/05/17/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-14-sequence-of-return-risk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Big ERN puts it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Ä¶ </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúSequence of return risk is a symmetric risk: you can benefit from it or it can seriously harm your investment returns. It impacts both retirees and savers and the risk is exactly a zero-sum game.‚Äù</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><b>‚ÄúPlease sir, can I have some more?‚Äù </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To add to the point above, a market crash means you can buy stocks at a discount. Downturns are actually a good thing for anyone who is consistently saving and investing (which is the majority of the population!). When you see stocks slipping, you should think like Oliver Twist‚Ä¶ </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúPlease sir, can I have some more?‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><b>Learning from past mistakes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Talk to anyone who lived through the 2020 Covid crash, the 2008 Financial crisis, or the 2001 Dotcom crash‚Ä¶ You‚Äôll hear 2 main regrets from any investor during those times. Those regrets are 1) I wish I didn‚Äôt panic-sell when the market was crashing. And 2) I wish I bought MORE stock during the crash. Learn from other people‚Äôs mistakes!</span></p>
<p><b>It‚Äôs a great time to side hustle!:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Speaking of buying more, market crashes are a great time to earn excess money ‚Äî&gt; and put that money into investments. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOGU94eL07E"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side hustles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also distract you and keep you busy so you don‚Äôt freak out about what the market is doing.</span></p>
<p><b>Guided Meditation Video, by JL Collins: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years back, legendary JL Collins made the following 10-minute video for anyone freaking out about the stock market dropping. Listen to his soothing voice, relax, and follow his wise advice!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64428 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Screen-Shot-2022-01-26-at-11.48.44-AM-e1643341663971.png" alt="" width="600" height="339" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOGU94eL07E"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Guided Meditation for When the Stock Market Is Dropping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My last piece of advice for what to do when the stock market is crashing‚Ä¶ </span><b>Keep living your awesome life.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hang with your kids, continue your hobbies, keep doing good deeds for people and spending money on the things that you love in this world. Just because the economy is doing weird stuff, it doesn‚Äôt mean you need to radically change your behavior. Spend your time on things within your control, not worrying about stuff you can‚Äôt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Friday, y‚Äôall! Have an awesome weekend. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/were-thinking-about-hiring-a-house-cleaner/" title="We&#8217;re Thinking About Hiring a House Cleaner &#8230;" rel="nofollow"><img width="710" height="473" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/GettyImages-915451972-768x512.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/GettyImages-915451972-768x512.jpg 768w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/GettyImages-915451972-300x200.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/GettyImages-915451972-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/GettyImages-915451972-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/GettyImages-915451972-e1642741259144.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></a><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soooo‚Ä¶ my wife and I are having a debate right now (actually, it‚Äôs not so much a ‚Äúdebate‚Äù&#8230; it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúwe have decided, just discussing the pros and cons‚Äù) about hiring a *regular* housekeeper to clean our house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a new area for us, because we rarely outsource tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past 12 years living together, we‚Äôve probably hired a cleaner maybe 10 times max. These have been times when we‚Äôre extremely busy or in a transition and need a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep house clean</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before hosting important guests or something. Apart from that, we‚Äôve always found time ourselves to sweep, mop, dust, clean the bathrooms, do our own laundry, and all the other adulting stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BUT‚Ä¶ </span><b>life is about to get pretty busy for us. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of all our current stuff, we anticipate a little kid or two entering our home soon ‚Äì and these kids will come with their own full schedule of appointments and activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a house cleaner will let us prioritize work and kid stuff, as well as protect some of our dwindling free time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm against hiring cleaners‚Ä¶ I just want to consider the long-term effects of this decision before we commit. To me, </span><b>this feels like lifestyle inflation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could potentially be a one-way street. Once we get a regular cleaning service, it might be hard to give up later.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Financial Considerations of Hiring a House Cleaner</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We‚Äôve found a cleaner that can come every 2 weeks, and will charge ~$150 per cleaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs $3,900 per year. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f633.png" alt="üò≥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTW ‚Äì we would still need to clean ourselves in the off weeks. (Our German Shepherd alone sheds heavily and we already sweep a couple times a week). So hiring a cleaner could actually cost us more if we need more than every other week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can afford an extra $3,900 per year, but there are a few ways to consider the costs:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the weekly cost breaks down to $75 per week. Luckily, one of my contracting gigs pays $75 per hour. So if I worked just 1 hour extra per week, this could fully cover the cost without impacting our cashflow. Sounds easy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, if we think about the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time savings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it‚Äôs probably a cost of ~$20 per hour that we pay the cleaner to save our time ($150 for 8-ish hours work).¬†</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is me and wifey‚Äôs work time worth more than $20 an hour?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, I think it is.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is our FREE TIME worth more than $20 an hour? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment I would say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but next year with a full schedule I would think Yes, it‚Äôs definitely with it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I‚Äôm considering the overall </span><b>impact of our FI number.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If this new annual cost continues *forever,* then it‚Äôs something that will need to be replaced eventually by passive income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the 4% rule, an extra ~$4k per year of living expenses </span><b>adds $100k to our FI number</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That‚Äôs a pretty huge increase to think about!¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also </span><b>opportunity costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (because we‚Äôll be spending $4k instead of investing it each year before reaching FI) which could be another $100k+ of missed growth over the next 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, I‚Äôm not opposed to increasing our expenses (we planned for increased costs when we have kids). It&#8217;s just a little sticker shock seeing the numbers written down.</span><b> Somehow a basic bi-weekly cleaning service has a ~$200k impact on our overall financial life!</b></p>
<h2><strong>Lifestyle Considerations</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money aside, I have some weird emotions going on about hiring someone to clean my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I think I have a pride issue that I need to swallow. Almost every one of my friends here in LA has a regular hired house cleaner. The fact that my wife and I do all of our cleaning ourselves makes me feel great. I‚Äôm proud to be a hard worker. And switching from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work is more difficult than I thought. It involves releasing control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, I‚Äôm scared this lifestyle inflation will be a ‚Äúcreep‚Äù that keeps growing and growing. I‚Äôm worried that a cleaning service twice a week will soon lead to every week, and then maybe we‚Äôll start to hire help in other areas of life. I guess the unknown future costs are starting to freak me out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I‚Äôm worried about getting lazy. When someone else is cleaning, it means I will stop cleaning. This change in my behavior may lead to me stopping other types of chores and looking to outsource more stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even worse, what will our kids be learning by seeing someone regularly clean for us? When I was a kid, my siblings and I helped with ALL household chores. Cleaning the house was one of the ways my </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/6-ways-my-parents-taught-me-financial-independence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents taught me to be independent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I‚Äôm worried that if our kids grow up with a cleaner, they‚Äôll expect that as the normal thing when they reach adulthood.</span></p>
<h2><strong>All Things Considered ‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I crazy for thinking this way? Am I being a tight-ass for not jumping at the chance to outsource chores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would love to hear from you all. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a regular house cleaning service currently, all in all, is it worth it?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a short post today‚Ä¶ Here are 3 simple questions to ask yourself this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking these questions once in a while (especially at the start of the work week) will help you lead a happier, richer, and more intentional life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go‚Ä¶</span></p>
<h2><strong>1. What Tiny Little Thing Can I Do to Make My Partner&#8217;s Life Easier Today?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I freaking love this question. That‚Äôs why I put it first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I personally believe that the quickest route to happiness is¬† ‚Äî&gt; </span><b>making other people happy.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A thoughtful 2 to 3 minute activity in the morning can brighten someone‚Äôs ENTIRE day, not to mention make you feel great all day, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I get up one hour before my wife each day, I have the opportunity to do something tiny for her in the morning. Like, making sure her bike tires are pumped before she rides to work, checking if her headphones are low on battery and putting them on charge, or writing a small love note to sneak in her lunchbox. Tiny tasks ‚Äî&gt; massive impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don‚Äôt have a partner at home, think about a friend, a coworker, your boss, or even a person you just met. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What one tiny thing can you do to make their day easier?</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>2. What Are 3 Good Things That Will Happen This Week?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positivity breeds positivity. When you anticipate and look forward to good things happening, other random blessings start to manifest in your life, too.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything fun going on at work you‚Äôre looking forward to? Meeting anyone cool this week? Are you getting paid or making any extra $ this week? What are the fun hobbies you‚Äôre doing?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel free to think of more than just 3 things. The more, the merrier. Oh, and BTW‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt have to be massive or life-changing events&#8230; In fact, looking forward to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">smaller and more regular things in life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will help you build a habit of simple appreciation.</span></p>
<h2><strong>3. What Tiny Good Habit Am I Trying to Form? (Or a Tiny Bad Habit Am I Trying to Shed?)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite Benjamin Franklin quote‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúYour net worth to the world is usually determined by what remains after your bad habits are subtracted from your good ones.‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs easy to set big goals and resolutions in life (especially at the beginning of the year). But sometimes we get lost in the grind and forget the small daily habits that help achieve those big goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of trying to change everything at once, just focusing on and mastering one habit at a time can be very powerful.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the one thing you are trying to improve this week, or month?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you a happy, productive, and prosperous day ahead! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="üí™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, Joel</span></p>
