					<description><![CDATA[So, here&#039;s the thing...
Where we are financially, in this country, pretty much dictates retirement as we think of it today will not exist by the time it&#039;s our turn. The flip side of that is ok..you &quot;work&quot; your entire life til say 62 and then STOP... how much golf, how much travel, how much of any &quot;retirement pleasures&quot; can anyone really take?  I&#039;ll take the million but count me out of the retirement gig.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool Topic

Having a millions dollars is quite different than having a million dollar net worth. 

If you add up all your stuff and subtract all you owe that is the first part: Net Worth

If you then look at all the stuff you have accumulated you can weed out the biggest money drains. As prices go up (inflation) so do your property taxes and general upkeep, utilities, etc.

For instance, If you know you are going to travel in retirement, you can safely trade down to a smaller home that will give you less total cost of ownership.

Most importantly I think, if you choose to live frugally, you can save up some cash. The nice thing about having a little bit of money is that you can actually then save a lot more:

You can bulk buy and take advantage of volume discounts.

You can pay cash for a nice used car instead of feeling pressure to finance a new one.

You can be adequately insured against loss. In fact, once you get to a certain level of wealth, you could decide to self-insure. One small example of this is having larger deductibles on car insurance and paying a much cheaper premium. Of course you have to have that extra $1000 in the bank to cover a damage claim but if you do, it pays.

It is always about lifestyle choice and habits. If you develop strong financial habits now (investing 30% no matter what, for example) you will be wealthy in retirement. As you get older your needs will change. Instead of cars, tablets and shoes you&#039;ll be buying more meds, birdseed and toys for your grandkids.

It is less about what a million dollars will buy but rather about the lifestyle a million dollars will support.

					<description><![CDATA[I have no idea what the wooden nickel saying means; I&#039;ve never heard it before. Care to enlighten?

As it stands, I could not presently live off a million dollars for my whole retirement if I were to retire today - mortgage, student loans.  However, since those factors will be long-since paid off by the time I actually retire, I think that I could if the economic conditions were similar (which, of course, in 2055 they won&#039;t be).

Just 40 more years to retirement....yup, I actually count.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, we could live off of $1 million.  

Your other question was if we thought we&#039;d have a million bucks.  If we can get 5% returns or better over the next 25 years, then yes.  Our 2 Roth IRA&#039;s, 401(k), and Scottrade investments should be more than $1.5 million and we&#039;ll hopefully have his teacher pension as well.  

I made my millionaire to do list a while ago...I should see if we&#039;ve been working on it...]]></description>
