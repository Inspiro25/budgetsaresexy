They do AMAZING work! It&#039;s a crew of the smartest, most talented and dedicated folks I know. I was amazed they even let me through the doors to be honest. =) They are all WAY out of my league.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love, love, love this post!  I first read about Tim Ferriss&#039; mini-retirements a few years back and realized I had already been unwittingly taking mini-retirements!  My life and career have changed significantly since then, limiting my travel and mobility, and I have struggled with re-framing my time and priorities so that I can continue to include breaks and travel throughout my career.  Having a solid planner like this one is going to be a HUGE help!  Thank you!]]></description>

That&#039;s great! Thank you for the reply. I can&#039;t wait until we find some way to reduce that health insurance cost - it&#039;s our second biggest, after housing. Gotta tackle those big line items to get the monthly nut down!]]></description>

We lived out that way for a while too. There are some really cool work opportunities, but it is pricey. I was able to volunteer with International Justice Mission while we lived there, which was so amazing! We were really fortunate to keep our health coverage as part of a military retirement. We still have copay&#039;s, and deductibles but not a monthly charge for it. I have to pay for dental, which is $60 a month. And Mr. Mt pays for life insurance. With everything else, we are really mindful of the monthly obligation. I would rather have lots of margin and extra cash for fun stuff than big bills, if we can help it.]]></description>

If you want to check out my free PDF, it can give some extra info on the practical side of saving up the money. I think it just takes time. If you are looking at taking a few months or year off in 10 years, then you don&#039;t have to save a ton extra every month. Plus in 10 years, you might be able to create a good source of passive income. Over the last 15 years, our combined household income has varied between $30,000-$70,000 a year. And we have 5 kids. So I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s impossible on an average income. It just takes some intention.]]></description>

We were able to negotiate the 2 month long leaves. One we did between jobs, and one we had to quit a job to get. I think if people have saved up the money and are ready, a space might present its self.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome! I love this line of thinking. :D

The &quot;monthly nut&quot; thing is a really great way to look at it. I was just looking at our monthly nut for comparison... big difference! We live in a high cost of living area (the same one as J Money, haha), so it&#039;s going to be a pretty significant difference. And we&#039;re somewhat okay with that, since we live here specifically because we couldn&#039;t do the work we do anywhere else in the world, and we love it.

Still, only $650 a month?!? Our health insurance alone (for mom, dad, and newborn baby) is more than that - and it&#039;s a high deductible plan, so we&#039;re paying for much of the care costs themselves on top of it. How do you manage to keep health insurance costs out of your monthly nut?]]></description>
