					<description><![CDATA[Its funny, cause if you ask a lot of successful people what made them successful, the honest ones will say their failures. They get up and keep on going. Failure also allows us to find new and better ways of doing things. I&#039;ve been a spectacular failure in so many parts of my career - but each one led to a far better experience that has catapulted me forward to make me more &#039;successful&#039;. So, while they felt like failures at the time, in hindsight they feel more like a bit of a pothole in the road.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If there is one thing I have learned in 2010, is that we can not let bumps in the road shut us down.  This has been the most challenging year of my life, yet I am still standing today.  Looking forward to the calendar changing to 2011, can&#039;t wait to get started!

@retireby40 - I agree I love the &quot;Adversity is never permanent&quot;.. If that slogan was on a t-shirt, i&#039;d wear it all year around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For sure.  I bet they&#039;d love to see their stuff growing even more online too!  This stuff will live on forever and most of it never changes -- we just keep trying to remind ourselves in different ways over time ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie, all those positive thinking books from the early 20th century... my parents and grandmother had &#039;em all. And yes, they may seem corny, but honestly, there&#039;s a lot of truth in them, that applies just as well today as when they were written. They&#039;re pretty inspiring, even for things that the authors never dreamed of like starting an internet business or whatever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see this so much, where people are so afraid of failing at something, they wont even try. This stunts growth, creativity, and success in my opinion. If you never fail, you&#039;ll never learn how to win.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like that - Adversity is never permanent. You should make a poster.
Nobody can be perfect, we just have to keep heading the right direction and we&#039;ll get there eventually.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thx guys :)  It&#039;s SO TRUE too.  Life is constantly changing around us and keeping us on our toes - for the good and the bad - but as long as we understand that we&#039;re the ones in control here, we can keep pushing forward!  As cheesy as it is, it&#039;s all a journey.

Nice to hear from you Elle :)]]></description>
