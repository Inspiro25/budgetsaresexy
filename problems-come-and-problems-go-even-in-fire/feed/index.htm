					<description><![CDATA[When our company was bought up by a Fortune 200 corporation everything changed.  For one they put me in charge of our company, and that was nice, but the pressure was ratcheted up so much it became like a minefield where every step was a potential landmine.  I kind of enjoyed the money and the amphetamine juiced hectic pace for a couple of years but it grew old fast. I was a happy guy in spite of it because I didn&#039;t need the money, I could just walk off into the sunset, and did.  And I think if you are a happy guy at work you&#039;ll likely be a happy guy in retirement.  And if the opposite is true you might have a problem in retirement. I know some people are very unhappy in retirement, I guess I question whether they weren&#039;t already pretty  miserable before they retired?]]></description>

Impersonal Finances - I tend to be more negative minded also.  However, after being around someone for over a week who tends to verbalize every negative thing, I realize how draining it can be on the listeners and it has inspired me to be more positive.  I also keep a gratitude journal.  It&#039;s amazing how that helps, too.]]></description>

I gotta see a picture of that if it ends up happening! Speaking of which, I am grateful for your morning emails. Always a huge mood booster. EVERY DAY!]]></description>

Hey Impersonal Finances - thanks! And to be clear, these are my issues, not Joel&#039;s. And you are right, at least most of my issues now are more directly in my control and never at the control of an employer. That is the best part, is having that sort of freedom.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Joel--awesome, honest post. Sorry to hear about the family relationship trouble--sometimes there is nothing you can do but try. 

You are right about trading one set of problems for another, though at least you are slightly more in control of what problems you choose to spend your time on. I am a fairly negative person by some birth defect but working hard at gratitude and positivity--and leaning on people like you for inspiration!]]></description>
