Selling is one of the most rewarding things :) Cuz not only does it mean you made something successful, but someone ELSE wants to take it and (hopefully) make it even better! And pay you handsomely for it too, so you can go and build the next thing on the list ;)]]></description>

Another reason to have a good mentor/biz partner. Nate once asked me why I was still doing GiveawaysAreSexy.com when it seemed like it wasn&#039;t growing and my passion had left it (both very true), and I thought to myself, &quot;Huh. I don&#039;t know?&quot; Haha... No one had ever asked me before and it made me stop for a second and reconsider the project. The next month I ended up shutting it down, and no one hardly noticed :)]]></description>

I&#039;ll second that one. I think you also have to ask your self WHY you want to do all of them? Or the new one? Like, what the *point* is at the end of the day? Is it for fun? To help people? To make millions of dollars and quit your day job? It doesn&#039;t really matter *what* your answer is, but usually once you pinpoint it that can help you make decisions faster for the future.]]></description>

Yeah, I&#039;ve learned after shutting down like 6 projects in the past 2 years that there is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, another one around the corner. One you&#039;ll usually just as excited about as the previous one, so if it&#039;s not working out after the given period, you can  move right on to the next. Although, 2 caveats here - 1) if you&#039;re not an idea person, then you may not have one lined up and need to partner up with someone who is, and 2) it&#039;s REALLY easy to jump ship and get into a new one without giving it enough time. And only you can figure out what &quot;enough&quot; is unfortunately - no rules out there :(]]></description>

Yeah, it&#039;s def. hard to gauge ANYTHING until it&#039;s out in the real world, but I agree you need some sort of check points to make sure things are as sexy as you&#039;re thinking they are in your head (at least, that&#039;s what I need a lot ;)). Luckily I can gauge &quot;success&quot; or not with how excited/passionate I still am w/ the project. As soon as I lose that - no matter what the numbers/goals look like - it&#039;s usually downhill from there. I&#039;m too damn emotional.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unless it&#039;s just a passion project, I always set the business goals when I start - monthly, quarterly, annually.  Then I revisit to see how I&#039;m performing.  If I&#039;m off track, it&#039;s a good time to rethink your strategy and see if there&#039;s a way you can improve it, or if it&#039;s time to pull the plug.

I&#039;m looking forward to selling my first business, one of these days...]]></description>
