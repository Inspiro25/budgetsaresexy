I&#039;m sorry but water is not free. Do you pay your bills and taxes? I would say water is accessible to public people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good genes also determine beauty, BUT... poor people will deteriorate faster than the rich because of the lack of education, self-discipline, and money, which all contribute to preserving the self.  Just my humble opinion.  I have seen beautiful hoodrats dancing at clubs, and then a few years later, they would age so bad because of the drugs, etc.  Also, I have seen college-educated women who end up looking better than these hoodrats even as they (the rich) are older and would age.  Not all college-educated women are rich, I should say the rich ones....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;CouponPrincess&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;...whatever attributes they have the money will bring out the best or worst in them.&quot; -- oooooh, that&#039;s interesting!  So if they were super generous before, they&#039;d be even MORE so now?  And same w/ being evil?  I wonder if there are any studies on that.  I&#039;d like to learn more about that - good one :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassandra&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;d agree with that.
@&lt;b&gt;Charlie F&lt;/b&gt; - For sure, we def. see more hot people on tv than we do not-so-hot.  I think Brad Pitt was once poor too - or at least living out of a car trying to &quot;make it&quot; at one point.  All rather interesting.
@&lt;b&gt;sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Sweat pants can be damn sexy too - I totally believe you can rock those :)  Work it, girl.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Oh man, confidence is killer. You have that and you can rock ANYTHING!&quot; ---- stole the words from my mouth! 9 times out of 10 I leave the house rockin sweatpants (cute ones, but none the less sweatpants) and as long as I feel confident, I might as well be wearing Prada. It&#039;s all in your attitude, and I like who I am, and it shows! That is what is sexy to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think richer people are necessarily more hot. I think that we see more attractive rich people because they&#039;re on T.V. and magazines and in movies, etc. They&#039;re more visible, yes. But there&#039;s so many people that are attractive that are poor, start out poor, etc. And all the middle-of-the-road people, too. How many models started poor? Marilyn Monroe came from a trailer park, right? But really, we just don&#039;t see that many poor people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you have ever had your make-up done professionally, you will understand when I say that, yes, money does give you the ability to look better. Tailored clothing always fits better than off the rack, although I only know this because of one suit that I was able to have altered. Professional make-up always looks better than what you can do yourself. A professional hair dye always comes out better than what you do at home. There are just certain benefits to being able to afford to pay someone to make you look good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Sarah Smith. 

There are plenty of poor people out there who are just beautiful. Maybe not always conventionally, but they are.

I guess just the markers of good health make you attractive. Teeth, skin, weight, hair.. 

Also, a great smile and confidence does much more for you than money in the bank ever will. Rich people may have trainers, chefs and all this money at their disposal for spas, but many people don&#039;t need any of that to look great.]]></description>
