					<description><![CDATA[Cell phone? 700 - iphone 4S
TV? I have two. I spent 1,400 for both
Music player?  250 ipod classic
Computer/Laptop? desktop computer - 1K, netbook - 350, tablet - 400
Video game/console?   I used to have a ps3 and a wii, I just sold my wii &#039;cause I&#039;ll be buying the wii U as soon as it&#039;s out. So, let&#039;s say 300
**EXTRA CREDIT**What’s the OLDEST electronic you own? Ugh.... I&#039;d say my desktop, but it isn&#039;t really old and I keep it up-to-date 

I&#039;m a big sucker for devices and technology and so is my husband so we change our devices fairly often. It is easier to say that I wear the same coat since 8 years ago than to say that my tv is that old....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love these - my apologies for being late!

1. Cell phone? Mine came free with a contract; I chose not to go with a smartphone because I have an iPod touch, and that already fulfills most of its functions.
2. TV? Nothing! My 34&quot; HDTV was a homewarming present from my mom when I moved into my new apartment.
3. Music player?  My second-gen iPod touch was... I don&#039;t remember, but it couldn&#039;t have been more than $250. I bought it way back in December 2009, still works great, haven&#039;t felt the need to upgrade it.
4. Computer/Laptop? Aye, the curse of Apple. $2000 for my Macbook back in 2008.
5. Video game/console?   Nothing! My Playstation 3 was a gift.
    **EXTRA CREDIT**What’s the OLDEST electronic you own? Oh gosh, this is embarrassingly not that old, but my Gameboy Advance from 2001.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Liz&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s crazy!! Jeez... I&#039;m sorry, that&#039;s just... umm... CRAZY! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;sandrac&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... at least you still have all that music in your head ;)  Nice and Free!
@&lt;b&gt;Nicci&lt;/b&gt; -  YES!  The Wizard! Man that was good... nice find :)
@&lt;b&gt;brooklyn money&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s pretty dope of your work to pay for the phone! Though it probably means you have to be on call 24/7 too, huh? Haha... I bet it&#039;s a Blackberry too?
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!!! I&#039;m glad you ended up getting that - I know you were thinking about it for a while, so yay! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I can&#039;t wait for that iPhone 5 to hit too! I&#039;m totally gonna upgrade then ;)  I&#039;ll have to make the crack in my phone just a BIT bigger so it&#039;ll force me not to see anything on it anymore, haha... cool to know you don&#039;t spend a lot though - well done!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Well I need to borrow you then on my next visit ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Rich Uncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - Ooh cool... yes, please let me know how it is!  I have a fine working laptop right now, but I&#039;d love to get a *bigger* one in the future (this screen is super wide but not that tall).  So def. keep me posted :)
@&lt;b&gt;Terry&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, $4 Grand?  That must be one kick ass computer!  I bet it&#039;s worth even more if you were to ever sell it considering you built it all from ground up.  Pretty impressive!
@&lt;b&gt;ImpulseSave&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! You&#039;re like the 3rd person on this post to say they just got a new computer :)  Hope it makes everything nicer for ya! (And faster!)
@&lt;b&gt;Rebekah&lt;/b&gt; - Visual effects will do that to ya ;)  I switched from a business major to multimedia design in college, and boy did my computer $$ go up!  Def. worth it though - at least in my opinion ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ubermich&lt;/b&gt; - Commodore!! Haven&#039;t heard that name in forever, wow.  Someone at that charity is gonna be really really lucky, nice one :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s okay, friend!  As long as YOU are happy with them and they get the job done, who cares how old or not they are :)  Fun to see what you own though!
@&lt;b&gt;C The Writer&lt;/b&gt; - Wow.  A computer for only $60? That&#039;s pretty good!
@&lt;b&gt;BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re #4 on these comments to have just gotten a new comp now, haha... it must be the season! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Young Investor&lt;/b&gt; - Nothing wrong with that my man :)  I&#039;ve cut down a lot of TV watchings since 5 years ago, but I must admit I still watch my portion every night to undwind... you&#039;re totally right though, there are plenty of other ways to do the same - and even cheaper :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff Crews&lt;/b&gt; - I know, I can&#039;t wait for the 5 either.  I just hope it&#039;s REALLY different enough for me to splurge for it, and not just smallish upgrades...
@&lt;b&gt;BrokeElizabeth&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, no TV?  You and the others who have mentioned that here are all super impressive... I&#039;d miss all my reality shows too much ;)
@&lt;b&gt;George&lt;/b&gt; - 3D!  COOL!  I have no idea what to even expect with that, and I&#039;m kinda waiting to find out just so I don&#039;t get tempted, haha... awesome that you went for it though :)  And love your blog name btw, haha, very clever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Cell phone – $100 - Google Nexus S. It allowed me to cut texting out of my plan and should pay for itself later this year.

2. TV – $1000 for a 50&quot; 3D Plasma. Came as a package deal with two sets of glasses, the last Call of Duty Game, and $50 worth of movies. 

3. Music player – iPod – $250 for the 80 GB one, almost four years ago. 

4. Laptop – $400 - Still works like a charm!

5. Video game consoles – My last two consoles were Christmas gifts, so I guess about $100 for the Playstation 2.

Oldest electronic…..probably my desktop, the thing&#039;s probably closing in on 7 years old.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Nothing... it&#039;s a dumb phone but it works well and I&#039;m trying to stay away from smart phones... I think I would get way too distracted. 
2. Nothing... I don&#039;t have one :)
3. iPod... around $200? I use it for hours a day, so it&#039;s definitely been worth it. When this one dies I might go for a different brand, though. 
4. I actually don&#039;t know... my dad bought mine for me. All I know is that it is a cheap but semi-reliable brand. 
5. Nothing... I don&#039;t play video games. I have 3 sisters, I think it would be kinda weird if I did ;). 
**EXTRA CREDIT** I have a pair of Sony studio headphones that I snitched from my dad because he wasn&#039;t using them very often. A quick Google search says they&#039;re from the early &#039;90s.]]></description>
