					<description><![CDATA[My rule is to never drive a better vehicle TO WORK than your boss.   Stealth wealth is key when you work for a large company.

Raises are subjective so it’s always better to be conservative.  This is especially important when you work for a very small company as the owner may feel you make enough money and will give you a small raise since you drive a fancier car/truck than them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Mother always said to make sure your shoes are shined. Also as a real estate agent I think it is important to look the part. If the company is not giving you their own logo polo shirts to wear than I believe you should be wearing a suit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A book I read in medical school changed my life. It is titled Dress for Success. It is no longer in print. I come from a working-class family and had no idea how to dress upper middle class like a physician. I refused to Wear Ties when they were de rigueur in medical school. This book outlines the scientific reasons why you should dress well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thankfully I need none of that for my current and hopefully finally profession. I always feel very silly in heels and make-up. The maximum contribution was increased this year for 401ks/457s so I’ll put my hair cut money there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoy shopping consignment &#038; thrift stores for bespoke and designer brands that I would not be able to afford full price retail.  I look for classic items that can span seasons and also unique items  (think scarves and necklaces) so that I don&#039;t look like every one else.  I am  frugal and this principal works for me.  I wear a white coat over my clothes, as I work in healthcare, so I just NEED to look neat and presentable, but I WANT to look classically stylish.  I replenish my wardrobe quite frequently and donate my gently used items back to independent thrift stores that help people get back on their feet. I do shop at higher end stores and may occasionally buy something but it helps me to keep up with fashion trends.  How the clothes help you feel is important.  I grew up wearing ill-fitting hand-me-downs.  I was never opposed to the second hand nature of the clothes, but if they don&#039;t fit well, the person doesn&#039;t look as presentable and the person knows it (usually).   Definitely dress the part you want to portray.  An attorney friend recently told me about an intern he did not hire in part because she didn&#039;t dress for the job- despite being told the dress code.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, as long as you have the funds to spend on the expensive clothes and if it makes you more confident especially in your professional life to earn the big bucks then go ahead and buy the Gucci suits and Tom Ford shoes.  Just don&#039;t go too crazy and make it a financial burden on yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great story - and I have a similar one.  

My husband did computer trouble shooting in the telecom industry.  After I married him, I suggested that we send his shirts to a shirt laundry - way back in the day when the cost was only 99 cents.  He reluctantly agreed.  His dress allowed him to stand out in his button down shirt compared to others who came in polos and tees.  Within a year he was promoted to management and continued to move upward in responsibility and pay.  Clothes do make a difference!  

I still have an ironing board and iron and use it frequently to look my best.  We buy quality clothes, but when they are out of season and on sale.]]></description>
