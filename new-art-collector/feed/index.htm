					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jessica W&lt;/b&gt; - They&#039;re killer deals, no doubt about it.
@&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks dude!  You&#039;re right - much better to prioritize your spending like that so you get the most out of it.  I&#039;ll see what I can do about the blogger den pics, it&#039;ll happen at some point ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, it&#039;s best to spend money on the things you love. Think of how many people have spent $290 on something they felt completely indifferent about. And to own something that makes you happy is something too many people overlook. Congratulations on your purchase... you should post pictures of your blogger den as your collection grows!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, hey - whatever works!  I used to be a big fan of art-deco too.  I still like some, but haven&#039;t gone the poster route much... I do like oldschool movie posters, but nothing yet that I really want to buy and put on the wall.  I agree frames are expensive!  Which is why the only art I have w/ frames is because they came with them! Haha...  I&#039;m not good w/ doing it myself and/or buying &#039;em.  Unless they come standard from Micheals with a 50% off coupon ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I collect art too--I got hooked on large-format art-deco posters in college when I house-sat for a friend of an artist. She gave me some posters as a thank-you. I&#039;ve got several by David Lance Goines and have purchased them from $10-$200, but the framing is the real %)#*%#... sometimes frames are upwards of $350. :-/    I try to pick up one poster per year. The downside is that the condo I own right now is one of those contemporary things with short little weird walls and funny angles. Almost all of my collection is wrapped in packing paper, hiding behind bookshelves waiting for a home with bigger walls so they can see the light of day.  I&#039;ve also purchased oil paintings in Africa, on my trips, as gifts for my husband. But I purchased them in Birr, and (deliberately) choose not to convert mentally to dollars. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hah!  I am :)  And heck yeah dude, that is awesome!  Funny enough I have two acoustics decorating my blogger den here too - but only cuz I don&#039;t know how to play them.  Figured I&#039;d teach myself if I bought them, but didn&#039;t go as planned ;)  Imagine that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Carolyn&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I agree!  I LOVE texture stuff - nice find! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jackie&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, I think you win for the most expensive piece bought so far :)  And good for you on paintint yourself!!  I&#039;ve done a few things myself over the years, but usually nothing bigger than a piece of paper just cuz of my attention span ;)  Though I did once make this cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ive-done-it-i-finally-finished-my-money/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;money painting&lt;/a&gt;! 
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Nice, maybe then you can get something from your friend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Barb Friedberg&lt;/b&gt; - Heck yeah there are!  I love street vendors too :)  OOH!  That reminds me, I guess I lied on my first piece of art -- I forgot I bought this one from my homeless friend once: &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/inspiration-from-my-homeless-friend/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pink Eye&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;Peliroo&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  I couldn&#039;t stop staring at Santa&#039;s face either - it&#039;s totally deep!  I think I&#039;d feel good knowing people connected with my art too if I made any :)  Would love to meet all my buyers in the same way.
@&lt;b&gt;Foxie&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  I like that idea of placing the original photo next to the commissioned piece - well done :)  Maybe one day I&#039;ll be able to visit in person to see it!  It&#039;s awesome to me that so much of your passions in life revolve around your cars.  They&#039;re like your kids, haha... thanks for sharing!
@&lt;b&gt;Alotta Lettuce&lt;/b&gt; - Well that works out nicely!  Esp for someone who doesn&#039;t &quot;get it.&quot; Well done! :)  I LOVE that idea of aquiring bits and pieces as you travel, I think I&#039;m gonna start doing the same myself now... a much better souvenir than the other crap I used to pick up, haha... good one!
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - I know, street vendors should DEF get paid more for sure... guess they gotta work themselves up and all that eh?  We all got paid crap in the beginning of our careers ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life &lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  Yeah, it really is the worst when you look back and just kick yourself for not picking things up - esp. one-of-a-kinds like art too.  I still get upset with myself for not picking up this awesomely painted dresser back a few years... it was only around $50 but for whatever reason I just didn&#039;t know if I really wanted it bad at the time.  The next day it *clicked* and I went back to get it and it was long gone :(  At least it probably went to someone else who&#039;s hopefully enjoying it now! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sue&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, well - as long as you like it and were happy w/ the price then, I say it&#039;s all good :)  You obviously thought it was worth it!  And artists - whether poor or not, or family or not - should still get paid either way.  I don&#039;t know all the details, but I don&#039;t think you got ripped off.  I&#039;m just glad you still like it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Paulette&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwwww, that is SO pretty!  Good call for sure, I love her style!! :)]]></description>
