					<description><![CDATA[The real problem is when students don&#039;t investigate the future consequences of that debt, or take into account the possible lack of job openings. Or when they take out the loan and forget their obligation to do as well as they possibly can and engage in every opportunity they can possibly find. A lot of people limit themselves to their options and then blame the economy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find it extremely ignorant and offensive that people so greatly generalized based on age. There are many good, well-informed reasons for taking out a 200,000 dollar debt. It&#039;s called taking a risk. The ability to take an intelligent risk is the only way to get ahead in the world. People who are going to sit back and settle for the safe option are the ones who are mooching off of all of the middle-class jobs, assuming that just because they got an average degree at an average college, that should mean they make an average living. That&#039;s not the way things work any more. If you see a rare or special opportunity for yourself at a college that happens to be 200,000 dollars, evading the situation to settle for less isn&#039;t going to get you any more of what you want in life. I&#039;m not saying the dept is necessary for everyone, but some people want and need to take that risk, and are aware of the consequences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m somewhat torn on this issue. First, I go to a very expensive private school (Hoya Saxa Georgetown University!) and do have student debt. However, I am paying for 3/4 years of it myself. (My parents said that they would pay for the first year of each of their children&#039;s education, and they paid most of my sister and brother&#039;s, which left really none for me.) However, I did the hard math and sat myself down and realized what I was getting myself into. I got a free ride to a state school, but picked GU because of the utility of where it was (DC for a language/international relations major is pretty much priceless), the level of education I&#039;d get, and of course, those words on my resume. I understand the want for a private school, so I can side with Kelli on that, but asking people for handouts...

That said, the numbers are terrifying, but you chip away at them. I work 18+ hours a week at my student work-study job, in addition to summers waitressing/bussing/tutoring, Also, GU has decent scholarships and financial aid in the form of Federal loans (better than Sallie Mae, which I only have 1 from, in my parents&#039; names.) 

Basically, 200k seems incredibly absurd for undergrad, but she just has to live the minimal life while she can. I&#039;m certainly not going to ask for handouts to help pay my debt but if she feels it necessary, then she can. I won&#039;t be donating but I won&#039;t stop others from doing it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@kelli I can&#039;t take all the credit, my mother helped me by forcing me to save half of all my paychecks while I worked in high school, if only I could save like that now :). Also, I wasn&#039;t the first to go to college, so I do understand your points. I definitely agree with your point about it not being easy to admit your are stupid. Although I think it is more ignorance of not knowing rather than general stupidity. I think even worse than the ignorance around the true cost of college is the ignorance around the true cost of retirement. 

I think finance remains a huge mystery to people for many reasons. Some people find it too difficult, the media definitely promotes living a glamorous lifestyle in the moment and constantly manipulates us into thinking that we need to spend and keep up with the joneses. Also, human beings instincts are not great for finance, it is tough for us to watch the wild gyrations of the market and ignore it to look 40 years down the road. In relation to my last point, for many reasons we suffer from myopia for example; the experiment where the subjects will choose one candy today vs. two tomorrow, but if you present it saying that you can have one candy in 100 days or two in 101 days the subject will choose to wait one more day. However on day number 100 they choose to have the candy today. We have become an instant gratification society. 

Kelli you are not passing the blame and that is admirable and you are working hard, I hope your story goes out to those who need to hear it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Tony in Iowa - Hi Tony! Thanks so much for your message. I will say, with the amount I&#039;m working, I am able to make my payments plus some; and my payments don&#039;t total $2300 (don&#039;t want anyone to get an inflated idea of the scenario). Either way, it&#039;s still well over $1000 per month and, now that I&#039;m on a temporary interest rate reduction program, all of my loans are now *variable*, so after this program... who knows what the rates will skyrocket to, and who knows how much that will increase my monthly payment.
Thanks again!!

@kyleinaz Agreed on all counts. I guess, basically, I&#039;m saying that I messed up. I don&#039;t place blame, I&#039;m just trying to fix it. On my own, I already look back and see the other choices I could/should have made.
Now I&#039;m just hoping the amount of money borrowed for college plateaus and stops growing so exponentially. It is evident that at this rate students are still borrowing like crazy when, in your words, &quot;you can still find some good bargains for colleges&quot; -- I want them to know that&#039;s true!! I want to force them to look 4 years into their future and see that paying these loans back will not be easy, no matter what they think/are told.
Maybe you&#039;ve made great decisions until this point -- congrats, if so, on such great foresight -- but I look back on being 18 and remember how clueless I was in so many ways. I think many can agree.
It&#039;s not easy to admit being stupid at 18 when you graduated in the top-ish of your class and went to COLLEGE which is supposed to signify intelligence.
We all know now that it&#039;s not necessarily the case.

@Natalie @ Mango - thanks for sharing Mango Money! I tweeted about it yesterday - what a great site!! So informative, and it looks awesome.

@Elle @ Odd Cents - Hi Elle! Thanks for sharing. I only needed a cosigner for 2 of my 11 private loans. The rest I was able to take out as much as I wanted, alone. Of course I only took out as much as needed (tuition + fees + housing/meal plan + books) but still a scary thought that a student is able to borrow virtually as much as they&#039;d like after they had a cosigner 1 time... at least was the case with me.


Thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@TonyinIowa I got thrown off by the first comment saying that it was Northwestern, as soon as I realized I wrote the wrong school I corrected it myself. Also, probably call it a midwest bias of being used to talking about Northwestern. 

@kelli my point with the mortgage was not so much the selection process, but more the fact that you can shop around for a bargain and go to a neighborhood in your price range, meaning you have control over how much you have to borrow. I completely understand that you probably did not see the economic collapse coming, very few people did. We graduated at about the same time, I remember reading articles about how fast incomes, etc were growing. Also I am not saying you aren&#039;t working hard or are not using your own money. You are working 60 hours a week and apparently throwing a lot of money at the student loan debt. I agree that there are definitely aspects of the system that are broken, but if you do dig around and research you can still find some good bargains for colleges.

For some possible ways to prevent this from happening would be for high schools to do a lot better job on going over financial aid, i.e. breaking down a loan amortization schedule vs. the expected salaries for certain professions, or extra assistance to the first college generation students.  

however, the onus of the responsibility should fall on the individual to do right by themselves and get educated. for example, upon reading the same articles others on this blog have read I noticed that college tuition is increasing by enormous amounts. I did some basic present value calculations and concluded it would be wise to set up a 529 plan in my name for my future children, I am not engaged nor expecting to have children for at least 3 years, which means the money I put in has quite a while to compound and grow. Most of my coworkers and friends have scoffed at the notion, but I am saving now to have to save less later.]]></description>
