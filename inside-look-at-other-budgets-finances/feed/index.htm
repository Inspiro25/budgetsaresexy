					<description><![CDATA[This is my first time commenting, though I read your blog all the time! I truly love the idea of this series! Its nice to read about your financial savy skills, but its also nice to see how others handle  their money, and to hear your thoughts on their financial skills.

Though I&#039;m only 20, and dont even really have a real income yet, I find these break downs to be fascinating. I hope reading and learning all these things from your blog will stick with me in the future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love that bro, sounds like you&#039;ve got a great plan going on. I&#039;m huge into the emotional side of things too, which is why I keep pummeling away on my mortgages.  It&#039;s gonna feel SOOOO FREEEE when those things are out of my life!  Much rather have that feeling than 3% more saved up in my investments or something ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Emotional: I really hate having so much debt! I want it gone and out of my life and stop anchoring me down!
2. ROI: If you&#039;re loans are 6.7% int rate, how well are you doing in the markets/401k?  If you&#039;re positive you can make a more than 6.7% return on money invested in the market or matches in your 401k, then it makes more fiscal sense to keep investing the money rather than throwing additional into the loans.

What I did: I picked an age.  I don&#039;t want any more loans of ANYTHING that&#039;s not giving me a positive cash flow after I am thirty five.  For me, it was realistic and timely, so I structured all of my loans, car and student loans, to b paid off by that date.  This helps me plan my future investment contributions too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff guys :)

@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - We&#039;ll have some here that doesn&#039;t even come close to that amount of monthly income, believe me ;)  I plan on posting up all kinds of ranges and situations over time, so some people may be able to relate to, and others not, but hopefully at least we all glean something from &#039;em all.
@&lt;b&gt;B Simple&lt;/b&gt; - Good one!  We REALLY REALLY need one too as we have zilch right now and just dread getting started :(  But with our new baby now here it&#039;s much more important we get this knocked out.. thanks for the reminder to everyone!
@&lt;b&gt;Elisa&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s an interesting idea actually :)  Maybe do recaps on everyone 12 months later? Hmm... I kinda like it. A lot.
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyGeek&lt;/b&gt; - Feel free to send over YOUR details too at any time if you want ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Romeo&lt;/b&gt; - Great comment my man, we do tend to go batty over big numbers like that but you&#039;re right - if the $hit hits the fan you&#039;d much rather have $100k in savings/investments than zero debt which you can&#039;t pull any money out of... thanks for stopping in!  And glad you like the series - we&#039;ll def. be continuing it :)  See you at FINCON again? Hope so bro.
@&lt;b&gt;Allison&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s what I&#039;m scared of! Right now it&#039;s easy to watch him here and there while he sleeps, but once he&#039;s going all over the place there&#039;s no way I can do work at the same time :(  But I realllllllllly don&#039;t want to pay $2,000+ for childcare a month either, bleh.  It&#039;s gonna be a tough choice when that day comes, that&#039;s for sure... we&#039;re def. starting to plan now for it - whichever way we end up leaning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, great series. Well, great start to a great future series. 

I don&#039;t know what all the fuss on the student loans are about. In THIS situation, the student loan wouldn&#039;t be my biggest concern. $100,000 going into investments or continuing to build savings would be my priority. It appears that there is no financial stress whatsoever in keeping the loan around at this point. But, there would be a big concern if after paying $80,000 of this debt he were to get laid off.  

The thing that the couple has going for them is the time value of money. Why rush to pay $100,000 down just to yield, what, $800 more per month? The interest is fixed...I hope. So with time, the loans will go away...eventually, and when the couple is ready.]]></description>
