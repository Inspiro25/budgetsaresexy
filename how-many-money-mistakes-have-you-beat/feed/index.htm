					<description><![CDATA[So glad the post on ATWS inspired this post and the big ol&#039; conversation! :) I swear it seems like we&#039;ve all made crap loads of money mistakes, huh. To be able to learn from them is so huge to financial success. I think too that sometimes mistakes are needed to help cement them into our brains so we don&#039;t make them again. I know I never want to get myself back into debt again bc getting out of it was such a massive undertaking! You better believe I don&#039;t look at coffee, clothes, and material things in general in the same way after having to dig out of those decisions. 

Great post as usual Jay!
p.s. you had me cracking up when you said your sis reads ATWS more than BAS. omg... too funny;)]]></description>

Yeah, that&#039;s a toughie. Back when I was going overboard with this I did my best to just *not* go into any stores or those online shops (*ahem* Amazon) and that helped out immensely. I couldn&#039;t spend if I wasn&#039;t in a store :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The scores are separate from the reports unfortunately. If you get the free reports at AnnualCreditReport.com, you basically have to pay the $6 or $8 or whatever at the end to actually get your score. Which sucks, but it&#039;s def. cheaper/easier than going to other places at least when I try it. Or you can get a free score at CreditSesame.com but it&#039;s not the &quot;official&quot; one that most people look for. Just depends on what you&#039;re going for.]]></description>
