Index funds were like the recovery wing of gambler&#039;s anonymous for me! I owe a lot to the abundance of those index fund infographics lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was so worried that you were going to commit financial infidelity for a moment there! Anyway, I&#039;m pretty sure we all make an expensive mistake like this. Some of us made two. Ahem. Then along comes a really solid, trustworthy infographic about index funds, so you lick your wounds and hop back in :)]]></description>

It was great education! Not fun, but it taught me a lot about my propensity for those delusions of grandeur you mentioned.

If my story can save just one person from a seedy motel seminar, my work here is complete :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved your post. It was a really fun read, and so relatable. It is silly how much we let future hopes and delusions of grandeur dictate our present behavior and override our &quot;common sense&quot;. It sounds like you got a good education in life. Next time I find myself at a seminar at a seedy motel, I will think of you and leave ;)]]></description>

That&#039;s a great philosophy -- and really cuts out all the noise of &quot;shiny object syndrome&quot;. I&#039;m slowly maturing into that philosophy as well!

And thank God for prudent wives -- she&#039;s saved me from more heartache than I know!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Kalen, It is eerily reminiscent of my life.  I also have the prudent wife, whose happy with the simple life, while I have to be the one to complicate things.  Though in my older age (51) I &#039;ve been more content, and better able to recognize the value simplicity...  If I can&#039;t invest in something &#039;passively&#039; for 5 years or more, I&#039;m not interested, that&#039;s kinda my philosophy these days!]]></description>

Totally agree -- humility is everything in the stock market! Knuckleheads like me have to learn the hard way :)

And yes a supportive spouse made ALL the difference, for sure. 100%]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think everyone needs to learn from that first bad experience and get humbled a bit before they&#039;ll have any chance of future success. For me, it was $500 on penny stocks! Though I still jumped in after meme stocks this last go round haha. Lucky for you to have a supportive partner along for the ride!]]></description>
