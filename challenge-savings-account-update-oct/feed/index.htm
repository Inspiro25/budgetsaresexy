Ughhhh we just got a notice saying we have to leave our insurance and go to Obamacare.... Haven&#039;t looked into it yet cuz it makes me want to punch myself in the face, but we will be soon. It ends at the end of the year I believe. I&#039;ll be blogging about it once I figure it out.]]></description>

Good job! That savings account is going to grow like crazy too, especially if you don&#039;t touch it for a long time - the 2nd half of the equation :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Verizon...shaking my head. I haggled my bill down some time ago and it crept back up. I couldn&#039;t understand what those chargers were and was told &quot;government surcharges and fees.&quot; The lady on the other line couldn&#039;t explain how my bill was reduced but the fees (which apparently you can&#039;t negotiate) has increased incrementally too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just realized I forgot to send you my numbers. We are at $431.33, not as good as last month but that&#039;s because the childcare savings we had last month was used on actual childcare this month. Kids, those pesky net worth drainers. :-) We are thinking about joining the Craigslist challenge, though, to beef up this account more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the progress....I&#039;m with ya on Verizon....it&#039;s a constant battle. Couple of things...TRASH ...Private pay here and it ain&#039;t cheap. We opted for no service and made a concerted effort to recycle because it&#039;s free. I seperate &quot;burnables&quot; to be used in the wood stove for heat, food scraps are placed in the compost bin, metal &#038; aluminum are saved and cashed in for $ . One trash can full of metal cans = about $5... To this end we have about a plastic grocery bag of trash every 2 weeks which I deposit at the Aldi trash can when I shop. My BIG question is have you made moves to take on your health insurance coverage and reduce costs? Just got my renewal notice WITH a 13% increase in our premium...What the #@&#038;*##!!! Any ideas...?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like the idea of your challenge and how you&#039;ve been able to save so much! This motivates me to get some stuff out of my garage and on Craigslist! Also, I cut cable a few months ago since I was going back to school and although I borrow my boyfriends Xfinity login here and there, I don&#039;t miss it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this post!  This past week was the first time we cashed in our change jar and deposited the money ($61) into a separate savings account instead of just taking the money and spending it!  It felt so great.  We even decided all of the money that would go in there from now on ~ change jar money, scrap metal money, craig&#039;s list money ...  little extra cash finds like that.  You&#039;re so right.  We may wish that we&#039;d started doing this ages ago, but looking back just trips you up.  And you&#039;re so right that saving a couple of dollars on this or that isn&#039;t a savings if you just end up spending it elsewhere.  Seriously, super post!  Love it!   :)]]></description>

That&#039;s a good idea.... I know a lot of people do it with silver and gold things, especially with coins (I&#039;m a collector so I love this stuff!), but I know other metals can fetch some $$ too... unfortunately/fortunately I don&#039;t have a lot of random metal stuff lying around haha..]]></description>
