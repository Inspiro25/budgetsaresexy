					<description><![CDATA[Ohmigod. I would have flipped my lid!!!! Accidents happen, but A. put down your freaking phone and B. tell me it happened!!!

The husband does the super Daddy thing year round and he loves it. Also, it drives him insane for adult conversation. Haha there&#039;s a fine balance between the two when you&#039;re hanging out with little ones all day.

I hope you guys have a great time! Rehoboth is so beautiful. And enjoy the new posting schedule, too! Slowing down can be such a great thing--like pushing the reset button.]]></description>

ET is a good hype man...I like his stuff.  I just think it a natural progression of human life to change courses every decade or so.  The issue is painting yourself into a corner financially where you need a certain income level.  Typically, a change in career means a lower initial pay.  That is not always an option.

In my opinion though, grinding is bad advice.  Knowledge is what will get you there.  The highest paid people are paid for what they know, not how many widgets they produce.  Anyone can work hard there is no value in that after a certain point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You must have been so worried to find that bruise. Eek! 

Slowing down for summers to actually enjoy them with your family is an excellent life choice. I hope the beach treats you well!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So very glad that the injury wasn&#039;t far worse :( 

Happy Fourth! 

We just did a mini version of a week off ... I guess that&#039;s actually called a long weekend isn&#039;t it? Spent most of it with the extended family: 11 kids, 5 parents, 2 grandparents. We were outnumbered!! Then a full pool / BBQ day with another enormous crowd of friends and their kids, complete with sunburn. I&#039;m honestly not sure if we could take this much fun all day everyday but I&#039;m working toward it anyway. ;)]]></description>
