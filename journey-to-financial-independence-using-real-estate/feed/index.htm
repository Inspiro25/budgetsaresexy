Thank you, Anya! It&#039;s an honor to have it read twice (and aloud!). My wife and I used to read books aloud together. I think we need to start back! 

I noticed your yoga website. My wife and I actually met in a yoga class and still practice. We love it. 

Best of luck with your RE and life journey!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chad,
I can&#039;t say enough positive things about your balanced approach to real estate, family, and life. I have had the opportunity to go to a lot of real estate educational events and the typical mantra is, a bigger business is a better business. While you have certainly built a very impressive portfolio/business, I am even more impressed with the way you have done while keeping a priority hierarchy that is very admirable. Thanks as always for inspiring us!

Best Regards, 
Sean McKay]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Chad, Great article, you did a great job capturing the ups and downs of investing.  Most importantly, you keep the whole reason that we are investing into perspective.  The reason is not for more expensive cars or wardrobe, but more enriching life experiences and quality time with friends and loved ones.  You do such a good job of expressing, and more importantly living, this message.  Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chad, thank you for sharing your story. I was so inspired that I just read it again, this time aloud, to my husband. We, too, share the travel bug and believe in the importance of living life fully now, rather than just working for &quot;someday.&quot; We&#039;re in our 50s and just starting out on our RE journey, and look forward to following your blog and continuing to learn from your experience. Have a great time in Ecuador!]]></description>
