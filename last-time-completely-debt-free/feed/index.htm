					<description><![CDATA[Yes, we are currently debt free and it feels awesome.  Sold our house last summer and paid off our last remaining student loans.  No mortgage, car loans, student loans or credit card debt.  Now it&#039;s just finding away to get my monthly income to a point where I can quit my job!]]></description>

HAH - really?? 

That is too funny...  I wonder how common it is or not and if they&#039;re just ignoring us the whole time ;) A reader of this blog works there and said they&#039;d put in a message to whichever team manages it, but I&#039;m certainly not holding my breath, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being debt free is awesome. Congratulations. We have been for some years now. My favorite moment was when we built our custom home and the construction was finished, I went in to pay the final construction loan installment and our account manager said &quot;we&#039;ll have to get started setting you up with your permanent mortgage financing....&quot; I replied, no thank, we won&#039;t be needing a mortgage. We&#039;re paying cash.&quot; His jaw early dropped to the floor. But my bank was very nice and supportive, I imagine since we have lots of money in it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations! That’s amazing! My theory is banks don’t want to encourage debt freedom, which is why it probably won’t be an option anytime soon. After all consumer debt is what they live off of. Haha. I’ll be debt free this month from all consumer debt, with only the mortgage left and then I’ll be attacking that to get it paid off in about 5 years.]]></description>
