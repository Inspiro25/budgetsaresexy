BOOM! That&#039;s where it&#039;s at right there - well done!

I wish all the comments saved from this post back in the day when it was first published (we moved blogging platforms and they got killed), but it was fun to debate on it all :) Cash is rarely ever denied unlike cards and anything electronic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An emergency requiring cash reserves did happen to us one year.  We live in Florida, and it was when a hurricane hit and knocked out power for almost a week.  We were using a portable generator, but of course needed to buy more gas.  There was one small independent grocer open, and one gas station open.  Both were running on generator power-traffic lights were even being operated on generator power! and both were accepting cash only.  I always keep a reserve of cash in small bills at home for just such an emergency.]]></description>
