oh man, you&#039;re bringing back the memories!!!

you or your spouse should switch and work for the government - their plans are amazing! lol... as soon as my wife got a job there the premiums took a nosedive and having babies cost pennies on the dollar. It&#039;s amazing.

but yes, without good insurance it&#039;s a night mare. and even good insurance doesn&#039;t always last :(

hang in there... sending over good vibes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad to be in good company. We are currently navigating the health insurance system in preparation for pregnancy and I want to scream. I&#039;m finally making decent money, but the extra money we&#039;re making is getting eat up by the monthly premiums ($775!) + out of pocket costs since insurance apparently doesn&#039;t cover much until we meet our $7k deductible. 

Thanks for sharing your experience. Even ten years later, this post hits home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good one, thx!  And sometimes even COBRA is too high if your old employer was giving you a great plan :)  My old one would have cost me $800/mo just for myself, so I&#039;d have to go on my own anyways, but you&#039;re right - usually it&#039;s a good thing to consider, even if just temporarily until you find a better one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One good piece of advice is that if you&#039;re self-employed and have recently left a job, stay on your previous employer&#039;s COBRA plan. It&#039;ll save a pretty good chunk of change. Doing your homework and making sure you&#039;ve sufficiently evaluated your options are keys to making sure you get the best health insurance coverage as a self-employed person.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Hmm... yeah, def. tough without much income coming in.. are you at least saving some on the side just in case an emergency comes up? Even if it was only $100/mo? That will help you feel better a bit.
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... yes, there&#039;s always that!  Don&#039;t forget about your new friendly mini-scars too - they&#039;re always the life of a party :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I now pay $512 a month for just me. But as you know, illness can strike without warning. So can the front bumper of a texting driver as you head across the street.
Witness my gall-bladder surgery a few months back. No symptoms, suddenly a lot of pain, and a couple of weeks later I&#039;m having an organ removed. If it weren&#039;t for insurance I&#039;d have been agreeing to a payment plan for a boatload o&#039; bucks. 
Not that I was nuts about paying just under $2,000 for my share, mind you. But it beat the hell of the alternative. At least they let me keep those bitchin&#039; slipper socks. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally, I&#039;m always worrying, stressing, freaking out that something is going to happen. Last time I checked though, it would costs us about $400 for the crappiest plan they had. For a decent one, it was around $700+ a month. 

There are a couple of things we could cut from the budget, but that would only give us around $250/mo. We don&#039;t really spend any money on entertainment or buying stuff, so it&#039;s pretty strict already.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Just realized my new payments are probably equal to others&#039; mortgages? Pretty crazy...

@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Man, you&#039;re right on that.  Nothing we can do about it cuz we need it 100%!  Sorry to hear about your brother, that&#039;s sad :( On both accounts.
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I hope it all goes in your favor! Baby stuff thows it all for a loope, jeesh :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mike@money-mouse&lt;/b&gt; - Okay, yeah that&#039;s what I thought was the case over there - thanks for sharing :) I think it&#039;s absolutely fantastic that everyone is covered there rich and poor.
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - I know, I don&#039;t understand it either. I think us Americans just like to complain a lot ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you approve ;)
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Yes, most def. take advantage of it and keep yourself nice and healthy :)  I&#039;m glad to hear it!
@&lt;b&gt;Mr. Everyday Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! That&#039;s not a bad deal at all.
@&lt;b&gt;My Money Design&lt;/b&gt; - I know :( I feel like it&#039;s getting scarier and scarier as the years go by... politics get in the way of so much these days.
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger @ Girls Just Wanna Have Funds&lt;/b&gt; - Well the Mrs. still has maternity coverage on her plan, it just wouldn&#039;t be covered if she joined mine without shelling out more money.  So we&#039;ll have to see what plan makes the most sense once it&#039;s time for us to start making more babies again :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - You don&#039;t have insurance? Aren&#039;t you worried/stressed in case something crazy happened?  It freaks me out too much :( I hope you both remain safe until that time too! Don&#039;t go skydiving or anything! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that is nice actually.  A small plus to it all :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, really? I wonder if ours will drop too then, even if we don&#039;t have an HSA? Hmmm... that would be something awesome to look forward to!
@&lt;b&gt;Kira&lt;/b&gt; - For sure, I know it&#039;s not FREE in the grand scheme of things, but it gets the point across as people don&#039;t pay directly for their insurance in other countries - even if they pay more in other areas/etc.  Didn&#039;t mean to offend you though, so I am sorry if I did.
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - I never researched health insurance for kids until after he was born cuz I knew I didn&#039;t have a choice anyways - he needs it :)  Now I could certainly research around more and compare other company&#039;s plans and offerings, but honestly it&#039;s too much work to save a few dollars right now.  I&#039;ve got my hands full with everything else now plus the new baby, so I just called them up and locked it in hoping they wouldn&#039;t slam me. And unfortunately they did :(  I&#039;ll consider switching by this time next year and see where we&#039;re at... maybe the wife will have a killer job and benefits by then?
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man, appreciate the kind words :) Stop by any time!
@&lt;b&gt;ckphoto&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhh, GREAT POINT!  And way to go w/ cutting back too like that, I don&#039;t have the balls for that yet ;) Having a higher deductible and % paid scares me too much at this point, even though I know it would save me hunreds of dollars each month too.  Ask me in about 6 months though when I&#039;ve paid half of what you have all year and we&#039;ll see if I&#039;m singing the same tune, haha... thanks again for the reminder, my  man.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, that sucks man I&#039;m sorry :(  Hopefully one day we&#039;ll be making enough where it doesn&#039;t even matter! :)
@&lt;b&gt;DC @ Young Adult Money&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes! So glad y&#039;all had some then - that could have been crazy!!
@&lt;b&gt;Wojo&lt;/b&gt; - Hmm... I&#039;m thinking that maybe I need to re-think this in the near future and see what the fuss is about on these HSA plans... it never really crossed my mind even though I know people love them, but it may make more sense once we&#039;re out of this more scarier time frame with babies when they&#039;re so fragile :)  Thanks for stopping by, bud - see you at FINCON I hope?]]></description>
