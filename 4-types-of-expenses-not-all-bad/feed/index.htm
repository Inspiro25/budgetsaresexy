					<description><![CDATA[I know what you mean about the physical books. Sometimes I think I might be addicted to reading. :) I haven&#039;t purchased a full priced book in a long time though. Between the public library, the free library, and some used book stores, I&#039;m set. However, as far as industries that I like to support, the local, independent bookstore would be at the top. :)

Have you read &quot;Living with a Seal&quot;? I HIGHLY recommend it. It is a truly laugh out loud read, and it is a quick read. I almost finished it in one day. Also, it combines thoughts on minimalism, productivity, entrepreneurship, health &#038; fitness, etc... The author is a multi-millionaire who runs ultras, but feels in a rut, so he hires a Navy Seal for a month. The author&#039;s wife is the woman who started Spanx (now on Shark Tank part time). I think you would really enjoy it. 

Also, since you like the &#039;zero waste&#039; movement, you may also like the book &quot;Plastic: A Toxic Love Story&quot;. 

Enjoy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I play golf 3x/week, my wife thought it falls under destructive expenses. I always thought it was more lifestyle and productive. I think it can only be classified as destructive when someone purchases those expensive golf clubs every time a new one is out. And I do not do that! Love this post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For people in too much debt (and that&#039;s most people), I see room for a few tweaks: #1 Lifestyle expenses - Cutting out even good quality visits with friends where it involves spending $ is a tough but really effective move. #2 Protective expenses - One of the reasons the wealthy are wealthy is that they do prioritize this. Those of us who aren&#039;t as wealthy would be wise to follow their lead. #3 Productive expenses - In  the balance between paying off debt (even what might be called &quot;good debt&quot;) and investing, debt repayment needs more emphasis in our society. #4 Destructive expenses - no tweaking necessary:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like seeing expenses broken down this way. I too believe that the only &quot;bad&quot; expenses are the destructive ones. I also agree with some of the comments that living expenses and protective expenses CAN be bad (but I also believe we shouldn&#039;t really be scared of them either!)]]></description>
