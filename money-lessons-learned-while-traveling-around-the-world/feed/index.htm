					<description><![CDATA[Simply beautiful.  Because it&#039;s beautifully simple!  I&#039;ve at times felt my most happy when what we had was &quot;just enough&quot;.  And I agree, travel can open your eyes and show you a clearer perspective that we all need at times.  I just returned from 2 weeks in Italy....Taking time to enjoy a meal (hours!), talking, laughing, people watching.  Seeing older men sit around together in the morning &quot;solving the world&#039;s problems&quot;, ladies and men shopping together for the dinner that would be that night...fresh fruit and vegetables, saying Ciao to people (strangers), a nod, a smile.  So beautiful. Sitting in the square and just enjoying a cappuccino, restaurant staff not rushing you away.  Shops with closed signs on the door (taking their lunch breaks...nice and long!), and how the people are genuine and want to see you enjoying yourself, and are proud to show you their town/city!  I told myself to hold onto this, these feelings of joy and contentment that seemed to be everywhere!  To take a piece of it with me.  And I think I&#039;ll work just &quot;enough&quot; to save for my next trip!  I am so much more fulfilled with experiences than things.  

Thank you for a well-done and timely post!]]></description>

I&#039;ll cheers to that, Liz!  There has to be a mutually beneficial relationship between employers and employees.

My &lt;a href=&quot;https://5amjoel.com/work-life-balance/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;thoughts on work/life balance&lt;/a&gt; have changed over the years. I have no problem working 60 hours some weeks (as long as I enjoy what I&#039;m doing!) To balance this though, I take a healthy amount of personal time some weeks too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My coworker and I started this new job a week apart coming from 2 different sites of a larger company. The culture of overwork was pervasive. One day she suggested she&#039;d take her laptop home and work on a document while she ate dinner. I suggested let&#039;s not start bad habits. Let&#039;s set the habit here that our 8 hours is enough.  We shall see!
I know expecting to only work 40 hours in a salary job is silly, these days. But why? I&#039;m not on my feet for the time, like a service job,  for sure. In my past role I could feel my decision making decline near the end of a long week. I told someone on a Thursday night they didn&#039;t want me to answer then and we&#039;d talk Friday morning after I&#039;d had my coffee.
I like that the conversation of a &#039;4 day week&#039; had come up, but I think the corporate world need to reset from 50 &#038; 60 hours to 40 before anyone could fathom the change. The study from Europe wasn&#039;t fully 4 x 8 hour days, but often 5 days at 6 or 7 hours. When we are pressured to do 9, 10 hours +... even doing an 8 feels weird. 
Here&#039;s to embracing &#039;enough&#039; working hours, so we have enough / abundant leisure hours to enjoy time with friends, family, pets, books, nature etc.]]></description>

Happiness is in the eye of the *beer*holder.  :)

Love that you are content with less. It&#039;s a wonderful skill to have!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Timely for me. So many people I know are close to or at traditional retirement age and I keep hearing the same refrain &quot;I can&#039;t retire yet.&quot; Almost all of these people are older than me, appear to have more financially than me, and yet, I feel like I could retire whenever I want - I&#039;d just have to make a few changes here and there to make it work.  I don&#039;t think I am delusional  (of course, I could be!), I just want less. Perfectly happy with my thrift store wardrobe, inexpensive hobbies, and low key vacations. I so appreciate this post for pointing out that happiness is in the eye of the beholder.]]></description>
