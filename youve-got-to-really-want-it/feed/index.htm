					<description><![CDATA[I find it slightly ironic that, though it&#039;s not related to personal finance, I REALLY REALLY REALLY need to finish this paper but instead I get sidetracked and read a post on your blog about &quot;you&#039;ve got to really want it!&quot;

I want a good grade, but I guess I don&#039;t want it bad enough haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J Money...How about you pass the collection plate so I can put my offering in there :D

Your note is just so own point! Personal finance really doesn&#039;t have to be this scary thing. And when you REALLY want something, you do whatever you can to get it done. So glad that I stumbled upon your blog at the end of last year/early this year.  Granted we&#039;re just entering in the 5th month of the year, but it&#039;s full speed ahead.  And truth be told, I&#039;m like, how whack was it that we (hubby and I) didn&#039;t do this before.  That&#039;s okay though - you live and you learn.  And now that we&#039;ve learned, we&#039;re not going back.  Those spreadsheets say it all.  Getting a little tempted to &quot;divert&quot; from the budget cause &quot;you&#039;ve just being doing so well&quot;....Just open up that spreadsheet again and see the progress you made since January...Works like a charm for me everytime :-D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant post J. You can write goals all you want (and you should too) but actually living with them day in day out is key.

My main new years resolution was starting a blog. Developed it in January, Launching February and while it&#039;s early days it&#039;s going well. But I know why: because I WANT IT.

The days go by so fast that everyone only really has time for so many things. You have to want something if you&#039;re going to squeeze it into your life. 
Keep rocking it dude.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Getting anything done is a total unpredictable process.  Whether its personal finance or avoiding getting voted off on a reality show, you have to stay on top of your priorities and agile enough to react appropriately in your environment.  You could be going great with your budget and then WHAM! some old lady (w/o car insurance) rear ends you... Now what?  Good example? Prob a bad one. But regardless... many times we want something so bad and then  Life throws us a very large impediment that slows us down... or many times... forces us to lose sight of our goal.  

Dont slow down. Drink a red bull and run right over whatevers in your way!  (I obviously am letting out my frustration of being at work at 539PM.. i am trying to run over my P.M. who is in my way of finishing this project!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think wanting it is only part of the equation. Or rather, it is a necessary first step, but it is not sufficient. As you said, you still need to find the energy to put the required effort behind what you really want. And then there is also the unknown. Stuff happens. Setbacks happen. They are often beyond our control. Unfortunately a sequence of setbacks can wear somebody down to the point of even giving up on the want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is why they created on-line banking (not really but it&#039;s what motivates me).  When I log in I see it- my graduate school loan.  And it is a constant reminder that I hate my loan more than I love DVDs, a flat screen television or a car with a trunk that unlocks from the outside!    And so I scrape together my nickels and dimes to throw them at my loan, until one day I will have pelted it with so much money, it will go away.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Brandi about the motivating kick in the butt :)!  I totally needed this today.  Every summer my friends and I hit the summer concert circuit.  After reading your post, I made the decision that while it would be nice to hit a few of the concerts, I&#039;d rather save up my itty bitty blow money for a couple months to be able to participate in a girls weekend coming up in July.  This keeps me on budget, and I won&#039;t spend money NOW that&#039;s not budgeted for.  Instead, I&#039;ll put aside a portion of my blow money over the next three months to enjoy time with them later.  I REALLY want to be debt free, so I&#039;m making it my PRIORITY.  Thanks for the kick!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[its a funny thing that every thing whether good or bad starts in the mind. i think that is why there is such hullabaloo about having good constructive thoughts all the time. even commitment starts in the mind and is then translated into actions.]]></description>
