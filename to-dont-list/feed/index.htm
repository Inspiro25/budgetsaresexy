					<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that listing things you should not do sounds more easy to achieve than things you have to do.
Some examples

Don’t ignore my kids --&#062; Always have fun with the kids --&#062; makes you think: what is next I can do to please them. The Truth is: sometimes they need their own &quot;me time&quot; (like my kids now: i can then read some blogs)

Don’t stare at a screen every 5 seconds --&#062; This might be an exception, especially in the current volatile markets. It sounds easier to say: Look at the end of the month to update your net worth

					<description><![CDATA[Just stumbled upon this, and it completely relates to an article I&#039;m about to post about my New Year&#039;s resolutions.  I tend to play it on the safe side, and where&#039;s the fun in that?  So, my goal this New Year is to DON&#039;T be afraid - to fail, of rejection, of the unknown.  I&#039;m looking forward to the challenge!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Balance the &quot;To Don&#039;t&quot; list with the &quot;To Do&quot; list, then it becomes positive reinforcement for overall personal growth rather than a permissions/limitations issue.  At least that is true for me.]]></description>

hah - love it! I actually started doing that in my daily journal inadvertently. I used to jot the few things I needed to get done that day in it, but after a while it got boring (and especially to go back and read later!) so I changed it to all the awesome stuff that happened the day before :) Now I get excited to write in it again as it&#039;s more of a diary than a huge to-do list (and most things I already know I have to get done so it&#039;s not too bad of a loss of reminder)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to admit that I have never completed a To-Do or To-Don&#039;t list!  I learned several years ago that instead of creating a To-Do list at the beginning of the day/week and then feeling down when there are things that you did not complete it is much better for me to complete a To-Done list at the end of the day/week showing all that you accomplished.

Just some food for thought (and it doesn&#039;t go against your allotted daily calories which is oh so important during the holidays).

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!]]></description>
