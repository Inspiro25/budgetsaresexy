					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/do-you-use-your-college-degree/#comment-181186&quot;&gt;Andrew&lt;/a&gt;.

Ecology and evolution - interesting! I don&#039;t know anything about what type of jobs there are on that stuff/etc, but I feel like if you&#039;re not that excited about it it&#039;s probably not worth getting another degree in it. I&#039;d probably steer towards the culinary stuff, but a lot easier for me to say looking in from the outside. You of course need money to survive so in either case I&#039;d get a job (probably in biology stuff) while you pursue your passions on the side until you can fully switch over. And fortunately with cooking it&#039;s not like you need a degree to at least start testing stuff out and learning! Youtube is brilliant for that stuff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i dont use my degree. i got  a B.S. in biology with emphasis on ecology and evolution. i thought thats what i wanted to learn but as the years in college went on, i liked it less and less. cooking has always been my interest, i like creating. im planning on getting a culinary degree and see where that takes me but sometimes i feel like i didnt give my degree a shot and i wonder if maybe i should go back to school in my degree....what i would do for masters in biology, i dont know but these kinds of things weigh on me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[yup!  well said, my friend.  interesting too that you all get paid the same regardless of the degree or not - in my experience it hasn&#039;t really been that way, even though it does make sense for a particular task (aka if the job gets done well, why does it matter if one person has a degree and the other doesn&#039;t? the outcome is still the same).  Overall though I&#039;m a huge fan of getting a degree - for most reasons I&#039;ve already stated above.  But if you can rock it without one, then more power to you. Lots of ways to succeed in this life :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the pieces of paper helped get me into the chosen field, but I work with many people who do the same work without any college education (one person dropped out of high school;) my knowledge base is larger, and people come to me for answers, but we do the same work, get paid the same salary, yet they did not have college loans to pay off, and they are getting some of their education from me.  It has actually created a debate on what is more important...a college education or work experience; people with only experience do not understand that school is the experience of thousands of hours of thousands of people, and I do not need personal experience when I already understand the what, when, how, and why.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t use my college degree. When I went to college I didn&#039;t know what I wanted to do. But with that said, I think having a college degree opens up a lot of doors even if you don&#039;t work in your field of major. I also think it&#039;s sort of a step into life. I don&#039;t know how to explain it but I feel like if I learned a lot (not just academically) from going to college and I would say it&#039;s worth it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think a lot of people end up getting a career outside their major, but you definitely need a degree. For many jobs it&#039;s a requirement for the job. I had one friend who called a degree a $40,000 foot in the door... could be the case :S]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;D*Rockafeller&lt;/b&gt; - Good luck!!! If you get it, you&#039;ll have to give me a shout and I&#039;ll buy you a congratulatory lunch ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Glad you&#039;re happy with the way everything&#039;s been working out so far :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jimmy Juber&lt;/b&gt; - VERY interesting, I hadn&#039;t heard of that...I know we didn&#039;t get a follow up survey!  Love filling those things out.
@&lt;b&gt;Nate Hall&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly!  It helps keep you at least in the running for jobs just by having that degree.  Esp in this economy when everyone&#039;s fighting over them!
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - That is hot!  That you went back after all those years - good for you.  That makes me smile :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward - Entry Level Dilemma&lt;/b&gt; - Well now that your writing has blossomed and been featured on the best blog ever (*ahem*) you may have a new career on your hands ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Erica&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Good one.  I like that :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve received 2 college diplomas and 1 university degree and I can happily say I am working in my field and use both my college diploma as well as my university degree. College got me the job, university got me the pay raise :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since I&#039;m unemployed at the moment, the answer is no, I&#039;m not using my degree.  But aside from that, I&#039;m in a similar position as Heather, although I was only out of school for 5 years before returning.  My B.S. is in Physics with a concentration in Earth Science.  I have no interest in a physics-centered job, but the Earth Science is closer to what I want to do - natural resource management.  And the end of the day, engineering would have been a better major for me.]]></description>
