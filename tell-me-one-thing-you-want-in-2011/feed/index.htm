					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;JoeTaxpayer&lt;/b&gt; - haha... that is awesome.  you&#039;re a good dad :)
@&lt;b&gt;Miss T&lt;/b&gt; - very valiant goal!
@&lt;b&gt;Quest&lt;/b&gt; - if you can create a killer online product you&#039;d be golden.  lots harder than it looks (as I&#039;m sure you&#039;re already aware of) but once you get on track it can really work!
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Oops, i didn&#039;t catch that one.  yeah, ChristineWithRegence was totally spam.  like seeing you all passion&#039;ed up though ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - haha, i&#039;m here for you.
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - wowwwww, good one!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ChristineWithRegence, your post was offered like a spam post.  Too bad, because the health care situation in America is my #1 concern.  That website sucks in my opinion, because it won&#039;t even load on Firefox, and it chokes Google Chrome.  Things like paying people to stop smoking are stupid.  The only solution is single payer, and anything else is a battle that will end there anyway.  For-profit insurance companies are non-sustainable and should be entirely eliminated, because without that, no real reform is possible.  Reform includes slashing many medical charges by 90% and outlawing pharmaceutical ads targeting consumers.]]></description>
