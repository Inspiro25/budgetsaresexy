					<description><![CDATA[Love the info and glad you&#039;re still online!  During this COVID crap last year, I did a lot of private party bartending.  Now, my question is how do you do your taxes?  I didn&#039;t really save any names/address but just wrote down dates and how much I made.  This is the first time I&#039;ve done anything like that but loved it...until I realized I have to pony up now.  I don&#039;t even know what form to use.

If you did your own taxes, please let me know what forms I need.  And do I have to know what people I catered to?  Thanks!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jessica. Just step out and start bartending. You have to start somewhere.  It&#039;s understandable that you&#039;re nervous.  I was nervous on my first private event as well. 

Not every Bartender supplies a bar. You may miss a few events because you don&#039;t have one, but you can work plenty of events without one.  It took me well into my fifth year to purchase one. If you really focused on purchasing a bar. You can purchase one on amazon for $60. It may need a little reinforcement, but it&#039;s useable.

Thumbtack is filled with bartenders. So people will always look for a cheaper price up there. All I can say is know your worth. People will try and get you to work an eight hour event for $100 because some people up there would do that event without a problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started reading your article and couldn’t believe how much I can relate to the beginner’s issues. I haven’t posted anything on Craigslist yet but get notifications(I’m not sure if you’re familiar with Thumbtack). It is a little intimidating because some say ‘bartender brings the bar’. I don’t have a portable bar and only saw one idea about a table, some milk crates, and a couple linen table clothes. I’m nervous to book my first gig and not really know what to expect. I think this article may help me step out of my comfort zone and just go for it. I’m a single girl, living alone, with not much of a social life so Bartending was my idea of putting myself out there, making money, and meeting people while having fun. I have the perfect lifestyle to be able to bartend and most say my personality is ideal. If you have an recommendations for a quick, cheap, portable bar set up and your meaning of ‘bring your own bar’, I’d love to hear it. Thank you for this article. I hope to step up and make some moves soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is very well written, thorough, and highly informative; J.Money thank you so very much for sharing your wisdom and insights on this topic! I&#039;ve always thought about how to go about being a private Bartender in the first place! I like the part where you mention that instead of crawling up the ladder of ranks in restaurant or hospitality, you chose to circumnavigate yourself forward and around by taking a Bartenders training course. Smart choice! I did the same at American Bartenders School!

I went on an interview yesterday at a 4-star hotel job fair where the HR recruiter (human resources) seemed to have been trying to bully me into stooping toward something lower in ranking - since I didn&#039;t elaborate to him enough about my prior practical experience as an entry level bartender at two grunge, hole-in-the-wall divebars and the added transferrable skills that I have as a domestic caregiver/nanny/cook for so many years. If anyone understands what I just wrote, my advice would be - make sure to not make the same mistake I did in this case. 

I&#039;ll definitely be storing this on my home screen for lucrative usage - Let&#039;s get this money!

Cheers! :D]]></description>
