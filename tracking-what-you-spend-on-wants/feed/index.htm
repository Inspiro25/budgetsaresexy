Haha yup! Major savings opps right now being stuck at home! I estimated we&#039;re saving at least $1,000 w/ each passing month! Much more fun to track than your *expenses*, lol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great one J. Amid the current pandemic I am tracking how much I am able to save while living this way. Honestly, it is amazing how much we consume and spend out of necessity. I am recording it in an Android mobile App for now, but the biggest struggle is to even record the tiniest of spending. :)]]></description>

Totally feel ya! It&#039;s def. hard to decline the niceties of life here and there - especially when it comes to relationships. Tell your significant other that J. Money says to move back next to you so you guys can enjoy financial freedom together ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to be so bad with money but now I’m trying really hard to keep on top of it and keep track, this is actually one of the things I did early this year to help me get a grip. I’ve definitely started slacking again though getting two coffees a week out and not my budgeted one. I agree it’s so much harder when you have the money, I try to go to work and not take my purse but everywhere accepts Apple Pay.
I need to get back on this!
My biggest challenge is a long distance relationship so when we get to see each other once a week we tend to want to go out for food and make the most of it.]]></description>

YESSS! Excellent idea! I might have to steal that and add a &quot;happiness&quot; column to the tracker as well :)]]></description>

Well, one week down and I discovered a few things- 
1- we love to eat 
2 - Hardee&#039;s has got to stay a once in a blue moon thing. Love their onion rings, but man, my body is not used to the grease..

I will say the timing on the challenge was perfect for me. Skipped on Amazon Prime Day spending #winning LOL

Published my numbers on the site for last week, but going to stick with it until the end of the month. The real benefit of this challenge for us is reviewing how much happiness/value we get out of spending on tour wants. 

Thanks J!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I track every penny! I have a separate bank account with a debit card that is strictly used for fun money so tracking is easy, plus every Friday I take a predetermined amount of cash out of the ATM for miscellaneous small purchases.  I&#039;m &quot;wanting&quot; less stuff because I want my cash more.  Over the last month my daily spending was under $3 a day, dang I really AM frugal.]]></description>
