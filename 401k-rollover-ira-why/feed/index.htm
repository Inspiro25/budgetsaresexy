That is awesome. I had the opposite happen recently with a large transfer. Sold at a low and the market increased a few percent before I was able to buy. :(]]></description>

TSP conversion to IRA is relatively  easy.  I admit it was my own instead of inherited, but just filled paper out, sent it back and 4 days later TSP was at $0.  Got to TD Ameritrade about 3 days later.  Probably biggest part is setting up new account before transfer.

Actually, unlike his flow chart, I have moved 4 accounts and never actually touched a check, all sent straight to other brokerage.]]></description>

Hey Susan! There should be no limit to rollover, it&#039;s counted outside of your regular annual contribution. The best place to rollover a Roth 401k is to your existing Roth IRA, not a regular IRA. This should be pretty simple, and the same trustee to trustee transfer process as in this post :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there a limit to how much you can rollover from your 401k to an IRA? I have already fully funded my Roth IRA  for 2021 and now that I’ve recently switched jobs I would like to rollover to the new company. I have $11k in my Roth 401k. Can I rollover to a Roth IRA? Or is there a special rollover IRA I put the money in?

Love your always informative newsletters btw.]]></description>

There will only be a tax hit if you withdraw funds or don&#039;t roll it over properly to another pre-tax IRA :)]]></description>

Great advice! I should have added that I&#039;ll be receiving ~ $100k in yearly pension payments in retirement so my tax bracket will be close to what it is now (if tax rates stay the same of course).  I really wish the government would just exempt all money saved for retirement from taxes - that would be the ultimate incentive ; -)]]></description>
