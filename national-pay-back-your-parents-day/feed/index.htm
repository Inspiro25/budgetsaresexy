oh jeez, haha...

I do agree that it gives parents/grandparents joy helping out their kids/grandkids so at least that&#039;s something for whenever we cave in :) And I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be the same way when we&#039;re older and trying to pay for things too - hah!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dad won&#039;t even let me pay for breakfast at Cracker Barrel when we visit. I literally had to track the waitress down (who he had ALREADY told to bring him the bill) and pre-pay it without him realizing...and he was annoyed. My mom will similarly pay for lunch and stuff...and I&#039;m 43 and doing quite well. I guess they get enjoyment out of it.  My mom always says when I tell her she buys too much for the grandkids or us &quot;Well, I want to do it while I can.&quot;  My parents are the opposite of FIRE. I was trying to think of a quippy way to say &quot;Work until you drop&quot; but couldn&#039;t come up with one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, I don’t think our three grown kids owe us any money.  They all earned their college with scholarships and I never noticed them costing very much.  They always had jobs from a pretty early age and all got off our support as soon as they got their four year degrees, all of them in just four years.  They all paid their own grad school tabs themselves. Mostly we gave them room and board at home and a lot of love and a little advice.  And most of that was by trying to live good lives in front of them, they were way too smart to listen to anything we said that we didn’t back up with our actions.  By turning into good adults they’ve more than settled the bill.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We bought the in-laws&#039; house off them when they went broke this year (for them to live in) so I think that counts... 
My parents are still trying to give us money via spoiling the hell out of grandkids so not sure how trying to give them money back would go. I think they&#039;d be insulted! But I do let them know that I know they set me up to be successful.]]></description>
