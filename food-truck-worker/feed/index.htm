					<description><![CDATA[@Long: There are two options: buying or leasing a truck. Obviously buying is more expensive. Also, trucks come in different sizes and come outfitted with different equipment. Depending on what you need (deep fryer, steam table, refrigeration), that will change the cost of a truck.

I&#039;d GUESS it would range from $40K-$60K at the low end to over $100K with a newer, fancy truck. This is STILL cheaper than opening up a traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant. If you have an idea for a restaurant, there&#039;s no better way to test out your ideas on a food truck first.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great and fun idea for a side job. I&#039;ve worked as a waitress on and off for four years, and this sounds similar but with additional benefits of moving around and getting involved in the food truck culture. Great idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a great job for a recent college grad. Maybe I&#039;ll pass along the idea to my brother.  We have a great food cart scene here in PDX if you ever come visit: http://www.foodcartsportland.com/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds fun, but I&#039;d imagine that it&#039;s kind of tough working in a cramped space. You have to be really organized to run that kind of kitchen line.

Anyone have any idea what the average start up costs for a food truck are? It&#039;d be kind of cool to get one going.]]></description>
