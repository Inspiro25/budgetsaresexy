					<description><![CDATA[@J. Money
Funny you mentioned, cause I thought about you a couple of days after reading your post when it got -35 WITHOUT the windshield factor (so that would be -40 or something) here! I must admit that we did not really get outside that day though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m back!  And already miss it after reading through all these comments ;)  Sorry to those asking questions - had spotty coverage throughout.  Here are some responses!

@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - I got taken to the Safe House!  And by that, I mean I was made fun of for a good 10 mins ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica, The Debt Princess&lt;/b&gt; - Sorry just now seeing this, that woulda been fun!  It&#039;s now my fave city in Ohio too - or actually in the surrounding areas!  Loved it there - so quaint.
@&lt;b&gt;KP&lt;/b&gt; - Sorry about your bad luck ;)  Although you all put in my boy Todd Collins!  Ex-Redskin, woo!
@&lt;b&gt;DoNotWait&lt;/b&gt; - After -6 degrees I was okay in the 10-15 range.  But -25?  no wayyyy - wow.
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you :)  Just trying to live life to the fullest!
@&lt;b&gt;Angie Mom to Ethan, Alex, and Megan&lt;/b&gt; - You are too sweet :)  Thank you so much Angie - that means a lot.
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - Where you gonna go?

Will be back writing again tomorrow - hope everyone had a great week or two!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh I wish I saw this a few day ago because I would have loved to meet you and Nate! I hope that the road trip here to Milwaukee went ok and that your nose hasn&#039;t fallen off from the wind chill! LOL!

I can&#039;t wait to hear about and see the results of the HARD work everyone has done and evrythig that has been done for Jills Family for the &quot;Maiden voyage&quot; of Love Drop!

I have a feeling our family will be meeting you and Nate in the near future! ;)

PS, my piece of cold weather advice...layers of course....and do not go outside right after a shower....wait till your hair is dry and your body has come back to room temp after a warm/hot shower otherwise...well....just don&#039;t do it! Lol!

Go Pack! (sorry Jill!)

Drive safe and have a great time at the conference and rest of your trip!

Thanks for being inspiring and doing somethig you LOVE and something that is changing lives!!! Don&#039;t worry about the $ as far as income because as the good Oprah says (and maybe others have too) because &quot;if you do why you love and it truely makes you happy then the money will follow, never fails&quot;.....if only MORE of us can live to Pay it Forward and have empathy for everyone them the world would be a much better place!!!

Thanks again!
Angie
Proud Mom to Ethan, Alex, and Megan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is everybody scared with cold? I live in Quebec, let me tell you what cold means: -25 degrees!! That is cold! Six degrees is only cool! LOL Seriously, a road trip in cold places is a fun thing to do. I used to hate winter here and now I enjoy it as much as summer. Getting outside with a little snow and having a walk near a lake or in the woods is something everyone should do. I am sure you&#039;ll have fun!]]></description>
