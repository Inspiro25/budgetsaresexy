Speaking of furloughs, in at least some states, it is possible to collect UI during a furlough, even a short one, or a series of short ones.  So don&#039;t hesitate to apply.]]></description>

Freelancing is starting a business?  Wonder if that is a new trick some states are using to push folks off the system.  Many years ago I freelanced for a former employer while collecting UI.  Depending on how much I worked, collected nothing, partial, or full benefit.  That type of gig work was highly encouraged.  And the UI was very helpful during the dry weeks.

But you are so right UI is way behind the times, even now still far too blue collar oriented.  Such as requiring at least three in-person contacts a week long after that become totally inappropriate for applying to most white collar jobs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sulyn - I agree with you.  It is not at all fair not to collect unemployment if you can and you need it.  And need it means you can&#039;t get along without somebody else&#039;s money.  Bringing someone else down is not something to take pride in, and nobody should be ashamed of collecting unemployment if they are eligible to do so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My significant other worked in construction for many years.   As we know, the building industry is one of the most hardest hit in today&#039;s economic times.   He collected unemployment for 5 months and stopped after he got a sub-contract job from a friend.  He did the right thing and stop collecting unemployment.   His friend ended up paying him less than 50% of what he owed him on the job, even though he got paid out 100%.   My boyfriend took anything to be working, but was out in the end.   He has not been working a regular job with benefits since December 2009, and only collected unemployment for 5 months.   Other&#039;s suggested he reapply for unemployment, but he feels to prideful to go back that route.   He moved in with me 3 months before he lost his job, and for the last several months I have been paying for everything.   A neighbor told him he should try to collect unemployment, and he is now mad at me for encouraging him to take the neighbors advice.   Come on people, if your not depending on the government your depending on someone else.  Is if fair to the people you love to not help financially if there is a means too... at least temporary.  WTF.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely plan to file for unemployment when I get laid off in the summer. I have a right to, I&#039;ve been paying into it since I started working at the young age of 16 so it&#039;s about time that I finally get to use it. Granted it wont be what I get paid normally, but I don&#039;t see a point in trying to find a job for 2 months when I can just use unemployment and money I&#039;ve put aside.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t read through all the comments, so please forgive me if what I am saying is redundant.
There is no proof that you are actually looking for a job.  A friend of mine just had to click a button online that said &quot;I was looking for week this week (date given)&quot;.  You can do that week after week after week and they never once asked for any proof that my they were looking for a job.  It is part of why the system is so abused.

I think you should give it a try.  It doesn&#039;t hurt to have that buffer income.  You may not be looking for a job, but you are building toward a business in a sense.  It isn&#039;t like you are sitting around watching reruns of Friends and drinking beer 24 hours a day.]]></description>
