They totally changed the game, didn&#039;t they? ;) Imagine what shopping will be like in 10 or 20 years from now?! I bet they&#039;ll just be teleported right over! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like many millenials, I have a love / hate relationship with my subscriptions (Amazon, Netflix, etc). Living in a mid-size city, shopping at costco is unrealistic - traveling to a store isn&#039;t easy and we don&#039;t have much room in our condo for the oversized costco items. I have many friends / family that also cut out their costco membership.

However.. Amazon has become our guilty pleasure.. The ease and convenience of prime delivery / purchasing quality products delivered to our doorsteps we find worth it. But it FOR SURE leads to extra spending!! If I had a nickel for every time we needlessly browsed Amazon...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We love using Greenlight cards for our four kids. The problem we were looking to solve is that often, they wanted to spend their allowance on online games like Steam or Roblox. We&#039;d hand over a cash allowance, then we&#039;d have to take the cash back and pay for the purchases using our debit or credit card online. I didn&#039;t love them having my card loaded in their online accounts, plus all the moving money around was messing up the budget. Now they have cards of their own. I like how the kids can manage their accounts on their devices. When they set up a savings goal and move money into it, they can&#039;t move it back to the &quot;spend&quot; side without parent approval, sparking a conversation with me about the decision.]]></description>
