Thats one of the reasons people who retire are leaving this country, the government and big insurance businesses are hurting the people just for profits. This is usually a non political site, but medical bills are getting too expensive to leave off the convo.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J Money - long time reader, first time poster. 

It really is crazy how much further your money will stretch in lower cost parts of the US, not to mention other countries. The geographic arbitrage of having a decent salary in a low cost environment is a powerful way to throw fuel on the FIRE. But it’s not for everyone. As great as it would be to live in paradise for much less than my medium-to-high cost-of-living home, we live here for a reason. We love our home, we have roots here and family nearby, so we pay that opportunity cost of having a higher cost of living and a lower salary. Although dang, snapshot #1 sure is killing the debt!]]></description>
