					<description><![CDATA[Rule #1 is genius. We have been decluttering our house the past two years so definitely down with Rule #2. We too have joined a local Buy Nothing group. I love it for giving away stuff that is in good shape but we just don&#039;t use anymore. Especially toys and clothes the kiddo doesn&#039;t want anymore because we get to see it go to a home we know they will continue to be enjoyed which makes it a little easier to get rid of. I have only given stuff on though, and have been good about not taking stuff just &#039;cause it&#039;s free :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve recently joined my local Buy Nothing group. It&#039;s intoxicating, dangerous and incredibly helpful to have. The temptation with the group is to &quot;win&quot; the item but you have to fight it when you want to WIN everything even if you don&#039;t need it. So far, I&#039;ve used it for good but I have to fight it with every post I see. I&#039;ve given away things I don&#039;t need or use anymore like moving boxes and a kitchen scale, and gotten things like really cute new clothes and a toaster. Free.99 is my favorite price but as with all things, great power comes with great responsibilities ;)]]></description>

Well if you&#039;re hawking the stuff then it&#039;s all welcomed!!

No shame in that if you&#039;re willing to put in the time! :)

(I have two items that I keep SAYING I&#039;m going to sell but it&#039;s been 4 months now and I have still yet to do it, ugh.... Good reminder to put it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/one-tweak-a-week/&quot;&gt;one-tweak-a-week&lt;/a&gt; list, thx brother!)]]></description>
