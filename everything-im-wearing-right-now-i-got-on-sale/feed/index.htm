					<description><![CDATA[I had a similar feeling the other day. The only thing other than underwear I had on that had originally belonged to me was a pair of slacks. The striped French-cuff shirt was my husband&#039;s as were the cufflinks that adorned it. The shoes were bought by my mother who discovered they run small but never sends anything back. The cerulean blue suit jacket had been my grandfather&#039;s. The trench coat had been worn by my oldest while serving in the army. The jewelry was from the grandmother who had been married to the jacket owner. To say that I was resplendent on a budget was no exaggeration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Definitely clearance racks are the way to go --- my teenage daughter is quite the clotheshorse and if we hit the sales right and take some time to do some digging, we&#039;ll come home with $700 worth of stuff for about $90. She&#039;s pretty smart and doesn&#039;t gripe about trying stuff on, or arguing if I say &quot;no&quot; about something, because she knows if we look hard enough, I&#039;m going to say &quot;yes&quot; about something else. So, even if she really really really wants something and I say &quot;no&quot; to it, she just goes on to the next thing rather than argue and risk getting me out of shopping mode.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - hah!  writing this in my pajamas too right now ;)
@&lt;b&gt;aj&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh yes, haven&#039;t seen one of those rummage sales around here in quite some time.  I gotta keep my eyes open more.
@&lt;b&gt;Grace L&lt;/b&gt; - Undergarment hand me downs, or hand me downs in general? haha... :)
@&lt;b&gt;Barb Friedberg&lt;/b&gt; - Man, 70%?  That&#039;s a pretty high percentage.  Kinda makes sense though, esp in this economy.
@&lt;b&gt;My Money Mess&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahhaa...  that is awesome.
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s been a while since I wore all thriftstore clothes ;)  I love them to death, but some of the ones around here just smell funny.  Makes it hard to want to come in and browse, no less buy clothes there.  I do get lucky every now and then at thrift stores in other states though - those are always fun.
@&lt;b&gt;Amy&lt;/b&gt; - Yay!!!  Nice seeing you here too :)  Glad you&#039;re still online and rockin&#039;t it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this! Most of my clothes are bought on sale - my outfit today is no exception. Boots and jeans were both purchased during a 30% off/no tax sale at the mall, my top and cardigan were both on sale as well...even my glasses were bought during a two-pairs-for-$199 promo. I almost never pay full price for anything. Today&#039;s exception is my winter coat - paid 100 euros in Paris for it, which was regular price. But it&#039;s pretty and it was a special buy that I wear at least three times a week all winter so I&#039;m fine with that - also reminds me of our honeymoon every time I put it on :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Next picture better be of you wearing all thrift-store duds. 
Then again, one of your readers would one-up you by saying, &quot;Goodwill? Bah! I get all my clothes by Dumpster-diving!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely everything I&#039;m wearing other than my shoes was either on sale or off the clearance rack. The shoes were kind of an emergency. I wear shoes until they literally fall apart. I had the sole fall off of one of my shoes at the Sears auto center when I was buying a replacement battery for my wife&#039;s car. Needless to say I couldn&#039;t wait any longer to buy a new pair of shoes. So I ended up getting the lowest price pair they had in my size.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw on TV this morning that 70% of all clothes sold are on sale. You did great with your buys. There&#039;s sale and then there&#039;s SALE. My hubby is an expert at combing throught 70-90% off racks at Kohl&#039;s. (And I&#039;m not too bad either). I really liked this one.]]></description>
