					<description><![CDATA[I like how you mentioned that it is important to be aware of the mistakes that can be avoided. My uncle mentioned to me last night that his friend is looking for an autocue equipment operator for his upcoming project and asked if I have any idea what is the best option to do. Thanks to this informative article and I&#039;ll be sure to tell him that he can consult a trusted teleprompter operator as they can answer all his inquiries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a fun story to read about. I’m actually going to start the same job next month at “voice of America” which is a government owned news station. So I decided to start researching about it and I came across to your story. Thanks for sharing this with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, I am a teleprompter op full-time and it is not a dying business at all. (Also, I make a lot more than $20 an hour.)  Yes, in local TV there are less and less prompter ops, but for video shoots, corporate events and live broadcast events there is still a huge call for teleprompting.  BUT you don&#039;t just need to know how to scroll the text at the pace of the reader. (although that is very important) You also need to know how to build and set up the feeds to the prompter systems.  You better be able to mount that prompter sled on the tripod and then balance the camera so the camera op doesn&#039;t have a back heavy or front heavy camera.  You better be able to troubleshoot why the signal isn&#039;t making it to the third camera.  Also, you better know how to set-up the executive prompter system (like the president uses on speeches) so that the images in each mirror match and the sight line is good.  You should also be able to handle client relations really well - nothing like a CEO who wants to make multiple changes to his script 2 minutes before he walks on stage.  Oh for those of you who think automating the prompter works - try being the person who&#039;s delivering the speech and you give some ad lib and the automated script just keeps scrolling past where you are.  Not fun.  I get hired a lot after people/companies have had a bad experience because they tried to get by with some cut rate gear or inexperienced production assistant running the prompter.]]></description>

Oh I know! But technology (especially newer technology) ain&#039;t cheap, and I guess it was just cheaper to get people to use the old system and pay them to install the new system.]]></description>
