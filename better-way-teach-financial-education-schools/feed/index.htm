					<description><![CDATA[You had to know I would come check this out! And of course, I wasn&#039;t disappointed. We have talked about how personal finance needs to be taught to us at a younger age, but you make a crazy good point...Young people could care less about managing their money! All they really care about is making a lot of it and buying everything they can. Your idea of turning it into a &quot;how to get RICH&quot; curriculum would definitely grab their attention first. Then as they learn how to make/grow money, then they could be taught the other aspects of personal finance.

Come to think of it, my fiancee&#039;s teenage brother could care less about saving money. He just loves making it and showing it off, so your point strikes AGAIN! hahaha

Good stuff J. Money, I always enjoy reading your work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You made me smile, thank you… and you are sooooo right. No one teaches us about money in school (and many times, not at home either), so we learn through play. We make lots of mistakes in the process. Such subjects would be incredible at school. You have my vote. =)]]></description>

I know that feeling. I have to pay to go to an indoor range or travel to my girlfriend&#039;s parents&#039; house to shoot my bow. I just want some place like where I grew up, surrounded by fields, so I can have a nice range of my own. Not to mention not having to hear everything my neighbors do.]]></description>

Oh J, I wish you were my teacher at school!

Glad I&#039;m not the only one that makes my kids pay for lost school clothes. Lost sunhats are their speciality. Tough love I say!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true!  Learning about money management is boring but so important.  There is a local comedian Colin Ryan who travels around to school talking about money management stuff but since he is a comedian it is truly entertaining while still being informative.  I certainly wish I had learned this stuff when I was in school.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite is simply the FU Money. But I also like the ARMAGEDDON FUND, which is the fund consisting of risk free assets like CDs and stuff. 

Money definitely gets more interesting when put a label!
