I thought the same thing with that question!!! Haha... definitely not scientific enough as many of us ARE decent at organizing but it&#039;s those around us who try to mess up our game ;) I swear I&#039;m going to count all my things one day and see just how many I have compared to the rest of the household, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Ladybug! &quot;Ladybugs are generally stressed out by surface clutter and like to keep their living space clean and clutter free. You know you’re a ladybug if your surfaces are clean and tidy but your junk drawer is overflowing and you would be really embarrassed if guest ever opened your closets.&quot; 

Yup, this is me. Visual clutter drives me absolutely nuts, and if I can&#039;t properly organize things I will shove them behind closed doors. Most of my closets are fairly organized, but please don&#039;t look in my hall closet or laundry room! (Also I had to fudge the &quot;biggest organizing challenge&quot; question - the real answer to that is my husband and kids!)]]></description>

How fun! I wonder what they&#039;d think of the movement if they started poking around more... Falling into it naturally would be so amazing and don&#039;t know that many people that have,  haha... Most of us need some good encouragement/ass-kicking :)]]></description>

Dang!! maybe you need to invest in a garage or outbuilding of some sorts so he can stash all his stuff there nice and out of site ;) Tell him you&#039;ll gladly throw - i mean gently move - all his stuff in there for him too! Lol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did my own Tidying Up project this spring, and wrote about it for my newspaper, Wausau City Pages. I ended up interviewing someone local who had been doing KonMari for years, and was basically a minimalist, and had never heard of FIRE! (And was very intrigued when I explained it - he and his family were practically living FIRE without knowing it.) I never thought of myself as particularly messy, but I was surprised at how much I got rid of through the process. And I was also surprised at how nice it felt having fewer things and having the place really tidy.]]></description>

Yep; two of them. I can close the door of my son&#039;s room. A bit harder with husband. He hoards and clutters half of the space(s) we share. I try not to look at his half. Basically, most of the time I&#039;m in angst that is hard to contain :).]]></description>
