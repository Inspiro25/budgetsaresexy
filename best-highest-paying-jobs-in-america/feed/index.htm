					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Kevin Vesga&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah! Didn&#039;t even think of that... I bet you also get super critical about ALL the games you end up seeing or playing too ;) Like always trying to break it or see how things were done/etc, haha... Kinda like what my dad does everytime we watch a movie involving helicopters and especially stunts. He&#039;s always like, &quot;Hey! That could never happen cuz of XYZ&quot; as he used to be a pilot :)
@&lt;b&gt;savvyfinanciallatina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I hope he does too then!
@&lt;b&gt;Kris&lt;/b&gt; - If only we had a time machine :)
@&lt;b&gt;becca&lt;/b&gt; - 1/3 of people? Wow, that&#039;s a lot higher than I would have expected actually... you think it&#039;s trending on an upward path then pretty fast?
@&lt;b&gt;LB @ Finanical Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - So basically you want a crystal ball? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah? Is that your next move? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassi&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!!! On not only going for that dream job of yours, but KNOWING what it is! Most of us don&#039;t ever figure it out until we&#039;re way past college or even ever, haha... You&#039;re gonna love it! I know everyone says college is one of the best times of your life, but I&#039;m gonna say it anyways - College is one of the best times of your life!! Soak it all in! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mitch&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, I bet. I mean I&#039;ve tried to use my personal accounts myself on my time off, and every time I sit down to do it I just have no motivation at all... unlike before I started blogging and going as this &quot;J. Money&quot; character ;) Luckily I can be as personal as I want on here though so at least that helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Working as Social Media Manager is an interesting job. Doing Twitter and Facebook all day is a fun way to earn moolah.

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting to see how much the very best jobs are paid on average. I&#039;m going to start college in the fall of 2013, so I have been looking for information like this, but I think I will stick to my physics major for now. (Starting salary is an average of $50,000. Very competitive, but my current dream job, so I am going for it!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1 thru 6 of the top new jobs, seem to have a lot of burn-out and turnover.  Makes me wonder how long those jobs will be around and how much they will actually pay in the future.  I have a knack for finding jobs that will NOT exist in 5 years.  I bet if I did more research I could figure it out.  Probably not what you were looking for in a conversation, as it looks as more of the downside to the new jobs, instead of the excitement.

I always check out the top paying jobs, just to see what is trending for this moment.  I saw that the top 100 had specifics on what made it a good job like: personal satisfaction, low stress, benefit to society, and  flexibility which are all good, but who decides what makes each job satisfying, or flexible, surveys of random people in the job or estimates and forecasts of what jobs will look like?  Either way, not a good way to decide the true value of a job. I want to know real facts, like how easy it is to get into the field, the average pay, the starting pay and the real benefits for the average person.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, we&#039;re running low on burial space. I&#039;m not sure mortician will be around forever, about 1/3 of people go the cremation route as is. 

I think wind turbine engineer sounds AWESOME! I mean, I could get PAID to climb up 300 feet?! WHEEE! 
(NB: in another life, where I was more talented, I would&#039;ve been a good cirque du soleil performer)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dentist is the most appealing, although at my age is not going to happen. I have a friend who is a surgeon, and he said if he could do it all over again he would be a dentist. Every job has its ups and downs, but for doctors being a dentist seems a little more positive, you get to know your patients better, and still make good $$$. Can you tell I wish I could go back to being 18 again to choose a career! :)]]></description>
