					<description><![CDATA[The link to modified children&#039;s books is hysterical. I make up stories for my kids about money all the time. I inundated my poor four year old with stories of mortgages and credit cards. At seven he is constantly talking about running lemonade stands to earn money and counting the cash in his piggy bank. He&#039;s too young to know if it will stick, but I do hope all of my make-believe money talk with help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Firstly, thank you for the mention. I am honored. 

Secondly, thanks for the good Saturday morning reading list. I enjoyed all of these articles in a different way. The video was my favorite. Fascinating! &quot;We are the threads holding the world together. We build it now so that those who come later will be able to create things that we cannot ourselves imagine.&quot; - Tim Berners-Lee]]></description>

Ooooh exciting!!! Welcome to my home!!! Definitely good to be leery here as we sure do like to hand out credit to people in hopes of snagging them into never-ending debt cycles! But with that minimalist brain of yours you will be just fine, I&#039;m sure :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the one from Four Pillar Freedom - I&#039;ve heard reference to compounding getting easier more effective as you accumulate funding but never seem a charted breakdown like this. Honestly it gave me a boost of inspiration. It won&#039;t change my behaviors - I&#039;m pretty much at max saving already - but definitely made me feel better about where I am at and the direction I am heading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent picks. We are moving to a new country (US) in 7 weeks and I need all the info I can get on how to manage our money there and not make some big mistakes. We cannot afford to get in debt and I&#039;d like to pursue a more minimalist lifestyle anyone, seeing that from all we gathered here we can&#039;t take with us most of the stuff, since it won&#039;t fit in our 3 suitcases :D]]></description>
