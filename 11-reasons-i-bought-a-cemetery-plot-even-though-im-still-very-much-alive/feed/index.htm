Oh wow, haha - exactly what I *don&#039;t* want happening to me &#128514;

&quot;The Binder&quot; sounds perfect for this sorta stuff... There&#039;s a blogger in our space who created a pretty good one that she sells for $39 if anyone&#039;s interested in it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/ice-binder/&quot;&gt;Family Emergency Binder&lt;/a&gt;.

There&#039;s also a not-as-fancy-one someone put out into the community years ago too, that&#039;s FREE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freelegacybinder.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;FreeLegacyBinder.com&lt;/a&gt;

Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dad has a spot reserved somewhere. The details are in &#039;The Binder&#039;. 
Which is better than my grandparents who my aunt LOST their urn when she moved. Because my mom made sure to keep it safe, while my aunt &#038; uncle were moving. My uncle neglected to tell my aunt he&#039;d handed it off to my mom.
Still the debate of do we have their remains interred somewhere or are my cousin &#038; I left figuring it out in the future??
That&#039;s when having at least your wishes documented, and even better a spot selected is a gift to those left behind.]]></description>

I still can&#039;t believe you had your friend pick it out for you, lol... But you gotta do what you gotta do!! You made it happen and now we&#039;re both proud owners of our future resting spots :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, J. Money. Thanks for the link to my article on why my yard worker picked out my grave for me. You&#039;re absolutely right that this is something that should be done sooner rather than later. Definitely a personal finance issue. It&#039;s only going to get more expensive. Mine cost twice as much as yours and I don&#039;t live in a large urban area. The average cost of a plot in Los Angeles is about $12,576, I found out when a fellow blogger wrote a comment on my article. And Jamie, in a comment above, said a two-person plot they&#039;re saving for is $25,000. That&#039;s crazy expensive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also told people were I want to be buried.  So many think it&#039;s morbid and don&#039;t want to talk about it.

I don&#039;t have anywhere near as much to pay for it any time soon ($25k for a 2 person) but I do plan on saving up for it and trying to get a plot ahead of time (if there are any left).

My family has a companion grave (4 people) there with one spot left so who knows.   My husband and I will have to be cremated in that case (there is a limit I think of 3 cremation in one casket spot).

I&#039;ve decided I&#039;d rather make my wishes known now so my chances of ending up there are better.]]></description>
