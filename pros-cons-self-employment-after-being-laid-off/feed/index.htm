Thanks J.Money! The site IS active - but with only one post, just so that I can keep it live to work on and refine it to where I think it needs to be. If you have a chance, take a look, and please read &quot;My Story&quot; and if you have time, and let me know what  you think. I believe in my message, and know there are a lot of folks who can benefit from it, the way they do from yours...! Positive, positive, positive!!

Thanks and keep up the great, awesome work! David!

BTW, the site is www.beenthere-donethat.net ! Cheers!]]></description>

YAYYY!!! Another positive story, I love it! And good for you on sucking it up and just doing what you have to like that. I am impressed. And I can only HOPE I have the courage to do so too if ever in that same spot - that scares the bejesus out of me! Haha... So thank you for sharing that with all of us - it is very inspiring!! And please let me know once your site is up and running and you&#039;re in action again. If I can help out at all let me know :)]]></description>

AWESOME STORY!! Way to go over there - I loved reading every word of that :) Esp that the biz is going strong! I was afraid it was gonna end on a bad note, haha, but yay! I&#039;ll agree 100% that it IS more rewarding owning/growing your own biz for sure. I forgot that&#039;s a perk to it, thx for reminding me :) And may you have continued success as well!! Thanks so much for stopping by today.]]></description>

Probably not :) BUT, all the other perks would blossom and you&#039;d start loving those things more - like all the freedom, and hanging out with your kids (if you have any), etc etc... I guess you wouldn&#039;t really know until you gave it a shot which is the scariest part! But if you had a backup like your old employer would always hire you back, then that would be pretty sweet ;)]]></description>

Wow, really?? That&#039;s so cool! Though that picture wasn&#039;t exactly *me* for what it&#039;s worth ;) It just captured EXACTLY what I was thinking in that moment, haha... Man... I can remember that entire feeling soooo well! Amazing the things that get imprinted in your head over the years...]]></description>
