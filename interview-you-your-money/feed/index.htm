Good point. Super easy to get in the mindset of &quot;upgrading&quot; everything - esp. the big boys (ie houses and cars).]]></description>

Adam,
I wrote up a post a while back on &quot;How Much Does Your Car Payment Really Cost You?&quot; that you might find interesting:
http://www.richmondsavers.com/how-much-does-your-car-payment-really-cost-you/
Admittedly this is a somewhat crude analysis, but I thin it&#039;s interesting for people to see a real-world example of how much a car really does cost in the long-term.]]></description>

It&#039;s actually the same question as #1 but it just has a different meaning to them. 

When people have no debt, it can be easy to get into the mentality of &quot;well, I have the cash now, so I can buy this - at least I&#039;m not adding any debt&quot;. 

However, it&#039;s still crucial that they are saving for goals that are in the future. One big goal that most people have periodically is buying a new car. If they&#039;re not planning properly for that purchase in the future, they&#039;re going to find themselves in debt again. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to look beyond the present and save for the future.]]></description>

Being 100% in charge can definitely be tough, and stressful, as you point out. There are days that I miss working for someone *else&#039;s* company vs. my own every month. You get all the risk and the reward when you&#039;re on your own. But it&#039;s good to know what you can take and what you can&#039;t for sure :) It&#039;s not for everyone.]]></description>

Definitely share this with your audience!! It really does help everyone in some form or another :) And give the personality infusion a shot too - might help your readers connect with you more (or, worst case, not connect with you more! Haha...) At the end of the day we&#039;re all humans on the other side of the computer, so my feeling is why not connect with each other that way vs. stripping it out?]]></description>
