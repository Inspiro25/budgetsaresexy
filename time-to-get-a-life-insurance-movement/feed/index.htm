					<description><![CDATA[I think life insurance is essential for those who need it, but not everyone is in need of life insurance, unless you have someone who relies on you for financial support, like a spouse, children, parents, siblings, a relative, etc. How to save on life insurance? Buy life insurance when you are young and healthy, consider term life, stop smoking, get healthy, compare rates among several leading insurers, choosing annual payment option, and don;t buy more than you can afford.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha... well $1.5 Mil sounds like a safe number :)  And $40 bucks is a STEAL! Esp at 30 years, wow.  What&#039;s mine, less than half that and like 1/4 the pay out!  Give him a fist bump for me, okay?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny enough, my husband has an appointment for his blood test for term life insurance today.  I believe the term is 30 years, for $1.5 million, for $40/month.  I still need to get some life insurance, too, but we haven&#039;t figured out how much he needs on me.  I&#039;m a stay-at-home mom, so no salary.  But he will need to cover the costs of housekeeper, personal chef, all-day childcare and a financial planner (and maybe a personal escort, lol) until the kids are grown.  It&#039;s a pain in the butt to figure out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here we don&#039;t have any option, it comes with the mortgage and that&#039;s it, but of course I live in a country where as long as you have a paid job the government takes money from your paycheck and puts it on a retirement account, public health services and a saving account exclusively for housing (they modified this already, not too long ago if you didn&#039;t use this money you couldn&#039;t ask for it once you hit the *mandatory* retirement age, now you can get 100% back interest included)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally have to go against everyone on this one.  I am always the black sheep, because I guess I just don&#039;t think like other people (Totally got me in trouble at work more than once!)  

OK I am not saying DON&#039;T get life insurance, but for me I am not.  I am totally angry at USAA still and don&#039;t have a mortgage or kids or even car payments.  If I died, my husband wouldn&#039;t have to help pay for school so no problem there.  If he died, I would just sell my house and all would be fine.  Maybe if I finished school, or had kids or something else, but for now, no thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;***I forgot to mention in the article that it&#039;s also a great idea to do earlier while you&#039;re nice and healthy too!&lt;/strong&gt;***

You never know what will happen in 10 years or even in one (or tomorrow!), so if you get that clean bill of health early on (they check you all out before granting you the insurance) and lock it in for 20-30 years, then you&#039;d be set just in case... Something else to consider anyways.

@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - I think a lot of people feel the same way as you do too.  But check what I just wrote here above ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MMLP Junkie&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah dog!  I like that!!  And $100 isn&#039;t TOO bad for what you&#039;d be getting either. I could get down with that :)  MMLP for life!
@&lt;b&gt;Greg@ClubThrifty&lt;/b&gt; - What??? You&#039;re a mortician? AWESOME!! I didn&#039;t know that :) Want to do a guest post for me on the inside scoop of being one for a living? That would be so inteersting! Shoot me an email if you&#039;re interested, I&#039;d love it: j (at) budgetsaresexy (dot) com.
@&lt;b&gt;jim&lt;/b&gt; - Nah, I never even considered that to be honest with you, but it&#039;s a neat way to think of things. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d like it though cuz if something happened tomorrow I&#039;d have diddly squat ;)  The whole point of it for us is peace of mind and making sure 100% we&#039;d be fine, so if we only had X amt saved at any point it would still stress us out... But for those who don&#039;t believe or want life insurance?  Damn good idea!
@&lt;b&gt;Renee S&lt;/b&gt; - I pretty much agree with what Brian said down there :) I don&#039;t mess with anything fancy or investment-related, and just want something nice and simple: If we die in X years we get X number of dollars.  That&#039;s how it *should* be in my opinion, but certainly do your research and see what you&#039;re most comfortable with.  I think a lot of older people say to do &quot;whole&quot; and the younger generation prefers &quot;term.&quot;  Who knows what the next generation will say :)
@&lt;b&gt;Em&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well stay on it!  It&#039; a good thing to have :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Great answer bro, I couldn&#039;t agree more.
@&lt;b&gt;Gillian @ Money After Graduation&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m glad you liked it :)  Took me a while to find something clever, and I was pretty happy with it in the end!
@&lt;b&gt;Walnut&lt;/b&gt; - Seems like a fine plan to me :) I forgot you can get life insurance through your employer sometimes, good reminder.  And the same with disability too - I actually need to look into that too!  It really freaks me out.
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - I know, these are the things that suck even more when you retire and/or start working for yourself.  All of a sudden you pay a lot more attention to all the numbers ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Krista&lt;/b&gt; - Good! The whole thing IS kinda overwhelming at first, but once you get going and just decide one way or the other as far as what kind you want/etc, it&#039;s just a matter of filling out paperwork and taking the next steps ahead to knock it all out.  Any good company should make it easy on you so they can snag your bizness. So if they aren&#039;t, move on to the next! Or if you have any military connections in your family, see if you can get USAA! That&#039;s what they&#039;re best known for - insurance.
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD!! Way to go!!!  And oh my gosh CONGRATS ON THE BABY!!! You&#039;re gonna love it :)  Nothing better in the world, it&#039;s crazy.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - I hope you do :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I don&#039; blame you - it IS silly money!  Esp. since 95% of us can REALLY afford it even though they think they can&#039;t.  $20 a month is literally 4 coffees or one dinner out a month - super do-able.
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Well, that would certainly be ideal, yes :)  But $350k any number of years from now is still $350k that I wouldn&#039;t turn down.  Your mortgage will still be the same too, you know?  Whether it&#039;s 5 years or 15 years for now, mortgages that are fixed ain&#039;t goin&#039; up, baby ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Craig Arthur&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... another way to look at it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Debt Free Teen&lt;/b&gt; - Holy shit, I&#039;m sorry to hear that. Damn... that is just insane.  How sucky that on the other side of that chain smokers can go 50+ years and be perfectly healthy in the end?  Life is so strange sometimes, I hope your friend&#039;s family is coping with things okay - I can&#039;t even imagine the paid I&#039;d be in :(
@&lt;b&gt;m1nts&lt;/b&gt; - You know, I think we DO have that option here too actually, it&#039;s just not that popular I don&#039;t think... I have Chase as my main mortgage and every now and then they try to upsell me on some kind of life insurance, but I just neve read it thoroughly and throw it in the trash ;) For some reason that stuff seems too shady to me. I feel like they should concentrate on what they&#039;re good at, and leave insurance to the others. But maybe I&#039;m wrong here.
@&lt;b&gt;Ornella @ Moneylicious&lt;/b&gt; - Also you&#039;re a professional and you know what you&#039;re doing wayyyyy more than the average person ;)  I agree other types of policies could be good for people, but only if they do their research and understand entirely what they&#039;re getting themselves into.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like any financial product it depends on your circumstances. Some people are best suited with Term, others with Whole Life, other with Universal Life, others with Equity Index Universal Life or Variable Universal Life. Personally, I have no dependents and in my early twenties I got a Variable Universal Life.  For me I used it as part of my long-term strategy because it doubles as life insurance (plus it&#039;s less expensive the younger you get) and to supplement as my retirement income ( I have other investments accounts, too). Actually, my cost has declined the older I got.]]></description>
