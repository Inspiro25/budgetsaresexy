					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I tried this challenge and kept it going for 64 days! It&#039;s a~mazing how much useless crap we dug out once we put our minds to it. It&#039;s really taught us not to buy things on impulse, either. A lot of the stuff we threw out / gave away / sold was bought on impulse and hardly used, if ever. Great idea, thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting idea. Getting rid of things sounds simple but practically hard to accomplish the idea. Going step by step can really help. It takes a lot of determination though. This is a fun read. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I emptied a storage bin full of the clothes that I was going to wear (WHEN I LOST WEIGHT).  My sticking point was.... since I purchase most of my clothes off season, some were new.  But after going through the bin &#038; trying on every piece (what a waste of time)!  I knew it was time to make someone else&#039;s day. I put all the clothes on the $2.00 table &#038; donated the money to the charity running the yard sale.  Next project, DVD&#039;s I haven&#039;t seen for 10 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love your #1 realization! Out of sight - out of mind! I used to think that all my cabinets and closets needed to be full! And it&#039;s definitely a process. Decluttering isn&#039;t a one time thing - it&#039;s a lifestyle! I&#039;m constantly finding more ways to limit what I own and find freedom from &quot;stuff!&quot;]]></description>
