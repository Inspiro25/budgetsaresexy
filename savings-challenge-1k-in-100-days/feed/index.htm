YES to all of this!!! I&#039;m at $3,825.34 for the year so far with those &quot;Spavings&quot; ;)

The point is more about pushing your limits than it is the actual money, although of course that&#039;s a bonus win from it haha...

Good luck killing that mortgage so early - that&#039;s going to feel amazing!]]></description>

The other thing I&#039;ve done in the past is to bank on the things I was going to buy but decided against.  Was going to buy something on Amazon, decided against it?  Put the money away.  You were going to spend it anyway.  Did that a few years ago and saved $500.]]></description>

Or...look for ways to actually *save* money (reduce expenses) to equal $1000 in 100 days,  not just to put that money aside?  Double-check the quotes for your insurances, use coupons on something and save the difference, drop an unused subscription?  I&#039;m in the same boat as Joe right now but that was what I&#039;m thinking of doing to hop into the challenge.  I&#039;m paying down my mortgage with the savings - goal is to be done by July 16, 2023 (23 years early).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually did this last month, by selling a bunch of stuff around the house that we no longer need. Generated $1,130 in cash on FB Market in less than 2 weeks, and as a bonus gained a bunch of storage space in my garage/shed. Sold 2 BBQ Grills, a generator, power tools I have multiples of, camping equipment, and even a bunch of Christmas lights.......Hoping to start round 2 in the next couple of weeks, although may be more difficult to get to $1,000 this time.........Love your blog, keep up the creative content!!]]></description>
