Haha... how were you supposed to know it wouldn&#039;t be as good? :) I&#039;d have done the same thing really. Though I would have called it more of a &quot;trying new places out&quot; type of adventure like you already know the Melting Pot is awesome and wanna see if this one compares. But too late now I suppose... If she gets mad at things like that I&#039;d be more concerned about what the future would hold. Too much drama for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the opposite experience. I used a Groupon to take my girlfriend to a Fondu place and she got upset at me. The Fondu place was, basically, not as good as the Melting Pot and she preferred to go to Melting Pot. So the Groupon ended up getting me in trouble because she thought I was cheap and didn&#039;t want to take her to the nicest place. I may have screwed it up by saying the place with the Groupon was not as nice as Melting Pot, but still using the Groupon got me in trouble.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I bet :)  I love me some Olive Garden too - wish there was one closer to me.
@&lt;b&gt;BrokeElizabeth&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! Your next ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - That helps!  You&#039;re right in that I think it depends on the area you are and what not to get some of these more interesting ones (and I know they don&#039;t hit all cities too - usually just the major ones), but good to know you can at least snag some deals here and there :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nononcentslife&lt;/b&gt; - For sure!  I&#039;m slowly becoming an expert on it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - You always find ways to save even MORE don&#039;t you, young lady? Haha... love it.  And yes - def. trying to get out while we&#039;re as free as we&#039;ll ever be!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Go out now while you still can! Babies change the dynamic a bit.
A reminder: If you buy your Groupon through a cash-back shopping site you will save an additional 3 to 6%. (The 6% figure was from Mr. Rebates.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We haven&#039;t found too many interesting places like you have where I live, but we do use Groupons for nicer restaurants and lots of sushi places. It&#039;s nice!]]></description>
