					<description><![CDATA[I just took the test, and scored 95%.  I think they might want to reconsider the advertising they put in the Results section though...  if you check off &quot;I own a home and have equity&quot; they put in a &quot;Refinance your mortgage&quot; button, encouraging you to borrow that equity right back.  Are they really looking out for my financial fitness doing that?  I know they&#039;re in the business of making money, but that one feels a little dirty to me...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just scored 94%.  Probably due to the fact that I&#039;m not currently regularily investing for retirement..bad I know!  We just finished paying off the debt and doing the emergency fund though so our goal is to start up again by January.]]></description>
