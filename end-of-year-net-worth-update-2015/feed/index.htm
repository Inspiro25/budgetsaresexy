Thanks! I actually recently read your review of PersonalCaptial.com and am considering it (or YNAB).]]></description>

No problem!

There are other apps and services out there btw that track it automatically for you if that&#039;s a route you&#039;re interested in as well. Places like Mint.com or PersonalCapital.com are free. Here&#039;s our review of Personal Capital: https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/personal-capital]]></description>

Thank you! I can&#039;t wait to try it. If it ends up not fitting my needs, then at least I have something to work from. Thank you so much.]]></description>

Thanks man :)

The value listed in my net worth reports is the latest estimate that my realtor values it at. Every 6 months or so I ask him to look at comps and then update his best guess from there. I&#039;ve tried using Zillow and the likes, but it fluctuates way too crazily and never seems to be accurate for my area. So the realtor route seems like the best option for us, and we&#039;re cool with the less frequent updates. Hope this helps :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a bit confused on the value you used for the house, was it based on an appraisal or was it the cost you acquired it? Regardless, congratulations on increasing your net worth so much over such a little amount of time - very great feat.]]></description>

Oh wow - you&#039;re easing into the freedom nicely! That&#039;s something I need to be better about here - cutting out the overtime/weekend work... I&#039;ve been a lot better than previous years, but I have to constantly remind myself not to become a workaholic or what&#039;s the point? I think the biggest problem I have is that I *enjoy* the &quot;work&quot; and anytime I think to myself - &quot;what would you like to be doing right now?&quot; in my spare time, I often dream up online projects to build haha... so I guess it&#039;s both good and bad, but I def. want to have less computer face time :) 

Anyways, congrats on the journey so far! Nice to take advantage and not make it an &quot;all or nothing&quot; type deal.]]></description>

Yes sir it will be. Right now I am working no overtime and 4 days a week most weeks. Have my blog that&#039;s growing slowly organically and my wife finishes RN school this year. Of course we have been living frugally, put in our time and hard work to get to this point but it was all worth it. We have been able to slow down a bit, enjoy life more and pursue what we love. We may not own the newest car or the best home on the block but we are content with our life style. We have less money stress and more options- financial independence is awesome!  My only regret is I wish I had started my journey towards financial freedom much sooner.]]></description>
