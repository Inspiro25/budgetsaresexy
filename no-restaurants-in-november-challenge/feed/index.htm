					<description><![CDATA[@J I still maintain pop tarts are only faster if you&#039;re eating them straight out of the box, skipping the toaster. If I have to eat a cold breakfast on the go, I&#039;d go with a dry turkey sandwich. 
And I can share two different egg tips to get you going faster.  1)Cook the eggs in the microwave. Crack and egg into a microwave safe bowl w/ a tablespoon of milk, a bit of salt &#038; pepper (and cheese!) and give it a quick whisk to integrate the yolk. Then nuke it for 60 seconds.  Not my favorite way to cook eggs, but they do come out nice and airy.  If that&#039;s not your thing, or your one of those weird people without a microwave, cook your eggs the night before and put them in the fridge.  I&#039;ll put cold eggs on bread and put it in the toaster oven to toast the bread and warm up the eggs.

@Geoff The biggest thing my wife and I fought about when we first got married was eating out.  She was used to bachelorette living that included eating out 4-5 times per week and I grew up in the country where the nearest fast food was 20 minutes away (stops being fast at that point).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to say that I can easily do this, but the challenge is that I travel at least one weekend a month if not more.  When traveling, the thought of stopping at a grocery store to purchase food to assemble seems too time consuming.  However, I love a challenge and I also love the idea of not having to choke down another fast food burger on the road!

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an awesome idea!  I really should try that some month but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible for us as I get cravings even during the week I have to fight.  However during the colder months, it seems that it would be easier since there is less desire to venture in the cold.  I envy people that can eat out less.  When I was a kid, I remember only going out to eat once a month and I was perfectly content.  Why can&#039;t I be like that anymore?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just have to clarify regarding the pop-tarts.  We eat a real breakfast every day, not pop-tarts.  Pop-Tarts are dessert!  Never frosted.  I like the doughiness of the unfrosted ones :D  These days, I can only find the strawberry unfrosted, but I think there was a time when they made brown sugar cinnamon.  I liked those, too.  One of my husband&#039;s specialties at work is cookies, chocolate chip being everyone&#039;s favorite, and he brings some home to me when he makes them.  I only took up my childhood habit of eating pop-tarts recently, because I was beginning to feel deprived when my husband did not bring home dessert from his work!  LOL.]]></description>
