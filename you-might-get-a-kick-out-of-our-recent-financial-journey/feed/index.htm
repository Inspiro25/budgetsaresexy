					<description><![CDATA[Update from the author:

We sold our rental property last week and walked away with ~$60,000 in proceeds after the mortgage was paid. So, our sole remaining debt is a student loan for ~$42,000! No personal lines of credit, no credit cards, and no car loans remain! 

Woohoo!!! I know that I&#039;m blowing my cover, but I&#039;m an open book! 

Baby boy #2 should be here anytime in the next few days to few weeks!]]></description>

I was shocked to see those debt interest rates too! I’d be hard pressed to find any investments earning more than that interest rate, and if I was losing money on my investments vs debt Id cash it out in a quick hurry! They could be non liquid of course though.]]></description>

Just read your bio on your site - sounds like it! Welcome to the land of peace now though it seems, at least career-wise :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, you know what Steve Jobs says: you can only connect the dots looking backwards.
My life story has been nothing short of ordinary either. It&#039;s been a long and tiring journey, but certainly worth it so far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to play online texas hold&#039;em poker when it was really popular in the late 2000s.  It was mainly for fun and didn&#039;t really make a lot of money out of it.
Thanks for sharing your story and providing us your numbers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chelsea- my eyes are bugging as well....
Accidental Home Birth- So glad you got through that without major hiccups! Makes a great conversation starter.......I do have to say that your financial journey made me need to take a moment of silence.... And just send happy thoughts and good wishes your way. I hope the house sells, the new baby is healthy, the business grows and that 2018 is better than you expected.]]></description>

Haha yeah - people like to beat themselves up on that (&quot;if only I invested in XyZ!&quot;) but the odds of them staying in for the long haul are so small that they would have just beaten themselves up more even if they *did* invest (&quot;if only I waiting 5 more years to cash out!!&quot;) :) This is partly why I just stick to my index funds so I can be invested in all of it long term and not tempted to do any more timing of the markets... I&#039;m too old for that now, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article -- the LWR is an interesting concept, although heavily skewed by investments and time in the market.  Gotta love those folks who bought what they knew in the &#039;90s and invested in, for example, the Starbucks IPO.  The returns from something like that are really mind boggling -- $10,000 turning into $1.9 million if you never touched it (a big if!!)]]></description>
