					<description><![CDATA[I have a better chance of winning a million dollars than knowing what I&#039;m going to eat tomorrow.  Why?  Because I hate to cook and I hate how much time it takes to buy the food, prepare it, eat it, and clean up after it.  Aside from that, we are really busy with our kids.  Not really a good excuse but it&#039;s the truth.  ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, I don&#039;t know. The kids are out of state visiting their dad for spring break. With just the hubby and I at home, our diet has went to crap.  It&#039;s been pizza rolls and sandwiches all week because none of us want to cook. I am notorious for spending hours researching and planning but I fail at the execution. lol   So, while I may think tomorrow will be another day of cereal, sandwiches and pizza rolls...we may wake up and decide we are going to go out.  lol  Yay for spontenaity that only comes around a couple of times a year.  : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do know what we&#039;ll be eating tomorrow! I don&#039;t plan breakfasts or lunches, but my dinners are always planned. Tomorrow is a roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, homemade bread, gravy, &#038; veggies! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an awesome idea!  Wish I&#039;d thought of it.  My meal plans are not only seasonal, they are almost exclusively based on my CSA, so they would probably be of interest to only  my fellow CSA members. :-)

Tomorrow we are having leftover tri-tip (which I am cooking tonight), creamed kale and collard greens, and probably a rice/quinoa mixture (that I will use in Monday&#039;s dinner of stir-fried bok choy, rice, and eggs).  I haven&#039;t planned past Monday, because Tuesday is CSA pick up day.

Meal planning saved me from ordering pizza last night...long week, really tired, MIL visiting...a short stop to pick up marinara sauce, and 30 mins later we had skillet pasta and steamed broccoli on the table.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@April: I used to shop the sales and hope everything would come together, but we&#039;d inevitably be left with two items that should never be mixed. Hope you&#039;re more successful than our chicken and potato chip night was.
@Sharon V.:Sliced avocado is a great side, and in season. Sounds like you have the shopping under control.
@Sarah E. Welch: Hope we can help you out!
@Grace L.: Actually, a dinner of vegetables sounds quite good. Just make sure you&#039;re getting fiber and protein.
@Erin: I love in-law dinners, but I haven&#039;t had good ribs since we left Las Vegas. 
@MindLess: That&#039;s awesome. My husband and I started out similarly. We wrote down a list of 90 meals and tried not to overlap any. It was excellent.
@Steve: Buffalo Wild Wings get the rave review.
@Sarah R.: Good call. Pot roast is something easy to turn into multiple leftovers.
@Amber: Even we make the occasional late night run. :)
@Liz: Thank you! Starting a meal plan is great...and you&#039;ve already got creative down. Shrimp Pad Thai? Yum!
@Carol: I totally understand. Sometimes it&#039;s just a lot of effort, especially when you&#039;re on your own.
@Dan: Happy to help. Stay-at-home mommies need all the help they can get sometimes.
@Jamie: Thank you very much.
@Barbara Fink: We&#039;ll think good date thoughts for you. Hopefully good dinner and good company.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually try to cook on Sunday for food for the week, however, the food is usually gone by Thursday.  Breakfast- toast and coffee, Lunch- no idea and Dinner- no idea (hopefully a date takes me out).]]></description>
