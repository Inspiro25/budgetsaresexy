					<description><![CDATA[Dude this is awesome! You&#039;ve given me such inspiration. I&#039;m in the process of &quot;releasing&quot; my Real Estate focused finance blog and I&#039;m looking for ideas on writing style and process. I could sit and read your stuff all day which almost never happens with a blog. I&#039;m glad I found you early on! My favorite part about this entire page was putting real life into your numbers. I definitely think I&#039;m going to start tracking my net worth more closely and add life events that have contributed to that. It&#039;s been a wild ride so far!]]></description>

Yup! So much more to this stuff than just the numbers... Fun to look back overtime too and see how things have changed based on our decisions/stuff that&#039;s happened to us :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite is definitely the last one. Graphs can be so boring and lack context, but a few comments and call outs can make a huge difference, especially when you&#039;re looking at something that spans a decade of time like your net worth chart.]]></description>
