We&#039;ll see how it all goes. I have multiple policies with this provider, I&#039;m not sure if that makes a difference price-wise but if I have to change ins companies I&#039;ll probably swing all my policies over at the same time.
Good call on the &quot;cash discount&quot; - I&#039;ll ask when I start getting quotes, although I&#039;m not sure it&#039;ll actually help me pay less than the full deductible.
Cheers J!]]></description>

I was going to make the same comment.  I used to sit next to a colleague who was a former claims adjuster with many years of experience, and he gave me the same warning when I had to file for my roof damage in 2017.  I ended up with a full roof replacement, as well.  I just made sure to have an arborist come out that year to assess the 4 Bradford Pears that were on the north side of my house, since they were nearing the end of their short life spans and are known to develop rot spots and split in large chunks.  One was likely to strike part of the house if what we were looking at did turn out to be a rot spot.  Such a claim would have resulted in our insurance likely being dropped.  (We ended up having to have the trees removed in late 2019, and only just now planted new trees).  That being said, we did everything right, but the insurance company still decided to mostly pull out of the state and out from the agent who wrote the policies here about a year and a half later.  So, we ended up having to pay for higher rates anyway since we had to find another insurance carrier and had the claim on our record.  Once it falls off we will more aggressively shop around.  As far as being out the deductible, our roofer offered a cash discount (completely legal) and we actually didn&#039;t end up out any money.  Our deductible was $1000, though. I think it still worked out well in the end, since our roof would&#039;ve otherwise cost $10K (ranch home).  Best of luck to you on your roof replacement.  It was fun to watch the work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, Texas is getting pretty well known for its natural disasters.  I live in the Houston area and we get hit by hurricanes (and the recent freeze) all the time. I can&#039;t wait to retire and moved to San Antonio to get out of hurricane alley! Of course then I&#039;ll have to worry about hail storms.  I guess there is no city safe from natural disasters anymore?]]></description>

Hey SL! Yes we owned this place in 2016 and I recall a storm back then but there was no damage to the roof.  Great questions about the new roof warranty and whatnot - I will ask when finding the new contractor when we&#039;re ready to replace.

As far as busy roofers and costing more... from my understanding even if it does cost less in a few months, I will still be out my full deductible. The insurance company won&#039;t let me &#039;profit&#039; from this claim. I&#039;m going to wait regardless, but cost isn&#039;t my concern.]]></description>

Thanks for the advice Laura! It&#039;s funny how insurance is supposed to help you sleep better at night... but the more I read and learn about this industry, the *less* good I feel about it all haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thought on home insurance claims. My uncle had the unfortunate situation to have multiple natural disasters hit his home in a relatively short period of time. After the second claim, his insurance company dropped him and he had to get the expensive &quot;untrustworthy person&quot; insurance for a few years until he could get back on the normal one. He asked my cousin, who sells insurance, about that and my cousin said that is the industry standard. So just be aware if you&#039;re making smallish claims and maybe save your two claims for the big expenses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another good reason to wait until hail season is over if possible is that roofing companies will not be as busy, demand will not be as high, and some may offer incentives to complete your roof which they wouldn&#039;t during the time of year they are in demand. In 2016, when the ZOMG Hail storm seemed to rip up half of South Texas, I HAD to have mine done as it crashed through my skylights. I was at the mercy of any roofing company&#039;s time schedule on the first-come/first serve emergency. Some people with damage that could wait had to wait almost a year for availability.

Questions for your roofer you/your property manager needs to have for you are:
How long is the roof warrantied for? Do they have a guarantee on their work? What kind of lifetime roof are you willing to pay for based  on the number of hailstorms that go through. 

PS - Did you own this home in 2016? Was the roof damaged/repaired/replaced then? If so, was anything warrantied? That does not disappear with a new homeowner. Would this be covered, even partially, under that warranty?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy Friday Joel!

Sorry to hear about your roof... that&#039;s never fun. At least you have a cooperative insurance company that seems to make the claim filing process fairly easy, so that&#039;s definitely good news! 

When I first read about the cost of roof repairs, I was astonished by how expensive they can be! It&#039;s incredible to see how expensive roofs can be. 

By the way - I can&#039;t even imagine an 8-inch diameter-sized hailstone!!

Cheers,

Fiona]]></description>
