					<description><![CDATA[1. I wasted money on two beers while watching a concert. $12 a piece just b/c they&#039;re inside a concert venue? Awful. Usually they&#039;re about $5 at a bar.
2. I used a Groupon to join a local sailing club. I had never been in a sailboat before, and now I know how to sail on my own! Best $30 I&#039;ve spent in a while.
3. Three bucks and some change.
4. No. I have nothing to do at my job over the summer, and I&#039;d rather sit here getting paid to do nothing and take time off during the busier times of the year.
5. No, I knew that IPO was too high, so I didn&#039;t buy. I&#039;m not a fan of their business model, so I don&#039;t think I will buy.
 **BONUS** I&#039;m a hardcore Democratic activist, so I&#039;d take the opportunity to talk progressive taxation, ending oil subsidies, single-payer healthcare, comprehensive immigration reform, and national funding for education.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man these always make me smile.

1. Clothes. I bought a dress at an outlet store. It was originally $90, got it for $60. I&#039;m actually returning it this weekend, so it&#039;s not a total waste.
2. Got a really nice leather purse for $20 at the end of March. I&#039;ve been using it every day and it&#039;s held up well. I&#039;d say that&#039;s a good deal.
3. Nothing in my pocket. $2 in my purse.
4. Since I&#039;m over halfway through my day, I&#039;d take the $100!
5. No and no. Considered it for about 2 minutes when my dad asked me if I was buying it, but then solidified my no.

BONUS: Oh man this would be fun. I&#039;d ask him a ton of &quot;would you rather&quot; questions while drinking White Russians at my favorite bar. And of course, get lots of pics with him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.  Upgraded a flight to first class.  It wasn&#039;t completely necessary, but I had a bad foot in a boot and had spent the previous day driving 8 hours round trip to get an emergency passport instead of being on my originally booked flight.
2.  Scored a new pair of athletic shoes on Amazon today for $49.99.  Paid around $80 for an identical pair at a shoe store last November.
3.  An emergency $20 in my wallet.  I generally don&#039;t carry or pay with cash.  I like tracking all of my purchases and find it easier to do with my debit card.
4.  I&#039;d leave for the rest of the day for $20...it wouldn’t take much.  
5.  No and no.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Wasted money on this vending machine...we were out and hungry with no snacks (I&#039;m usually overprepared in that dept) but hey the machine has that popcorn we love and score! it&#039;s the last one...and we put the money in and it did that thing where the bag gets stuck and doesn&#039;t drop so we had to put my last dollar in it to get it out, I know it&#039;s petty and small but it&#039;s that stuff that adds up to big waste, the munchkin thought it was funny tho so maybe I can put it under the &quot;entertainment&quot; budget...

2. Got a deal on gas.  My parental unit loves giving gift cards and needed to buy a bunch for all the graduating kids, and just happened to be visiting so I took her to my local grocery store and swiped my rewards card and got the fuel points - $1.69 a gallon... hello!

3. Cash all gone, see answer at #1

4. Now I&#039;m not going to make the same mistake I did reading into the bills/jail question on the billionaire quiz and I&#039;m gonna answer the question as written... SOOOOO yes I would take the day of work cuz I work nights! ;)

5. My family plays the stock market game and all I hear about is how much money they&#039;ve lost and how easy it was to make a profit pre 9-11, and I find it disgusting and wasteful so No and No to any stock

6. Love the bonus question... check this out... I would sit him down at brsexy and have him reply to everyone who posted an answer to number six and totally bump up J$&#039;s site, but not being a total saint I would come up with the best way to make money on fiver.com by maybe selling his voice or a personalized outgoing vm message or autograph or pic for something (I have a green screen in my photog setup) oooo oooo oooo and I&#039;d make him autograph every sporting item I have in my house and donate it to all of my local kids clubs teams so they could auction them off AND I get a tax write off to cover all the extra money I make on fiver.... screw the politics stuff... i&#039;m a hustler baby, i just want you to know... 

@Marilyn - I so wish I&#039;d wasted my money on that instead!
@Emmy - I&#039;m so sorry your E.S.B. visit wasn&#039;t the best, but I hope you try again in better weather! we thought the views were worth it.  I was in NYC over Patty&#039;s day this year and HATED myself for buying the express pass for me and my sis, thinking it was such a waste of money but we had dinner plans afterward... and then I saw the lines and could not believe that we literally were escorted to the front of every single one.  I was expecting a separate sort of VIP line - nope.  So IMO esp. if it&#039;s a busy holiday, your time is worth the extra $.]]></description>
