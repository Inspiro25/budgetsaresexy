					<description><![CDATA[Yay! The first comment in years! :)

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d tap my brokerage account before a bank loan, personally. I consider my 401k not to be touched. Like you said, something big is going down if I ever consider taking a loan against it.
To note with Roth, you can take out the money you put it but you can only &#039;repay&#039; to the yearly limit. I looked into it for assessing funds to buy a house, but if I took out say 7000, I&#039;m capped at putting 5500 back in per year.]]></description>
