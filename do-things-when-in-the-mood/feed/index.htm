					<description><![CDATA[I started feeling sorry for myself and started wondering why I was going through all this craziness for braces.  Then I read this interview and I realized I was being lazy and dumb.  So I took control and walked into Orthodontist appointment with gauze hanging out and my lip slightly askew.  It was very empowering to do something like that.  Anyway, long story short, I think I scared a little kid and now have a funny story to tell at parties HA!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;bogofdebt&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah I think you&#039;re right about that.  People have to really WANT the change in order for them to start acting on it.  At least we&#039;ll be here when they&#039;re ready for us to help though! :)
@&lt;b&gt;KC @ PsychoMoney&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a great question actually. Every day I get new readers to the site (hence me leaving in that first q&amp;a up there on why I started BudgetsAreSexy) but not too sure how to make these posts more exciting.  Maybe they do help people but they just don&#039;t tell me?  I&#039;ll continue posting them up as I feel they&#039;re helpful though - most people read and never leave a comment anyways :)  Any post that excites me, I&#039;ll continue adding up.
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah that&#039;s true too.  Sometimes we don&#039;t have the luxury of picking *when* to do things - esp when it&#039;s work-related.  As long as we get most of our tasks done when in the mood though, that&#039;ll have to suffice :) And it&#039;s hard for me to blog too sometimes - I usually go back to my &quot;list of ideas&quot; in those cases, or do what you do and read others&#039; stuff to get pumped up (or to find something I can agree with or hate 100%, haha... all makes for more passionate blog posts!)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  You got that right, friend.  You&#039;ll only look like a freak temporarily anyways ;) It&#039;s those long-timer missions that need to stick in our minds and keep us going forward.  And one day your teeth are going to look amazing! yay!!!
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - Perfect summary.  Can you do those for me every day?  Maybe I&#039;ll do a &quot;5 seconds money managemnet&quot; site where it&#039;s just a brief summary for anyone with A.D.D., haha... that would be rad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some great down to earth advice here: 

Know yourself well enough to work with or around yourself
Seize inspiration when it&#039;s there!
You just have to get started, and use momentum to stay motivated
Managing your finances isn&#039;t hard
Pay attention, and take action!

Thanks for the blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow that was an awesome interview to read.  I think most of your advice applies to all of life.  Just start, stop wishing, stop whining and just take one step forward.  At least that is my take on what you said and my daily mantra.  Shit, today I got 4 teeth pulled for my adult braces and look like a freak, but you know what so f-ing what.  Tomorrow is always a new day, but you need to start whether you are in debt, look like a freak or just plain lazy, start today!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with doing things when you’re in the mood. It takes me twice as long to complete a task if I’m not in the mood for it than if I am. Although, sometimes I have to jump start myself on a task I’m dreading by doing a related task. Like if I don’t want to write a blog, I’ll read a few blogs to get me started or write something completely off topic. Then I think, “While I’m at the computer…” Six hours later, I’m done with a ton of tasks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By not exciting people you mean you dont get as many comments or as much traffic or something?  I wonder if as you get bigger and more first time visitors come to your site if it would be better then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent adivce.  I loved the it&#039;s not hard to manage your finances part especially.  Whenever money and budgeting comes up around my friends, its the first excuse given.   I just think they aren&#039;t motivated enough yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;KC @ PsychoMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah?  I&#039;ve tried it in the beginning a few times, but usually the &quot;interview&quot; style doesn&#039;t seem to excite people. So now I pick and choose the ones I think are important ;)  I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it!
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Love it.  So true too - if your brain thinks it&#039;s just 15 mins - even if you DO stop at that - it&#039;s soooooo much easier to get the ball rolling on things.  Good job on the wifey ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Eduardo&lt;/b&gt; - Anytime buddy!  I consider you a good blogging friend, so always feel free to reach out :) As you can see it made a good blog post for me too!  Win-Win, baby.  Also, I give mad respect to those who WANT to reach out to others and pick their brains - it shows you&#039;re a very smart man and always eager to learn.  So keep it up! One of the best ways to grow :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea to share it with your readers, J. I think some of these questions might have been in their heads too!!!
I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to do this. If you remember, when I first sent you an e-mail to tell you I wanted to meet you, I used the &quot;pick your mind&quot; term... and I think getting to know your thought process behind all these topics and your own motivation to get involved is really valuable stuff!!! 
I would also want to let you know that the first part of the interview had lots of visits yesterday. I think there&#039;s other people out there interested in knowing what you think, what you&#039;ve learned, and your overall experience.
Big thanks!!!! And yes, I split it in 2 parts. The second one will be published next Monday.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff.  I like the &quot;take action&quot; advice, too.  If I&#039;m not motivated sometimes I force myself to &quot;just do 15 minutes&quot; with no distractions.  Usually by the time I&#039;m 10 minutes in I&#039;m focused and keep going until it&#039;s done.  (It&#039;s also how I got my wife to do a budget with me years ago for the first time - &quot;Just spend 15 minutes going over some numbers with me.&quot;]]></description>
