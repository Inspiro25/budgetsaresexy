					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate someone who can talk about personal finance and not sit on a high horse. Most people become serious about personal finances because in the past they were so irresponsible! It&#039;s refreshing to hear someone&#039;s failures instead of their cookie cutter success story. Good pick!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. That was an &#039;interesting&#039; read. Dave has gone from being a Jack the lad,cocaine snorting, stereotypical London Estate Agent with bad friends and self esteem issues to living like a monk with a touch of residual misogyny. The maths is questionable as is the back and forth between British and American English. To be honest I&#039;m wondering if someone is trolling you J$? Either way I don&#039;t think this lives up to the quality of your usual recommendations or is a sustainable guide to financial health. 

(Sorry if this is harsh, I have tried to soften my initial thoughts)]]></description>
