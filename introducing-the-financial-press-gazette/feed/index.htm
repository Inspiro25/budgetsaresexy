					<description><![CDATA[@myfinancialobjectives - I stay up all hours of the night working on stuff - gotta hustle in case the ol&#039; 9-5 goes away!  but you should totally do that reggae blog, I&#039;d sign up to read it :)

@Double My Net Worth - Appreciate the honesty brotha.  There actually is an rss feed button there on the right sidebars (at the top) but I suppose I could always make it bigger.  Thx for checking it out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good concept.  I checked out your site and I do have to admit I like the content.  Not particularly a great looking site like everyone else says but I am sure over time as it starts to generate revenue for you, you will transform it into a ultra-cool, modern, hip-hop look that&#039;s popping news here and there in a flash.

Sorry, couldn&#039;t help myself from talking like you for a bit there.  You may want to include an RSS feed in your sidebar to generate further attention and direct your readers over there.  There&#039;s just too many blogs out there with the same materials but so far, I like what you have to offer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea, and a great looking site so far.  I love this idea, I&#039;ve been toying with the idea of starting another website (about reggae actually), but was under the impression I don&#039;t have time... How do you manage both!  You must be one efficient productive sonofa!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha...well, if it helps it&#039;s not really &quot;advice&quot; more than it is just alerts about financial things happening ;)  I think some of my friends just skim the headlines for quick info (perfect for those with A.D.D.!)]]></description>
