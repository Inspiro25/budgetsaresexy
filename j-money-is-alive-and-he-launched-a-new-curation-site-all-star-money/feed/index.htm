					<description><![CDATA[Good stuff J!

Fascinating you don’t miss the writing part at all. I wonder if I’ll be the same if I ever sell my site.

I’m making the commitment to hold onto my site until I get an idea of what my kids are like. If they are really lazy and lacking in intellectual horsepower or effort, I might just keep my site longer as career insurance for them! Because if they have a tough time getting a job, at least they can get one from me!

At eight years old, can you tell what your oldest will be like? I’m assuming by 12-15 years old, we have a good idea of how our children will turn out. Of course, we can still be very wrong.

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome to hear from you, J$! 

All-Star Money looks great, btw. And with you at the helm, I&#039;ve got no doubt it will be a huge success!]]></description>

That&#039;s awesome :)  I&#039;ve definitely gained a new appreciation for dogs having Sadie. And I&#039;m sure the kids love having another play pal around. 

And Sadie came to us as &quot;Mama&quot;--feels like a variation of &quot;Baby Girl&quot;]]></description>

Hey bud! Always enjoy seeing you online! That coffee one came out of nowhere and my wife still can&#039;t believe I&#039;ve gone for it,  haha... For some reason I just keep looking for new ways to challenge myself and that one was a biggie to tackle!! Though hit me when I&#039;ve gone to zero and I&#039;d be *really* impressed with myself ;)]]></description>

Oh man, haha, now THAT&#039;S a compliment - thank you!! Going right now to add that to my &quot;love&quot; doc whenever I need combat from the haters!! :)

But yes - &quot;community&quot; is def. on our future ideas list, just not sure what or when yet... But 100% agree that comments/forums/etc all make the experience better with this stuff, and honestly I wouldn&#039;t still be hanging in this community without them myself! Who wants to just type words out into the abyss??! It&#039;s always been about the people to me, so my goal is to always figure out a way to work it in when possible :)

really nice comment - thank you again so much!]]></description>

Personally I&#039;m just glad to be back at it again so if it ends up taking off like Rockstar did that&#039;s great, but if not (and I get to keep my job! lol) then that&#039;s fine too :) Though of course you always want your projects to succeed! I think we all do things a little bit differently though so there&#039;s plenty of room for all of us in the space... And I&#039;m constantly cheating and seeing what gems they find as I often miss good stuff every now and then too! So hopefully they&#039;ll cheat off me too! :)]]></description>

Very cool!! And yup! Will def. be hopping on some new shows here shortly and enjoy doing that 1,000% more than hosting your own :) You just get to do the fun parts of talking about money while the other person does all the hard work and markets it! Lol... Though I do miss hanging with Paula - that was the best part :)]]></description>

Haha nice!!

We call her &quot;Baby Girl&quot; since it&#039;s the only little gal we have in the house :) Haven&#039;t had a dog since I was a kid so it&#039;s been a learning curve having one as an adult but it&#039;s been great... Outside a lot more and of course the kids just adore her :) Maybe one day she&#039;ll meet Sadie!]]></description>
