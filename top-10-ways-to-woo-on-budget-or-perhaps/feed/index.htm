					<description><![CDATA[J. Here is one more for your bucket...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a fortune cookie and hold it over steaming water. This softens it. Gently open to remove the standard fortune and insert you own custom note. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this on our 10th anniversary to propose to my wife again. The whole family still talks about it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the post it notes! One of my favorite Valentine&#039;s memories was when my husband and I were dating. He wrote down 100 reasons why he loved me and hid them in my room, in my car, in my school stuff, everywhere! It took me a long time to find them all, but everytime I found one, it made me smile :)]]></description>
