					<description><![CDATA[I love sharing and discussing my goals with other people. I haven&#039;t gotten any help from them, but it&#039;s opened up a lot of topics and it feels great to be inspired and inspire others. Talking about what I want to accomplish opens up the conversation about finance a lot easier than any other method I&#039;ve found. It puts myself out there first and then other people feel more comfortable opening up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a lot of success by telling people my goals lately. I finally told my BFF about my blog and my goal to pay off my debt (and stop shopping). She&#039;s helped keep me accountable when we are together and that&#039;s awesome! I&#039;m still not perfect and it&#039;s not 100% her job to make sure I don&#039;t spend on something I shouldn&#039;t (obviously), but it sure makes it easier having her support.]]></description>

Yeah, people get weird with that stuff. I personally LOVE when people tell me what they want/need for weddings or even birthdays/xmases - it&#039;s the worst adding clutter to someone&#039;s lives...

We tried one of those &quot;honey funds&quot; type things for our wedding where people could help pay for our honeymoon and activities on it. Technically they just gave us cash towards it, but you tied it to something like &quot;help w/ airfare&quot; or &quot;dinner out&quot; &quot;Massage&quot; etc, so it was like giving an experience... Not everyone liked it, but enough did to cover everything which was great :)]]></description>
