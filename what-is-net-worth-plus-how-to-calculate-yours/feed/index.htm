					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this article! Catching up over the weekend :-)

I owe it to this blog for helping me start to track my net worth, back in 2018. I feel that it is very important to track as how can you measure progress on ANYTHING if you don&#039;t track it.

My family is up to about $ 800,000 now, and I think a lot of good guidance from this blog and other resources will help us get over the $ 1,000,000.....

Cheers!]]></description>

Aussie Aussie Aussie! Great to hear you&#039;re tracking and growing that NW! I&#039;ve been using Mint for almost a decade! But as my net worth grew and I started acquiring rental properties and investing in private partnerships, it became easier to build my own net worth spreadsheet. I still use Mint to track all my expenses, daily.  Cheers Jasper!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article Joel! I think Mint and Personal Capital are great platforms to track your net worth. I’m a 21-year-old from Geelong, Australia with a net worth of less than $10,000. I definitely plan to start building it up in the future!]]></description>

Hey TB! Congrats on your kickass growth over the last 6 years!

Personally, I don&#039;t include any &#039;gift&#039; accounts in my NW. I have 4 nephews with &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/giving-stock-ugma-custodial-account/&quot;&gt;UGMA accounts&lt;/a&gt; (like 529&#039;s but not for education) and there&#039;s prob $15k in these accounts. Because the money is *not mine* I don&#039;t add it to my NW.  If I did, it would artificially inflate my overall worth and maybe I&#039;d be under false pretenses when I hit my FIRE number. Know what I mean?  I keep my NW personal - and any gifted money out, even if it&#039;s under my control as a custodian.

Also, some people list their cars, jewelry, and other possessions as assets in their NW. I leave these things out, because they&#039;re not income producing assets that are helping me build wealth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just calculated our Net Worth as of the end of August earlier today!  I&#039;ve been tracking our net worth since 2014, but I&#039;ve only been doing it monthly for the last 12mos.  During that time I&#039;ve seen our net worth grow by 2.5 times from $250K (age 29) to $630K (age 35).

I was reviewing our net worth calculations, specifically my investment accounts, and noticed that we always back out our children&#039;s college savings plan (529 Plan).  After a little bit of research, I realized that I should probably including it as an asset, even though it&#039;s not for my benefit.  

Joel, what are your thoughts on including 529 Plan amounts as assets in the net worth calculation?]]></description>
