What&#039;s funny is I MUCH prefer talking about money than writing about it! haha... It&#039;s too bad there was a disconnect somewhere as it did have some good potential going into it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really sorry to hear you&#039;re leaving the podcast, it has been keeping me company for the last week or two on my commutes to and from work and I&#039;ve been really enjoying it. I really liked the dynamic between the two of you, with your different approaches to things. Best of luck with whatever comes next and I&#039;ll still be listening to Paula as she goes solo.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bummer dude. I thought you were very entertaining, friendly, and natural sounding on the podcast. Nothing was forced or sounded awkward!

At least you have an &quot;in&quot; if you ever want to get interviewed on Paula&#039;s podcast now!

I&#039;ve struggled to make it on more podcasts. I&#039;m happy to talk to folks, but nobody is coming a knocking. Am I too intimidating?! :p

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear this, Jay; as you say though these are good reasons to retire from podcasting. And you know, some people were born to the &#039;written word&#039; while others can do all the talking :).]]></description>
