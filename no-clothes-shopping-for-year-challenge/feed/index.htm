					<description><![CDATA[I probably could. I don&#039;t work in an office, so I don&#039;t need nice work clothes.  And I don&#039;t really like shopping anyway. I&#039;d probably just ask for clothes for birthday, anniversaries and Christmas. Does that count? :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Cherron&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that&#039;s perfectly understandable though :) In a lot of financial places you could get in trouble too if you don&#039;t dress nice and sharp all the time! Just a part of the job.
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - I give you permission to make an exception for them :)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal @ Get A Copywriter&lt;/b&gt; - Would I be in trouble if I told you I bought something from Amazon like twice a week? Don&#039;t tell anyone! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ms. S&lt;/b&gt; - Work it, yo! That&#039;s wonderful - you&#039;re almost there!
@&lt;b&gt;Chrysilla&lt;/b&gt; - You know, I think you&#039;re right about those dryers and what not. Technology is good, but there&#039;s nothing wrong with the old fashion way of doing things too! Thanks for bringing back good memories of my childhood too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Suzanne&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! Saving money is a different kind of sexy ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sure. I would no problem doing this. Over the years my values have changed. I no longer give a bleep about clothes and shoes, although, I have to admit I&#039;ve got some nice clothes from years past to last me awhile. I live in comfortable clothes and work from home.  I used to think nothing of spending $300 per month on clothes when I had an upscale retail store. Not anymore. I&#039;d rather live simply and put the money in the bank.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I could. I actually really need to stop buying so many clothes, tho this year I can at least make the excuse that after being sick for 18 months and gaining a bunch of weight lots of things just didn&#039;t fit anymore. But I think I&#039;ve got my new wardrobe sorted now.  And while I&#039;m feeling better and starting to lose that weight very slowly, I also own a sewing machine, so if I happen to shrink out of the new clothes I can just tailor them in a bit.

I barely have the space for it, but I also hang-dry all the clothes I really like so they last longer (jeans and sweats are expendable, tho). Driers seem to break down fabric waaaaay more than soap &#038; washing machines. When I was a kid my parents didn&#039;t even own a drier, and I still own some tshirts from childhood that are older than I am ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doing that this year and it hasn&#039;t been difficult at all.  Two more months to go and I will have gone a whole year without shopping.  Well I bought a new swimsuit for lap swimming but that&#039;s it. Since it&#039;s for fitness and not fashion wear I don&#039;t count that.  If I needed running shoes I&#039;d get those too, I consider those purchases fitness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually have gone without clothes shopping for a year.  It would have been two, but I needed $100 in new undergarments, lol.  It was from 2008-2010...I pudged up a bit, decided that I had enough work clothes, tshirts, and jeans, and I just stopped looking at clothes.  Then I lost 25 pounds and had to buy a few things for my new wardrobe.  To be completely honest though, I still only clothes shop a couple of times a year for something that wears out.  Now tell me I can&#039;t buy holiday decorations or random house items from Amazon for a year, and I would go bonkers...I think I buy something from Amazon every two-three weeks at least...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I could do this if I could classify shoes as an exercise expense. I&#039;m an avid runner and go through at least 2 pairs of running shoes per year. But other clothes? Ugh. Way too many!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I could do this in a SECOND if I worked from home and just hung out. It&#039;s the judgements of others (co-workers) that keeps me buying new blouses and slacks and trouser socks and shoes on the reg. I feel like I would be less respected if I dressed in worn clothing / and or if I wore the same clothes all the time. So superficial, but a fact of life if you work in finance / law with a lot of women.]]></description>
