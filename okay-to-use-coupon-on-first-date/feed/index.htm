					<description><![CDATA[Would I use a coupon on a first date? Absolutely and it wouldn&#039;t turn me off if the other person did either. Maybe I&#039;ve just gotten lax in my ways, but eating out in general is special for me and I think saving money doesn&#039;t take away from the specialness of it. The special part of the date should be the experience and the shared time together, not how much money someone does or doesn&#039;t spend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Melissa, I guess there is a &quot;too cheap&quot; that we all need to decide with this stuff.
@MMM, I hear ya.  I think as long as you&#039;re comfortable about it and the date goes well otherwise, it shouldn&#039;t make or break the chances for a second date.
@Alice, but what if they&#039;re just super smart with money and can somehow find deals to even great places...why not take you to great place A that allows a coupon over great place B that doesn&#039;t?
@HP, or could it be a point of where you felt comfortable with each other and saw some similarities in approaches towards money!
@WorkSaveLive, love it...use it depending on how the date goes!
@Nick, very original pickup line!
@Barb, love it!
@Richard, good way to straddle the line!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I&#039;d use a coupon on a first date.  Maybe after a few dates and you felt comfortable with her, but on the first date I think it would come across as &quot;cheap&quot; rather than &quot;frugal&quot;.  

But I do like the idea of bringing it just in case...if the date is going poorly and you already know you don&#039;t want to see her again you could feel free to whip it out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guys, guys--finesse! Hasn&#039;t anyone considered diplomacy? You excuse yourself, get the waiter, maitre d&#039; or whoever aside, tell them it&#039;s your first date with this lovely creature and you don&#039;t want her to think you&#039;re cheap but you do want to benefit from this coupon (that brought you here in the first place), so can you kindly apply it before presenting the bill? Thank you, my friend. I knew you&#039;d understand . . .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It would actually be a positive thing to me as I would think the guy might have a frugal head on his shoulders and be compatable with me!  Be who you are.  If you use coupons for most meals out (like I do) don&#039;t hide it.  I have found my life partner but if I hadn&#039;t I would be looking for someone with similar values and the confidence to live them, first date or not.]]></description>
