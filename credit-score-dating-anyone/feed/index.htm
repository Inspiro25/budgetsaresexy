					<description><![CDATA[This article was awesome!! Thank you. Being fairly new to the credit repair and credit score arena I am constantly trying to gather as much information as possible to try and keep myself headed in the right general direction. Spending some time on this post has actually given me a lot of great points to think about. In my recent research I have also been able to find some useful information related to this topic when I Googled the credit locker university. Thanks again!]]></description>

Well that&#039;s pretty interesting.... you&#039;re right, they DO look the same! But many successful companies duplicate templates and what not. Not saying they&#039;re legit or anything - I have no idea - but if it works for people?

A good reminder to be cautious though when doing stuff online, thx for the info :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Probably more about &quot;finding someone with a better match to yourself&quot; than explicitly ruling out those with horrible credit. I&#039;d imagine 95% of those signed up to that site have GREAT credit cuz that&#039;s why they&#039;re there! Haha... it would be dumb to apply with crap credit unless they&#039;re going for a &quot;save me&quot; type of person ;)

To me this is as similar as asking someone out on a date because you find them attractive. It&#039;s not that the less attractive aren&#039;t worthy of love, it&#039;s just you&#039;re concentrating on the one who makes you feel good for whatever reason. You could swap out attractiveness with &quot;funny&quot; or &quot;smart&quot; too - whatever trait you&#039;re drawn to.]]></description>

YUP!!!! Your debt-to-ratio was all messed up when you went down to 1 line, it&#039;s crazy, eh? because of that I just gamed the system a bit and pumped up my only two credit cards from $5k limits to around $30k limits each ;) That helped a lot and took me 5 mins on the phone! Haha... I don&#039;t need credit at the current time, but it WILL help when I go to refinance again later, you can bet on that. And since I&#039;m good at managing my money I don&#039;t have to worry about &quot;slipping&quot; and using all that credit up... So for all those reading this and wondering if they should do the same, just make sure you trust yourself enough!]]></description>
