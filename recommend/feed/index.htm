					<description><![CDATA[Here are some books to help you save money: 
The Complete Tightwad Gazette by Amy Dacyczan
Cut your Grocery Bill in Half! by Steve and Annette Economides
Make a Mix by Karine Eliason, Nevada Harward, and Madeline Westover
Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a day by Jeff Hertzberg and Zoe Francois
Don&#039;t Panic, Dinner&#039;s in the Freezer by Susie Martinez, Banda Howell and Bonnie Garcia.(Also, Don&#039;t Panic, More Dinner&#039;s in the Freezer)

The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey--This book was a life-changer for us.  We will be completely debt free, including our mortgage in one month. (Actually paid off house in 2017.We are paying off a car)I can&#039;t wait! Now, we didn&#039;t give up credit, because that was never a problem for us, but his book gave us easy steps to take to ditch debt. We are both 51 and working hard at getting those retirement accounts loaded. 
Some of these books may be out of print. Just go to your library or Ebay.]]></description>

Is he still alive? He can hook you up if so! If not, there are other online banks doing some pretty cool stuff out there. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/simple-bank-review/&quot;&gt;Simple Bank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/hot-new-financial-apps-fintech/&quot;&gt;Chime&lt;/a&gt; - they&#039;re relatively new in the online space and are using technology to make the banking experience much easier/better for people. I&#039;ve never used them personally since I&#039;m with USAA, but they&#039;ve got pretty solid fan bases.

If you like being able to walk into banks, I&#039;d hit up your local credit union and see what they offer. Most of them are pretty good since they&#039;re not-for-profit organizations and specifically set up to help the community :) Just depends on what you&#039;re really looking for.]]></description>

Hey - very cool!! You&#039;ll have to let me know what you think about it :)

Another I keep meaning to add to the list is &quot;Essentialism&quot; by Greg McKeown. Not really a finance book, per se, but one that would definitely change your life/career/money for the better if you follow the overall tone of it :)

Here&#039;s a mini-review I did on it last year if you wanna check it out - it really affected my life!

Thanks for the addition :) Never heard of before, but sounds like an investing one, eh? I tend to stick to my &quot;boring&quot; index funds and don&#039;t even dare try timing or hacking the market, haha...]]></description>
