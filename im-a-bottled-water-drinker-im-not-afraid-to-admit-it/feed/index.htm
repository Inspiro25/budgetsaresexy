					<description><![CDATA[I like it :)  I&#039;ve started drinking water in huge jugs at home, but it&#039;s def. hard to get used to... my water habits have been cut in 1/2 so far in the past week. it&#039;s just not as exciting to me as much as Dasani in a bottle, that&#039;s the only way I can explain it... I&#039;m not giving up yet though, wanna give it a good shot before reverting to my old ways.  Thanks for sharing what works for you!  I like it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, first of all there is a lot of other things out there to worry about besides berating someone for drinking bottled water.  In my eyes, if you are out and about and thirsty it is a much better choice than paying for a high fructose corn syrup laden soda.  And I would NOT drink tap water due to the chlorine &#038; flouride, and other yucky stuff in there that shouldn&#039;t be (I have to clean a pinkish-orange residue off my tub from the water that dries there...what is THAT stuff?)

My kids will most certainly always choose a cold bottle of water if it is available.
And I would rather them drink the water than soda, more juice, or more milk...
So for a while I was also buying the bottled stuff &#038; having it all the time.
But it is expensive, and everytime I saw that big stack of empty bottles it made me cringe...

So we bought a Berkey water filter.  It is expensive, but it will pay for itself in very little time.
It filters out everything, and the water tastes great.  And you can use it for emergency purposes also, like, if there was no water we could take the creek water and filter through it to drink.  And then we bought everyone an insulated stainless steel water bottle to use.  We just fill them up with our filtered water before we leave the house. I am never caught without mine! That thing does not sweat, and will keep ice in it for for over 12 hours!  Even if you have it out in the hot sun (soccer games) or leave it in your car.  (Got mine from flylady.net as it is the best I have been able to find anywhere! you can unscrew the top to put ice in it, and then drink out of the smaller spout...remember it needs to be &quot;double wall&quot; stainless steel or it is not insulated!)

I feel much better about our water habits now that I am not wasting so much money and not buying all that plastic...yet if I am out of water I will buy it and not feel guilty as I know I am doing what is best for my health at that moment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Paula, that means a lot :)  I actually went out and grabbed one of those large jugs of water at the grocery store, to see if that curbs my at-home drinking and so far so good!  It&#039;s only been one day, but I&#039;d call that a success :) I don&#039;t mind drinking water differently at home as long as it tastes good.  I&#039;ll still have to figure out water on my walks, but one step at a time...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, 85 comments? This post struck a cord with a lot of people ...

I say, do what you love! Money is for spending on the things you love, and the things that are important to you. If bottled water is so important to you that you&#039;re willing to write a post about it, then it&#039;s obviously worth your money. You&#039;ve clearly throught this through.

Personally, I do what your commenter Stefanie does -- put it in a Brita filter, and stick that filtered water in the fridge so it&#039;s nice and cold.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hah! I&#039;m the opposite of you -- I like my water room temperature, I can&#039;t drink it real cold cuz it gives me a headache :)  I think I drink too fast?  But yeah, I recycle everything - plastic, glass, cardboard, you name it.  It doesn&#039;t excuse my use of all those water bottles, but at least I&#039;m not chucking &#039;em all in the trash.  I&#039;m gonna start getting bigger jugs of the water from Safeway and drinking from a glass at home for a while and see what that does.  Though my biggest problem is going on walks and all and having to carry around a bottle with me for hours.  But lots of good ideas here in the comments for me :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dooooooode. I told you I was going to come back to this post and give you ish about it, so here goes.

I like the planet. I don&#039;t mind bottled water, BUT - I choose to use refillable water bottles when possible.

BUT MY THING IS (and I haven&#039;t read your 80 other comments so if I&#039;m duplicating something, sorry), I need water to be COLD, and I think icecubes made in my own freezer aren&#039;t as good. Maybe with refillable bottles stored in your fridge for on the go use, you might be more inclined? I am always getting water bottles as swag, so I have no shortage of bottles - and so I try to remember to keep a few filled up (with tap water) in my fridge ready for me to grab as I walk out the door. If it&#039;s cold, it doesn&#039;t taste like tap water to me. 

ULTIMATELY if the choice is bottled water or none, it&#039;s kind of crucial to your body systems that you stay hydrated, but dude, I&#039;m pretty sure you can kick the habit. (And actually, I get very pissy when people throw beer bottles away - recycle that shizz).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I think that&#039;s a smarter way to go for sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;LLF&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  That would def. solve my problem about carrying stuff! haha... i love it.
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - I agree w/ the home delivery, I really think that&#039;s where I&#039;m gonna end up landing on after all my tests :) I&#039;m fine with the &quot;luxury&quot; of bottled water (again, I prioritize my money on what&#039;s important to me so I&#039;m fine with that), but I want to change to be better about the environment.  And if I can keep hydrated the same way as now, but save on all that plastic, then I&#039;d def. call that a win.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally drink tap water that&#039;s been Brita filtered--but I have a more economically sound and environmentally friendly option for tap water haters.  Just get one of those water coolers (like Ozarka) delivered to your door monthly.  It&#039;s the same bottled water without the waste of a bunch of plastic bottles.  Problem solved!  No, you wont get to have your easily disposable bottles that you like having, but that is merely a luxury that budgeters should be able to do without.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$,  depending on how much you hate carrying a bottle when you go for your walks, you can try a fuel belt or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runningwarehouse.com/catpage-hydration.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; running waist pack&lt;/a&gt; (scroll down).  I use a amphibi single pack which lasts me a 3 mile run when it&#039;s 3/4 full.  I drink filtered stuff at home and we get 5 gallon bottles of water at the office.]]></description>
