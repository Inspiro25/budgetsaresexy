Hey Jacob! I wasn&#039;t actually tracking that particular property publicly -- but now that it&#039;s sold off I&#039;m starting to track it all in these accounts.  I have a couple private partnerships that we are keeping separate from public view.

I know what you mean though about zillow estimates and how you might be overvaluing places. Even my Duplex here I have valued at 250k in this NW report. But if I was to liquidate it after fees and commissions etc, I might have a 20k drop overall.  It&#039;s hard to know how to value property within NW reports... I guess as long as you realize transaction costs can set you back, just keep that in mind if you ever have liquidation plans.]]></description>

Hey Gary!  I have no idea how the market will perform this year. But, since my horizon is 10+ years I really only care what the market does over 10+ years. And I&#039;m confident we&#039;ll see growth in the long term :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome post Joel and congrats on the big NW jump!  I’m curious though, why weren’t you carrying the value of the property you sold in your net worth calcs prior to selling it?  Did you make more than your appraised value?  I carry a pretty agressive Zillow number for my units in my NW so if I sell I might even see a NW decline because I’m probably not accounting for closing costs adequately.  I’m also impressed with your low cash position.  I’m easing out of cash also having just purchased my $10k in I-Bonds which claim 7.12% return. I also just opened a public.com account and have bought a few individual stocks just for fun. Im prepared to lose all that and still be ok. Im a lot older than you though just turned 50.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats Joel! Looking at your NW update just a few months ago, it&#039;s shot up over $100k, which is incredible! I appreciated linking to the post on lump-sum investing is better than DCA for long-term time horizons, a well-needed reminder for those of us scratching our heads at how the market will perform for this year.]]></description>

Hey Steve! Yep, we have multiple credit cards to cover unplanned expenses and a line of credit against our brokerage account. Planning for emergencies is important, but for the most part &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lowering-my-emergency-fund-to-0-00/&quot;&gt;I no longer believe in cash emergency funds&lt;/a&gt;.

					<description><![CDATA[You are killing it! That&#039;s a huge net worth, especially for someone in their thirties.  I&#039;m curious, you said your normal target for cash is $5 to $10K.  That sounds low for an emergency fund and even lower for an emergency fund plus working capital.  I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re substituting something like credit cards with a high limit or a home equity line of credit in case of some major unplanned expense?]]></description>

Hey Katie! -- Here&#039;s the first post I wrote about it [&lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/solo-401k/&quot;&gt;Solo 401k w TD&lt;/a&gt;] and it has some stuff in there on why I chose TD instead of the other places...  And another good resource was The College Investor which I also reference in the article.  Feel free to hit me up via email if you want to chat further or have questions!!]]></description>

Since you are the plan owner, you can set your own rules. I believe by default, they allow 1 in-plan rollover per year. But, I think it&#039;s in your best interest to just keep it all in the Roth 401k and roll it all over in a large chunk later in life. There is zero downside keeping it in the roth 401k vs. IRA, they are essentially the same thing.]]></description>

Amazing. And I believe when you eventually roll it all over to the Roth IRA, it is all treated as a &quot;contribution&quot; (original contributions + growth). So you can withdraw a larger amount earlier if needed.]]></description>
