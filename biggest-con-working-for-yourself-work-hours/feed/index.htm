I&#039;ll agree that no job, whether working for yourself, or someone else, is ever solid. But usually a 9-5 tends to be more stable than going out on your own (depending on what the 9-5 is and also what &quot;going out on your own&quot; is as well).

As for blogging being a dumb business plan, well, that would be true if you were treating it as a blog and not a business ;) There&#039;s a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes most people are unaware of that make one blog worth $3 million and another $3.00 (and there are plenty of blogs in the finance niche who have sold for over a million dollars than most people know (and/or have even heard about)). 

So the fact it&#039;s a blog in itself shouldn&#039;t be the determining factor of whether it&#039;s dumb or not, but rather the strategy/goals behind it. Though I&#039;ll agree 99.9999% of blogs will never make a penny. Fortunately the one you&#039;re reading right now has more than supported a family for over 3 years...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading many comments about the stability of working a 9-5 job. Why do you believe working for someone elses business is more secure than your own. At any point your company you work for maybe having financial or market problems you don&#039;t even know about, and could Cal you into the office, hand you a severance package, and out you in the pool of unemployed and looking. The people you&#039;re working for....all started their own companies. Your job is at the whim of their business plan. Plus whatever work you do end up getting done isn&#039;t going to you, its going to them. You&#039;re getting about 10 to a 15 percent return on your efforts. If you are working for yourself, than chances are almost all your efforts will be going to you. This is why the only way to ever achieve real wealth and stability is to work for yourself. Blogging is a dumb business plan. In order to get yourself to the point of seeing returns on your efforts you have to become a household name...which, no offense, I don&#039;t see that happening with this one. Small businesses should be as simple as possible. You are serving/ selling x to y customer for z amount. Otherwise your &quot;small business&quot; is really just a project you decided to spend all of your time doing...so of course you may not make money working for yourself. You have no sellable service or product that you can sell right away!]]></description>

Wow, did NOT see that one coming when you started leaving this comment, haha... we don&#039;t get too many dairy farmers up in here, but love it! :) And so very very true about learning and researching - I often struggle with that too. In fact, it&#039;s one of the reasons I launched my latest site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://RockstarFinance.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RockstarFinance.com&lt;/a&gt;, because I wanted to network more and force myself to learn and research about what everyone else in the money blogging field was doing. So it&#039;s a perfect outlet for expanding my own horizons, but also promoting some of the best content out there since all the site does is curate these awesome articles I&#039;m finding :) Kinda like a Pinterest I suppose, only for money articles.

Thanks for stopping by and sharing, my man. Great insight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the biggest hurdles I had (and continue) to over come when working for yourself is realizing you have a lot to learn.  When working for an employer, chances are if you don&#039;t know how to do something another not far away in the company will teach you (assuming you are not too chicken to ask for help).  While you can still ask others for help when self-employed it can be much harder to find the people with the knowledge you want.  Basically this means you&#039;ll have to do your fair share of researching and learning a new skill on your own.  It can be mentally draining (especially when worrying about getting paid) yet extremely rewarding if manage to pull through.

In my case I get steady pay as a dairy farmer with learning how to run a plumbing business on the side.  Having a steady paycheck from farming helps take some of the financial sting out.  Still, learning a how to run a business from scratch has definitely been draining at times.  I&#039;ve learned much though and while I can&#039;t say I&#039;ll still be plumbing five years down the road many of the business management skills learned will definitely help when I take over the farm management.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a full time mystery shopper, I started working from home eleven years ago, leaving a position at the local school district as a supervisor. I can certainly relate to the people who say others do not think you have a &quot;Real job.&quot; Even my own husband has said things like, &quot;You are not really working, you are getting paid to shop, eat in restaurants and have fun.&quot; Really???? He forgot about the time it took to find the jobs, all the note taking and then the reporting, scanning and sending receipts, etc. I worked at least twelve hours a day and did not have a day off for many years. 

Now that I am the President of the Independent Mystery Shoppers&#039; Coalition, I work even more hours. However, I would not have it any other way. I love what I do and I love not having to deal with the politics and rantings of some of the crazies that are in positions of management. Although it is nice to be able to work in our pajamas, one downfall I have noticed from this is that I do not take as much time as I should to make myself look my best, which I believe prevents me from feeling my best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I just realized while reading this post:  I DO like the hustle; that is the real me!  Also, when I worked so many years as a techiegeekiewordygeekie, I was using my higher cognitive parts almost exclusively.  Now, I produce my best work when I just use my heart and soul, especially my soul!  In my senior years, I figured it was about time, before the juices dried up, you know?]]></description>
