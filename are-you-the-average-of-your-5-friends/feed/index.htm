					<description><![CDATA[I, literally, just told someone who&#039;s pretty close to me that I heard you&#039;re the average of your 5 closest friends. I mentioned it because he recently started a business and it&#039;s taking off pretty well. He&#039;s not the only one of my friends who is doing great things and accomplishing big stuff. So, I&#039;ve pretty much come to the conclusion that math and science has destined me to excel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great point.  I think you should have financial &quot;role models&quot; people you want to inspire towards.  Not entire sure if they need to be your best friends but definitely someone you can talk to and ask questions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Local friends --- not so much. Online friends --a few of them and I consider them actually friends, as opposed to &quot;people I know online&quot;. I do have my share of those, as well. 

I bailed out the local friend once (let her sleep on my couch when her heat was shut off) which turned into a year. of. he**.  I&#039;ll never do that again. I learned I&#039;m a pushover that allows myself to be put in situations where I think there&#039;s no other option. I&#039;m fighting to get out of that mentality, if it is actually mentality on my part, or how others perceive me. 

I think I&#039;m on the higher end of the scale when it comes to finances and my friends. Two are more well-off than I am, a lot more are worse off. We all share a love of sci-fi, and so go to conventions (yep, we&#039;re geeks and proud of it). When we get togther, a lot more are complaining about their cars breaking down and not having the money to fix them, or other financial difficulties. Yes, I realize that actually traveling out of town is a financial problem itself if you don&#039;t have the money or don&#039;t have plan for it, but I digress. While one friend paid off 15 maxed-out credit cards on her own, I&#039;m still struggling to pay off my two. However, I&#039;m able to handle emergencies, like my car acting up, better than my friend is. I may not have a great cushion, but I feel fairly secure in my financial life. 

As for partying and the like, I&#039;m almost the complete opposite of most of my friends. I&#039;m a homebody but I will &quot;allow&quot; myself to get dragged out to a concert or movie. I don&#039;t do bar scenes; never have and never will. I&#039;m the one who doesn&#039;t drink and I got a LOT of flak for that and felt uncomfortable, then I found out the designated driver gets free non-alchy drinks :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dunno if I&#039;m the average of my friends, but I definitely think that I DATE the average of my friends. I tend to date guys who have qualities that I like in my friends. Which is good, since I like my friends a lot, that I should date people who are similar to my friends in their good qualities. =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am, without a doubt the average of my five closest friends but with my own personality thrown in with the mix.  My best friends were the  most diversified of anyone I know.  We had the lazy dude, the always at the gym guy (Me), the business guy, the blue collar guy, and the nerdy guy.  I have attributes from all of these guys, hopefully less so from the lazy guy haha.  But, since moving away to SD from everyone, I&#039;m definitely changing.  My priorities are completely my own and I&#039;m finding out my &quot;true self.&quot;  That&#039;s the fun part about life, seeing how you change when those five friends are gone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm... if I had to look at the numbers, I&#039;d say my number of friends available on a daily basis are increasingly limited. As opposed to my normal pack these days, I&#039;m the &quot;rubber ball&quot;... I&#039;m bouncing all over the place as one minute I&#039;m at the highest level, and in another second I&#039;m somewhere in the far corner. I notice that the people I stay around, for the most part, are more motivated and financially savvy than I am and it&#039;s rubbing off positively.]]></description>
