					<description><![CDATA[This needs to be asked to graduate students fresh out of college. It&#039;d be interesting to see how we weigh the promise of higher future income against paying debt off now.

As for me. Heck, I&#039;d spend 2 weeks in jail for 10k in debt reduction.]]></description>

You wouldn&#039;t be worried about your life in any manner?? That&#039;s the part that concerns me... Anyone can easily be bored for a week and get paid tons of money for it, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really hate my debt. But if I could eliminate all my mortgage debt ($600k) by spending a week in jail. I think I&#039;d give that some serious consideration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$10,000 for one week of being in jail? Assuming I wouldn&#039;t lose my job or have a record, the answer is a loud HECK YES. 

One week is 168 hours. $10,000/168 = $59.52 an hour! That&#039;s a heck of a lot to lay low, stay in a room, eat for free, watch some TV, and maybe work out. Heck, I would stay for 10 weeks if it meant paying off all my loans!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Women&#039;s prison are terrible, but a much different type of bad than men&#039;s prisons. I would go to prison for a week to remove debt. Absolutely. Would probably go for a year to get a million, too. How many years of my life am I trading in work to receive money?]]></description>

Hey, thanks for letting me know though!

I think we get SOOOOO caught up in all the &quot;right&quot; ways to do things here on $$$ blogs that it tends to skew our reality for people - including ourselves.

I used to be adamant that you have to track every penny - or else! - and as I got more mature I realized there are tons of ways to do *everything* and that it&#039;s really those first initial stages of wrapping your head around $$$ that tracking comes into play big-time. 

so def. don&#039;t feel bad or give yourself any $hit if you stop tracking it all yourself! you&#039;ll be fine once you&#039;ve figured it all out!]]></description>

Ooooh fascinating!!!

I didn&#039;t know there was a difference between jail and prison, but man I bet you have all kinds of stories working out in their library.

You see a lot of people trying to prove their innocence? What were the most popular books read? Bible?]]></description>
