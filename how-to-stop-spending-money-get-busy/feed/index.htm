Walk or bike to the mall and don&#039;t take your wallet or if it&#039;s not close enough to walk then drive there only carrying your driver&#039;s license and not your whole wallet with your money or your credit cards. This way you really are going to the mall just to hang out since you don&#039;t have your money or your credit cards with you so even if you wanted to buy something you can&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you stop your husband from spending money at the bars every night?  He gives me $250.00 a month for bills, but he spends $3,250.00 a month at the bars playing pool. I wouldnt mind if he went out once a month or even once a week, but he leave the house at 7pm and gets home at 1am, seven nights a week. I started working extra hours at my job, to pay bills. He spends every pay check on himself.  He had been out of work for 4 years, and just started this job 5 months ago, I was so excited to have 2 incomes, but I am still in the same place I was before. I have never spent $3,250.00 on myself for anything, in my whole life.  I am in tears, that he spends that much on himself  each month.  I have no idea how to stop this.   I am home alone every night in tears and a nervous wreck with all the bills coming in. I feel like i&#039;m going to have a nervous break down.]]></description>

Nice! Haven&#039;t played kickball in years.... such a great social activity :) (And love the idea of renting out one of your own rooms in your house!! No idea how I can convince my wife of the same, but I&#039;d be all about it!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true! I&#039;m between finishing school for the year and starting an internship in a few weeks, so I have a ton of free time right now. It&#039;s so tempting to spend money to fill the time...and I confess, I&#039;ve succumbed a few times. I need more productive things to do!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$ I love this post. It made me understand my husband a little better. (ha ha). I tell him I sometimes think I missed out because I never did those &quot;early free years&quot; things. And honestly, when he tells me the stories they sound like such fun. But he paid for it in terms of credit card debt. I have never (with a big N) liked debt. i remember I got my first store card because it would have been my ticket to buying the to die for designer tote bag all of my college friends had (and I HAD to have). I went to the store, picked up the bag, looked at the price tag, started calculating how much I would end up paying for the bag if I made only the minimum payment each month (which is what I would have been able to afford), and promptly put the bag back. LOL. I couldn&#039;t figure out how my friends afforded it. I didn&#039;t ask either. I just assumed they had money. It would be really interesting to know the answer to that question. But that&#039;s not the point of your post. It&#039;s Father&#039;s Day on Sunday so it won&#039;t be a no spend weekend, but it will be a weekend well spent. Enjoy your Father&#039;s Day too!]]></description>
