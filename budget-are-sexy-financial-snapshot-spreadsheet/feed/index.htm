					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budget-are-sexy-financial-snapshot-spreadsheet/#comment-125709&quot;&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Crystal :) Yeah, I still use it all these years later but I don&#039;t update it anymore online because I ran out of time. You can view it on Google Docs/Drive still with all my details (I just checked and it worked) but you&#039;re right in that you can&#039;t download the one posted *here* because it&#039;s just for show. 

Use this one if you want to use the budget template from Google docs (make sure you&#039;re logged into gmail when you do it):
http://docs.google.com/previewtemplate?id=0AphtcNd0RXTEcEpHQkZHV21TVUhNd3ZWcmdNUkZKWnc&amp;mode=public

You have to click the &quot;use this template&quot; button in the upper left corner and it&#039;ll go into your own area :) And then from there you can download if you wish.

Or, you can just download the excel spreadsheet and go from there:
https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budgets/j_budget_template.xls

Hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HAH!  You&#039;re right on that one, good sir.  And the people of DC need one too, which I&#039;m quite aware of living here ;)  Awesome that you&#039;re a huge fan of them though, hopefully if enough people spread the word there&#039;ll be less stress in the world.  You&#039;re def. right in the importance of tracking it even more when you make less too - thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a major budget nerd and have been one my whole life!  I so glad it is now ‘cool’ to be in control of one&#039;s financial goals and spending plans.  I just get a cold chill up my spine when I meet someone who tells me that budgets are too hard to stick to, too hard to plan and the kicker of all excuses is they don&#039;t think they make enough money to bother with a budget.  I say the less you have, the more you need a budget, a spending plan or even a rough idea of how much money you do have compared to what it costs to live inside a building WITH utilities, eat every day and somehow get from point a to point b, without having to walk or take a bus.  
So, I will sit contentedly by, willing to help anyone who asks for help setting up a budget and keeping them motivated and on track towards some type of goal.  
I wish Washington DC would get bit by the budget nerd bug, they need to, FAST.  Joey]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome! Congrats so much on getting a budget up and running, and taking control like that - it&#039;s an incredible feeling, huh? :)

RE: Investing -- it&#039;s hard for me to advise on anything like that since a) I don&#039;t know much myself about it, and b) I don&#039;t know your personalities and/or risk levels, but I do know that a lot of first timers enjoy going with mutual funds or those that track the S&amp;P 500 or other indexes (Or even &quot;target date&quot; funds that adjust depending on the year you guys want to retire).  I&#039;d Google a bit to get some ideas, and then maybe check out Vanguard or other highly respected places that give out good info :)  You guys will be fine though. I&#039;m a big believer in doing your best whether it&#039;s 80% &quot;the right&quot; choice, or 100%.  The point here is you&#039;re working on growing your nest egg, and that&#039;s half the battle.  So keep it up!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am in my early 40&#039;s.  My husband and I have just started to track our spending and made our first real budget in January.  In the past we didn&#039;t really make a budget, we just wrote down what we spent without a plan and were really ashamed at the end of the year.  I want to proudly say that we have been on track and under budget for two months.  We have a 401k but I want to invest a small amount for &quot;fun&quot; meaning something that is more emotionally based.  I opened an e-trade account with a small amount ($1000) and have kind of froze up with uncertainty.  Any advice for an amateur investor? Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey David - congrats on having a nice amount left over every month!  And even better than you want to apply it to better your finances :)  It&#039;s tough to say which is better for you since we don&#039;t know each other, but I think either way you go you&#039;ll be fine.  If you have no emergency fund set up (3-6 months worth of expenses), I&#039;d probably put more into savings than the mortgage, but if you have a nice cushion and/or your mortgage rate is incredibly high (over 5-6%), I&#039;d probably push that side higher instead.  All depends on what makes you most comfortable :)  But again - either way you&#039;re on the right path!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J
  I&#039;ve left a note on some other page, not sure if it went through. Back to budget:  
  I  will have 350 a month extra that I want to use for extra house principal and  savings, {CDs,} What amount  would you recommend for each? Thanks for the input!
                                                                                       David]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, weird - never seen that before, I&#039;m sorry.  I&#039;ll see what I can do.  In the meantime, why don&#039;t you try downloading the spreadsheet into Excel, and then just uploading that into Google Docs?  That&#039;s what I originally did to get it up there :)
