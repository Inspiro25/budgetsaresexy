					<description><![CDATA[3 banks
1 investment bank
11 accounts
Individual stocks + couple index funds
2 cards
...that just mine+joint accounts.

When we started on the path to more sensible use of money, the best method I found was hide some of the money in another bank. If you did not see it, you didn’t spend it. Still doing the same. 

One bank for daily use, second for emergencies and other savings (no cards), third for targeted saving like investments. Third bank has better interest rate and lower accessibility, that’s holding cash for our next investment apartment.

All traced in excel once a month. After getting used to doing it feels like me-time now. I could add them, Mint-like, to the primary bank’s app (thanks new Euro regulation!) but I don’t want to see that money on a daily basis.

I know some people who don’t even need separate savings, their money keeps piling on checking. Gotta do what works for you. :)]]></description>

Are all the accounts under the same roof at least?? That definitely helps streamline things more (for example - all mine are with Vanguard). Though you can&#039;t do much about the 401k if it&#039;s still at your current employer (even more reason to pull the plug sooner!! Haha...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to add my sister has 1 savings account. She refuses to use it she just hoards the money. I told her to create a house account for home repairs which her house desperately needs ( front door is literally dry rotted) and she could save in that account and won&#039;t feel like she can&#039;t use the money because it&#039;s little earmarked for home repairs.
