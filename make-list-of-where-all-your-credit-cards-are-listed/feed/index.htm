I worked for a bank, and mailed checks for bill payment was one of the most common reason people had to close their accounts due to fraud. 
  First of all, people steal mail out of the drop boxes out in front of post offices. 
 Secondly, letters get stolen all the time enroute by sticky fingers somewhere along the way.
 Thirdly, when the bill payment arrives at the right place, a dishonest employee can swipe it. Combined with all of your account info the employee has access to, they also have the following:
 When you write a check it contains your name, address, bank account number, routing number, AND signature. Most of the time you also have to write your driver&#039;s license information on it. 
    Use electronic bill payment wherever possible, and under no circumstances should you ever write a check to a business, especially one where you hand it to a clerk and they require a driver&#039;s license. Just more personal info to be stolen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do this, but in a way that actually incorporates several other suggestions above. I have multiple credit cards and a really poor long-term memory; and this system works wonders for me. 

Everyone logs in to pay credit card(s) these days, right? And hopefully, if you&#039;re at all security-minded, you use a password manager. I use LastPass; but I&#039;m sure they&#039;re all pretty similar. 

So LastPass has an entry for my username/password combo; and there&#039;s also a NOTES field. This is a logical place for me to store that list you describe -- critically, I won&#039;t forget where it is. 

I *also* use the notes field to store info like: customer service #, card # (for easy online shopping when I don&#039;t want to fetch the card, or store it with the vendor), rewards info, summary of other perks, and account history (brief summary of any interactions I&#039;ve had with customer service). 

And to Emily&#039;s point, you can also create secure notes in LastPass that are unrelated to an online account. (Not sure if other password managers have this feature?) So I created one entitled &quot;READ THIS - FOR THE EXECUTOR OF MY ESTATE&quot; -- and I shared access to this note (only) with the potential executors in my will. This note includes all kinds of handy info -- basically what you&#039;d expect to be in such a note. 

LastPass is SO MUCH MORE than a password manager. I really can&#039;t imagine life without it.]]></description>

Hah - good insight! We often forget about what &quot;free&quot; really means, don&#039;t we? Reminds me of when I was on Blogger and they were closing down features left and right and eventually kicked me off.. Nothing I could do, nor could I complain, cuz it was completely free! But thank goodness they did it as Wordpress was certainly the better option to go... So glad I switched all those years ago.]]></description>
