Way to go man! That&#039;s the PERFECT place to start, and what I recommend everyone doing no matter what their stage in the game.

I started really paying attention to money around 26. And then shortly thereafter started tracking everything and created this blog - so really not that long ago in the grand scheme of things. So depending on your age you could really outdo me here if you&#039;ve figured it out early :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How old were you when you started? I have been trying to get rolling in the last couple months, and have a lot of spreadsheets that I created myself to track money, and after seeing your graph, I started mine. The first installment of tracking investment gains and losses as well as Net Worth came from reading your blog. Thank you for the motivation to start tracking these things!

					<description><![CDATA[You can get a better idea by looking at the remarks next to the updates here:

https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth/

We did get extra money here and there during business booms and inheritances, but I&#039;d say a solid 80% or more came mainly from maxing out both my ROTH Ira as well as my 401k/SEP Ira for 6 or so years straight now. And then having that money grow over the years in the stock market too.

I actually just wrote a new post on how focusing on just one thing can do wonders to our worth - especially if it&#039;s a &quot;biggie&quot;:

Well, it helps being anonymous and not telling some friends and family about it ;) I just loved seeing bloggers do this before I even started my own 6 years ago, so I knew I&#039;d be one of them too once I got going... Really helps keep yourself accountable when you know people are gonna look at it! Haha... But at least if you&#039;re doing it at home for yourself it&#039;ll help too :) I don&#039;t think sharing your net worth is good in all circumstances.]]></description>

Do it man! I&#039;ve been learning a LOT from putting it together so far and it&#039;s really kept things in perspective... Especially the power of doing just one or two things consistently:

Haha... sadly I&#039;m afraid that ship has sailed. With popping out #2 it would just be a nightmare trying to separate out what expenses belong to whom, not to mention find the extra time to put into it. I&#039;m glad you liked it though! I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be tracking something else feisty again soon ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi:
 I&#039;m a little confused.  Is there a way to separate out how much capital you put in the investments per year ?  Any windfalls ?  Or, is this 5 years of maxing out the retirement ?
