					<description><![CDATA[haha LOVE that partnership you&#039;ve worked out :)  and also that your friend not only enjoys the job, but she&#039;s workin&#039; all the benefits out of it!  both my brother and my sister used to work at the movies and to this day we still get free passes whenever we go back home to visit.  we should probably stop that now that it&#039;s been a good 10 years since either of them have worked there, but the same managers are there and one of us will buy some expensive food so they can make some extra money ;)  it&#039;s a great trade off - esp when there&#039;s like 6 of us that go at the same time!  but yeah, usually best to not buy all those crazy snacks there.

@&lt;strong&gt;Sox&lt;/strong&gt; - Nice!!!  Love drive-ins, totally forgot about those.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hmm.. I considered it until I remembered that I watch most movies in my backyard theater.  Perhaps if it was a drive in I&#039;d give it a shot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, J$, your question about whether the movie theater would be as nice in a local mall... reminds me of when we first moved out here. The nearest movie theater was a mom and pop operation and it sucked!   It was old and rickety and the customer service was horrible. One time the guys came in and turned the lights on when the movie had two minutes left to go and just started cleaning. I complained while there, and wrote a letter of complaint to the management, and never heard a word back.  Thankfully they finally closed down.  That would be horrible to buy a $100 ticket for a year and find it was a place like that one. I have a friend who LOVES movies. She is legally blind and is on disability but she is still allowed to make a certain amount of money each month and she got a job taking tickets at one of the big theaters about six years ago and she totally loves her job. Of course she gets to go to all the movies she wants, free, and she can take her family (daughter and son-in-law and grandchildren, sister, nephews, etc) along with her, and one friend at a time. Anyway, she and I go to the movies about once a year, I treat for dinner and she gets us in to see the movie. We have never bought from the concession even though she gets the food discounted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;It was a Groupon ad :)  For a local mall I believe...&lt;/strong&gt; which actually brings up another variable -- What if the Mall cinemas aren&#039;t as nice as the others? (Like Regal, AMC, etc etc).  Would that matter?  I think it would for me.  I&#039;m all about the atmosphere of places I spend hours at.  Same thing goes for houses &amp; places I rent -- It could be the bargain of the century, but if I&#039;m not excited to be in that particular area it doesn&#039;t matter -- I&#039;ll hate it.

&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#039;t use Netflix or Hulu -- just Comcast OnDemand... there&#039;s always something there worth watching, and I hate knowing in advance what I&#039;ll be getting.  I like picking on the fly ;)  Woo!

&lt;strong&gt;PPS:&lt;/strong&gt; This also reminds me that I used to bring in $1 cheeseburgers from McDondald&#039;s into the theatres as snacks! haha...  for you ladies who have big purses, you can bring in lots of cheap candy &amp; sodas - that would save on snacks.  When you remember to bring ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Know what&#039;s sad? To me, there aren&#039;t 12 movies a year worth seeing in theatre. I have a Netflix account, but my standards for what I watch while running on treadmill is far lower than what it takes to go to the movie theatre. 
My wife and daughter don&#039;t care for animated movies and while I&#039;d see every one, there&#039;s a creepiness factor of an adult going alone to a kid&#039;s movie. I don&#039;t want to be that creepy guy.]]></description>
