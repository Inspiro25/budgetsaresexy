Nice man, congrats! Def. cool with you leaving relevant links here - it all helps us reading and who are interested in this kinda stuff :) That&#039; quite a flip you did - reminds me of real estate, only online! That&#039;s something I want to try out actually - trade an online property for a physical one :) 

https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2012/08/trade-website-for-real-estate/

It&#039;s really only selling one and then picking up the other, logistically, but it just SOUNDS so cool, doesn&#039;t it?? Both have their ups and downsides, but one of these days I&#039;m gonna do it ;)

Stop by anytime, brotha. It&#039;s nice to e-meet you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money - just saw you featured in a video on the FinConExpo.com site (think I&#039;ll be at the event this year). Anyway we both timed our sales within a few weeks of each other. Not sure what your policy is on linking to blog posts in comments (especially since this is my first comment here) but I spoke about my sale for $42,000 of a single site I bought:
http://entrepreneurboost.com/55k-website-flip/

In past years I also sold another one of my sites in a six figure deal, but yah I love buying and selling websites so if down the line you have any you want to sell or know others that do feel free to send them my way.

Perhaps I&#039;ll see you in New Orleans in Sept

P.S. Go ahead and remove the link to the post if it&#039;s not cool. Great site been reading for the past 30 minutes... I really should sleep though lol 2:42 AM.]]></description>

Haven&#039;t heard about that before, but you can make as many &quot;fan pages&quot; for businesses that you want, if that helps?]]></description>

Hey EJ - that&#039;s one loaded comment :) I&#039;d love to help out and give specifics, but unfortunately it would become next week until we were done talking abut it, haha... much easier to do via phone or skype one day, but you&#039;d have to hire me for it I&#039;m afraid as I&#039;m overloaded with stuff these days :( I&#039;d suggest looking for awesome bloggers online who talk about the ins and outs of it - maybe SmartPassiveIncome.com? - and go from there. there are a lot of easy parts, and a lot of annoying parts, but it really comes down to research and grunt work. And of course a LOT of time. If it were easy everyone would be making $50,000 every month :) Sorry I can&#039;t be more helpful at the moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seems like a good move to me! You got a bunch of cash up front and having 50% profits will hopefully keep you motivated to keep maintaining it. You&#039;re feeling a lot better about things now so that will probably go a long way to keeping it positive and ramping things up for you!]]></description>

Hi Ben 
We know that feeling. My partner has spent the last 5 years working in the mines and while that was awesome while we were child free, the working away all the time will eventually take its toll because you miss out on a lot. We have been fortunate in my son&#039;s first year to have a drive in drive out position but it will soon change to flying interstate for a few weeks at a time which is no fun with a growing family. We have the plan to cut a certain amount off bad debt and mortgage and then look at a lower paying job with more time home. Hopefully by then my blog will have increased and working from home will be all we do and being able to travel overseas and finally get back to the US for a holiday. I hope your next big opportunity presents itself soon :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money! Congratulations on the cash injection! I&#039;d love to hear more about how you work out how to buy and sell sites. I read a lot about people who create little niche websites and sell them but havent found a lot of how to actually do this and source buyers etc. It&#039;s easy to say &quot;create a website&quot; but what is actually involved in that ? Do we require special skills? If I could make $50,000 for a few websites I think that&#039;s what I would be doing to get my own cash injection for further investment so I could renovate properties ( one of my ultimate dreams, if you have ever seen flipmen on foxtel) As far as time management goes can you outsource elements of it, or would that eat into your wage too much? Maybe utilise Fiverr? I love that site! Maybe also you could talk to the new owner on your sites about getting a commission for referring new people to the site eg you blog traffic? More $$ for you which could then mean more delegating? Just a thought. How very exciting ! I&#039;d be happy to make $50,000 in a year I was earning $65,000 in my case management job so I&#039;d like to get close to that working from home so please let me know this buy and sell formula! :) All the best with what you choose to do with that sum of cash!
