YES!! They make for good reporting over the years too - super easy to look back and see what you were thinking/doing/working on :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this concept. I could certainly benefit from depth on all the things I started and didn&#039;t finish in the last six months.

It&#039;s amazing how gratifying just being alive is if we just take the time to take the world in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Starting a blog is (or can be...) a way to get &quot;depth.&quot; It has been for me. I need to think and reflect on things. Otherwise I would just be a &quot;surfer&quot; in the world, flittering from one thing to the next.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This seems like a good merging of the two ideas of a &quot;no-spend month&quot; and &quot;spending with intention&quot;. I really like the idea of taking a step back, and really looking at what we are bringing into our lives. Are we just distracting ourselves, or working to enrich our lives with things (and experiences) we love?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need this ... have signed up for the Facebook group already.  I have so much yarn I want to knit, and so many projects on the go that I never need to buy yarn again ... until the next fiber festival.  I have a spinning wheel my loving husband gave me as a gift, but it hardly gets used.  The same with the sewing machine.  I&#039;d like to be able to focus on a few things, instead of being distracted by the shiny &quot;thing&quot; flitting by.

Pinterest definitely doesn&#039;t help ... :(]]></description>

Yes I get that but it is hard to do!  It is always nice to buy shiny and new :)  I love to decorate for the holidays and I have stopped adding to my collections...if I want new I must get rid of the old first.  I sold a few things on fb rummage sale over Christmas to get cash to buy new and it felt great.  I got my shiny and new but I had an empty place to store it when it was time to take down.]]></description>
