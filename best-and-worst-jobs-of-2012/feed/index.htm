					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve worked closely with audiologists in the past as an interpreter.  My best guess for the rise of the prominence of the profession is probably cochlear implants.  They may not be the surgeons implanting them, but they are the people who service them...in addition to fitting and programming hearing aids and testing and diagnosing hearing loss.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Gerard&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes!  Good for you on taking up the challenge though!  That&#039;s gonna be exciting/ballsy too ;) And even better if you can help turn it around!  Work it!!
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh, never even thought about that but you&#039;re right - I automatically assume journalists and news reporters/etc know a ton :)  It&#039;s a good thing y&#039;all have great perks at least!
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m pretty sure sanitation workers make a lot more money than people think too - I bet that may be a reason they&#039;re not on the list as well.  I could have sworn an old friend told me he made like $80-$90k a year picking up garbage.  I&#039;d actually LOVE to try it out for a day or two :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really thought jobs like sanitation worker would make the list for the worst, but I think that&#039;s only because I wouldn&#039;t want to do any &quot;dirty&quot; jobs. Mike Rowe is an awesome host on Discovery&#039;s &quot;Dirty Jobs,&quot; but I cringe every time I see him doing a job I&#039;d hate. 

My husband works in computers, and he loves it. Definitely wouldn&#039;t be my cup of tea, though. I think the best and worst is somewhat personal as well!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I work as a reporter  (magazines and online news) and I have a lot of friends in broadcasting, and while i wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s necessarily a bad job, because it is really fun most of the time, it&#039;s exhausting and all-consuming, extremely stressful and very poorly paid. Plus, there&#039;s a bit of an expectation that you have to know everything about everything that&#039;s going on in the world, read everything that everyone else is reading, be able to speak intelligently about everything and everything, so it gets pretty overwhelming sometimes, because you never really get to turn &quot;off.&quot; I love my work, but I can definitely see how it made the list.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J.Money, it does indeed seem that the best jobs are more comfortable. At least physically. The mental stress can be great and demanding.

I do not fit the profile for any of the jobs. I am a controller/CFO. And can tell you from experience that being a CFO while the company is going under is extremely stressful. Even if you come in when it is already sinking (my case).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhh really?? Haha... that&#039;s crazy!  I used to work in a tiny call center, and that wasn&#039;t too bad (though you always had to notify them every time you got up and went pee or whatever), but I can&#039;t imagine huge ones.  Freaks me out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Lindy Mint&lt;/b&gt; - Bah dum ching!
@&lt;b&gt;TeacHer&lt;/b&gt; - Your main one or side one? Both are cool in my books! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Gerard&lt;/b&gt; - Very true!  Cuz you don&#039;t need higher education for them and a lot more convenient with flexibility/scheduling/etc. Good observation :)]]></description>
