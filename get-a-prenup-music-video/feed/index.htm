					<description><![CDATA[J$, I was married 6 months ago, and beforehand discussed briefly with my parents if I should consider a prenup with my (now) husband. We didn&#039;t get one, and here&#039;s the main reason: Unlike many people, we did not get married after college. We&#039;re both still finishing up college, me being 20 and him being 23. If there was a divorce, we&#039;d be splitting up our main assets... hand-me-down furniture. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the Video!   I&#039;m actually getting married in 5 months and have been seriously considering a prenup.  It was too funny to come along on this video.  It was something I brought up very early on in our relationship and she agreed to go along with it.  If she said NO I can&#039;t say it would of been a deal breaker but who know&#039;s that was over 6 years ago.  I still need to find a local attorney to get a cost estimate before May.  Wish me luck I&#039;ll let you all know how it goes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Bill at FamZoo&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I was curious too!!
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt; - “prenupitals give me the creeps” haha... nice.
@&lt;b&gt;Well Heeled Blog&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!  It&#039;s soooo sad how people treat each other once things go to $hit.  It&#039;s like - &quot;Y&#039;all loved each other for a reason!  At least be civil!&quot;  I like your question about asking whether they&#039;d be a good ex if that were to happen, haha... you don&#039;t hear that too often ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - That sucks about your boss, sorry to hear :(
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; -  We really need some good stats up in here :)
@&lt;b&gt;Megan&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I WISH being Christian changed things...  It&#039;s crazy the amounts I know who are pretty fake on the outside and just do whatever it is they feel like.  And that&#039;s with all religions, not just Christianity (Which I am, too).  But luckily there are a lot who play by the rules too! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah - you have first-hand experience!   I think if we all went through that too once, then we&#039;d act accordingly in our next marriage as well.  Thanks for sharing your history and thoughts with us!  It really helps out :)
@&lt;b&gt;Yazmin&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, as sad as that is.
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - I can&#039;t wait for you to start your forest gardening!  I wanna come see it and learn too -- don&#039;t forget about me, okay? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow.  Yeah, when kids are involved I feel like it changes everything.  I&#039;d probably be more conscious of it too in that situation.]]></description>
