					<description><![CDATA[I buy a few of my daily essentials to make sure I can break/lose them without too much trouble. Don&#039;t know if baby $ has a favorite stuffed animal as well but you should get three of them before the store discontinues and then you can wash one or have one at daycare and one at home without tantrums when you can&#039;t find one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not sure if actually starting my blog is a win yet, but I did find some time to attempt a few articles. 

My wins and losses for the week? They were all attached to each other. It was like the &quot;Facts of Life&quot; theme was silently playing in the background throughout my week. I took the good and the bad in stride, because they seemed to be hand in hand.

My biggest losses were also my biggest wins: 

Loss: I put in a monster week at work and worked over 12 hours a day. Missed the family a bunch.

Win: Being able to work a little harder to stash some saving is big right now with twins on the way

Loss: &quot;Wasted&quot; money attempting to take my son to see &quot;Planes&quot;. It was our first try at a movie theater and it didn&#039;t go all that well. He loved the candy, popcorn, and pop. Unfortunately he liked running up and down steps with red LED strips on them more than he likes the &quot;movie experience&quot;.

Win: Took my son to see &quot;Planes&quot;. It was a Daddy &#038; Bryce day and even though we didn&#039;t stay for more than 10 minutes it was still very memorable.

That was my week. Overall very good :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m catching up on the week, just chillin&#039; and I realize (HUGE lightbulb over my head) when you said Starbucks...my darling daughter was registering all her Sbucks cards (ya know, we all have &#039;em....25 cents on this one, $1.05 in another) and BAM!  Outta nowhere she finds a card in the bottom of her purse with $25!!!  So by consolidating all those itty-bitty cards, she ended up with somewhere around $50 in FREE Starbucks!
I, however, did not have such a stellar week.  And I&#039;m all about staying on the positive so let&#039;s just say I&#039;m looking forward to this next week.]]></description>
