					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome, Alaya! I just started tracking my net worth in the last 1.5 years and find it to be both fun and motivating. I had a very similar experience as you this month with my 401k - it got to just below 50,000 and I simultaneously rolled my eyes that it wasn&#039;t *quite* at the 50k mark, but also did a little happy dance about being essentially 1/20 of the way to my million in savings goal. Wishing you the best on your journey.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way to go, Alaya! And I had the same takeaways, J. I can only imagine how different MY net worth would be right now if US employers contributed the same to retirement or the government offered 0% interest student loans. probably to the tune of at least several hundred thousand (I’m in my 40s). I’ve had measily retirement contributions from my company(ies), though I’ve been saving at least 10% consistently. And now that the student loan is history, I don’t like thinking about it, but it was in total about $80k. 

Anyway, the best investment was that “kick ‘em to the curb” payment! I’m sure that gave you the mental space to do greater things, as well as getting rid of a leech! Well done!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why does 1/20 sound so much closer than 5%? Not that I know about it from experience, I&#039;m still negative (but only four digits negative now! Less than a mile from home!).

Awesome job, Alaya! And I love the orange color scheme for the spreadsheet, it&#039;s eye-catching but not alarming. (By the way if the divide-by-zero error bothers you like it bothers me, all you have to do is wrap the formula for those cells with IFERROR( at the beginning, and ,0) at the end. That&#039;ll just put a zero in the cell in place of any error.)]]></description>
