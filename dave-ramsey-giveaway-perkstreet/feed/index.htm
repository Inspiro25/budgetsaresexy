Yup! Per their wikipedia page:

&quot;With no bank branches, PerkStreet Financial had low operating costs. However, a cash-back rewards scheme that approached 2% for some debit card accounts turned out to be unsustainable, and contributed to the company&#039;s closure in 2013.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Upon attempting to close my account after I found out that you had to have $5,000 to get the 2% cash back, I was told by a customer representative that I should leave my account open so I could return to it and use the funds if I ever wanted to in the future. 6 months later I realized I would not be using it, called back to cancel the account, and was told I only had $7 left in the account due to an &quot;inactivity fee&quot; of $4.50 a month. After informing Perkstreet what I had been told by the previous customer service representative, I asked for each inactivity fee to be refunded but they refused saying that the $4.50 fee was in the mice type disclosure statement and would be in full force no matter what I was told by a representative. Go with Perkstreet if you want no customer service. Go with a local credit union if you want an actual human to interact with and be understanding.]]></description>
