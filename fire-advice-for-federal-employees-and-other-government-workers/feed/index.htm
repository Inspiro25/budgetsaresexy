					<description><![CDATA[I found it just interesting about US fed. govn&#039;t benefits. I&#039;ve worked for several non-profits, 3 global private firms (engineering. law and accounting), 1 national firm and 3 different govn&#039;t organizations:  2 different provincial jurisdictions, final one is a municipality in 3rd different prov ince.  

I&#039;m glad to book end my career with public service.  I did learn lots in private sector to bring over into my public sector jobs.. it makes one sharper when entering public service since you may deal same private firms on the other side of the table.  

What you do as an employee is a very tiny building block,  but yes, there is a purpose of adding to service, making a difference to daily lives and permanency....public infrastructure is around and used for next 75 -100  yrs.  

It is my feeling that covid....has revealed the role of govn&#039;t set ground rules to keep us safe and somehow keep   economy falling through the ocean.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Working for the government or your local municipality or State is one of the best jobs around. The benefits are top shelf! You can go as far as you want up the ladder. Like he was saying about length of service the longer you are employed the faster you generate more vacation and sick time. I got a free 30 minute phone call with a financial advisor every year.  Best job on the world too me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really wished I started in some federal employee job when I was younger. I think I would&#039;ve enjoyed that much more than working a retail job as a cashier making minimum wage. $15 an hour would&#039;ve been phenomenal, even if I was just 18 years old.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was fantastic to read. Living two miles from the DC line, I have dozens of federal employee friends and family; my dad retired after 34 years with NASA (covered under CSRS) in 2010 and makes more in pension than the combined W2 income of my wife and myself. These folks are incredibly dedicated and underappreciated.]]></description>
