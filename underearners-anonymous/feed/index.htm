					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/underearners-anonymous/#comment-185665&quot;&gt;Gil&lt;/a&gt;.

It does sound contradictory, doesn&#039;t it? It can surely work together though. I very much believe in God myself and know I&#039;ll be taken care of, but I still go and *make it happen* at the same time.

Reminds me of that old moral/joke:

*********************************************************

A fellow was stuck on his rooftop in a flood. He was praying to God for help.

Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, &quot;Jump in, I can save you.&quot;

The stranded fellow shouted back, &quot;No, it&#039;s OK, I&#039;m praying to God and he is going to save me.&quot;

So the rowboat went on.

Then a motorboat came by. &quot;The fellow in the motorboat shouted, &quot;Jump in, I can save you.&quot;

To this the stranded man said, &quot;No thanks, I&#039;m praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.&quot;

So the motorboat went on.

Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, &quot;Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.&quot;

To this the stranded man again replied, &quot;No thanks, I&#039;m praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.&quot;

So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, &quot;I had faith in you but you didn&#039;t save me, you let me drown. I don&#039;t understand why!&quot;

To this God replied, &quot;I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zack, thanks for sharing. I attended my first meeting today. I attended the underearning meeting for writers, and it was very awesome. It was very supportive. I will continue to attend every week. I love the fact that they have meetings depending on what your goals are, which allows you to interact with people who are where you are and working to get where you are trying to get.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey man, thanks for posting this!  Sounds like an interesting group.  Wish I had found it years ago, before frittering away so much of my life.

A couple comments, (based on other comments):

1. As far as the &quot;Higher Power&quot; component goes, maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m a good bit older than most of y&#039;all, (at least I assume so!), but eventually you realize that this is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART of any 12 step program, and any well lived life, for that matter.  Lacking a moral purpose, our rationality can lead to Stalin and Robespierre.

2. Having TWO KIDS is insanely more difficult than having one, as you are no doubt discovering.  Or maybe your experience is different?  Nah ..... I doubt it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yikes. I definitely go through phases of this. Every time I&#039;m playing a game on my cell phone and realize it I feel gross. It&#039;s not worth it and there&#039;s too many fun things to do instead!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! I had no idea that this organization existed.  The symptom that jumped out at me was &quot;Not following through.&quot; I&#039;ve become very aware of this trait in myself. For me, the key is to narrow down my &quot;to-do&quot; list to very specific items instead of having a generalized, infinite list. One thing done well is so much better than 10 things thought-of and barely started.]]></description>
