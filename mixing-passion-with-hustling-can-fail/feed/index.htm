It&#039;s hard sometimes to mix business and pleasure :( But cool that they loved your items so much they wanted to sell them in their store! That&#039;s gotta feel good! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got this same feeling when people started to ask to buy my handknit items. I tried to make 10 hats for one store to carry, but I just got frustrated that I had to work on a timeline and produce a product of a certain quality. I love knitting, I use it to relax. And when I make a &quot;mistake&quot;, to me or my friends it&#039;s a &quot;design element&quot;, but to a retailer, it&#039;s a flawed item.

I stopped enjoying it when money got involved, so I quit selling my items. Now I handknit whatever I feel like making, and I give them away to make people happy. The joy comes from enjoying my hobby and being able to give someone a true gift. That joy isn&#039;t worth trading for dollars to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been making quilts for about 15 years.  The thing about a quilt is that you can easily sink  $200-300 and 50-100 hours into a full size quilt.  Making quilts to sell, for me, just isn&#039;t worth it at all.  

However, in recent years, I have given away and once or twice even sold a quilt project or two.  What I have been finding is that initially I have a strong attachment, but as time goes by, I am more ready to part with the quilts I&#039;ve made.  Some things that I&#039;ve made, usually smaller projects, that didn&#039;t come out as well as I had hoped, I can&#039;t wait to get rid of them.  Thankfully, those are the exception.  For pieces that I am especially attached to, if I can give them or sell them to a friend, that helps me feel so much better about parting with them.

With quilting, I always tell myself, I don&#039;t quilt so much for the end product, because that may take years, but for the means, the creative process that I enjoy so much.  So following that line of thought, eventually, when I do finally finish something, I always want to start something else so that I can continue that creative process.  A few pieces I will maybe keep forever, but most, I will pass along.  There is no hurry either way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right -- your free time IS valuable. And that means you have to spend it in a way that makes you happy. If that&#039;s hustling for more dollars, great. If it&#039;s watching Netflix, great. If it&#039;s creating art, great. 

I&#039;m all about the hustle but if you&#039;re just spinning your wheels on something you don&#039;t enjoy, I&#039;m with you -- what&#039;s the point?]]></description>

Thanks for the compliment Kemkem. It seems like the general consensus is that people prefer to give away their creations to people close to them. Did you find that you made jewelry with specific people in mind?]]></description>
