					<description><![CDATA[Love a good blast from the past, and always a fan of some good lyrics - you&#039;ve pulled a great one out here J Money!  

I&#039;m sure I never appreciated the lyrics back then, but that&#039;s the beautiful thing about good music - you can always come back and listen to it as a different person and from a different perspective.

Cheers,  

Frankie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I remembered this group when they started in the early 90s.  I just started high school at the time and loved their music. Not just &quot;Mr. Wendal&quot; but also &quot;People Everyday&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; with the songs I remembered from them.  
Thanks for this J, enjoy the weekend!]]></description>

There are many songs that evoke specific memories for me because it happened to be popular and playing constantly during some memorable event. Even if I don&#039;t really like the song, a little smile may come across my face when the memory associated with it surfaces.]]></description>

Indeed. Particularly grunge, alternative, and gangsta rap of early 90&#039;s. 

I just saw Stone Temple Pilots, Cult, and Bush this week. Nostalgia!! 

Random: the new singer for STP is a dead-ringer for Weiland, both in vocals and stage presence. Kind of creepy. They sounded great.]]></description>

Totally :) And that&#039;s really what it&#039;s all about, right? Being as conscious as we can with our values and actions, and of course our money. I learned a long time ago that none of this $$$ stuff is black and white - there&#039;s always deeper roots attached that we need to understand to really move ourselves forward.]]></description>
