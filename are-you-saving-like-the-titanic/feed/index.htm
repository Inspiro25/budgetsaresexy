Hell yeah - I would totally go out and get a roommate if my wife allowed it :) I always joke about living with my parents (built-in baby sitters!) but so far no one is in except for my mother and my kids... 3 down, 2 more to go!]]></description>

Fascinating!

And by &quot;saving&quot; Mr. 1500 is really talking about investing it all once it&#039;s saved so it can grow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the analogy BAS!   It just has me thinking why I hadn&#039;t come up with such an analogy (kidding).  But this easily shows the power of compounding and why it is critical that you save at a younger age and start the process of having your money work for you.  Each decision should be made with a long term perspective and you cited three examples at the end.   But a car that you can drive to 200k and can last well over 10 years.  Buy a house you may never have to leave. Don&#039;t incur those RE fees, the costs of financing, the cost of moving, etc.  My wife and I are getting ready to move into our first house.  We made sure we had a house that we knew would be big enough for our family not just 3, 5, or 10 years from now.  But also for 20+ years.  We will most likely never have to leave (until we are ready to downsize).   Sorry, got on a rant there!  Thanks for the great read.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I hate the phrase “starter home.” Why can’t a modest home be a forever home?&quot;

Ohhh my God that is soooooooooo true. You know who is getting pay off this concept? Agents and their RE firms. We brought our current home thinking it&#039;s just for 10 years but now obviously its a lot better financially just to stay put. Plus we love this house. And we&#039;re lazy to deal with selling, closing, buying, packing up and moving. What a hassle. Stay put people!!!!]]></description>

Same struggle here. I do contribute 15% to 401K and double up on monthly mortgage payments plus some extra bonus help pay it down. I&#039;m 51 and want to have it paid down by 55 so I can retire with no mortgage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good analogy for compounding interest. Though it won&#039;t work too well today. You&#039;d be lucky if you can get 0.1% at a bank.

Also did you know the people who would have been against the Federal Reserve was on that boat. Saving money would have been a lot easier just like in your example. Plus we&#039;d be saving in gold.]]></description>
