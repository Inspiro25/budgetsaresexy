					<description><![CDATA[Just received a class action form against PHRG LLC. It states based on their telemarketing practice those accepting inclusion in this claim may receive (up to) a whopping $50 of the $5,200,000 settlement. From this the counsel is asking the court for in excess of $2,500,000 in expenses. This is the reason I do not participate in these suits. I&#039;d like to think the fewer of us that agree to this the fewer the frivolous lawsuits there will be.

I&#039;m not saying there shouldn&#039;t be consequences for PHRG&#039;s breaking laws but for the lawyers to bank as they do is unethical. In a perfect world PHRG would be held accountable (sued) for their indiscretion and the lawyers would receive a commensurable remuneration. Payment to the class action members should be nothing more than satisfaction that enough of these reasonable lawsuits would reduce, if not eliminate, unwarranted telemarketing practices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Walk away if the action of the bank benefited you. It is unethical to take money just because lawyers want to make money by filing a lawsuit. There have been cases where people were nasty enough to sue doctors who volunteered assistance in random emergencies. Dreadfully unethical. Some monies are not worth having.]]></description>

Wow, that is a huge kick in the teeth!!!

J I say +1 for the charity idea. They are paying out that money regardless so at least if you took a share you know it would go to a good cause of your choosing. And if it turned out to be in the $1000&#039;s (which I highly doubt) at least you will have a second moral dilemma of whether to keep any which you can turn into another blog post ;O)]]></description>

Yup, totally agree they were only in it for the money regardless of how it helps me out personally or not. But still doesn&#039;t change the fact I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m owed anything, even though technically I may be.]]></description>

I just found out you can submit a claim online too - maybe give it a shot and see if you can be included or not?

More info on it all is at that site too.]]></description>
