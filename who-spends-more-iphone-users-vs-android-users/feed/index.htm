					<description><![CDATA[Yay! Android users are way more aware of purchases. 

You can get better Android phones nowadays anyways. I don&#039;t know if Android users are really less happy than iPhone users. I wonder what that would look like in 2020?

Thanks for the great article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two immediate thoughts were... Yeah that&#039;s just lifestyle inflation, as a few other comments have already pointed out.

The second one was that the only thing that degrades our relationship is that it p**ses me off that my wife wants an iPhone when they are just overpriced junk.

What&#039;s this about having not having similar communications etc...? Just get whatsapp, literally everyone I know is on that now anyway and it does free video calling. And obviously it works on both types of phone. We sync all our stuff together with Google drive which basically shows how pointless Apple&#039;s attempted walled garden approach actually is...!

The person who had to buy an iPhone was either very tech unsavvy or just plain stupid for not suggesting they both go onto Android instead to save them both money!]]></description>

It may be so w/ the engineers you hang out/know, but 9/10 of the engineers I know use iPhones precisely b/c of their functionality (reliability as first and foremost).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never owned an iPhone, only had Andriods, in particular LG phones.  The only Apple related item I ever owned was an iPod back when it was really popular.  I don&#039;t need much from my mobile phone as long as I can do the basic stuff.  
My wife also has an Andriod(Samsung Galaxy 6 I believe) so I can&#039;t say if their is a conflict between a couple that has different operating systems for their phones, sounds kind of silly to even get into any conflict about phones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apple all the way!
I bought my current phone (an iPhone 6) in 2015 when I went to the UK and Europe for 63 glorious days. I wanted a good camera/phone.
Three years later it&#039;s still going strong. 
My iPad has the kindle app on it - I read my books and listen to podcasts from it. I&#039;ve had that baby for well over 6 years.
Looking at those stats, I&#039;d mostly fit on the android side. But you&#039;d have to pry my Apple laptops/iPad/iPhone from my cold dead hands before I&#039;d give them up.]]></description>
