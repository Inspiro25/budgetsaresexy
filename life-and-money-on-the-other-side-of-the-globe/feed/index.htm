Definitely the last one :)

Most have us have lost all hope with our leadership here, but the fact we have so much freedom and life&#039;s necessities around every corner still make it a great place to live, at least in my opinion... We have our (serious) issues, but how fortunate to have been born into such luxuries off the bat??!

Where do you live, Ayumi?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J$, I don&#039;t live in the US and I&#039;m curious about this phrase: 
&quot;Still better off than most of the world, but boy do we have a lot more learning to do :(&quot;

Do you mean that you think the US is still handling the pandemic better than most of the world, or that, despite the pandemic, things are still overall better than most of the world?]]></description>

We&#039;re a huge fan of maps over here :) Have about 6 or 7 of them up for the kids, and my guilty obsession is trying to find a rare one of my hometown to have on my walls... Only know of one so far and it&#039;s hanging in a museum! Lol..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have relatives who live in eastern Europe.  To say they had a hard time financially after the Berlin wall came down is putting it mildly.  It wasn&#039;t until their country joined the EU that my relatives really began to prosper.  They got great paying jobs in the west and brought that money home to buy property and build homes. Those who are now retired and remember what it was like under communism relieved to be financially stable and safe.   I&#039;m very proud of them.]]></description>
