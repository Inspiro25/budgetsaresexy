					<description><![CDATA[Message from another real live substitute teacher:

As you know, there is no Union currently in place for substitute teachers; therefore, these amazing men and women, who have major responsibilities like anyone else, are paid only what has been predetermined as “district” payment rate for services rendered.

Recently I co-wrote a book with financial expert V.L. Trent of Valerie Trent Financial Group, titled: If You Want a Larger Piece of the Pie You Have to Take a Bigger Bite.  The title can be found on Amazon under books and Kindle reads.

I co-wrote the book after recommendations from friends, who are also substitute teachers like me.

After reading the book many teachers felt hopeful and encouraged they could continue to mold young minds without fear of financial scarcity where there is not enough money available from the job to do what needs to be done.

As you know lack of spending power is costly both inside and outside the classroom; teachers who are scarcely paid cannot perform at their best. 

And why can’t substitute teaching be a viable career option? Why should substitutes have to look for additional jobs outside the home away from family while giving back to the field of education?

Substitute teachers need alternatives to keep pace with the ever-increasing cost of living, savings for emergencies, etc. because insufficient funds impact every facet of life in a big way.

Maybe you will find the book useful as a catalyst for any substitute teacher that loves his or her role, but is having trouble making ends meet or who wants more from this great profession!

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-substitute-teacher/#comment-121548&quot;&gt;Stacey&lt;/a&gt;.

I find it quite disturbing that a teacher has to bribe the students with sweets in order to control the class. What if a child is diabetic or on a special diet?  A couple of decades ago when I did some substitute teaching, teachers with twenty, thirty, and forty years experience were showing the high school students popular (at that time in theatres) x-rated movies on a VCR during study periods as an incentive for the students to attend school so that they would not dropout.  Ironically, these students who liked x-rated movies could barely read and write.  Yes, this is true; I am not capable of making this stuff up.  Schools have really gone to hell, haven&#039;t they?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I laughed out loud -- literally -- at the line in which you wrote: &quot;That was just minutes before a girl asked me if I was 55 years old. (I’m only 38, by the way!)&quot;

I once volunteered to visit a 6th-grade classroom to do a presentation on Australia. (The students were learning about that country, and the teacher, a friend of mine, knew that I had visited there. She thought the students would enjoy meeting someone who had actually been there, and seeing my vacation photos, hearing stories, etc.)

One of my photos depicted an Australian person who was about 40 years old. I asked the kids, &quot;How old do you think this man is?&quot; They ALL shouted out answers (rather than raising their hands), and they shouted everything ranging from 15 to 100.

Moral of the story: don&#039;t worry about what age the kids think you are. Many kids have a tough time estimating the age of adults. In their eyes, we all look &quot;generally old.&quot; :-)]]></description>

That is crazy! I know in our state the students have to be in school a set number of hours per year - so I don&#039;t think this would be an option? But our district has gone to a 4 day week (no school on Fridays!) in order to save transportation costs (very rural district.)]]></description>
