Sorry missed this question! Finland, but similar scenarios are elsewhere in Northern Europe and much of other parts of Europe too.

Of course, Finns are notorious complainers and tweakers, so we are always trying to optimize how much and for how long we should pay the benefit. Currently gov is talking about shortening it a bit, which might make sense (most people do find jobs quite fast and we don&#039;t want leechers just taking a &quot;vacation&quot; on that money). Then again in low employment areas (the countryside) it might become too short...you can&#039;t make it work for everyone at the same time!]]></description>

A Tax-Free Savings Account is Canadian (I&#039;m in Winnipeg).  Normally we have to pay tax on any bank interest earned, but you can put up to $6000/year into a TFSA without incurring any tax.  Better still if you can leave the money in there to compound, obviously, but life happens. 

I&#039;ve been playing clarinet for about 15 years now.  After falling under the spell of a community concert band -- essentially the adult version of a high school band -- I got more serious about practice and bought a really nice instrument for myself.  (That was the first time I used my TFSA to save up for something, and it was nice to pay cash rather than using a credit card or buying on an installment plan.)]]></description>

A Tax-Free Savings Account? Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve heard of that one before! In another country I presume? (And fellow clarinetist here! Though I haven&#039;t touched one since high school :))]]></description>

Haha.. Well don&#039;t leave us hanging here - has it been FUN to ride so far??! :) Are you now taking it to and from work, thereby saving you money and helping you get fit at the same time?! Inquiring bloggers want to know! :)]]></description>

Ack!! And notice how most of those things are *house* related too which never gets considered when people do the &quot;owning vs renting&quot; comparisons :(

I&#039;m glad the emergency fund has saved y&#039;all over the years though :) Sending good vibes over that your husband finds a new gig soon! That would be a great Xmas present!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a savings account that doubles as emergency fund and &quot;large necessary expenses&quot; fund.  I&#039;ve tapped it for furnace repairs (emergency), a new roof (non-emergency but important), replacing a creaky old staircase (non-emergency but a bottleneck in a renovation project), and a complete overhaul on my clarinet (definitely an emergency, and worth every penny).

It&#039;s a minor hassle withdrawing funds as it&#039;s in a Tax-Free Savings Account and I have to go down to my credit union and sign a form, but the money shows up in my checking account the next day.]]></description>
