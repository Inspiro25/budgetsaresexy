well, I am a Clevelander too and I googled the stadium and couldn&#039;t find any job listings. Where did you find them on the site?  The jobs you listed as being open would be just my speed. Too old to deal with drunks and fights anymore!  LOL.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I were have time to get another side hustle, I would work at football stadium. Imagine that I could get to meet those football players for free. Yay! That would be really awesome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the coolest thing ever! We actually have a big stadium (only stadium? clearly I&#039;m not a sports fan...) close to where I live (we hosted the last Super Bowl, heyyy!), so this could be a side hustle for me!

I would hate to do security, actually, and I&#039;m 5&#039;2, too. But a greeter or guest services person? Heck yeah! Such a cool article, thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have worked at the Ralph Wilson Stadium here in Buffalo, NY. I did the food services and it was actually pretty neat + the tips that you bring home from our loyal Canadian drinkers that tip wonderfully if you engage in a conversation with them. I am actually trying to get back into it and a friend worked tonights game and she was going to see if they needed any help. It is really fun but it is not for everyone.]]></description>
