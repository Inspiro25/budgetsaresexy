Sometimes the study groups release their original raw data results so people can filter them. I agree, it&#039;d be really interesting to see numbers when the outliers are removed. My guess is even removing the top 0.01% would make a big difference in some of these stats.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though we shouldn&#039;t, it&#039;s still fun to compare ourselves to our peers. Gives me motivation to up my game if I&#039;m slacking or the confirmation I need to see what I&#039;m currently doing is working. I wonder if there are stats that get rid of the top 1% as I would agree that those figures likely paint a rosier picture than what actually exists out there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m delighted that despite my idiocy (and my husband&#039;s, bless him), we are a teeny tiny bit ahead than our peers ... by a few dollars actually. 

We are all effed if we don&#039;t get our acts together!!]]></description>

Well, remember that &quot;averages&quot; are thrown off by extremely wealthy people. &quot;Median&quot; is a better measure if you&#039;re talking about a % of the population. Also there&#039;s a huge difference state by state and city by city.  My guess is you&#039;re doing just fine David :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, reading about these &quot;averages&quot; makes me wonder if those articles saying &quot;40% of americans can&#039;t afford a $1,000 payment&quot; are actually true. I had no idea the average income hit $87,000 that&#039;s really good. 

The average debt balance isn&#039;t all that bad either especially when it includes mortgages. This is making me scared and that I should be trying harder.]]></description>

Hey Adam!  Not sure if you&#039;ve seen this.... It&#039;s a survey done completely with FIRE people as respondents...  It&#039;s skewed towards Australians, but i&#039;m hoping someone in the USA will make a FIRE survey dashboard like this one day. It&#039;s fun to know what other FIRE community members are doing.

https://www.aussiefirebug.com/australia-fire-survey-results-2020/.  (at the very bottom there&#039;s a link to &quot;fullscreen mode&quot; of the dashboard where you can interact and drill down into the data!)

Again, I should point out that comparing yourself to others is a slippery slope! It can be helpful sometimes and humbling, but it can be harmful in some ways because FIRE IS NOT A RACE.]]></description>

Good catch, Mary!  I just found this in the data report:  &quot;Editor&#039;s note: we aren&#039;t reporting the median and average *salary* in the U.S. here -- instead, we&#039;re reporting *income*. The U.S. Census Bureau tracks earnings (which are made up mostly of salary and wages) and income, which includes all sources of money that people bring in.

So yes, I should have included rental income. Woohoo we&#039;re crushing this category :)]]></description>

Hey Lady! Great points!  I didn&#039;t even think about rental income but you&#039;re probably right - if other people include it in the statistic data then I should include it too. In this case I&#039;m definitely crushing the average there! :)

I originally had it color-coded (green for good, red for bad). I guess everyone can make up their own mind about how they feel about some things whether it&#039;s good or bad... For example:  total houshold debt, I consider a huge debt number as a good thing (home mortgage, leveraged real estate), whereas some people might say it&#039;s bad in their situation.

I know what you mean about the averages being hugely different across the US. There are way too many factors, so all stats should be taken very lightly. Don&#039;t get too lost in the data. It&#039;s interesting, but also mostly useless as far as building your personal tactical wealth plan. :)]]></description>
