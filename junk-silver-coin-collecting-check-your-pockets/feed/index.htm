					<description><![CDATA[I love APMEX! One of my favorite things is how they keep track of all your purchases so that you can see what you paid and their current market value. What I like to do, since I don&#039;t usually have very much money to invest is wait for a free shipping promotion. If you sign up with them, they will email you about different promotions. So all I have to do is save up whatever I can and then wait for a free shipping promo. Then I just make sure I have at least $50 to spend to meet their minimum.

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a great point actually, silver is silver no matter where it&#039;s from, right?  Just a bit harder to get your hands on, I&#039;d imagine...
@&lt;b&gt;DC @ Young Adult Money&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Well it&#039;s a good hobby to get into since you&#039;re always investing in MONEY, you know? Haha... Unlike other hobbies out there ;)  Maybe you and the wife can tagteam and help each other snatch up stuff you&#039;re both really interested in!  Coins and Lanterns :)
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! If you ever want to sell any to me (not joking), let me know :) It would be fun to have coins coins from readers of my site! I already had another guy shoot me an email about something similar, and I&#039;m pretty excited about it.  Win-win for everyone!
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - PERFECT!!! That&#039;s the way to do it - get people on your side and helping you out :)  Which also helps THEM out too especially if they&#039;re coins they have to count every night before locking up, like silver and gold (in color) dollars, and $2 bills etc. Sometimes they drive tellers crazy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I work at a credit union and in these hard economic times people are cashing in loose change they have laying around to get cash.  I had one of our tellers keeping an eye out for me and she was given about $75 in half dollars for part of a loan payment.  She called me and I walked away with $4.50 in silver coinage:).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dad has several Morgan Silver dollars that I would love to look at from time to time growing up.  I imagine he still has them so one day, I might get a few.

In the meantime, I have to settle for my own 1 oz. rounds purchased in the late &#039;80s for $5.00 per ounce.  I might consider selling sometime over $50, but will have to see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, I have to admit.  I think your posts about antiques (coins in particular) have single-handedly made me interested in collecting!

Her best find so far was an antique lantern that she got for $2.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;DebtKiller&lt;/b&gt; - Would be better if you found coins from older people who never took the time to cash them in ;)  Better odds!
@&lt;b&gt;Eric&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, how much did you like working there?  Imagine if you saw $500 or $1,000/$10,000 bills come in? Ca-ching!
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lynn @ Broke-Ass Mommy&lt;/b&gt; - Okay! I will, thank you :) You&#039;re the best gift giver EVER! Haha... man that&#039;s awesome.
@&lt;b&gt;Scott&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh, okay that makes sense. I did see that my collector coin picked up a box of coins at an auction once, and they all came graded - so I gotta go that route then if I want graded stuff... I&#039;ll just have to wait until I get a crazy good one worth some $$! If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what&#039;s the most valuable one you have? (Or maybe email me if you don&#039;t want it out in the public? j @ budgets are sexy dot com)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J Money - you really want to avoid grading unless you have a nice coin (generally several $100 in value). The cost to get a coin slabbed is generally $20-50 with all fees, so you dont want to put a $50 coin in a $30 slab - in resale you&#039;ll instantly lose any slabbing costs - if you&#039;re interested in graded/slabbed stuff, it&#039;s always better to buy it already graded/slabbed - let the other person take a financial bath on the fees ;)

If you&#039;re just looking in terms of silver value, third party grading doesnt offer any real value - it&#039;s really for nice collectible coins ;)]]></description>
