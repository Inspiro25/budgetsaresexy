					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt; - I think it depends on a lot of things, but mainly whether your employers MATCH your 401k contributions. Cuz if they do, then it&#039;s hands down a smart move to keep investing at least up to what they&#039;re matching cuz it&#039;s guaranteed money right off the bat! :)  If they don&#039;t, or you want to put in more than they match, then your average finance guru will probably say to invest the rest into an IRA since you have more control over the funds/etc.  But either way you go you&#039;ll be on the right track - the fact you&#039;re investing *somewhere* is very very good :) So keep it up!
@&lt;b&gt;Blue Spyder&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, sorry to hear that :(  I&#039;ve had a few duds too over the past 12 months, but we do whatever we can to keep on getting better! :) Winning this prize would certainly help jump start that too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I entered but am wondering if maybe I have my retirement going in too many directions. We pay into railroad retirement for my spouse and myself, we each have 401ks, and have done the IRA thing the last couple of years. Should I be focusing on maxing out my IRA first, then 401k?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh no - sorry!  Once you&#039;ve &quot;liked&quot; IRAmarket&#039;s page, the directions should be right there on their facebook page.  Ask you to enter you name/etc - do you see that?  If not, let me know what you see and I&#039;ll pass it along to the folks to make sure nothing funky is going on :)  Sorry for all the hassle! It will all be worth it if you win, haha...]]></description>
