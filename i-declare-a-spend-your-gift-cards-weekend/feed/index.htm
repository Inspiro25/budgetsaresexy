					<description><![CDATA[Companies love selling gift cards and prepaid cards, because there is always a healthy percentage of them that go unused.  People throw them in drawer and they expire and eventually get thrown away.

If you do not want to use them, there are sites you can sell and trade giftcards as well.  Might be something to look in to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jolie -  yay Timmies!
You cannot use VISA in the store (only AMEX and Mastercard) and I might feel silly paying the $1.52 on a credit card, so I have my Tim&#039;s card set up online to automatically reload from my VISA. This way the card never runs out and I get the Aeroplan points on my VISA. At their website you can do a one time load onto the card, or set up auto reloading. I have it set up to put $30 on whenever the balance drops below $5. 
I&#039;ve cut my coffee addiction down to 2/wk but I still insist on getting my mileage points whatever way I can. It all adds up.  I&#039;m annoyed when I can&#039;t pay for something on my VISA. We&#039;ve now got enough points for our family of 4 to fly to Europe this summer! Woo hoo!]]></description>
