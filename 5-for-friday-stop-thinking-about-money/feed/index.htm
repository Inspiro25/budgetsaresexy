Yeah, girl - work it! That sounds like a fantastic break and way to make some side $ in the process. Who knows what types of opportunities/learning experiences will come from it too in the future :) Congrats.]]></description>

I found a cool side gig after all.  I&#039;m a freelancer for a guy that offers online courses to prep for the HVAC certification test.  He pays me hourly ($15) to research random stuff for him and I&#039;ll be earning a processing fee ($50-$100) for every finance application his clients fill out to get financing for the course if they need to (I&#039;ll be entering their info into the financing application online).  Honestly, this is just brainless enough to make me very happy to have a break, but flexible enough not to mess with my favorite part of self-employment (not having a set schedule).]]></description>

Hahaha.... nice. I hear ya on having pure cash in an E. Fund too - we&#039;re the same way. Though my wife like 10x more than me :) We had like $40k in there once and my wife always felt like we were broke! I guess cuz we know one major hit can wipe a lot of it away - scary stuff... Good luck on finding a good side gig! I&#039;m considering the same over here too - for both money, but also to get out of the house and turn my brain off. So I guess I better find one not relating to money/blogging haha... which of course is way more fun ;) I go in circles!!]]></description>

Congrats on the new move to one income! Sucks about money but probably much better/happier in the end once you guys figure it out. We&#039;re doing it now but luckily only for a year, haha... we&#039;re not ready for that quite yet long-term ;)]]></description>

I thought you were gonna say you didn&#039;t think about saving $ for retirement cuz you were gonna die young having fun, haha... I know a few people like that and I always cringe cuz I really think they mean it! And if they (hopefully) don&#039;t die sooner, they&#039;re gonna be in loads of trouble later :(]]></description>
