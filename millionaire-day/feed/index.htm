I know right? I say we go out and create our own days too! &quot;Money Blogging Day!&quot; &quot;Budgeting Is Sexy Day!&quot; Haha...

You&#039;re def. right though - for the average person, the more they earn the more they spend. But for everyone here trying to get their $$$ on, we know that more money = faster goals cuz we don&#039;t let the lifestyle inflation get us! You def. need a nice balance of spending less and earning more at least to get the momentum going... The nice thing about having $$ invested and growing for you is that once it&#039;s there (and you don&#039;t touch it!) it&#039;ll just keep going up. Regardless of what you&#039;re spending/earning :) At least all in theory - hah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J! Totally love your point about people being impatient. We live in this crazy ass society where everyone wants everything right now. Probably because that&#039;s all we see on TV. Society has programmed us to want everything immediately. A colleague of mine was complaining the other day because she had to &quot;wait through commercials&quot; while watching a live TV show, and preferred the luxury of Netflix. You know what I say... #firstworldproblems.

ANYWAYS, I think your goals are legit... I am way too far off from being a millionaire to even start to have this conversation, but I know that it&#039;s not going to happen overnight and I know it takes dedication and perseverance.

One point you made that I found intriguing was making more money vs spending less. I think, unfortunately, a lot of consumers feel that making more money is the path to freedom. To me this doesn&#039;t make sense... Whether you stick to it for a week or a couple of years, when you make more money, your brain will eventually prompt you to spend more of it. I truly believe this is the case with most people. I think the trick is to force yourself to spend less, but within reason (like a diet... don&#039;t deprive yourself) and buy things that only add to the quality of your life.

Regardless, awesome post - and frankly I didn&#039;t even know this day existed (who thinks of these days anyways?). Thanks again man!]]></description>

I missed it by a few days. Lol. Maybe it&#039;ll eventually make it&#039;s way on to a calendar so people will know when to celebrate. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t get serious with my finances until my daughter was born a year ago. Before I didn&#039;t worry too much about the future and had a very laid back attitude towards money. Now I HAVE to gain wealth and succeed. To me there is no other option. I want to be millionaire to ensure that my family will always be taken care of. I obsess about money so I won&#039;t have to worry about money in the future. 

Now, we pay extra on the house each month to pay off my mortgage early, maxed out our Roth IRAs for the year, and make it a point that any windfalls we receive go into savings or investments. 

I&#039;m on my way to that million dollars!]]></description>

Indeed, my friend, indeed.

And what a damn good feeling it&#039;ll be each year going into the 10 too! That&#039;s really where my motivation started kicking in - watching the balance exponentially grow for once and not go *down*, haha... And throwing $$$ into retirement accounts that penalize the $hit out of you if you pull from it only makes it easier to leave alone!]]></description>
