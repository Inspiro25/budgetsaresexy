					<description><![CDATA[@ J$ I can&#039;t stand to see this!!! They can at least write out the name of the store, date and memo - then only put in the amount and signature. Do they not realize how much they are holding up others? Oh, and I&#039;ve never seen a man pay with a check either!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know, as much as I hate waiting behind slow people in the check out lines, I would MUCH prefer to see coupons holding up the register than people writing checks.  It drives me LoOnY when people start digging in their purses for checkbooks! (and it&#039;s always women too, I have yet to see a man take out a checkbook at a store in the past 10 years).  If you want to write a check, that&#039;s cool, but fill out as much as you can before getting there!  And know where it is so you don&#039;t have to search all over.  

//end rant :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With regard to doubling coupons, I live in a wasteland: Seattle. Every couple of months Albertsons lets you double three coupons. 
My daughter lives in Phoenix, where double coupons are a lot more common -- and where one store declares that all coupons are worth $1. In other words, that 25-cent coupon that Betsy&#039;s husband pooh-poohs is worth $1. Combine that with sales and instant store rebates and you can kick frugal butt.
I don&#039;t keep track of how much I save. What I can say is that I haven&#039;t paid for toothpaste and a bunch of other toiletries for years, and that coupon/rebate combos allow me to donate a ton of stuff to a couple of emergency pantries and a shelter for homeless youth. 
As for the &quot;holding up the line&quot; thing, well, possess your soul in patience for heaven&#039;s sake! It isn&#039;t just couponers who add an extra 15 seconds to your wait; it&#039;s people who can&#039;t find their debit cards, or whose credit cards are denied.
I wrote a piece on this very subject, called &quot;Don&#039;t hate the payer, hate the game.&quot; If it&#039;s kosher to post URLs, here it is:

					<description><![CDATA[@Khaleef - That is awesome! I agree, CVS is my absolute favorite when it comes to savings. I know it varies from region, but the CVS I go to always has the best employees. I should also consider drawing up a business card and perhaps offering coupon classes, there are so many people who would love to learn!

I also agree that if someone is behind you with a few items, it is a good idea to let them in front of you if you have a lot of items and coupons. However, If someone gets in line behind me when I am in the middle of my transaction and their frustrated, I am not going to let that affect me. I refuse to feel ashamed to save money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Lisa, I&#039;ve had a few cashiers complement me and remark about never seeing savings like that before. I was able to give a business card to one of them and had another one comment on one of my CVS articles! 

As far as the line is concerned. I&#039;ve actually let up to 3 people get in front of me because they had one or two items!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I only use coupons when I have a coupon for something I actually need, or if I am getting it completely free, or better yet, making money by using the coupons such as overage, extra bucks, or rebates. 

I personally couldn&#039;t care less if the person behind me is annoyed because every time they ring me up and they say my total is $50-$150 dollars, I love the satisfaction of using my coupons and then the cashier saying &quot;your total is $1.22&quot;.

I have literally had people that were behind me in line track me down in the parking lot to learn my secrets. I save tons of money, and with the things that I get for free I give away to local charities. 

As far as the excuse that coupons trick you into buying something you don&#039;t need... that&#039;s a little juvenile; a coupon doesn&#039;t have that much power over you, its simple: don&#039;t buy it. And as far as clipping coupons sucks, well work sucks too and anything that saves you money is going to require some work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[GREAT points on the *types* of food that most coupons are good for - never even thought about it.  Probably because I eat most of the non-veggie stuff out there ;)  But that does seem like a sad state of affairs.  Maybe we can be the first group to ban together and make this happen?!  Healthy Coupons for ALL!!!

And I also agree w/ those who don&#039;t like using coupons all the time since it tricks them into buying more.  That&#039;s my one and only jab at groupon and living social.com, and the rest of those daily sites (even WOOT!).  PERFECT when the stars align, but they are just too damn tempting to check every day for me... gotta watch ourselves ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Ashley Baxter&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;Whole Paycheck&quot; - haha.... Whole Foods is like that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Betsy&lt;/b&gt; - CouponMom.com - got it, thx!  You keep workin&#039; it over there.]]></description>
