					<description><![CDATA[I got a CC in college and never had an issue -- my discomfort with spending money happens at the register. I dislike spending money (and/or rejoice in the great deal) at the moment of the &quot;point of sale,&quot; as its called in retail lingo. 

That doesn&#039;t change regardless of the medium of payment that I use.

But I hear stories of other people who have problems, including one friend&#039;s boyfriend who refers to his CC as &quot;free money.&quot; So the answers certainly aren&#039;t one-size-fits-all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, well at least you got capped at $1,000!  That&#039;s way better than most others out there - so good job ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re a smart chick, my friend.  I love grabbing those rewards even though you have the cash too -- it&#039;s free money!
@&lt;b&gt;Liz&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I always forget about debit cards... I used to use them a lot too, on top of my credit card in school so I wouldn&#039;t get in trouble w/ the parents ;) Though, it also ran out a lot faster, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Daisy&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Some in college can for sure handle it, all depends on who we&#039;re talking about :)  Congrats on learning so fast!
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - True that.  I think mine was only $300 or $500?  Can&#039;t remember - been a few years ;)  You&#039;re right in that it&#039;s good for EVERYONE to keep in mind though!  Especially those who skip college altogether and go right into the &quot;real world&quot;... though, I suppose they&#039;d have more money and not *need* cards as much?  That would be an interesting research project :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - A &quot;Who&#039;s Who&quot; card?  Never heard of... did it give you special deals or something?  Sorry you&#039;re still paying it off, that sucks :(
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  True. The farther you attend college away from home, the more you&#039;ll probably feel safer WITH a credit card.  Good point.
@&lt;b&gt;Rachael&lt;/b&gt; - Well, you can&#039;t be perfect ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Camille&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes, that&#039;s a tricky one!  I think someone commented back at you below (&quot;Diane&quot;), but I think I&#039;d  have to agree and veer to the &quot;no&quot; to co-signing too.  Though I don&#039;t know your sister, or your mom, or you for that matter, haha... the idea of mixing money w/ family/friends when they&#039;re irresponsible is def. cause for trouble.  Maybe she could get a prepaid card or something instead to learn from?  Wouldn&#039;t help out w/ credit score, but better to have none and a BAD one in my books... I&#039;m pretty sure she&#039;ll figure out a way to get one anyways, most poeple do ;)  Wishing you both luck!
@&lt;b&gt;Amanda Bee&lt;/b&gt; - AGREED!  I&#039;m all about having higher credit limits than not if you can hold back the temptation. Also in that it sucks to find a co-signer for apartments ;) I had to do that when I got a place in NYC (Parents didn&#039;t trust me all the way I guess then? Haha...) and it turned into a pretty sticky situation (Was our roomate&#039;s boyfriend who then &quot;expected&quot; stuff in return if you know what I&#039;m saying.) Hopefully we never have to do that again ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle@Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, man they got you RIGHT in time! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brad Moore&lt;/b&gt; - Well, it still sucks if your debt card gets stolen and they drain your account of cash, but other than that yeah - kinda the same if you&#039;re still getting the rewards. (though actually, you wouldn&#039;t be able to use them for large emergencies either unless you have tons of cash?  So I change my vote - they&#039;re not the same, haha...)  As for your baking though, that is AWESOME!!!  You should check out my friend Danielle&#039;s destroying debt video ;)  She did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS7f9qCtuEM&amp;feature=player_embedded&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;viking burial&lt;/a&gt; with &#039;em! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Diane&lt;/b&gt; - Good response :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Camille:  Do NOT co-sign for your sister.  If you do you are almost certain to trash your own credit and regret that move.  Your Mom has good reason not to sign for her - take her lead.

This mania with getting credit right away so as to &quot;develop&quot; a credit score is dangerous. If your sister develops good financial habits and saves money she will be fine, and have no issues in future.  Far more fine than developing a debt habit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First, and unrelated to your questions, cutting up a credit card is the way to go. I was going to put a video on my website about how to bake a credit card......but it really began smelling bad and I goggled and found the fumes are poisonous. So cut &#039;em.

The main reason I have had CC&#039;s in the past was for the rewards. However, our current bank (Whitney) also gives us rewards for spending on the debt card. I figure that&#039;s the best of both worlds!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got my first credit card at 23 and that was only because someone offered me a pre-approved card. I would never forget it. I got that card a couple days before I was going on vacation in Toronto. That was the first time I ever went on a shopping spree and I went crazy on clothes. When I got back home, the bill nearly gave me a heart attack. Back then I never used to pay off the balance in one go, I would stretch it over a few months so that I could continue to save. But since then, my habits have changed - I keep a note of what I credited and I pay it off in one go. A credit card is a lot of responsibility and you have to be disciplined and keep your financial limits in mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got a card my sophomore year of college, at the ripe age of 19 by myself. It was one of the best things I did.

Neither of my parents are financially responsible people, and I can&#039;t rely on them for any kind of financial advice or help. I was super wary of cards because I didn&#039;t want to have debt like theirs (that sounds snooty, but it&#039;s not- I feel for them, I just don&#039;t want huge CC bills like them). I bought the card to build credit, and used it ONLY for gas at first. Which worked well, so I started using it for other things. But the rule was that I had to pay it off online within a few days of charging it, so it never built up and I never paid interest.

I haven&#039;t had flawless card usage since then (who does?) and ended up putting a couple of emergencies on there when I probably could have managed it out of my bank account. But I&#039;ve paid maybe $5 in interest in the past 3 years total?  So I feel like that&#039;s a success.

And now at 22 my credit is good enough that I don&#039;t have to scrounge for cosigners in the event that I ever need a loan, or have to pass a credit check for an apartment (which is common around here). And that&#039;s awesome, because finding a cosigner when neither of your parents can do it is no fun.

So I guess I agree with most of what you say- if you&#039;re trustworthy with a card, it can have huge benefits. But you have to be honest with yourself, and look at your past history to determine if you&#039;re REALLY trustworthy. Do you have a history of overdrawing your account?  Don&#039;t sign up for a card until you have that sorted.

Side note: I hate the advice that you should stick to as low of a limit as possible. High limits are helpful, credit-wise. The only reason they hurt is if you tend to load up the debt. But if you do that then you shouldn&#039;t be getting a CC in the first place, in my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well-timed post, J$.  I&#039;ve been struggling over whether I want to encourage my college sister to get a credit card, and if I should co-sign with her.  My mom did that with me the day I turned 18, but she says my sister is irresponsible with her debit card fees so she won&#039;t do it with her.

Yet, I feel like if I don&#039;t sign my sister up for a card, I&#039;m doing her an injustice.  If we don&#039;t get her credit history started asap, she could have problems getting loans when she&#039;s graduated and responsible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t remember exactly when I got my first credit card. Probably around my second year in college.  It was through my bank, my parents did not cosign with me. I just used the card sporadically and always paid it off in every month.  I do remember having a conversation with a girl who lived in my hall about credit cards when I was a freshmen.  She was doing something for a class and asking people if they had credit cards, how much they used them etc.  and she was suprised to learn that I did not have one and once I had one I didn&#039;t plan on using it that much.  Probably my biggest credit card mistake is falling for the store card trap during my senior year of college.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It also depends on WHERE you go to college.  I went to school all the way across the country so I had to get a credit card.  No way I could afford to buy an emergency last minute plane ticket across the country without one.  Luckily, I never had too, but having a little bit of peace knowing I could was worth it.]]></description>
