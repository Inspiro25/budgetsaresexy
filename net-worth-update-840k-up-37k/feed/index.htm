					<description><![CDATA[I love seeing the difference that 10 years can make! Glad to hear that your wife and baby are still doing ok. I hope you&#039;ve gotten better at just being. It seems to be a lifelong journey away from &quot;needing&quot; to be productive all the time.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad that your $$$ relationship is better :) And you&#039;re not alone in feeling anxious with this stuff - we all freak out at times! Just matters *what you do* about it, and even more so what you *don&#039;t do* haha... But we all have our own strategies, and really you can&#039;t go wrong w/ either of those funds you have listed in my opinion. Just keep adding to it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J,

I would be lying if I didn&#039;t say this little market dip has me a bit anxious.  Being 100% invested in VFIAX makes me thinking of switching to VSMGX (60/40).  It&#039;s disheartening to see a year&#039;s worth of gains evaporate.  That being said, I&#039;m still going to stick with it.  I may just switch to VTSAX when the market gets back up.  I&#039;m noticing VFIAX makes about .10% better gains but also .10% sharper declines than VTSAX.  However, VTSAX edges out slightly better over the long term (10+ years.)  Yet both John Bogle and WB like the 500.  Anywho, thanks for listening and thanks for the awesome blog that has helped me change my relationship with $.

I don&#039;t think you can every do anything too wrong in blogging - there are no rules! Unless you&#039;re not having fun - then you&#039;re doing something wrong ;) But I remember loving how clean and minimalist it looked when I popped on over there, as well as the sharing of your real life #s - so def. keep that up! People love it, obviously! Think about sharing raw stories and tips/fails too from over the years outside of the debt stuff - the more you can push yourself the better chance of people sticking around and sharing :)]]></description>

Sold our house and went back to renting :) (and loving it!)

https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/we-sold-our-house-no-more-mortgages/

Some people don&#039;t believe it should go into your net worth, but most people do - including myself - and so in that case you&#039;d list the *value* of your house in the assets column, and then the *mortgages* on the house in the liabilities column. Doing that effectively gives you your &quot;equity&quot;, only you&#039;ll be able to better see the two sides of the equation.]]></description>

Thank you! You removed tracking your house or you sold your house and don&#039;t have one to track? It should be part of my net worth? Or do I just put my equity there instead of the home value?]]></description>

Excellent question! The answer is that you really never know until the day you go to sell it, however depending on how conservative or not you are you can estimate it a number of ways: by using sites like Zillow.com (I never liked it as it over-valued mine all the time, but i know people use it), RedFin.com, taking an average of both, asking a realtor to price it every now and then (that&#039;s what we did - we asked our realtor once a year and then updated it then - and when we went to sell it it was only $1,000 off!!), or just using what you paid for it as a baseline and *not* updating the value over time. But of course every month you pay your mortgage the equity will grow due to the principal payments - so you still win in that case :)

Lots of ways to track it, but those are the most common I&#039;ve seen over the years. Hope it helps!]]></description>
