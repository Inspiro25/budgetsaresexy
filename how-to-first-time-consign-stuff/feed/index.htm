					<description><![CDATA[I thought you guys might enjoy this post :)

@&lt;b&gt;Pauline&lt;/b&gt; - I know, I hate that it&#039;s 50% but totally not worth my time :( That and I like window shopping while there and getting out of the house! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Call Me What You Want Even Cheap&lt;/b&gt; - Maybe I can pay someone else to do it for me, at like 25%, and then make 75% profit? Haha... that might work ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, those are totally rented out booths - and are usually more upscale and incredibly boring. At least to me ;) I like stuff constantly moving in and out and not priced as if they&#039;re stuff came off the Titanic!
@&lt;b&gt;Angie Nelson&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! What&#039;s going on over there? ;)  Do you want me to give you a homework assignment?
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - A car??? Now that&#039;s a first! Haha... although I shouldn&#039;t be laughing as my mom once found one at a yard sale - my dad was pretty shocked (&quot;What did you find this morning, honey?&quot;... &quot;Oh, a car.&quot;)
@&lt;b&gt;Heather Stephens&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wowwww that&#039;s an excellent idea! Totally booking that to give it a shot later - these kids outgrow EVERYTHING, my word... I can&#039;t believe you asked me if I knew you this weekend too, you turd :)  I don&#039;t think I could forget our talks last year even if I tried! Haha... if you know what I&#039;m saying ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MJYU&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ll email ya :)
@&lt;b&gt;Amanda Talbert&lt;/b&gt; - What??? Facebook??? You guys are geniuses!! Can you come here and set them up for us? :) I suck at Facebook! Man... that really is awesome. Good for you guys. And for working at a consignmnent shop too - I&#039;m totally jealous.  
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah man, you too!!  VERY cool indeed - you were one of the ones I was really looking forward to meeting :) Next time we&#039;ll have to chat a bit more too, I know things were kinda crazy there this weekend.
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;m not fans of those unless a) you get tons of foot traffic in, and b) you can sell stuff other than things that are 300 years old.  I&#039;d never fill a booth in those places!
@&lt;b&gt;Mistress Susan&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooooh now that&#039;s a good idea! I hadn&#039;t even thought of (or heard of?) high-end consignment stuff like that before, but you&#039;re right - the higher the $$ the better the return! Esp if it&#039;s not 50% :(  I&#039;ll have to see if there&#039;s others in our area as well, but for now it&#039;s a good way to test the waters and see how the whole system works.  Been having a blast so far.
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Nicely played! I once bought a dryer on CL too - a 1 year old one cuz the person sellin was a richie rich and needed a new one for her mansion or something, haha... I got it for like 90% off! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - If only I could negotiate :(
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Love it! And super smart too - our kiddo is already up into 6 month&#039;ers and he&#039;s only 2 months old!!  &quot;They grow up so fast!&quot; Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman, J C, and shey&lt;/b&gt; - All three of you thought I said &quot;Cosign&quot;?? That&#039;s hilarious! And an entirely different post, haha... I&#039;m glad you guys were wrong ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife does this all the time. We have an 8-month old, and as he grows out of clothes, or if we get clothes we just don&#039;t like, she goes there, gets credit and buys him new (used) ones. We haven&#039;t had to pay much for baby clothes over the last 8 months due to this strategy. We also do this with her clothes anytime she wants something different.]]></description>

I&#039;ve definitely sold clothes via consignment before.  I should call and see how much money I&#039;ve made so far...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow 50% is so high!  Most the ones around here at 40/60, but they usually only take antiques.  Years ago (as in my high school days lol) I use to hit up yard sales and thrift stores and resell the goodies on ebay.  I made a ton of money!!  You know, because before ebay changed everything it started out as, you actually had a shot at making some money.   I&#039;m all about some cheapcycle and craigslist these days.  I think if you handle selling it yourself, you&#039;d make a lot more money, just comes down to what/where, the time you have and marketing!  I sold our washer/dryer set for enough money to buy a brand new set and still have $75 leftover!]]></description>
