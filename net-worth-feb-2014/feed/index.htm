					<description><![CDATA[I love the Roth IRA and always max mine to the full $5500.  But if I needed the cash cushion instead, I would hold off on investing this year.  In the next year, I would make it a goal to fulfill my 2014 contribution as well as 2015.

I&#039;m such a Roth IRA fan boy!]]></description>

Possibly :( There are a lot of variables that go into this stuff though too. Like occupation, where you live, etc etc... You seem to be doing damn good though with what life has brought you! Keep going, friend!]]></description>

My lack of financial success has more to do with the fact that I am in my late 40s and had to restart my life after a divorce.   Going back to school while raising children and working for a low wage left me with debt.  

I live a very frugal life and I don&#039;t spend much on anything but my income is not high either.  I take home $1,350 every 2 weeks and own my own and have helped my sons with their post secondary educations. I am convinced that it is harder to make it as a single person.]]></description>

1) I&#039;m self-employed and the only income maker of our household (aka very unstable and need tons of cash as back up)

2) I like having tons of investments working on our behalf while I do nothing :)

3) We don&#039;t live in the house anymore (it&#039;s now a rental) so it&#039;s not as exciting to have it paid off. More like a business now which we don&#039;t want our cash tied up in.]]></description>

You dirty bastard :)

Answer to SEP ira vs SOLO - My accountant told me to :) I probably should have researched it more, but everything she said seemed to make the most sense at the time so I just ran with it... I&#039;ll ask her in more detail this month when we wrap up taxes here in a bit. I&#039;m kinda wondering too!]]></description>

Nice work there J Money. I was just curious, why SEP IRA and not Solo 401K?

Take care!

PS I maxed my SEP for 2013, but I also have a 401K at my day gig ;-)]]></description>
