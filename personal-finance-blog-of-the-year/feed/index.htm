					<description><![CDATA[THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!

x A billion million trillion.

+ suger on top.

(and a cherry)

@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - I bet they think we&#039;re a bunch of weirdos ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sue&lt;/b&gt; - Here it is if you want to see all the other categories and winners: http://www.plutusawards.com/winners/
@&lt;b&gt;B Simple&lt;/b&gt; - Did I not mention the Super Bowl yet to you? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Mike @ CreditCardForum&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, fair enough... next time we meet I&#039;ll chip some off into your beer :)
@&lt;b&gt;AB@ Aspiring Blogger .com&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe... you can see them far off in this here pic, actually ;)  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/PMrlZPwRoT/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://instagram.com/p/PMrlZPwRoT/&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;Clever Dude&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks man!  I think that&#039;s the most genuine thing you&#039;ve ever told me! I was so waiting for the punchline, hehe... much love right back to you, sir. Remember that you were my very first mentor! :) So this is all you too, bro!
@&lt;b&gt;DC @ Young Adult Money&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m still in shock that I&#039;m still here!  First time in my entire life I&#039;ve stuck with something longer than 2 years - woohoo!
@&lt;b&gt;Tino&lt;/b&gt; - It might as well be a sex blog, the terms people search to get here is incredible!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie S&lt;/b&gt; - Me too!! Just still feel like an ass for not saying bye to you OR walking you out - ugh.  After you drove all that way too!!  At least we got to chill for a little bit :)  Next time, no beer for me!
@&lt;b&gt;Mistress Susan&lt;/b&gt; - Yayyy!!! Maybe it was all due to your phone sex post though? ;)  It&#039;s still my #1 most clicked page!  You&#039;re killing it!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - You too, bro. Next time just don&#039;t let me drink so much, okay? :)]]></description>
