					<description><![CDATA[@Pauline - Interesting situation. I have no idea why your boss hired Bob with the same salary (I wouldn&#039;t do that!) so I cannot talk for him/her. Sometimes trying to keep everyone happy just doesn&#039;t work well. 
@Lace - sometimes people get such great offers that negotiating any further might be deemed offensive. :) 
@Money Beagle - true. I actually moved up myself because I changed departments and jobs. I know people who are doing the same jobs for years and years, and they are maxed out. 
@BD - if it is in fact discrimination, it can be grounds for a legal case. 
@Jay and Melissa - excellent points. By the way personality (as in a &quot;personable&quot;) does get you farther. :)
@Corey - don&#039;t jump into negotiating right away. As I said above, sometimes the offer you get might exceed your expectations. I am not going to write another post in the comment sections about how to negotiate a salary, instead I am going to email you! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great tips - I have learned that I need to negotiate more than I have in the past. This might be an idea for a post, but when you are being hired for a new position and they offer you a salary, how would you recommend negotiating the salary up? Do start with expressing your interest, but then explain why you want more money? Thanks for the thoughts. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know, I know - this is just a small snapshot of reasons, but from an HR perspective, I thought I&#039;d weigh in with a few more reasons why he&#039;s paid more (below). Also, as to the reasons above - I&#039;m not sure that getting a degree for a position you are already in will have much, if any, impact (other than the educational field). That would matter prior to accepting a position a lot more (although it&#039;s rare again, for two people with vast backgrounds such as degree/non-degree to be hired for the same position these days). 

1. Bob has received higher annual ratings and merit increases than you - because he is perceived a better performer.
2. Bob is more personable - I know, it sucks, but people tend to be more generous with salaries with someone that they feel is on their side or can be a better &quot;partner.&quot;
3. Bob as ASKED for more money - during annual reviews, following a huge project or recognition, he asked for more when his value was being evaluated.

And I agree with @Jay - you should spend more time concentrating on the bang-for-your-buck that you get from your salary and your position, regardless of what others make (as painful as that can be).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What does it matter what Bob makes? Bob can make nothing or Bob can make $1 million an hour, either way it does absolutely nothing in regards to building your own wealth. 

The question you have ask is are you paid well enough for your time? If not do something about it, ask for a raise, get a new job, find a second job, start a business, just about anything. 

If you spend too much time worrying about what Bob makes or his credentials you are spending less time coming up with ways to make more yourself.

Just saying...]]></description>
