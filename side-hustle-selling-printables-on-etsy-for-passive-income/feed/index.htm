You need to make sure all fonts and graphics you use are okay for commercial use and specifically okay to use in a template. The safest approach is to buy the font or graphic you want to use on a site like Creative Market and check the licensing. There are free fonts on Font Squirrel and Da Font you can use too. We cover this subject in more detail in the course but it sounds more intimidating than it is. Good luck! I think your Christmas printable idea sounds great!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this sounds like a fun side hustle that can create some nice passive income (or more with more effort!) If I create a printable, how do I find backgrounds or decorations for the page that aren&#039;t trademarked? I really don&#039;t know much about creative commons, but I know that it is something to be aware of when selling things like this. Or does it only pertain to pictures? Her e-book didn&#039;t discuss this aspect of selling, just ideas of items to sell and when in the year to sell them. Either way, I think this is something I will try to look into and maybe get a Christmas printable or something for the new year figured out! Thanks for the idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I&#039;ve been missing the side hustle series - nice to see another entry! 

I had an ebay flipping side hustle and I know what she means - it can be easy money in terms of time invested, but definitely adds extra stress in trying to get to the post office or find time to print off the mailing labels (my policy was I only sold items I could ship cheaply in a mailing envelope). My best flip was a mp3 player I bought for $3 and sold to a guy in Sweden for $40. When my job increases dramatically in pay and responsibility, I dropped most of my side hustles since I found I needed the recovery time more and wanted to value my time more. But I still do mTurk every once in a while (started because of this blog!) and the occasional photo job when I come across one. This seems like a good one though!]]></description>

We&#039;ve got display ads here, as well as affiliate stuff when we share something we love or use :) Others also use their blog as more of a &quot;resume&quot; to get *other* high paying gigs/freelance projects, speaking engagements, etc... 

The more traffic/community you have, the better the shot for income... Though it&#039;s not as easy (or fast!) as it may look ;)]]></description>
