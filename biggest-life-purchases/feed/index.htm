					<description><![CDATA[I am so late to this but what a fun post!
Top 5
1. Two flat (1) -230K in 2008 ( literally 6 months before the bottom fell out)
2. two flat (2)- 115k in 2010
3. two flat (3)- 124k in late 2010
4. two flate(4)- 121k in early 2011
5. college 78k just student loans, I recieved a 5 year tuition scholarship. Last year of pharmacy school was all loans!!- Paid in full March 2015!!

All my properties are green because they are rented out and cover their expenses. The first is worth 50% what I paid for it but the rent covers the cost and I am aggressively paying it off!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Th only ones I can think of are:

House - $170,000 - (which at one point i would have said red, but now I&#039;m thinking green looking at what houses in my neighborhood are now selling for at $200k+)
Car #1 - $15,000 - Bought new, with some money down, but I drove it until it died (the dealership could not figure out how to fix it) So I guess that is an orange?
Car #2 - $10,000 loan I&#039;m still paying on after putting $15,000 down. Bought kind of hastily after #1 died.  I am just hoping I get more life out of it that the previous car.  And Sometimes I kick myself for buying new, but my family has had nothing but bad luck with used, so I couldn&#039;t pull the trigger.

No other big expenses in my life (yet)!]]></description>
