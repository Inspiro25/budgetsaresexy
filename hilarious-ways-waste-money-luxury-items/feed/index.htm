					<description><![CDATA[Huh... well that&#039;s something to consider then.  We found a knock off version of a Tempur-pedic for $1,000 this week and it took everything from me to get OFF of it, haha... was sooo comfy!  But who knows how it would be once at home and living with it for a while... appreciate the info though, helps out :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... maybe out of convenience?  Or if they&#039;ve been wealthy for a while, they might not even *know* there&#039;s other way more affordable clothes out there?
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, you have one of those?  Is the hype real? Super comfortable? Or just the same as all other beds? Let me know :) We&#039;re gonna be looking for a new one very soon - can&#039;t stand ours anymore.
@&lt;b&gt;WR&lt;/b&gt; - If you&#039;re buying, I&#039;m in! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Young Professional Finances&lt;/b&gt; - I hope they&#039;re selling some of them or it&#039;d def. a waste of money ;)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Guess it just sounds sexy? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey @ Zero to One Million Challenge&lt;/b&gt; - We should build a &quot;budget nap shell&quot; for everyone, I&#039;d be down for that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... if I lived on the beach maybe :)
@&lt;b&gt;Savvy Scot&lt;/b&gt; - Def. LOOKS good, but does it work?
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - For much cheaper probably though, yeah?
@&lt;b&gt;The First Million is the Hardest &lt;/b&gt; - Hahahhaa... then it&#039;s totally worth it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Adam&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  You&#039;re always hitting up the best places. You know more about them than WE do here in the States! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that actually sounds somewhat do-able if you were rich ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - It has nothing to do w/ the water, but everything to do with the bottle it comes in ;)  All V.I.P. like w/ crystals and what not.  Though I haven&#039;t actually tasted the water yet so maybe there is something special in it too? (I doubt it)
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ Afford Anything&lt;/b&gt; - If I win the lottery it&#039;ll be one of the first things I&#039;ll get for you ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Anna&lt;/b&gt; - Like this :)  It&#039;s the one I own: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bau_sonhos/373638825/lightbox/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Red Bling h20&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since I wake up in my pod, drink a bottle of Bling H2O, check my messages on my diamond-encrusted phone, shave my legs with an iriium razor, dry off with a Hermes beach towel, and spritz myself with doggy perfume all before I eat my gold-leaf/caviar sundae every morning, I don&#039;t think any of these are ridiculous ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a fun list. I&#039;ve actually been to the New York city restaurant, Serendipity 3 and saw that dessert on the menu.

I couldn&#039;t finish my $20 dessert so no point in the $1k one!]]></description>
