Yeah, he snores a lot less now (hardly at all), so it did what it was meant to do. I just wish we could have planned ahead and saved up after he heard that a tonsillectomy was an option for sleep apnea. 

I think for him, it was priceless because he has much better sleep. Even before he would subconsciously pull the CPAP mask off in his sleep so it was much better to not have to wear a machine, it just stinks how expensive medical needs can be :(]]></description>

Ugh, sorry to hear...

Is he at least happy with the outcome? And sleeping better now? 

Many people would say that is priceless :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just used $150 from our HSA account to pay on a pesky medical bill from my husband&#039;s tonsillectomy last year. It&#039;s nowhere near being paid off, but it has been bugging me because he swore that we would hit our deductible and it would all be covered but he didn&#039;t understand that we were still going to be charged 20% after the deductible until we meet our out of pocket maximum (which we were nowhere near). The surgery was to help his sleep apnea so it wasn&#039;t exactly medically necessary but he no longer has to wear a CPAP, which is what he was hoping to happen from the surgery.

Bills, bills, bills...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While creating our January budget the other night, my husband and I agreed to add a $10/week &quot;mad money&quot; line item for each of us, so about $40/month. Some of this I&#039;ll use for the occasional coffee stop or art supplies, but anything extra is going in my DSLR fund. I&#039;ve wanted one since 2011, but just never seem to be able to justify spending $600-$800 when I&#039;m trying to pay off student loans and build up savings. Here&#039;s to saving for something that will bring me joy. :)]]></description>

I did this with the Detroit half-marathon in 2013. I was just managing 5ks, but once I signed up for that race and put my $75 down, I was in it for the long haul!]]></description>
