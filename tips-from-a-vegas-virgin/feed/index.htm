					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - Should I get your autograph now, or later? :)

&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Haha oh yeah, people get p-i-s-s-e-d at the tables! And @ dealers.... The very last time I was there I had a bit too much to drink (shocker) and was actually WINNING for once in Hold &#039;Em to the point I started actually feeling bad for the others at the table (it was the alcohol!).  So one time, after winning I&#039;d say about $300 off 1 hand, I tried giving all the money back to them and said someting like &quot;That was a tough break fellas, here, have your money back!&quot;  And I about got killed.  My good deed made me look like a big asshole and people left the table (only 1 person took the money :) ) and the dealer said if I did it again I&#039;d be thrown out.   

So yes, pay attention to the rules and the cues!  Especially the latter - dealers have no problem explaining the game to newbies.

&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Some people get away with it though ;)
&lt;b&gt;Vegas Mish&lt;/b&gt; - Thx!
&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - Hahhaa... at least you came out with a nice story ;)  Much better than -$200.
&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, TONS of stuff to do there.  And cheap too if you research enough.  I&#039;ve got with people who don&#039;t gamble and they&#039;re always getting into something.
&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - I like the way you think, sir!
&lt;b&gt;Pretty Unfamous&lt;/b&gt; - You girls get it GOOOOOOOOD there, you&#039;re right on that :)  And also at places here in D.C.  SO many &quot;girls night&quot; themes at bars/clubs where you get the hook up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The BEST tip for Las Vegas is just being a girl and going with a group of girl friends. We got comp&#039;ed alcohol in all the clubs and no cover.

Also, save up your loose change for awhile and bring THAT as your gambling money. But make sure to cash it in as dollar bills BEFORE you get to the casino--a lot of casinos won&#039;t take and cash in your dimes because they don&#039;t have dime slots in the casino. My friends brought a ton of change one time and had to dig out all the dimes before the cashier would take the rest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last time I was in Vegas (about a month ago) we walked to the strip stopping at all the cheap drink places!  They are hard to find but how do you pass up 1 dollar beers and 3 dollar irish car bombs at 11am!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On my second trip down the aisle I got married in Vegas and we brought along our two young children.  It&#039;s illegal for kids to hang out in the casino so as we were at our hotel walking from the lobby to the elevator you had to walk thru the casino.  If the kids doddled for a second a security person would come along and tell me to keep moving.  One day my kid decided to throw the mother of all mother temper tantrums right in the middle of the casino as we were making our way to the elevator.  She wouldn&#039;t move and if I picked her up she started kicking me.  I&#039;m not stupid- I moved back.  A security person came up and told me to move along.  I looked at him like he was crazy.  I was VERY tempted to move right along and leave her there to finish her tantrum!
We didn&#039;t have a chance to gamble!]]></description>
