Fascinating!!! Are you able to ask him and find out, or is he no longer around? I&#039;d imagine the wealth would have to be somewhere right now if that&#039;s true (and he&#039;s gone)? I doubt he would have let you kids go hungry if so - prob didn&#039;t accumulate it until everyone was out of the house as kids just eat through wealth ;) (at least mine do!)]]></description>

Haha yeah, probably all that partying back in the day that messed me all up :) Never calculated what I missed out on, but seeing how I was only making like $7/hr at the time I doubt my 3% would have amounted to much, haha... Plus I had all that partying to do! Which eventually forced me to move back home for a while as I ran out of money (turns out living in NYC is pretty expensive - who knew?)]]></description>

You must have an incredibly vivid imagination to have fooled yourself that you had actually waltzed into HR. Oh my goodness, why isn&#039;t this a blog post for beginners!?! I&#039;m cracking up! The best lessons learned are learned the hard way. Have you calculated yet how much you would have put away, and how much it would have grown, if it weren&#039;t for your error?
I think it&#039;s great that your Dad harrassed you--not only in the beginning to DO IT, but also to see how much you had saved. Imagine if he hadn&#039;t followed up? Maybe all parents need to harp on their kids more (I know, kids everywhere--myself included--just groaned). None of our three work (yet!) at a place that offers 401k, but they should at least be doing a Roth. Oh, to be young and frivolous again...]]></description>

Glad you liked!

Oh yes, I&#039;d say we asked for about 5 things a week and maybe - if we got lucky and if the thing was cheap - we&#039;d get 1 :) Always got a lot of things for Xmas and birthdays though, because my mom was great at finding bargains and had a whole year to look for them! haha... and as a kid you just liked getting a LOT of things vs just a cple nice things, so we never complained at all even if most of the things we got prob cost like $3 haha...]]></description>
