					<description><![CDATA[I just used this service from Lendtable and it is literally can&#039;t miss for those who cannot afford to budget out enough from their paychecks to take advantage of their company&#039;s 401(k) company match. They lend you the money to receive your full match and then just take a percentage once the money vests. Would highly recommend!]]></description>

Congrats! Just keep in mind the markets fluctuate like crazy though (as evidence of this week - having the biggest drop in a start of the year ever!) so it&#039;s more of a long term thing than short term. Like, 5, 10, 20, 40 years :) So I&#039;m glad you&#039;re seeing a nice jump here, but don&#039;t be too discouraged when future quarters are down. Which they will most definitely be. But the nice thing is that you now have an extra pair of eyes on your account to help you weather the storms :)]]></description>

Hey Pam - it usually takes a few days for them (Smart401k) to review and get back to you fyi :) As for losing $$ in the markets lately, you&#039;re not alone - we&#039;re all losing more or less these days. Just the way the markets go. It&#039;s possible that you&#039;re also not invested in the right funds for your goals too, but try to not let it discourage you. The $$$ is for the long haul and the beauty of it going down right now is that you can scoop up more for cheap each paycheck! So hang in there :)]]></description>

Jeez.....

I wish they would set up those calls *after* helping people figure out their 401k stuff first - I&#039;m going to shoot them a note to ask. The service they&#039;re providing here - Smart401k - for free should be all handled first. Then if people like what they&#039;re about and want additional help w/ outside investments, great! If not, also great. I feel like all the calls are confusing people... I&#039;m sorry about that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I signed up and they called me afterwards.  They said they were setting up a consultation and that I could have another 401k right-sized, and that the company would NOT try to sell me anything.  TheMutualFundStore.com called to set up a consultation.  I show up and BOOM, they try to sell their services right off the bat.  They weren&#039;t interested in right-sizing a portfolio they couldn&#039;t make money from.  Now I&#039;m dodging their calls to meet a 2nd time.  Their admin fees are too high, and there&#039;s of course (naturally) no guarantee of returns.  So I pay the original admin fees on the funds themselves, THEN yet another mgmt fee?  No thanks!]]></description>

Target dates could be good just depending on what the other options are and your goals/etc. Let me know if you end up trying Smart401k out, and what they recommend in comparison :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing. I was just talking with a friend the other day about needing to really look at my investment options for my 401k. Currently, I have a target retirement fund, which isn&#039;t the best, but it&#039;s easy. One of my financial goals this year is to better understand retirement investing and become more active in investments.]]></description>
