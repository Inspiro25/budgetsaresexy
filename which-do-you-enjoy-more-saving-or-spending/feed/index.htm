					<description><![CDATA[I definitely prefer saving. I love watching my balances grow! Spending is more of a &quot;have to&quot; kind of thing; if I could get what I needed and do what I wanted without spending, that would be awesome. Kind of like not having to sleep. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;tj&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, savings is savings!  And I hear ya on the getting bored part, I tend to go down that route too at times ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Early Retirement Extreme&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that is awesome.  I really need to start researching more investing stuff down the road.  I&#039;m GREAT at maxing out 401k and Roth, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not invested 100% smartly.  Although I&#039;m cool w/ being 80% good too ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, that&#039;s very easy to answer; SAVING!

Saving correlates well with one of my primary values. 

Conversely, spending is completely anticorrelated with several of my values: independence, self-sufficiency, competence. Spending means I lack the competence to construct my own solution and it means I need to depend on others. 

I guess it&#039;s a blessing that the money stuff I earned while I was earning could be invested. Otherwise, I frankly wouldn&#039;t really have known what to do with it. Granted, there are a few things I still haven&#039;t figured out how to avoid spending money on. I&#039;m working on that though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: the 47%,  to be fair, I did receive a hefty tax refund this year due to the 1st time homebuyer credit....  but my monthly bills for the so-called &#039;necessities&#039; (mortgage, hoa, gas/water, tv/internet) is still probably under 30% of my gross, so its easy to save.

Plus, I just started socking 15% away into 401k when I became eligible, which I don&#039;t keep track of in my budget)

life&#039;s cheap when your single (even on the west coast!), but I do get bored a lot..need some new (free!) hobbies!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was fun to read :)  A few responses - 

@&lt;b&gt;ctreit&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;I wonder if we should call it “delayed spending” rather than saving&quot; That&#039;s a very good way to look at it, sir. It&#039;s true, we will usually spend it at some point! :)  But saving for 40 years is still being filed under &quot;saving&quot; in my books.
@&lt;b&gt;Tiffany&lt;/b&gt; - Nothing new in my 9-5 stuff...still waiting for everything to be finalized so we can move on.  This limbo time blows.
@&lt;b&gt;Greg McFarlane&lt;/b&gt; - hmm....I guess I&#039;ll agree with you for a majority of that.  I know plenty of people who go to the gym to listen to music on hit on girls, so they def. enjoy that ;)   But I see your point.  All about proportions.
@&lt;b&gt;Michael Manfredi&lt;/b&gt; - Just turned 30 my man.  Not sure what you&#039;re counting as &quot;older&quot; but it seems to me that you earn MORE and spend LESS as time goes on, once you&#039;ve figured out how to work it.  If you&#039;re talking about retirement ages though, then yeah - def. bringing home less at that point.
@&lt;b&gt;One Frugal Girl&lt;/b&gt; - I like the way you think :)

@&lt;b&gt;Jenn&lt;/b&gt; - I TOTALLY hear you on that &quot;if I spend X now, that means losing X later&quot; type mentality - doesn&#039;t that suck? I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way cuz *knowing* and reflecting on this information is very very good, but I do miss the days of willy nilly spending and being naive about the whole thing ;)  I&#039;m impressed you guys track this so much though!  Not many people can pull that off.

@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;purchasing toilet paper made me feel queesy&quot; - hahahaaha....wow, ya just never know what you&#039;re gonna find in these comments are ya ;)
@&lt;b&gt;tj&lt;/b&gt; - 47%?!  Damn, that is great!  Mad impressive.
@&lt;b&gt;Broke by Choice&lt;/b&gt; - “purposeful” spender and saver, I like that.  Being conscious of your decisions is always good :)
@&lt;b&gt;finallygettingtoeven.com&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I hear that.  If I stopped traveling I&#039;d be a lot more wealthier too.  But then all I&#039;d want to do is go spend it on traveling! haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I only enjoy spending if I can afford it...which means that I had to SAVE for it first!  Spending outside my means = credit card debt or having to take money away from other things I&#039;m saving for (like retirement or a vacation).  So, I get more gratification from saving than spending.  I love seeing that savings account balance go up knowing that I&#039;m one step closer to that awesome vacation!!]]></description>
