					<description><![CDATA[(Aw the babies are so cute!) I should do this! I have around a month before I am off on holiday, and this will help me keep track. I find online shopping is something I have done too often recently. Will try to stay away from it unless necessary, and this will help me keep track of the &#039;wants&#039;]]></description>

GOOD!!!! I&#039;m so excited for you to see what you end up finding through the experiment! Will you come back and let me know after a month? :) Our c/c bill tends to skew upwards over the years too, but mainly because we keep on having kids haha... Hoping now that we&#039;re content with our three we can start shifting it in the other direction :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of tracking &quot;wants&quot;.  I generally use my credit card for all purchases and find the monthly total is really getting high.  Used to be about 1K, now it&#039;s over 2K.  A lot of that is house related but then, that&#039;s mostly still in the &quot;want&quot; category.  I look at the expenses and say &quot;oh, that is a one-time expense&quot; but I find I think that a lot.  I may be late to this party, but I&#039;m starting my &quot;want&quot; tracking today!
J$, thank you so much for your very practical money management advice.  I&#039;m glad to have found you.

And my first job when I returned to work was a playground monitor and crossing guard at my son&#039;s school.....the hardest job I&#039;ve EVER had on many different levels!  Just think in 6 years, 11 months, and 1.5 weeks you too can be holding a walkie talkie and be responsible for 90 kids running around like crazy after lunch with ONLY ONE OTHER ADULT!  Just letting you know as I think you are currently in training for a prime position like this :)]]></description>

Give it a shot!! Even for just a couple of hours - it really helps break up the day and you feel a part of society again :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need to to track my spending. It&#039;s been creeping up lately for the items that fall into the &quot;other&quot; bucket of my budget.  

I should try working from Panera or a coffee shop. I work from home and find it so isolating. I also eat way too much since I sit right next to the kitchen. I try to not buy junk food so it&#039;s not in the house, but it&#039;s amazing what you can find in your pantry if you dig deep enough. lol

Those boys are adorable! Looks like you will have your hands full!]]></description>

It&#039;s def. been rewarding so far :) Especially when people I barely know come up to me and say what a great father I am taking the kids everywhere, haha... They should be doing that to all the MOMS out there! But I guess it&#039;s still pretty uncommon seeing Dad in the mix so much...

And 312% - Incredible!! With the same income/expenses no less, that&#039;s some proof right there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is AMAZING what increased awareness does to personal finances. We were able to determine how much more we paid off debt the first year we became focused (2012) vs. the year before (2011). Same income, same expenses - and a 312% improvement! I&#039;m sure that your 2nd month is going so much more frugally not just because of your ramped-up daddy role, but also because of your ramped-up awareness. (And way to be such a hands-on dad! I just read an article this morning about how good dad-involvement is for baby, mom, and even dad :)]]></description>
