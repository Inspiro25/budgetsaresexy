					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;UPDATE: JAR NOW HAS $15.00 in it ;)&lt;/b&gt;
I swear I&#039;m getting better though! (no pun intended)

@&lt;b&gt;Eva&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you&#039;re totally correct there.  I&#039;ve done this twice already and had to double my payments ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  But you know that IS a good idea for next year -- stop buying lottery tickets.  Would be super hard for me ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;*UPDATE:  Swear Jar now has $5.00 in it -- but I&#039;m starting to catch myself!*&lt;/b&gt;

@&lt;b&gt;Ruby&lt;/b&gt; -- Haha, yeah.  You go in all kinds of phases doing a no-spend challenge :)  I wrote about it once years ago, if you&#039;re interested here&#039;s the link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/4-stages-youll-encounter-during-no/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The 4 Stages you’ll encounter during a &quot;No Spend&quot; challenge.&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;Lauryn&lt;/b&gt; -- Small steps :)  Usually once you try it once, you can get back into the habit easier the second or third time.  Or if you&#039;re REALLY good, nix it altogether.  The adventure&#039;s kinda fun though.
@&lt;b&gt;CouponPrincess&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahaha....  i hear that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doing the same thing, I&#039;m giving up swearing and cookies for Lent. So far I have been a fail with the cookies and better the swearing..well except for last night and this morning. Atlanta&#039;s rush hour traffic can really make you use some colorful words..OY! LOL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doing a 30-Day-No-shopping challenge, and as you found- it just totally changes things.  It has totally shifted my thinking.  I&#039;m actually really looking forward to the select few items I&#039;ve been wanting for the past 22 days- I&#039;m only getting a few things (weeded out a TON of impulse buys)  and the cravings to shop have really calmed down.  

I&#039;m not sure how I feel about it though- I&#039;m kind of worried I&#039;m obsessing over what I can&#039;t have, but on the other hand- the anticipation and delayed gratification will make me appreciate my money spent and the adorable shoes THAT much more.  :)]]></description>
