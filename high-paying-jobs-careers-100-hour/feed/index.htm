					<description><![CDATA[Interesting list...though misleading.  Massage therapists can make $100 per hour but most are not making that $100 per hour consistently.  A lot of people go into MT thinking it&#039;s a great way to make money and enjoy what you do but most do not realize the actual &quot;real numbers&quot; in the career.  The range is more like $25-80k per year gross.  Most MTs that graduate with you...will NOT be doing massage 5 years later...they may have great MT skills but no business skills.  

The same goes for many on this list.  Interior designer, Tattoo artist...etc...]]></description>

I am a production welder for a small company in Illinois currently but I have worked for Caterpillar and compensation with benefits was no where near $100 an hour. So I have to ask where do you work? Because even the most dangerous jobs in welding dont even come close to $100 an hour including underwater welding. infact the average income for underwater welding is close to $30 an hour ...not $100. unless they were talking about the top 5% of that industry. Look it up the list is flawed. most under water welding according to the something something of global statistics on average compensation of a underwater welder is like $26.24 per hour. regardless i plan to move to Oregon in the next couple months to join D.I.T in Seattle,WA. But i am still curious where you work making $100 an hour. Or were you including the benefits in wirh your pay?]]></description>

You ignorant f....it&#039;s about supply and demand. Welcome to the free market. If people stopped getting tattoos because the price is too high, the artists would charge less to be able to do what they love. And if it was all about money the artists would do something different. It&#039;s the same thing as buying cars. Primus cars are constructed cheaply and are extremely under powered, but people are stupid and can&#039;t get enough of them so they are over priced piles of plastic junk.]]></description>
