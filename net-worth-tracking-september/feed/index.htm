Yeah, I use my budget spreadsheet to track it all (I built in a net worth section up top):

Though the picture you see above is a bit different as I extract the #&#039;s and then pretty it up for y&#039;all :) You could easily change the colors and what not in the spreadsheet though for yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks like almost everyone’s net worth has been dropped and they including myself and you care less about net worth drop. The reason is simple. We know time is on our side and as long as we keep save and invest wisely, the net worth will easily grow like there is no tomorrow. Mine dropped by 0.6% even though I have been growing my cash position for next year&#039;s tax deferred investment room.  Thanks for sharing!

Cheers!
