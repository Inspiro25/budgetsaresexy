Thanks man! I try my best to stick to what I enjoy writing, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#039;t. But at the very least it&#039;s better than writing about stuff that bores me! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So after reading this article I&#039;ve concluded that I should invest in Brittany Spears memorabilia - a solid investment that excites all of us. :) going through your list of 2015 fav articles and enjoying them! It&#039;s a bummer that what gains the most page views due to Google or a catchy title isn&#039;t always the best material. Thanks for sharing and for your motivation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re barely keeping our heads above water Everyday! We&#039;re both Disabled, no money for anything and a favorite cat that needs to see a Vet asap! I&#039;ve tried everywhere possibly that I have been told about, but they are more concerned about their money upfront than helping me, help her! We made sure all our bills were paid this month but sure didn&#039;t see This coming! Money......what&#039;s that???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, I agree that it depends on what motivates you.  I personally HATE debt, even though, yes I do currently have some. It makes me feel imprisoned, and I don&#039;t like that feeling.  So I work fervently to eliminate it, sometimes to my detriment.  At the same time, I&#039;m a big advocate of investing and creating passive income that will help pay the debt, instead of doing it all myself.  In other words, running circles around my debt as I call it - I&#039;m working on that!]]></description>
