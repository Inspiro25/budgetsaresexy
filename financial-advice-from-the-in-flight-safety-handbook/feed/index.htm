					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to respond to Kerry&#039;s post.  I was in the military in a capacity that required me to fly with the aircraft.  As such, I had to attend annual training in the altitude chamber - wherin they simulate typical cruising altitude, then remove the cabin pressure.  Everyone responds differently to this scenario, but everyone I ever was in training with lasted a good 4-5 minutes before they absolutely needed their oxygen masks.  Not to say that symptoms don&#039;t start at 7-9 seconds, but you do not pass out that quickly.

Anyway, great post Brad - and I wish I had taken this advice before lending my sister yet another $500 about 6 months ago.  She still has not paid me back and probably never will...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Kerry - Yeah 7-9 second doesn&#039;t seem like very much time to safe yourself and your children and that is a GREAT thing to know if it ever did happen. LOL

@ Crystal - People often guilt themselves into helping others even if their own situation is in dire need of help. (It&#039;s tough to point out that they should stop) Most of the reactions I got when suggesting this with clients was emotional. &quot;How can I just let my parents suffer?&quot; My question is this. Why do you think it is your fault your parents are suffering and why should you put yourself in danger just to help someone them out?

Help yourself, and you can help others a WHOLE LOT EASIER. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is interesting, but I thought I should tell you why (at least this is what my pilot husband told me)... if the oxygen masks come down, you only have 7 - 9 seconds before you pass out. If you don&#039;t help your kids, then you all pass out and there&#039;s no one to help. 

Now, obviously I know that this piece is NOT about this, but I thought that I&#039;d tell ya the true reason! (I also think that airlines should tell us this - wouldn&#039;t you want to know to try to stay calm or at least hold your breath!?!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Michelle - It gets even tougher when a family gives money to help their parents pay a light bill when they are struggling to pay their own. It&#039;s definitely hard to say no to your parents or any close family for that matter, but it really boils down to figuring out if your help is really helping or prolonging the struggle. It&#039;s amazing how some people can find ways to help themselves when they are forced too. As long as they are being helped they have no reason to even try. This creates a huge wall of resentment that eventually tears down relationships. 

You are definitely in a tough situation. Good luck to you and your family.]]></description>
