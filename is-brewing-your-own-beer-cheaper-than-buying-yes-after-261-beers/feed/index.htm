Awesome, Chris! Let me know how it goes!  The seltzer is pretty easy, but not as easy as cider (imo). I&#039;m curious to hear how it goes for you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice! We&#039;ve done hard cider a few times since Jenni is gluten-free (making beer a little harder to do or at least more limited). Cider production is pretty easy and CAN be pretty tasty.

You&#039;ve piqued my interest in considering beer production for myself and some friends...plus a reminder to give cider another go! :) Really enjoyed the deep breakdown for each expense/part required. Hadn&#039;t thought about Seltzer, so that&#039;s a neat idea too!

Cheers!]]></description>

That&#039;s awesome Tony, would love to see your set-up! You&#039;re right that the more expensive craft beer you buy, the cheaper and cheaper home-brewing good beer is!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good stuff but I think brewing your own is far cheaper if comparing home brew to craft beer.. Your average price, I think, averages in other beer. I know a Sam 6pk here is $10. Your cheapest 4pk of craft is $16... so add another $8 to make that 4pk a 6pk. This brings your cheapest average 6pk of craft beer to $24. Nevermind something like KBS which can fetch $25 to $30 a 4pk.

So let&#039;s say on average your typical case of craft beer is, at the cheapest, $96 a case and that is for 12oz (Bourbon County 22oz is over $200 for a case of 12).

If using those numbers, I&#039;m willing to bet that even with great equipment, you recoup that cost quickly. 

I&#039;ve got over $4K invested in my home brewery and the best feeling is winning 1st place and best in show for a home brew. That type of satisfaction is priceless.]]></description>

Cheers Jason! It&#039;s definitely eye opening to put all the numbers down on paper! I wish I kept better records on homebrew costs vs. store bought alcohol. I my beer spending all in the same &quot;alcohol&quot; category in my annual budget, so it&#039;s not broken down by type.  Enjoy the brews and cheers for reading!]]></description>

Hey Steve, glad to hear you continue it as a hobby even after realizing it&#039;s not financially beneficial. :)  Home-made beer also makes a great gift for others, as holiday treats or just to say thank you to people. One of the priceless joys of brewing is giving away samples!]]></description>

From my experience, if you&#039;re buying at places like Bevmo, the cost roughly works out the same for keg beer vs. cans/bottles. The other issue is a much smaller selection and range of beer to choose from. Some larger craft breweries sell kegs directly from the tap room which can be a teeny bit cheaper, but I&#039;ve only done that a few times.

You&#039;re definitely right about the more you buy, the more you drink!]]></description>

Hey Angie! Congrats on the no drinking. I&#039;ve never tried making a gluten free beer, maybe that&#039;ll be a new challenge for me one day. :)]]></description>
