Hey Shelley! We chose to not have any insurance for that year. Actually it turned out to be a few years. We are incredibly blessed that nothing went majorly wrong during that time (had a few issues and just paid out of pocket for care).  This is a route that I am not recommending to anyone, but it worked out for us for that time.

Good luck on the sabbatical. Regardless of cost, I think you&#039;ll find time away is always worth it!]]></description>

Hey Peter - great to hear. Let me know if I can help at all. I&#039;m just returning to work after a 2 year sabbatical and happy to share experiences. Ultimately, you have to feel comfortable yourself and make the leap. There&#039;s also no harm in not doing it too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I’ve come late to the party - both to this blog post and to taking a career break (I’m over 40). But this is really inspiring to me. I’m really keen to take the plunge, but have the usual worries. I think as we get older it seems like there is more to lose. I must do this though. Time to properly plan and maybe set myself a fixed date in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved this article more than you know! I had a terrifying work experience about a month ago and that coupled with a journaling on what I wanted from life, I’ve started asking myself if I need a break. It’s so hard to see past the what if’s especially when I feel financially secure, like I’m at the peak of my career, etc but I think I keep coming back to this space of is there more to life and need to chase that question a little further. SUPER inspiring :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Lisa,

I&#039;m 54, single with 3 kids pretty much on their own. I have 27 years with my company,and I&#039;m considering a sabatical.  I would probably have to leave my career to do it, however I&#039;m so ready for a change and a fresh beginning.  Time to follow my heart and my desires. I really enjoyed your story. Thank you. Any recommendations for someone older like me who wants to make a course correction?  Thanks. Paul]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Muchas gracias Lisa, I’m sure you are having a fantastic time with your Catalan :). And kudos for your journey.... unfortunately very few people do what they really want. And glad you are not one of them :)

I admire people who are true to themselves, and take the courage to try even when things don’t go in the expected way.

“In life you win or learn” - you did it 

“Is reacher the person who need less than the one who have more” - you showed it 

“When nothing is sure, all is possible” - you are a testimony of that.

I’m planning a sabbatical to become a stay home dad and enjoy a 4 year old son to play, learn, explore, grow, together in a very different way that the current social system teaches; “work hard, be worry for the future, and forget the present moment”

My dream is to teach my son that;
1) life is great and easy
2) be happy no matter what
3) try and fail and enjoy the journey
4) be self-confident, humble and respectful to others
5) experience all and make decisions based on learnings

I see this as the best investment I can ever make on my son’s happiness solid foundation.

please accept my sincere respect and tribute to you and your journey!!!

Cheers/Jesus]]></description>
