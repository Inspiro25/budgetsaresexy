					<description><![CDATA[HAH! That is an awesome one indeed :) And even better that you&#039;re working the system and hustling at a car parts place! Haha... you, sir, are a smart one. What a brilliant way to learn and have fun all on the cheap. Def. something that will pay off forever and ever!

Thanks for sharing my man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite hobby is fixing cars. This hobby doesn&#039;t really cost anything - in fact, it SAVES me hundreds of dollars by not having to pay someone else to fix my cars. It does require you to buy tools, however I think tools are more of an investment. With all the money I save fixing things myself, the tools pay for themselves. I&#039;ve bought expensive tools that paid for themselves the very first time I used them (and they continue to save me money every time I use them thereafter). I&#039;ve bought some tools that I thought for sure I would use once and never need again, only to end up using them again and again.

Fixing cars myself also requires I buy parts. I save money here too, at my side-hustle gig, working at an auto parts store. I get a substantial employee discount. Many people don&#039;t realize repair shops buy parts from a store like the one I work at, then the shop marks up the price even more and pockets the difference. Do-it-yourselfers save not only by not having to pay for labor, but also by avoiding the extra parts mark-up. 

Monthly costs - If you count &quot;hobbies&quot; and &quot;auto maintenance/repair&quot; as separate expenses like most people would, then cost of hobbies is zero.

If I were rich - My hobby would start costing me money. I would buy a project car (perhaps a couple, or a dozen project cars, how rich are we talkin&#039; here? :) ) and spend lots of money fixing it up, probably more money than what the car is worth. Not to mention I already have 2 cars and don&#039;t need any more.

If I were poor - I would pretty much HAVE to pursue my hobby; I wouldn&#039;t be able to afford to pay someone else to fix my cars even if I wanted to (which I don&#039;t!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ron Fucking Swanson!

No not yet, it would only depress me and make me want to spend more money than I should. I troll CL&#039;s for certain tools but normally buy new tools. I&#039;m pretty inexperienced when it comes to building from scratch. Alot of times we&#039;ll find furniture such as chairs for the dining room that need to be broken down and reglued/reupholsered/stained, or a piece of furniture such as a dresser to convert into a vanity. My basement and one of my guest BR look like I&#039;m running a shop out of my house. We simply haven&#039;t gotten to it yet. I lack the tools to build most things from scratch, but I plan on slowly accumulating all the tools needed to make my own pieces. Who knows maybe I could use my skills for a side hustle, once I&#039;m done with my MBA I&#039;ll have more time off than I know what to do with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1st post to your website, came over from MMM, lots of great content.

My current favorite hobby is woodworking/remodeling. As much for necessity as it is for pleasure in doing the work. I&#039;ve always had a penchant for doing things myself whether it be home improvement or fixing my car. Needless to say I&#039;ve acquired alot of tools this past year probably 3K worth or $250 a month. On the plus side I still saved thousands doing the work myself. I also enjoy working out which is free (P90X at home), and running adventure races like the Tough Mudder. But these races can be over $100 a pop so I normally don&#039;t do more than 2 a year. My wife&#039;s favorite hobby is cooking which probably adds another $150 to our monthly grocery bill, but we eat a minimal amount of processed foods so I certainly wouldn&#039;t change her spending. 

Compared to other bills: I would say our hobbies combined equal our monthly electricity/gas/oil (winters are expensive in the NE).

If I were rich I could easily spend $25k on woodworking tools. Since I&#039;m not I&#039;ll have to settle for good enough.

If I were poor: I could still stay in shape, probably wouldn&#039;t spend money on races. I wouldn&#039;t have bought a house that required me to buy tools to restore, and hopefully the less quality food we would have to buy would still be enjoyable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great question... I don&#039;t actually spend much on my hobbies... and my most seasoned and loved &#039;hobby&#039; was more of a... labour of love, a performance art (card magic), and so that was pretty inexpensive as you can imagine!, just cards!

I&#039;m not sure if money you spend on hobbies could ever count as wasteful since, they are your past-times, and you are the sum of your parts - so what better to spend money on than a hobby, a passion or something like that... much better than to throw dollars (I&#039;m British, pretentious!) into the pockets of banks and corporations. Whatever that means!]]></description>
