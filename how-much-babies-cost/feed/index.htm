&quot;Female repellent&quot; - hah! I feel like we&#039;ve all accidentally sprayed ourselves with that at some point in our lives :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Naw... it doesn&#039;t cost 1/4 million to raise just one child ($1 cool million at four).  An unmarried co-worker told me so.  Of course he did that in front of others who were married.  He still stuck to his ignorant position.

My guess is 1/4 million is on the low side.

He of course, never married.  Women liked his appearance and money but he daily sprayed himself with female repellent.  Just obnoxious.]]></description>

I&#039;m sure our costs will look extreme to some, and a lot less to others. As you can see, healthcare, daycare, and college savings makes up a bulk of our costs at $20,000+. Could we skimp on a lot of that? Sure. But it doesn&#039;t make sense for us in our current phase right now. I put all this out there to give a real-life account of how much it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; cost someone, but there&#039;s a lot of factors to consider such as locale, needs, goals, careers, lifestyle, etc. It&#039;s hard to compare when it&#039;s not apples to apples.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to admit, this was painful to read, I&#039;ve spent a fraction of that on my kids. Hell, we lived on what you spent on Junior in a year. And unless you are simply noting the costs without any intent to spend carefully (which is perfectly fine in itself, but seems counter to part of the point of your blog/lifestyle)... I think &quot;challenge everything&quot; is sorely needed here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cloth diapers have saved us quite a bit so far.  We have spent about $600 on cloth diapers for baby #1, which, based on your numbers will save us about $500.  Once baby #2 comes along (only in the conceptual stages at this point) we will have saved $1700-ish.  There is also, beleive it or not, a pretty good used market for diapers, which will get us another small bump.]]></description>

Haha - you&#039;re right on that one! It definitely changes your priorities a bit ;)

Congrats on the soon-to-come babe though! Such an exciting time in life - soak it all up, even when you&#039;re tired and annoyed w/ the little guy/girl! :) The phases changes so fast in the first few years - it&#039;s amazing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your baby tracking endeavor was amazing! My husband and I are expecting a little one in a few weeks time and I&#039;ve also been trying to keep track of all our expenses so far but it&#039;s been way too difficult to get everything recorded. I have a feeling that once the baby is actually here, I will have neither time nor energy to keep it up too. So for you to have reached 29 months is truly spectacular!]]></description>

For sure - these #&#039;s will be different for everyone :) And our 2nd has cost way less so far since we already have most things in place and now he gets hand me downs from his older brother! Woohoo!

RE: Insurance costs - A bulk of that $$ is all the premiums over the months. We had some ER visits and stuff in there too, but mainly it&#039;s the high # due to insurance rates - and it doesn&#039;t help that I&#039;m self-employed and have to get our own :)]]></description>
