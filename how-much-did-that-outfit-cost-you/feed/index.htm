OMG this is good, haha....

Love the Walmart underwear next to all the fancier jewelry! And also that the engagement ring is only $175!! Are you actually engaged or is it just cuz you love the ring?

Thanks for playing along... Might have to revive this post and do a current update :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pajamas today, so.. 

Yesterday was fairly cheap.

Beatles Junk Food tee: $15
Just My Size jeans: $20
Walmart underwear: $1.50
Walmart socks: $.50
Torrid Bra: $28
Blood Milk Talon necklace: $150
Blood Milk Engagement ring: $175
Casio digital watch: $30
Dr. Martens 1460 boots: $100
Marc Jacobs handbag: $60

Total: $580.00

Total without jewelry: $225.00

Those jeans are my least expensive, I usually wear Levi&#039;s and that t-shirt is less expensive than I normally wear. I usually wear $20-$25 dollar shirts (mostly band tees). But I do also have shirts as low as $5. 

My most expensive outfit would be:

Vintage Nirvana band tee: $60
Asos Leather jacket: $143
Torrid bra: $28
Walmart Underwear: $1.50
Levi&#039;s jeans: $41
Hue socks: $3
Dr. Martens 1460 boots: $100
Cast of Vices bracelet: $50
Casio digital watch: $30
Blood Milk engagement ring: $175
Blood Milk Tarot necklace: $120
Blood Milk Labradorite necklace $220
Catbird diamond earrings: $88
Marc Jacobs handbag: $60
Vintage Coach wallet: $30

Total: $1,149.50

Total without jewelry: $466.50

I could swap out the shoes for more expensive ones like my $150 Bailey UGG&#039;s or my $110 Nasty Gal heels but that wouldn&#039;t match my outfit.

As you can tell I&#039;m way too brand oriented but all my really expensive stuff has been gifted from others. All my jewelry is gifted. All those expensive shoes were gifted. The leather jacket was a gift. All handbags were gifted. The only time I really get clothes and jewelry is at Christmas and my Birthday and if I really, really need it for some reason.]]></description>

Calvin Klein suit jacket (1/2 of $60 set so $30)
Express shirt on sale ($10)
Express pants ($60)
Socks from Nordstrom Rack ($3?)
Boots from Aerosoles on sale ($25)
Engagement ring (free to me!)
Gifted necklace (free to me!)
Gifted bracelet (free to me!)
Underclothes ($12 or so)

$140... not bad for a corporate attorney right? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J.Money It&#039;s not a class ring like you would get from a university, it&#039;s a ring given to Canadian Engineers after they say their oath. I don&#039;t believe other countries do it. It&#039;s called the iron ring. If I lose it it&#039;ll cost me about $30 to replace it, but I had to get my engineering degree to get it in the first place.

Random little piece of useless information, our oath was written by the same guy who wrote The Jungle Book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha... I think you def. take the prize for the most use of your clothes :)  I was expecting a much bigger difference from your Saturday attire to your work combo, but nope!  You&#039;ve mastered the art of clothing yourself on the cheap!  Nicely done, sir.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On a budget-related blog I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d be one of the lowest totals (and Serena still has me beat for sure), but after reading all these other posts I realize it must be a combination of frugality and a complete lack of fashion sense.

Slightly unfair that I&#039;m reading this on a Saturday, so I&#039;ll post today and yesterday (a work day) totals.

Today – total of $2:
Sweatpants $0 (hand-me-downs)
T-shirt $0 (also hand-me-down)
Socks $1
Underwear $1

Yesterday – total of $39:
Pants $2 (from garage sale)
Polo shirt $1 (from garage sale)
Belt $12 (from Walmart)
Shoes $5 (from Goodwill)
Socks $1
Underwear $1
Wedding Ring $17 (replacement ring purchased on eBay since my original ring “shrunk”…)

Also, other than the undergarments, every other clothing item is 5 to 10 years old or older. Did I mention that I’m not really into clothes?

And since we’re talking budgets, our family’s “Clothing” budget only includes clothes for the kids and occasionally for the wife. My own clothes purchases come out of my discretionary spending, which means I don’t buy many clothes, ever!]]></description>

@&lt;b&gt;HighOrderGuiltComplex&lt;/b&gt; - WoW you are good!!! I&#039;m impressed!  And Saucony is one of my all-time favorite shoe brands too, well done :)
@&lt;b&gt;Rai&lt;/b&gt; - Totally entertaining! I&#039;m still shocked at how many people are doing this, haha... guess we&#039;re all just super curious, eh? :) Thanks for stopping by!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! That is too funny :)  I&#039;m totaly sure it was a &quot;hottie&quot; beep, I mean come on!
@&lt;b&gt;DB&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I have a pair of outlet Crocs too - the only pair I have, actually. Super comfortable!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Leather crocs?  Interesting... maybe like half leather at top, and then that normal plastic all around? My dad has a pair like that - prett cool cuz it has laces too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessi @ PracticallyFunctional&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah working from home!  Or in your case &quot;reading blogs at home&quot; haha... love it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Lindsay Z.&lt;/b&gt; - I bet!  And lots of more expensive stuff usually lasts longer too, so that def. counts.

@&lt;b&gt;BrokeElizabeth&lt;/b&gt; - Not bad at all :)
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel211&lt;/b&gt; - Bandana - yes!  A very awesome accessory :) And cheap too, apparently!
@&lt;b&gt;tom&lt;/b&gt; - Look at you mr. dapper! And you could have had $0 on, but that would be a different part of the evening, haha... 
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Wow you have an awesome sister!  Whew! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Andrea&lt;/b&gt; - Man, that sterotype that ladies buy a lot of expensive shoes sure isn&#039;t coming out on this post... I&#039;m impressed :)

@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - That sucks on losing all those earings :(  I lost accessories all the time, it blows.  Good call on swapping in fakies! (not like anyone ever notices anyways, though I know it does feel better somehow w/ real ones on)
@&lt;b&gt;Serena@ThriftDiving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... thanks for the mental image ;)  Since I don&#039;t know what you look like, I&#039;m just gonna picture Sofia Vergara - deal?
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that must be tough w/ those bra pricings - sorry to hear :(  And VERY interested in what you mean about the engineering ring?  Something for work?  Or do you mean like a class ring? haha... actually, that&#039;s probably it, huh?  Man I&#039;m slow :)
@&lt;b&gt;Annette&lt;/b&gt; - WOW that&#039;s impressive!!  Seriously!  I love the &quot;everything in my closet I love&quot; method - so cool :)  Your mom taught you well!
@&lt;b&gt;Ella&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well that&#039;s good! It seems those picks should last longer than other brands too, right?  I bet it looks hot on :)
@&lt;b&gt;Good Cents Savings&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I like how you calculated a &quot;per wear&quot; cost ;)  Never even heard (or thought of?) that until you ladies started mentioning it here... good stuff.
@&lt;b&gt;Georgie&lt;/b&gt; - I miss state fairs!!  So much fun :)

@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - I don&#039;t know how y&#039;all deal with all that snow/cold stuff, boy... I&#039;m a wuss w/ freezing temps :(
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Damn good work there!  I love the &quot;Horny Toad&quot; too, haha... I can only imagine what that looks like ;)
@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - Your knickers were free?  Bow chicka wha wha!
@&lt;b&gt;Rebecca&lt;/b&gt; - HOLY. $HIT. Haha... you win the prize of the day! WOW! :)  I&#039;m gonna assume you prioritize a lot, so you can have an awesome closet of goodies.  But either way, if you can work it - go for it!
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Maternity? Woohoo - congrats! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Marianne&lt;/b&gt; - True true, nothing bad on spending on higher quality stuff as long as you can afford it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I&#039;ll have to catch you on a work day to see how much it changes :)]]></description>

@<b>Good Cents Savings</b> &#8211; Haha&#8230; I like how you calculated a &#8220;per wear&#8221; cost ;)  Never even heard (or thought of?) that until you ladies started mentioning it here&#8230; good stuff.<br />
@<b>Georgie</b> &#8211; I miss state fairs!!  So much fun :)<br />
