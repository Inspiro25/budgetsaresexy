					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch, that does suck for your mom :( Sorry to hear, my friend. Hope the moving goes smoothly and you&#039;re nice and settled in soon! I&#039;ve always found the whole thing exciting - esp. if you&#039;re going to someplace new :)
@&lt;b&gt;Fern&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... good guesses! But it was right off Georgia :)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - There you go! Isn&#039;t that awesome how EASY it is to nix those fines by just making a simple phone call? Way to go my man, that&#039;s top notch personal finance right there ;) (Though, I suppose you also weren&#039;t paying attention to the account in the FIRST place so maybe it evens out? Haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - What?? You were going too slow??? That&#039;s crazy cuz the speeding limits are the MAX you&#039;re technically supposed to go, not the slowest! I guess if you were holding up people or causing trouble though it was needed, haha... that&#039;s exactly what you were doing too, huh? ;) Sorry to hear about your cat too, that&#039;s never fun. Esp. driving that far to do some burial action :( He/she is up in the heavens with ours!
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhh you&#039;ve got a TON of action last week! Congrats on all that awesome money hits though, that&#039;s great!! Whic hopefully makes up for the nasty fall and in-laws time :( Hope you have only *hits* this week around! Stay safe! (And WOW $388 for a tkt is a lot!!  Mine was only a speeding *camera* so I got super lucky. Haven&#039;t been physically pulled over by the cops (knock on wood) in a long time. And hopefully it stays that way!)
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly! Paying double for the exact same food, ugh... At least I haven&#039;t made the same mistake twice just yet ;) I&#039;m on a one-week roll! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin Vesga&lt;/b&gt; - For sure. Much better to be caught via speeding camera than an actual cop!
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie @ The Empowered Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - Heck yeah it is! Listening to it now for a good 30th time in a row or something close, haha... they&#039;re so relaxing :)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal @ Get A Copywriter&lt;/b&gt; - It blows, right? Totally pisses you off...
@&lt;b&gt;Mysti&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, really? From a camera?? Man, I don&#039;t know then... ours was from a camera too :(
@&lt;b&gt;Kristina&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! I can&#039;t believe you tried to get away from those, haha... I bet they revoked your license! You should blog about it sometime if you haven&#039;t already ;) And stay safe out there, friend!
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Well, not much you can do about a client not telling you something! Hopefully it won&#039;t ruin your relationship or futur deals :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bryan&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you like them, thanks for telling me :)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - Well I&#039;m a bad person to ask cuz I LOVE LOVE LOVE their stuff. So I&#039;ll be buying every single album of theirs without even listening to them first ;) Not all songs are the awesomest, but there are very few artists which I could play in the background 24/7 and not get bored of them... Esp while working. I&#039;m constantly streaming them, or artists like them, while blogging every day. Soothes the soul! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yay for the new album!  Sorry about the groceries...I have done that so many times.  The absolute worst was the time I specifically went out for bread, milk, and bananas.  I ended up leaving the bags out and the milk went bad.  Two trips for the exact same thing...kicking myself the whole way...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Argh, bummer about the speeding ticket! I was going through that same thing only with street sweeping parking tickets. Luckily that hasn&#039;t happened since February. And I&#039;ve totally done that grocery thing too. It&#039;s a pain because now you probably have to go back and get the same groceries again!]]></description>
