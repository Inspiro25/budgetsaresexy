Oh yeah - all concerns I had too. I love them being around other kids and even getting sick/etc to build their immune system. Plus it&#039;s a nice break from being at home or outside (though they did play outside a lot at daycare too).

It&#039;s been about 3 weeks now and I can tell you that both are kids are FLOURISHING. My oldest is just so much happier all the time and love spending time with his mom (while also &quot;checking in on me&quot; at my office - so cute!!!!), and my youngest is getting more of the one-on-one time he didn&#039;t as much at daycare.

On the flipside my wife is exhausted and now more than ever wants to get her career started and be around adults again (hah), but we&#039;re both enjoying the time while we have them and taking it week by week :) And the fact we&#039;ve saved $1,500 so far (!!!) is just incredible.

Oh, and she keeps a nice routine going so both kids know what to expect, and part of that is an adventure out of the house somewhere every morning. Right now they&#039;re actually at a play date somewhere and yesterday they went to the park. We&#039;re finding the routines help a lot especially with nap times and such too.

So we&#039;re doing well so far! Only time will tell though :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats!  Im jealous!  Our day care bills this year will hit almost 30k (3 kids will do that!), and now that i work from home we are seriously kicking around the idea that we keep them home and i work at rhe same time...though in highly skeptical that its possible.

The other downside is that the kids wont get as much socialization...not a bumig deal if you live in a family friendly neighborhood, but ubfortubatly we dont....

Post in another month or two how its going please!]]></description>
