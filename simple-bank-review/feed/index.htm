Damn, sorry to hear man.

I&#039;ve never used Simple personally so can&#039;t vouch entirely, but I do know that all banks have their issues no matter which it is. The important part is how they *deal with them all* in the end. So hopefully your mom gets a happy resolution and keeps fighting until she does!

If anyone&#039;s looking for the full BBB report on them, here&#039;s the direct link: 

http://www.bbb.org/alaskaoregonwesternwashington/business-reviews/banks/simple-in-portland-or-22730643/

Looks like they currently have an A+ rating, though they&#039;re not &quot;BBB Accredited&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t get scammed by this &quot;bank&quot;

Simple Bank owned by Spanish banker BBVA, and backed by Bancorp is a bunch of thieves. They have stolen $736 from my mother and countless amounts from others. They won&#039;t talk anymore falsely claiming she deposited and cashed the check when they returned it. They stole her money and think I&#039;ll shut up about it, F*CK YOU! 

http://www.bbb.org/.../simple-......

BBB complaints (Unresolved): &quot;Once I verified my external account I proceeded to deposit $2500 into my Simple account. A few days later I was locked out of my account because they needed more verification. I sent in all requested material including 2 bank statements .......... Simple informed me that for some reason they could not return my money or close the account.&quot;

BBB complaint (Unresolved): &quot; I had been a Simple customer for almost a year, and had never had any issues with them. Until February 8th... On February 8th I go to use my debit card and it&#039;s declined, I was confused because there was over $1000.00 in the account, it shouldn&#039;t have been declined.......On February 10th, my Federal Tax Refund was deposited into my simple account, over $6,000. I called simple because obviously at this point I&#039;m extremely irritated that I can&#039;t access MY money.......so once again, I am still sitting on this money because Simple can&#039;t do an easy thing such as conform the funds are there to my current bank.&quot;

BBB Complaints (Unresolved): Opened acct, they freeze funds - apparently a common issue with this company per online reviews - saying need id documents. Submit documents, they do not get back to me. Then say documents not in color and need pdf&#039;s from bank. They refuse to close account and refund my $300. And there&#039;s more, check out the link, check out the unresolved complaints issues. They are stealing people&#039;s money. They are then refusing to respond to them and when asked what to do next they say they can&#039;t talk anymore. They are thieves, scammers, etc. They may have once been good but they&#039;re no better than a standard bank now]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[worst bank ever. I&#039;ve been trying to get my money for the last 5 weeks. They illegally froze my account. Then told me I could transfer my money to another account so I set up another account and they then told me I couldn&#039;t and they had to have all of this personal inforamtion from the other bank and ssn, and birth certificate. and they still refused to give me access to my money and then they told me they sent a check and it would be to me in a couple of days. that was last week and i&#039;m still waiting. I don&#039;t even know if they sent the check or if they sent me all of my money or anything. I email them and call and get nothing. When I call they hang up on me. they are very rude and operate illegally. DO NOT BANK WITH THEM THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY]]></description>

That&#039;s one of the perks to USAA too - free ATMs everywhere!

And you&#039;re the second person to rave about that Schwab account this week... I&#039;ve def. heard good things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my opinion nothing beats a Charles Schwab Investor Checking Account for one awesome killer feature - getting reimbursed on ATM fees WORLDWIDE. Pretty much every ATM is your ATM. I no longer have to pull out a wad of cash before a Vegas trip or if I go anywhere international because of this! This is key for a person like me who frequents many small businesses and restaurants that are cash only. Yes - places like those still exist. They also offer great customer service and anything else you might need from a bank (with the exception of being able to deposit cash). 

I don&#039;t think the budgeting feature of Simple would work for me. I try to use credit cards as much as possible so my spending is spread across multiple accounts, so I need my YNAB to reconcile everything. 

Great post!]]></description>
