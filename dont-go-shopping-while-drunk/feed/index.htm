					<description><![CDATA[I also hate strip clubs! I refuse to go. 20$ lap dances and 10$ drinks just don&#039;t do it for me. You&#039;ll have much more fun going to a regular bar and you&#039;ll save lots of money. Not to mention that the potential to meet someone is MUCH higher at a bar.

As for the spending money when drunk-- avoid 24 hour restaurants at all costs! You will purchase obscene amounts of food at ridiculous prices. Not to mention the fact that you could be feeling generous and offer to pay the bill for everyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I forgot to mention, the GOOD thing about buying things drunk is that you can go back when you&#039;re sober and return them ;)  But only if you buy items and not gambles or women.

Responses:

@&lt;b&gt;sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I actually happen to love glitter on girls, just not paying for it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MK&lt;/b&gt; - Good point.  We always want to spend lots of money at TJ Maxx!
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - I know, it&#039;s nasty.  I&#039;m sure there are some higher end ones that would be better, just haven&#039;t experienced any myself.
@&lt;b&gt;Darwin&#039;s Money&lt;/b&gt; - Are you volunteering? ;)  I mean, your &quot;friend&quot;? haha... and yeah, the adsense is brilliant!
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousand-aire.com&lt;/b&gt; - That was very disturbing, sir ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMan @ FinancialOdyssey&lt;/b&gt; - $80 is much worse.  On the other hand, you can always go back and return things when you&#039;re sober!
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @ Sustainable Life Blog&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah I don&#039;t mind strip clubs being around either - they serve their purpose for both the clients and women working there - but like you I just don&#039;t wanna be in &#039;em.  And I&#039;m a new fan of PBR - so cheap and tasty!
@&lt;b&gt;Karmella&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!!!!   At least you would have gotten an awesome car ;)  Love those c70s
@&lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, good one. The drunks like to buy their food!
@&lt;b&gt;Kira&lt;/b&gt; - You and your mom?!! haha.... that is awesome. You guys are funny :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - I bet it is!  They know what they&#039;re doing ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Mama Geek&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, now that&#039;s bad.
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - That is also a no-no!
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahhaa... totally something I would have done too :)  Good work on catching it, although you&#039;re going to kick yourself if you log on tomorrow and see the stock way up! Sometimes I think drinking brings out our hunches more.
@&lt;b&gt;Serena&lt;/b&gt; - Sidewalk chalk!  Used to love that stuff as a kid.  But you&#039;re right, very fun but very stupid when you wake up ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - College students make a lot more mistakes than just this, but luckily they do a lot of smart things too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nunzio Bruno&lt;/b&gt; - There was only one time actually that I did REALLY good when drunk at the poker tables.  The only problem was, I started giving back all the money I won to the people I just took it from! on purpose! haha... some people didn&#039;t like it cuz they thought i was pushing it in their face and they walked away.  I ended up breaking even after winning a good $500 in an hour.  The glory story is totally worth it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - haha, true.
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, and that&#039;s the problem!  Although confidence is okay w/ alcohol ;)
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - That is going to be so much fun!!!  The one thing I&#039;ve never tried yet is a cruise, I really really want to one day soon. Enjoy!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley Jacobs&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Ashley :) This one was really fun putting together - and surprisingly quickly too!  I wasn&#039;t even drinking when writing it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! So true!  Never thought about that one before, thx.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also, there&#039;s no reason to go to an ATM after 2 a.m. Chris Rock sums it up nicely: &quot;Drugs are illegal, but ATM machines are open twenty-four hours a day. Twenty-four hours a day. For who? Who the f***is it open for? Have you ever taken out three hundred dollars at four o&#039;clock in the morning for something positive?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Articles like this are the reason why your blog is one of my favorites.  :)

I&#039;d like to add bars and liquor stores to the list.  No financially savvy decisions ever happen after you follow up drinking with even more drinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What an excellent message.  I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve spent more money, and too much money at that, while either very much intoxicated, or slightly intoxicated.  Hmm.. for one, whenever I&#039;m at the bar... &quot;ILL BUY THIS ROUND!!!&quot; lol....

However, I am greatly looking forward to my cruise in a few months.  I&#039;ll be at the casino every night... I won&#039;t spend more than $300... But that will allow me TONS of fun for the entire trip...Ah I can&#039;t wait!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t go near much of anything after a few drinks- including strip clubs!
Shopping for clothes is very much on the top of my list.  Once I&#039;m tipsy I&#039;m convinced I deserve almost anything and everything because it all look FANtasTIC on me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t need to drink to shop at amazon.com ;)  Although I can understand that someone could sneak an online purchase while drunk.  It&#039;s just so easy, even a drunk can do it!  LOL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That was a great post! I loved the analogy to not grocery shopping while hungry. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve been with friends at the casino and they were wasted making terrible decisions. What really intrigues me are the glory stories after about how competitive the tables were and that they couldn&#039;t walk away when it looked like it was a &quot;sure&quot; thing. Thanks over indulging on alcohol to make terrible decisions make you look like a hero, LOL!! Shopping online was def a valid point too...they should make wallets with breathalizers so you can&#039;t do that kind of stuff :)]]></description>
