					<description><![CDATA[Hi

Is there a spreadsheet that allows for declining expenditure throughout retirement?

My thought is that expenses are high at the beginning, decline in the middle and then will either increase or taper off, depending on health in years 80+.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How long will we live? According to new research...more than half of millennials will live past 100. It is expected that 50% of the babies born (in the US) in 2007 will live to be 104. I have not read the book talked about in the below blog post, but it is now on my TBR list. Sobering stuff as we think about how long our money needs to last.

Damn, talk about putting things into perspective. Good for you for prioritizing the important stuff like that!

I remember running an article years ago here on someone running up *hundreds* of thousands of dollars when he found out he had some kind of terminal disease. He took out tons of credit cards and loans and just went all out, only to find out that he in fact wasn&#039;t going to die. Which of course was great!, but then he now had to deal with the financial mess he put himself in :( I wish I could find it cuz it was pretty wild to read, but it always got me wondering how I&#039;d react in a similar situation. I&#039;d like to think I&#039;d be composed, but who knows!

Anyways, glad you&#039;re on the mend now and finding that right balance :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was $40K in debt in my 30s and it took a long time to pay off and be debt free (which I did by budgeting and getting rid of my car). I did pretty well maintaining that but then was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013 at the age of 45, (thankfully surgery and 6 rounds of chemo took care of the cancer) and fell back to some old habits.

After I recovered, I went through a stretch where I thought &quot;why bother saving?&quot;. Why not have fun now when I&#039;m not sure if I will be here in 10 or 20 years? So I built up a little debt again ($3K). Thankfully, I got wise... or maybe more hopeful? Anyway, I am debt free again this month and am starting to save for retirement again but cancer did clarify what was important to me. When I wasn&#039;t sure what the outcome was going to be after my diagnosis, the one regret I had was that I hadn&#039;t traveled more so now that is a big part of my budget. I think I have finally found a balance between retirement savings and living now that works for me. I hope.]]></description>
