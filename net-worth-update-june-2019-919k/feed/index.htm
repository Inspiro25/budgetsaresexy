					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, thanks for sharing your progress. Indeed, last month’s bloodbath was a tiny blip of 7%, something that I took advantage of. I was wondering if you hold individual stocks or buy the index ETF? I have written some articles on choosing great companies and would love for you have a look. https://onceamillenium.com/how-to-select-wonderful-companies/
Cheers!]]></description>

We do own the cars (both are 100% paid off), but def. not the mortgage...

Just picked up the house two months ago so it&#039;ll take a little time...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job at having a positive net worth! I am curious to know why you are financing cars when you could have them paid off?

Yup, every $52k is another dollar an hour! I&#039;m past minimum wage, for now...but need to keep growing to keep pace as it increases in my state. I&#039;m not sure why I&#039;m thinking along those lines since I&#039;m not an hourly worker...it&#039;s just fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fun fact: you have $794k in your retirement accounts (not sure how to account for the TSP, but included it anyway).  At a 4% withdrawal rate and assuming 2080 hours a year, you would &quot;earn&quot; $15.27 an hour, which is more than the minimum wage is set to be in California after all of the annual increases that are coming.]]></description>
