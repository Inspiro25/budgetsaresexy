					<description><![CDATA[Multifamily rental property a few months ago - found something at a competitive price, ensured that the rent collectible were fair (for both the tenants &#038; me) - fixed up the place so that the tenants were happy and I now have a positive cash flow, happy tenants and a nice tax break. A triple win situation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My best financial advice is don&#039;t run with the turkeys if you want to fly with the eagles.  Stick with people who have and are working for the same goals financially and stay away from people with poor financial habits.  I know it may sound harsh, but it is true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting there&#039;s two mention to bonds - that game is over.  You could have a pretty penny if you got in Summer 2009.

Most interesting is the title.  Could it have been rename &quot;The bubble busted - bet on THIS bubble!&quot; ;)

Don&#039;t get me wrong, interested in the book.  Agree with first 3 commentators.  Plus - Caity&#039;s point ties right into AJ&#039;s.]]></description>
