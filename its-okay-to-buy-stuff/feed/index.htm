					<description><![CDATA[Best purchase I have ever made:  Lasik eye surgery.  Life changing.  It&#039;s been a few years and I still cannot believe the amazing difference in my day-to-day life.  The decision to spend a chunk of my savings on that really internalized for me the concept that ultimately money is for spending in order to improve quality of life.  

I am also in the spend on travel camp.  I have never heard anyone say they wish they had traveled less, seen fewer places, made fewer great memories.  Never.  

Of course, all of this spending is saved up for first and only puts a small dent in overall savings, that is to say, it is not a cycle of save-then-deplete-then-repeat.  Thank you for all your excellent posts and for the realistic attitude you share here.]]></description>

Yup! Great idea indeed... Plus, nothing saying you can&#039;t budget in awesome stuff too! At the end of the day it&#039;s all about controlling where you send your money :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with you, as long as you&#039;re paying cash for your splurges! Some people see budgeting like dieting - they can never have a cookie. But in reality, budgeting is more like a healthy eating plan. There is room for portion controlled fun!  I recommend my coaching clients schedule small splurges at least once every six months, even while they are paying off debt. I&#039;ve found that prevents burnout and keeps them on their plan.]]></description>

You&#039;ll get there if you keep watching that $$! All of those above, and myself, have spent years kicking ass and building up our wealth. (and before that - sucking with our money!). It&#039;s all a phase, and you have to get through the hard ones before you can reach the fun ones :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow,I would say that my experience is a bit smaller than most on this.  I am the working poor (thank college debt and recession for that).  I could only dream of spending like most here.  It&#039;s not hyperbole when I say that my &quot;splurging&quot; are things like saving enough for gas to visit my family more than once a year, buying discounted meat because the budget can&#039;t handle it, or taking my fiancee out to eat at a steak&#038;shake once in a couple months.  It&#039;s the small things we have to save for and enjoy because anything else is fantasy.  I look forward to the day I can actually spend money on things I truly enjoy and cherish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Money spending confessions...
Dropped over 20k on a new renovated kitchen
Just bought a bunch of new shoes

Totally happy:P Kitchen is so brand spanking new and awesome and I love walking into it everyday. I also cook a ton so it&#039;s worth it for me. And the new shoes...I had to throw out a bunch of old ratty shoes I had worn for years...and of course I got them on sale but good brands.

No regrets here to spend money I&#039;ve saved and worked hard for when I need it!]]></description>
