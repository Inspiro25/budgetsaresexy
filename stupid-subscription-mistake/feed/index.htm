					<description><![CDATA[I try to avoid any subscriptions. It&#039;s better to pay as you go, IMO. I have a gym membership that I use a few times per week. That&#039;s worth it. 
Check your credit card statement every month!]]></description>

Oh gosh, yeah - moving places makes a mess of all kinds of areas in life, haha... Another reason to set up the *systems* now while life is calm so you don&#039;t have to deal with it during hot messes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true J, I remember moving from one place to another, and because I changed internet providers, got charged internet for a place I didn&#039;t live in for 2 months until I checked and got a refund! I wonder how fitness memberships and now car wash memberships are doing so well :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have such respect for companies that send you an email before the subscription renews so you can make an active decision about continuing. In the meantime, these things are such a prevalent problem that the FTC ruled last week that subscriptions now have to be as easy or easier to cancel as they are to start. Apparently the biggest offendeds are Planet Fitness and vitamins. I had an issue with eDreams Prime (an online travel agency)...did the free trial, reminded myself to cancel, then went in to cancel and it showed no payment method on file for me to change or add, and gave me an international number to call and cancel.  I figured the lack of a payment method to update meant I was okay. NOPE. And after it renewed (I did a chargeback because I really wanted it to cost them something for being asses about it), suddenly there&#039;s a US customer service number to call about membership. The fact that Chase flagged the charge as potential fraud tells me that service is a frequently disputed problem right there. I&#039;ve had words with Norton Anti-virus back in the day too - $100 to auto-renew, but available on Amazon for $35. They wouldn&#039;t price match, so buh-bye.]]></description>
