					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not just bodies of water nearby ... sometimes intense rain can still cause flooding if you live in an area without excellent draining or such. A flood can happen anywhere, it seems!

That said, we don&#039;t carry flood insurance. We don&#039;t live in a flood plain and our house is slightly on a hill and it doesn&#039;t seem to be much of a risk for our circumstances.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well we made it out a-okay, friends! Some messy trees and leaves outside, but overall the house went unaffected and we kept our electricity the entire time - woohoo! We REALLY dodged a bullet this round - those pictures and vids about other areas that got hit hard are just so sad to watch :(  They&#039;ll definitely be in our prayers.

@&lt;b&gt;Liz&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, yeah for real! We&#039;re def. glad we ended up getting it even though all was good in the end! We still have 12 more months to go ;) And I&#039;m loving that line too - &quot;Insurance is one of the only things you buy hoping to never use&quot; - so true!
@&lt;b&gt;Bonnie&lt;/b&gt; - Jeez, really? In the desert? That&#039;s pretty wild.
@&lt;b&gt;Pam&lt;/b&gt; - Real scary esp after this hurricane stuff :( 99.9% of people never think about it at all, but after these storms hit at least it goes on their radar for the future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just down at the insurance office and I heard many people asking if they had flood insurance or not. This is crazy that some people just don&#039;t know.

					<description><![CDATA[It really depends on where you live. I live in a desert so you would think I&#039;m safe, but we get some crazy flooding here every 10 yrs or so. I looked up our place on the flood-zone maps and felt pretty safe foregoing flood insurance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You definitely made the right decision. I&#039;m in an area that was severely affected by Hurricane Ike 4 years ago (and Rita 3 years before that - but that was more of a wind event) and it was the storm surge that did the damage. My parents live in a 100 year old house that &quot;took on&quot; water for the first time, ever, and I had several friends with 4+ feet of water in their homes. Insurance is one of the only things you buy hoping to never use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So far so good, guys! Wish us luck our lights stay on and the insides dry! :) Though we still haven&#039;t hit the bad parts yet, jeez... gonna be 24 hours of madness here in a little bit.

@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I know it! And apparently USAA is pretty happy about it too as I just saw they tweeting out today&#039;s post too ;) Gotta love our insurance family!
@&lt;b&gt;G.B. @ In Budgets We Trust&lt;/b&gt; - No problemo my friend :) So far our house is okay! But it is getting really REALLY windy out there now - I keep staring at the trees swaying around our neighborhood :(
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - It does feel pretty &quot;legitimate,&quot; you&#039;re right :) And a LOT cheaper than other insurances too which is nice!
@&lt;b&gt;LB @ Finanical Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - YUP! Exactly - I forgot our flood insurance covers that too - sewer backup and all that... Not a bad thing to have just in case the $hit hits the fan! LITERALLY! Haha... ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - What? Yeah right - I bet there&#039;s MORE of it there and it&#039;s damn expensive too ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have flood insurance but I am looking into it, along with changing my home owner&#039;s insurance too.  I used to think flood insurance wasn&#039;t worth it, because it would have to rain for weeks for me to get flooded and by then everything else would be flooded first, but I have been thinking of it more lately, as there are some weird things flood insurance covers like water damage of other sorts and even sewer backup.  Yeah, who knew that sewer backup is covered by flood insurance.  Even if policies aren&#039;t all the same, I would say it is something worth looking into just to see if it covers areas home owners insurance doesn&#039;t.  Stay dry and safe J., Mrs. and Baby!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J$.  Heard that power might already be out in your area, so I apologize for saying the storm would probably fizzle out.  (I remember how easy the power went out back in July when I was home visiting family, so I figured D.C. had already met it&#039;s horrific weather quota.)  Extra good of you to buy the flood insurance now!

Stay extra safe, dry, and warm!  Let us know how it goes out there.]]></description>
