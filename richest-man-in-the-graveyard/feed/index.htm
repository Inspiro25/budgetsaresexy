					<description><![CDATA[A friend of mine, his parents saved &#038; scrimped their whole lives, always saving for a rainy day. They only left their home state ONCE to drive to a funeral. &quot;Vacations&quot; were day trips to the beach, casino or to visit someone. They couldn&#039;t wait to travel the world when they retired. You guessed it. 3 months after they retired, he was diagnosed with asbestos cancer &#038; unable to leave his home town where all his doctors were. He was only retired a few years when he passed away. While my friend did quite well saving for retirement, he made it a point to take 2 real vacations every year all over the USA/Canada/Europe. There&#039;s more to life than saving every extra penny you ever made &#038; being the richest guy in the graveyard!]]></description>

Oh wow haha... total rawness up in here today - love it. As Ferris Bueller once quipped, &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&#039;t stop and look around once in a while you could miss it.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Phil, thank you for your honesty! I agree with your assessment =) Most people live lives like that, and it&#039;s a shame. I think we&#039;re fortunate to have realized this so early! Especially you at 22, wow! Thanks for reading!]]></description>

Hi Shaun! That&#039;s the irony. It does come back full circle. You can&#039;t reap what you haven&#039;t sown!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Self-made Korean American immigrant&quot; LMAO. One day I aspire to be a self-made immigrant. (You mean &quot;self-made millionaire,&quot; I&#039;m sure).

This is very well-written. It hits home. It&#039;s why, at 22, I&#039;m making international travel one of my biggest priorities. My first job, I was a deli clerk at a grocery store. I got to see people every single day -- average, every-day, middle-class people, people who I thought had it all figured out -- come into the store depressed and tired after a long day at work. Never smiling, never happy. Every day bleeding into the next, everyone was always looking for something DIFFERENT to happen. Something to break them out of the monotony.

It made me wonder: What the fuck is the point?

You work hard in high school so you can get into a good college.
You work hard in college so you can get a six-figure job.
You work hard at that job, 60-80hrs/week, so you can, if you&#039;re lucky, become a VP.
You buy a big house and a nice car.
Then you find out your wife&#039;s fucking the next door neighbor.
Then your wife finds out you&#039;re fucking the secretary.
And then you realize, before you ship them off to college, you don&#039;t even really know your kids.
Then you retire and you don&#039;t even have the energy to spend all the money you saved.
So you spend a couple idyllic months on the beach before you start losing your mind.

That&#039;s it. The American Dream. 

I, for one, don&#039;t want to travel the world at 60. I want to do it now. I have the rest of my life to work.

On another note: &quot;Barring a huge medical and/or technological breakthrough that greatly extends our lives,&quot; I think this is on its way. My great-grandmother lived to be 101 (her advice: &quot;Always Keep Busy&quot;), and she never went beyond the first stage of dementia. I think, if you eat healthy and exercise, you should live a very long life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I can say is &quot;wow&quot;

Couldn&#039;t agree more - if we&#039;re financially blessed then there&#039;s almost an obligation to pay it forward and help others.  

It&#039;s funny how it often comes full circle then too, and we wind up with more resources to help bless again!  

Really well written and a great note to everyone to read
Thanks for sharing, and thanks J. Money for publishing out to your audience!]]></description>
