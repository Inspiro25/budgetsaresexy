					<description><![CDATA[All my credit cards are starting to get replaced by ones with these funny little microchips in it.  I heard it&#039;s supposed to be more secure, but I haven&#039;t really looked into it yet.

I definitely have too many credit cards at the moment... thinking of scaling back to 2 or 3, and I really like that advice about bills on one and expenses on another.  That&#039;s good stuff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FinCon sounds like a lot of fun! I wasn&#039;t able to make it but maybe next year. I had a credit card that was also fraudulently used earlier this year. I am not sure where it happened exactly but I think it was at a restaurant (apparently they&#039;re bad for that)]]></description>

A negative one :) I literally lose $300-$400 a month. But keep in mind we purchased it as our residence initially - we weren&#039;t thinking about renting it out and turning it into an investment property. Thinking about that stuff first would have led to totally different results - like, not buying the one we did. But such is life.... On the plus side this blog and my entire life changed because of that decision :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear about the credit card and the property problems, but as you say, there&#039;s always work to be done. I&#039;m interested in getting into property investment. What kind of return do you get on yours (if it&#039;s not too cheeky a question)?]]></description>
