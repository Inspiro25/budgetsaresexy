Good point on the data/subscription stuff! Would make even more sense then why people chose to give it up in exchange for being debt-free too in the recent survey I just posted about ;)

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting buck an hr rule. Reminds me buck of shuck. (Oyster fan here). 
Most of the entertainment I consume is free actually and online already. I guess we online users are just so used to consuming free info/entertainment in exchange for data instead of paying for subscription. 

I put a high priority on fitness and physical health so probably exceed the buck an hour rule for the gym and bike memberships, but the social interaction and health benefits makes it totally worth it to motivate me to stay active in an already full time cubicle envt]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to say your last two fails might not really be fails, because you only looked at the hours of fun given to you.  If you add up the hours of fun given to everyone who is rewarded by your expenditure, it may pass.

So if your subscription helps keep your paper in business, that may help lead to lots more fun for the employees and other subscribers.  Plus, any event that you go to because you discovered it in the paper counts.

And donations, by definition, are mainly about others.]]></description>

Fascinating!!! I&#039;d love to shop a yard sale there, and then come back later at night for some haunted paranormal activity, haha... (And then maybe do a work out somewhere in between if there&#039;s time ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J.Money- About this forced gym membership from the HOA...…….. There are 4 gyms in our town. They have: 
 a pool (indoor or outdoor or both)
running track
cardio area
weights area
one has a golf simulator
rooms for spin classes/aerobics classes/various kid and adult classes, cooking classes/pottery/etc....
They put on shows- acrobatic, haunted paranormal, wildlife, ….
They have various other events in the buildings- community garage sales, special ed activities, basketball games, badminton. racquetball, dodge ball competitions...
rooms for birthday parties and meetings
Some gyms have batting cages, personal trainers, etc....

These activities do cost extra but to go and work out isn&#039;t extra. They do keep a tally of how many people enter each building each day and I believe the total for the year (cumulative) is a few million? My neighbors and their kids do not go. At all. I don&#039;t believe most people go, really. Most of us are in the age of 40&#039;s/50&#039;s with a sprinkling of high school and elderly that go.]]></description>

Yup - games are a ton of bang for your buck. Also cards. My kids and I play approximately 300 games of UNO a day and they enjoy it more than any of their millions of toys laying around ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great rule. 

Sure it&#039;s arbitrary, but that makes it easy to remember. It&#039;s a reference, not set in stone. 

That&#039;s basically the math I do in my head when buying something. My husband and I each spent $60 on a game, for example, but we got 300+ hours out of it. I&#039;m thinking, &quot;that&#039;s way more than five movie theater trips worth of fun for the same amount of money&quot;. 

Peak moments can of course go above $1/hr, but it&#039;s best to keep most entertainment relatively inexpensive and use this as one comparison tool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money!
This &quot;Buck an Hour&quot; Rule is quite intriguing. One of the biggest ways to eat away at your income is monthly subscriptions, so this rule can definitely help you go through and assess which are worth it.
I also emphasize on my blog to cut out coffee expenses. A lot of people don&#039;t realize how much money they burn on coffee every month! lol
Thanks for sharing this rule, I&#039;ll definitely apply it to myself.]]></description>
