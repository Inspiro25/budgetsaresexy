					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your story, Rob!

I think that offering up your personal finance story, as a writer, gives the reader context. It lets them understand you better. Sometimes that may mean they have trouble relating, but it&#039;s more honest. 

Isn&#039;t that a good thing?

Thanks for sharing your story so we can all better understand your path to becoming a millionaire!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Rob

Fascinating Story and journey to 7 figures! Just goes to show that with a clearly defined plan whilst keeping things simple, it can be achieved! 

I also love that you gave alot of credit to your wife. I have written about this and personally believe that choosing the right life partner is the secret sauce to a guaranteed rich life.

Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! It&#039;s amazing how fast things can grow in a bull market when you are diligent. 

Do you still live in the first home you bought or rent that out?]]></description>

Sounds like you are on an awesome path Krystal!!!  I could theoretically retire in the next three years, as long as the stock market doesn&#039;t implode, however, I have a wait and see approach.  I guess it depends on how I like my job in the next couple of years and what I could retire to :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What an inspirational read!  I love when ordinary people do the extraordinary with a little bit of hard work and diligence.  My husband and I are in our early thirties and have are finally investing more strategically (more than matching our 401K)  for retirement.  We have recently started tracking our net worth, and I&#039;m encouraged to see where we end up in ten years.  I&#039;m curious....Are you planning on retiring when you reach a certain number?  Or do you plan on working for the long haul because you enjoy your job?]]></description>
