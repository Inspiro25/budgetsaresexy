Good for you!! You gotta be happy at the end of the day regardless of the costs/logicalness, so I applaud you :) And those Acadias are sexy!! (I was going to mention that Toyota Highlanders are also pretty good w/ the seating, if you&#039;re ever looking again down the road (or anyone else here reading this is))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just read this post after seeing your exciting &quot;baby dime&quot; post today! (Congrats by the way!) It was timely because our family is in the midst of vehicle shopping right now. We drive a 2007 Lincoln MKZ which is nearing 160,000 KM. We have two kids and are hoping to add another next year. Currently, we drive my folks around with us a lot whenever we go out, but we don&#039;t have enough room for everyone, which means someone gets left at home (my poor husband usually, because leaving our three or one year old would be illegal ;)) Long story short, we need a vehicle that seats more than 5. But I just cannot get on the minivan train. And your statement &quot;I prioritize happiness over practicality&quot; just really hit home for me. So that&#039;s why we are going with a 7-seater SUV (GMC Acadia). Thank you for sharing this with us, and for keeping it real. I really appreciate authenticity and someone I can relate to!]]></description>

Def. agree on buying used! And for not taking on debt when you don&#039;t have to, of course, however sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do when you don&#039;t have the cash :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, I gotta hate on this purchase.  But cars and education are two of my hotpoints.  In 2011 my wife and I bought a brand new Honda Pilot for right at 40K.  0.9% APR made it ok right?  NO.  $550 / month car payments made it very wrong.  What made it worse is that we paid it off early on our anniversary in 2015 and by that time our beautifully maintained car with only 65K miles on it was worth approximately 20K.  So we&#039;d paid 40K for it and lost another 20K in depreciation in FOUR years.  That works out to $12,000 per YEAR in true cost of ownership.  

I swore then that we&#039;d never again do two things - 1. Buy a new car, and 2. Have car debt.

Props to you for buying used as the depreciation curve has smoothed out big time, but the debt....man...the debt!  Don&#039;t owe money on something that goes down in value.]]></description>

I live in the Pacific Northwest where Subarus are the norm, and the used models actually cost more than brand new! Last year I traded in my 10-year-old Honda Accord I was gifted in college with a brand new 2015 Subaru Forester (got $3k in trade in which wasn&#039;t bad considering the car had been in three severe accidents not caused by me). It was $21K after the trade in and had all the upgrades including leather seats. At a really low interest rate (2%) I decided not to put any money down. Paying $319/mo. Insurance went up $10/mo. First time paying car payments ever.]]></description>
