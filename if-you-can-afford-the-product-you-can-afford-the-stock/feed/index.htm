					<description><![CDATA[Great quote. I have started using &quot;It&#039;s not in my budget right now&quot;. And if whatever it is, is that important then I make my budget work for it. Having that shift in mindset has been literally life altering.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this approach purely because it encourages people to see investing as something that&#039;s accessible. As soon as you get over the investing scaries, you can get to the good stuff. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When my Grandmother was in charge of cancer research in Eastern Star, I went to many chapters and spoke about the power of their gifts and what they had done. The phase I used at the end of the lecture was &quot;Skip one dinner and give $25 to cancer research.&quot;  If we all only skipped going out one time and stayed home and had sandwiches instead, we  could raise millions for cancer research. We usually had more donations that night than the group had given in the prior two years. 

Having enough money is not usually our problem. Allocating our money to the things that matter is where we falter. We do have enough to invest, we just choose to spend it instead.

					<description><![CDATA[You can do the same thing with mutual funds or index funds, just invest the same amount as the stock you like every month into the fund. Plus some of the SP 500 funds, most likely already has all the stocks you favor within the fund. Good post, I made a similar one a while back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Express is making a comeback! They created a petites line so I&#039;m wearing Express jeans now. Ordered online, of course, though. I&#039;m not going to the mall! ;) 

Along with buying ethically, I buy the stock of any product that I like enough to use regularly and where I like the way they run their business (sustainable) and treat their employees (ethical!).]]></description>
