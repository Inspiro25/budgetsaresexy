					<description><![CDATA[One great source of food is restaurants and supermarkets. They waste a lot of food, and in my area, as long as you are not using the waste for human consumption, they can legally give it to you. 

This has proven a great food source, and much less costly. We leave four 55 gallon bins with a local grocer, and we pick them up each day. Chickens are mostly omnivorous, so this is a good match. 

Obviously this is not sustainable on a large scale, but as a side hustle, this one tip can nearly eliminate food cost.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You forgot to add in any savings on not having to buy eggs (or selling them) for the duration of the time you were &quot;processing&quot; the chickens. This is worth something at least. Also if you are able to breed the chickens wouldn&#039;t you be able to keep it going without the initial layout?

Also if you are farming, you should also be able to figure out a way to grow your own chicken feed to avoid that cost as well.

Since you already own your equipment needed, this won&#039;t impact the second batch or continuation so your profits would rise as you continued.]]></description>

Hehe go for it! I love the idea of egg-producing pets around the yard :) Not allowed to do it where I currently live though, booo...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant old post this one!
We are due to move in the next couple of months from a flat to a house with (crucially) a garden and the first thing I want to do when we are settled is getting some chickens. For egg laying only though, not sure I could handle the butchering side of things! Will now be reading through the chickentown blog with pleasure :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[that is awesome!! I want fresh eggs!!!! :)  I really really admire all of y&#039;all who make their own food like that, and raise all these farm animals.  I just don&#039;t have the patience (or land) to do any of that just yet.  I can totally see getting addicted to it though.  Maybe one of these days?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just reading through all of the side hustles for a friend! Thought this was GREAT! I live on a 5 acre farm and we have 7 chickens and 3 ducks that lay eggs (well, 3 chickens aren&#039;t quite there yet, they are this springs babies). Anyways, I&#039;ve been trying to figure out what we will do with them when they stop laying. I was a vegetarian for a year except for things I caught/killed myself but have recently gotten lazy about that. I just don&#039;t think I could kill them myself either, and the manfriend won&#039;t because they are &quot;pets&quot;. I actually have an egg co-op at work. Coworkers bring me egg cartons, they get fresh chicken eggs. We just have way too many that we can&#039;t use. I suppose I should have started charging for this. Oh well - hindsight :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good for you!  We have been doing this for years also.  We experimented with raising and selling homegrown turkeys for Thanksgiving one year, but found the same problem - not much $ for a whole lot of work.  The scale we would have to get to in order to make a reasonable income for time invested was not worth it for us.  And having to butcher all of them a day or two before Thanksgiving was pretty stressful!  
Our kids (5) have always had homegrown poultry, and they actually think chicken from a restaurant is pretty gross (different texture).  My 5 year old daughter took a chicken to school one day for &quot;show-n-tell&quot; and when they asked her what the name was, she thought quickly and answered &quot;Dinner&quot;.  I love when kids have such a healthy attitude about where their food comes from.  Keep it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m always impressed when people tell me they helped butcher the family chicken as a kid.  My kids will help with the chores but NOT the butchering.  They go in the house and scream out,&#039;TELL US WHEN ITS OVER!&#039;]]></description>
