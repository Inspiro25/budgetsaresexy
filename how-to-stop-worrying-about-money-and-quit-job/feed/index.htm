					<description><![CDATA[I love this post MF! ( mister fifteenhundred) Because it essentially resonates with my situation so much.

I operate under the backup to the backup plan scenario..Which is somewhat ridiculous.. But most likely those were the genes passed from generation to generation that survived and made it into me ;-)

I look forward to seeing where your journey takes you (and that book you are writing)]]></description>

Yep! If the money ever starts to run low, I&#039;ll just go out and get a job. Or, maybe move to a country where living expenses are super low. There is risk to retiring early, but there is also risk as staying at your job for an extra 10 years...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love reading your posts.  Always so inspiring!  I do have a question for you.  Assuming we can live off of $40,000 you say about a million is a safe number to save.  Are you taking into account inflation and longevity of retirement years since you retired so early?  I think $1M is doable for us, but my ever-worrying mind always wonders about taxes, inflation, insurance, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great Mr.1500. 

Personally I have been contemplating on leaving my 9 to 5 already. Even though I am no where close to FI, I do have a fair amount of cushion saved up that generates some income already. The thing is I am increasingly cherishing my time as I really don&#039;t feel like working at a job that I am not super passionate about for another 10 years just to reach FI. 

I will probably pick up on some side hustle and focusing on other passions of my, which could potentially generate income for me down the road. 

Does anyone think this is too crazy?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s nothing wrong with retiring and  deciding that doing nothing is just not for you. Some folks are just wired like that, where they need something to do. For my dad, that was actually going back to work part-time, because he loves what he does. For others it might be a side project. Keeping busy sounds like the biggest struggle especially for early retirees, but it sounds like you&#039;ve got that part figured out.]]></description>
