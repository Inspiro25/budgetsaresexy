Maybe after you hit FI you could start up photography again and offer your services for free (but only to people that can&#039;t afford big weddings)?  Could be a good way to renew your hobby, help others, and have some fun in the process? just a thought!

Congrats on your NW increases for 2020 and 2021!!!! I checked out your blog and love that you are documenting your journey! Have a great weekend :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. I agree with you and the side hustles. Sometimes it can even kill your passion if that&#039;s what you&#039;re doing as side hustle.
I used to do wedding photography on the side and i gave it up. People want to hire you to shoot the engagement, a 12 hour event, an album, a house and the divorce for $500. 
Thanks for sharing those numbers. The first time I heard about NW was on this blog. At that time, it seemed to me unreal the idea of individuals like me even thinking about net worth; like that was reserved for just rich people. My credit cards were in the red, plus a student loan and all that.
After becoming financially literate and working on my numbers for very few years I ust can&#039;t believe what a difference it makes when you pay attention to your NW.
We need these stories in front more people.]]></description>

So happy to hear that you love what you do and have opportunity for advancement. Sounds like you&#039;ve already got the best of both worlds, so there&#039;s definitely no point in hustling on something you don&#039;t enjoy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Side hustles are good for people who enjoy them, don&#039;t care about their job, have limited income or income growth potential or feel their main job is precarious. I&#039;ve been left cold by the side hustle culture though - never seen the appeal.

To illustrate my point of view, I&#039;m working in an very well paid job in a domain I really like with both potential to advancement and pay raises. I make enough that a few percentage point raise will trump pretty much any side hustle I could come up with. Moreover, spending that little extra time in advancing my skills related to my job instead of dog-walking will have even better chance of higher pay (so I guess you could call that a job-hustle?). It also increases my overall skills and marketability, plus I find it fun.

I do own investment properties and in fact also have a company on the side, just currently not spending much time on it. (The side company does exactly the same stuff I do at my day job.) But I guess from my point of view almost any side hustles are jobs I&#039;d hate - I don&#039;t want to walk dogs, I would never want to work in customer service, I cringe at the thought of being and Uber driver or grocery delivery person and I most certainly don&#039;t want to start monetizing social media.

I think people need to find stuff they like to do, whether it&#039;s writing stuff on the internet, doing a &quot;day job&quot; in a domain that they find interesting, or walking dogs. But I don&#039;t really see side hustles to be for me - unless you count that one day I might go out freelancing, in which case I&#039;d just ramp up that side company of mine. (So I guess I&#039;m inadvertedly anyway counted in the side hustle gang?)]]></description>

The thrill of making a sneaky profit... I know it well!  Sometimes I waste 2-3 hours flipping something for a $40 profit. Definitely not worth my time, but I just love doing it for funsies!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very much depends on the gig, for sure. I know people can make money messing around with various apps or filling out surveys, but to me those are zero enjoyment activities that bring little in return. I try to avoid time sucks like that, but am open to 

Something in my personality just likes to find arbitrage opportunities and feel like I got one over on... someone. Not sure who. Maybe flipping houses is the final boss stage of this trait. 

And you&#039;re being polite on MLMs haha.]]></description>

Interesting thought! I actually know a ton of busy parents that want a side hustle to keep the distracted, relaxed, and give them something else to focus on rather than just the family. Depending on the activity, it can be a needed break.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if there is a correlation between side hustles and being childless, Joel? I would assume that those who are single or married, but without kids, have more time to devote to side hustles. Furthermore, once you have kids, I would assume that the trade off of time for extra money increases greatly, since you want to see them grow up. What do you think?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with where you landed. Obviously &quot;it depends&quot; is the answer the question, but I don&#039;t think you can go wrong with pursuing your passion as a side hustle. If it makes money, great, if not, no biggie. 

Really, this is exactly how I managed to turn my side hustles into selling two businesses. I started small, and good things happened. But even if nothing had happened, I loved what I was doing at the time, and that is really the key. If you are doing something you won&#039;t regret, then it is worth it. If you already regret what you are missing out on in the moment, then I would ditch that side hustle!]]></description>
