					<description><![CDATA[The most I&#039;ve ever paid for shoes was $120 for a pair of tennis shoes (you know, the special kind for wearing on the hard court) and $90 for a pair of hiking shoes. I&#039;m pretty cheap... but since finding a pair of red Kate Spades at a second-hand shop, the big names have been calling mine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m cheap by nature, but do love a pair of cute shoes. But seeing as though I am a SAHM, I don&#039;t have a need for too many hot, sexy shoes. I tend to spend more on decent running shoes. The most I have ever paid for shoes was probably about $90. I enjoy going to tj maxx or marshalls and getting $30 heels, or strappy sandles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Megan, I&#039;m kind of cheap as well.  The most I&#039;ve paid for shoes is probably $45.  (I say probably because I&#039;m old and can&#039;t remember every purchase).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At one point in my life, I was into expensive shoes.  Lots of them, including a $400 pair of classic black Manolo heels.  Wore them forever and turned out to be a bargain based on wear!!]]></description>
