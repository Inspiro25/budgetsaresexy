					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;The Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  You&#039;re like in my heaven right now :)
@&lt;b&gt;Eric J. Nisall - DollarVersity&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, amen brotha - I can get down with that.
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Good point on the holds, I didn&#039;t even think of that... probably because I put everything on a credit card so I only really &quot;pay a bill&quot; once a month so it doesn&#039;t matter much *when* the checks clear to me, as long as they do.
@&lt;b&gt;PB @ EconomicallyHumble.com&lt;/b&gt; - ING is great, I agree! Esp. with all those sub-accounts you can do with it. Makes saving for goals MUCH easier for ya.
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I could go for a good cash stacking right about now ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iHeartBudgets&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! No, no Happy Gilmore reference here but I am a big fan of the movie :)  And I totally agree that it&#039;s like monopoly money - just seems so fake! (but very VERY glad it&#039;s not!!!)
@&lt;b&gt;Peter&lt;/b&gt; - Yes indeed!  I very much enjoy heading to my mailbox every single day :)  Only nothing ever comes from Bible Money Matters :(
@&lt;b&gt;A Blinkin&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!!!!  Didn&#039;t that place go under too?  Or couldn&#039;t use real money or something?  I was never an online poker player during the last trend, but it did get me to play in Hold &#039;em tournaments with friends - I miss it... I could play every single night if my friends were closer :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... he should keep trying to break his record too and go for like 6 weeks and then 12 weeks! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Laura&lt;/b&gt; - YES!!! EXACTLY!!!  I can gaurnatee that if we had to pay our cable bill in CASH (and in person) every month, as well as all other bills - like our mortgage - we&#039;d double think a LOOOOOOT more of our habits than we do now, that&#039;s for sure.  And even if we kept things as-is, at least we&#039;d appreciate it more!
@&lt;b&gt;Craig&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  The random &quot;free&quot; ones are always the best, too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s something you need to send me today! Just write a 1 and then a whole bunch of 0&#039;s on it, okay? Thanks :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would love to receive a check some day. Everyone once in a while, I&#039;ll get a check  back from paying too much on insurance or taxes or something like that and they cut me a check! It&#039;s nice to take it to the bank!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I hate about direct deposit is busting my ass for two weeks, putting in long hours, dealing with endless crap, just to be rewarded with some numbers on a line on an electronic page on my computer...and just so I can send some electronic numbers to my creditors.  I often feel the reason we got so in debt is the disconnect between the lines of type and the fact that they actually represent real money!  I can&#039;t imagine actually taking cash and paying creditors with it, but I imagine it would &quot;bring home&quot; the reality of our situation.  I love the ease of direct deposit as well as online billpay, I&#039;m just not certain it reinforces the reality of our financial situation as well as actual money would.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s hilarious that you love getting checks. They scare the shit out of me. When money hits my paypal account, I know it&#039;s there. When I&#039;m holding a check, I can&#039;t guarantee the money is available. 

When I used to play poker online, I remember the first sizable check I received from Partypoker. The check was coming from some flower shop in California. Sketchiest thing I&#039;ve been a part of.]]></description>
