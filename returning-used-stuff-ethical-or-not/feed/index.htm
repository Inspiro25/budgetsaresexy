Well that&#039;s an interesting question!!

I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a way to prevent it other than just taking the tags off before selling, but I&#039;m sure stores account for this type of thing in some fashion or another... If it&#039;s been out of stock for years and/or super discounted they&#039;d only get a certain amount from it. And even if they did turn around and hawk them, the goal would still be accomplished at least on your side right? You sold stuff you no longer wanted? Or better yet - why not just return them back to the store yourself if they&#039;re still able to be? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really hope someone still looks at this after time has passed on original post...
My question is this:  If I have items with store tags still on them that I sell at a garage sale, how do I prevent the buyer from returning it to store for credit or return?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That guy with the bedroom set it just gross.  Realistically what they stores should likely offer is a disposal service.  I was recently moving and had a similar problem, about just not wanting furniture/beds etc.  Truth is I&#039;m getting married and have no use for my post college single girl stuff.  I just gave everything away for free on craigslist.  There was no way I felt ok charging people money for stuff I&#039;ve been using for years.  It never even occurred to me to try and return anything.  The only thing that went back to a store was my TV and that&#039;s because Best Buy makes it known that you can e-cycle there.]]></description>

So you rip them off?

Why not just keep the used toys with the better price tag? Kids don&#039;t know the difference and as long as they&#039;re clean it&#039;s all good.... They&#039;re gonna move on to the next one soon anyways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d return it.  I have to live with myself, and I also have to be an example to my children.  It opens up a great conversation with my kids, even if their little.  My son is now almost 12, and he knows (hopefully) that taking things not purchased is wrong because of my actions. 

My husband has wanted to return items that were damaged after we purchased them and the damage has been our fault.  I won&#039;t do it and my son has agreed with me.  Everything we do imprints on our kids.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[REI also had (or has, not sure any more) a lenient return policy. I bought some super expensive boots, hiked in them a few times, and got severe blisters (yes I know you&#039;re supposed to break in boots, but these were bad from the get go). I shoved them in the back of my closet for a couple of years. After I realized they had such a lenient policy, I returned them. I do feel slightly bad for returning something so old, but they did blister me up in the first place, so I don&#039;t feel overwhelmingly bad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I generally do not like returning stuff unless what I bought doesn&#039;t fit, what I intended the item was used for don&#039;t match anymore (and so I return it because I&#039;ve never used it), etc. But then again, there may come a time when I might be in desperate need of cash so that couch might just get returned..
