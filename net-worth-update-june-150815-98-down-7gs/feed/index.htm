					<description><![CDATA[As of writing, the stock market is undeniably overvalued.

Which is a pity, because I&#039;ve been contemplating my new entrance strategy by selling cash secured puts as a means of buying shares at a discount. But I can&#039;t help but feel that it&#039;s pending plummeting though. XD

If I get into it again, I might have to re-contemplate my hedge. Paper Assets have been quite saturated in the market (need I really explain the bond markets? XD) So we could be looking at a comeback of commodities.

Tangents aside, I&#039;m short stocks and long commodities at the moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - Yessir that&#039;s the truth!  Doesn&#039;t really matter what the 401k is doing until it&#039;s time to cash it out ;)  But obviously it&#039;s gotta be going up over time to do some goodness (which I think it will for sure).  Nice to see you back online and off Twitter (hah!).

@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - A post about it is actually already in the hopper!  But for now here&#039;s your answers ;)

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Possibility of a refinance somewhere on the horizon?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Nope!  Because I literally JUST checked the other day, and unfortunately we don&#039;t qualify for any of the new programs out there.  Apparently we have to start defaulting and/or lose our jobs - then we can do it.  ?!?!??!!

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What would it take to get to the point of refinancing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Well, if we were able to physically do it, I&#039;d say we&#039;d have to at least decide to keep the house for 3 more years.  It would make no sense to refi and then leave after a y ear or two as it would take at least that to recoup the refinancing costs (maybe around $3kish?).  Of course, the option of keeping it as an investment property and renting it out is always on the table, but these days I&#039;d much rather go back to just renting myself and getting rid of it.  I&#039;ve realized I&#039;m not of homeowning quality ;)

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Would a refi save any money on your monthly payments?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; OH YES.  Probably at least $200 a month, if not $300.  But again, would only make sense if we were to keep the place and not unload it.  Of course in this economy that&#039;s not an option either, but you get what I&#039;m saying. Refinancing is only good if you can recoup the costs and then save every month after.  Well, that or if you&#039;re rates keep going up and up and you&#039;re getting screwed!  Fortunately most of ours is @ a fixed rate or we&#039;d really be in trouble.

@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yup!!!!  It&#039;s a perfect time to be picking up these bad boys ;)  Which is why I just dropped $5k into my Brokerage Roth just now!  I have to wait &#039;till it clears in a bit, but then it&#039;s on.  The market can keep going down, but eventually it&#039;s gotta get back up and I want to have as much skin in the game as possible at that point.

@&lt;b&gt;Miss Jane&lt;/b&gt; - Well done rolling that over, I have like 4 friends who have theirs all over town and they never take the time to get it all consolidated.  I feel like if you only had one account to check and maintain, it would be a lot easier to manage.  AND pay attention too also.  

Now who the heck is Fever Ray?]]></description>
