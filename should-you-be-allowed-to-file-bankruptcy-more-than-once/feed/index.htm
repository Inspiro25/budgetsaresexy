					<description><![CDATA[Credit card companies are real close to congress and they also get a way with bloody murder.  I have seen loved ones take out credit cards in another persons name and wreak havoc on their life, so the individual ends up filing bankruptcy ,so they won&#039;t get the spouse or whomever did this deceitful dead in trouble, or try to disputed this selfish nonsense.  My own basic research sent me down a path to find some amazing things about the credit card industry,which I found disturbing and plain foolish. One person told me his granddaughter had taken out a  Capital One credit card in his name to help with her drug habit, so what&#039;s in your wallet.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing, fellow J :) And I agree - lots of people ready to take advantage of others for a quick buck, it&#039;s a sad world we live in some times...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

There is more  than 1 type of personal bankruptcy.  In chapter 13, you don&#039;t get out &quot;free&quot;.  In many ways, a 13 is probably more fair to everyone: you pay back what you owe, and not outrageous fees that are often attached as apr and late penalty things.  Also, some people file when they are young and are approached by people who benefit from their filing instead of learning about other methods to manage debt.  Budgets and responsibility ARE super sexy, but sometimes people who need the help to get budget-sexy really have NO idea where to go to get it.  Also, chapter 7 filings dont leave people with nothing.  Getting decent housing and even some jobs become problematic.  Rarely is anything as simple as it seems.
*I counsel people who have had major financial troubles]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I filed for Chapt 7 on 4/2/14 and received my discharge on 7/18/14.  I have never filed for bankruptcy and never planned on it but I was glad I did.  Since my filing, I have been able to sleep at night and not had creditor houding me for payments.  My income is a lower amount than when I incurred credit card debt and a house that was foreclosed on.  Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a welcome relief!]]></description>

Oh my gosh I&#039;m so sorry to hear - that is horrible!! After you were rocking it too! Jeez... I don&#039;t know what to say :( Except that you sound like an incredibly strong woman, and that you have to do what you have to do to get to that next step. Which hopefully includes being back to healthy again! I will say some prayers for you and your family. You guys really have been through a lot, so sad :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can understand how you all could agree against bankruptcy. Those that do it solely to take advantage of others, and the opportunity to do so,are wrong to do it.
As for me, I did it and have no choice as well. My partner cheated on me, after he opened  hardware accts (my fault for allowing my name to be on them too)and then leaving me to try and pay all his dept, plus the house, car, and utilities, no way I could do it on my own, I took out a second mortgage, to try pay off  the debt he left me, and after 5 yrs, i was still spinning my wheels just trying to get food to eat.( I raised 3 children alone with out any outside Govmt assistance. But, I did get a grant, and went back to school, and then took 2 more classes to become certified in healthcare, to make a better living for myself, and dont you know, right after i passed all my state exams, and started working a new job, 6 weeks in, a Male person was traveling way too fast, and lost control of his car, and hit me in a headon car collision.(he totalled my vehicle) (Oh, HE had NO Insurance) I was taken to the hospital, long story short, here I am still recovering , been on my back for over 5 months, lost all muscle mass, and learning to walk again after having a metal plate and a dozen screws installed in my rt foot, Behind on my house, and they are going to foreclose next month. I ran the race, and just when i thought I was going to win, i got knocked down, in a real bad way. Some people have no choice. Im thinking about it again. I dont have any charge cards at all. Just the house. I dont know what to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can say, i am one of those people that unfortunately claimed twice in ten years. I had cancer when I was 22, and went through a divorce at 32. It wasnt easy to choose, but I was trying to pay my bills, &#038; I was consumed with debt. My first bankruptcy was only medical bills, nothing else. The second was a variety of debt, mostly credit that I used to move out, sell our home, get food on the table. I had no money &#038; was desperate. However, I also seen ppl abusing this, as said before. It&#039;s the same as the welfare system, lotsa pl rely on others to pay their bills]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, I&#039;m so sad you all are going through that! :(  I really really appreciate you sharing your story with us though and giving us another perspective to think about.  Much harder to leave things so black &amp; white, ya know?  And I think you&#039;re right - every situation should be looked into and consideration be made depending on the circumstances.  You guys hang in there!  I&#039;ll send a prayer and hope it makes it over ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial &lt;/b&gt; - I think meeting with an adviser is AWESOME.  In fact, I wish every single person in the world had to have a one-on-one every 10 years to make sure they stay on track! Can the gov&#039;t do that for us? :)]]></description>
