					<description><![CDATA[This made me laugh in a good way... oh mothers... I know someone with the same predicament and her mom tells her that her freelance jobs through the internet are not work at all. And continues to berate her with, &quot;why-don&#039;t-you-get-up-that-chair-and-start-working-in-a-proper-office-like-everyone-else&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[gotta love mom!  I&#039;ve heard lots and lots of the same over the years but now that i&#039;m older I tend to hear my mom with different ears.  is that possible???  when she asks when i&#039;m coming to visit I drop most everything, look at the calendar, and call her back within a couple days to say &quot;does this work for you?&quot;  as she gets older, time spent with her is more and more dear to me.
she still has some weird advice though. take it with a grain of salt, and love mom for all she&#039;s worth!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha when I was working a &quot;9-5&quot;, I was NOT working a 9-5, it was like a 7-11/7 days a week! Now I&#039;ve gone to an unstructured gig and it&#039;s like 10am-1am, most days a week and I&#039;m way less stressed than before. 
Moms just want the best for their kids; it&#039;s just that so often, it&#039;s what they&#039;re NOT doing at the moment because Moms can always see how you&#039;d be happier &quot;if only you&#039;d just [insert here]&quot;  :D 

I know you&#039;d be hustling no matter what but I&#039;m hoping you&#039;ll soon back be where you&#039;re hustling for the sheer love of it and not because things have taken a downturn.]]></description>

Haha, love it. Also? Just headed over to your blog - which I also now love!! Really interesting stuff you&#039;re doing over there my man, totally pimping out either your negative net worth article or your latte one on my new site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rockstarfinance.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RockstarFinance.com&lt;/a&gt;. I get so annoyed w/ the coffee talk now - mainly because even if you DID stop drinking that money, you still have to take action and SAVE/INVEST/PUT IT SOMEWHERE in order for you to take advantage of the entire situation! And most people forget to do that 2nd half.

But I digress... point is, keep pouring your heart into your blog :) It seems to really be taking off now too - you&#039;re a lot farther ahead after a month than I was!]]></description>
