					<description><![CDATA[JS, nothing really wrong with my blog, it&#039;s new and works for me!  ;-)  I need to get a domain, but for now, I will keep it at Wordpress.  It&#039;s free!
You are right, its the 20 steps later that users do that make my life miserable!  ;-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Veronica - I do have a DesignPanoply store on Envato. It is a small chunk of money each month, especially since I don&#039;t sell exclusively so the commission is only 33%.

I honestly don&#039;t enjoy developing WordPress sites, but you&#039;re right, a lot of them make some REALLY good money on it. I swear the top selling WordPress theme has made over $1 million!

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Thanks again, John!&lt;/b&gt; And congrats on finding that biz partner of yours - it DOES make a difference so much! Without my man Nate there&#039;s no way we would have launched (or have been as successful as we were), our charity project &lt;a href=&quot;http://lovedrop.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Love Drop&lt;/a&gt; last year. Makes an incredible difference, so I&#039;m glad to hear you guys are connected :)

@&lt;b&gt;Ian&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;This is how I look at it: most people get home and watch TV for 4 hours and go to bed. I go home, and hustle from 10pm-12/1am on my sites before getting up again at 6.&quot; -- YES!!! Very productive - I love it!!

@&lt;b&gt;Marie at FamilyMoneyValues&lt;/b&gt; - It DOES get overwhelming at times. Every now and then I have to sit back and really ask myself which of my projects are truly important to me at the end of the day and try and weed out the others... We can&#039;t always limit them to our &quot;perfect world&quot; scenario (esp if your income depends on it!), but hopefully over time it would eventually lead to that :) In the meantime we just keep on hustlin&#039;!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Marie - I know what you mean about keeping up with blogs :-/

It can be fun and rewarding, but sometimes it&#039;s so tough and time consuming it can be demoralizing.

Keep up the good work!

					<description><![CDATA[debtgirl - Computer support can be tough. Most of the time it&#039;s people who have no clue about computers and have managed to take 20 wrong steps to making things worse, haha.

What&#039;s wrong with your blog? If there&#039;s a problem I&#039;d be happy to try and help.

					<description><![CDATA[I do some Computer Support on the side, but I really hate it.  I hate working on PCs.  But it does give me a few extra bucks if I decide to do it.  But it is so rare anymore.

Come fix my website/blog!  ;-)]]></description>
