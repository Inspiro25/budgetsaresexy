Cool! People tend to either love or hate that guy, but I&#039;m all for anyone trying to help spread the good word whether his &quot;story&quot; checks out or not... In fact, Rich Dad Poor Dad was one of the very first books I ever read around $$$/entrepreneur stuff! It took me a while to start acting on it, but it helped plant the seed at least :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[God Bless Andrew Lumish!!  

As for my latest read, I like the following passage by Mark Manson in his book: The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck.  &quot;Consumer culture is very good at making us want more, more, more.  Underneath all the hype and marketing is the implication that more is always better.  I bought into this idea for years.&quot;  He goes on to say how this leads to the paradox of choice and becoming less satisfied no matter what we choose.  &quot;Instead, invest deeply in one person, one place, one job, or one activity...&quot; In short, commit to your passion and stop chasing the carrot.]]></description>

Beautiful :)

I might have to try that for late nights w/ the baby as I&#039;ve quickly learned that reading or doing anything else using my brain does not work during those times, haha.... But I can listen to ebooks! Maybe it&#039;ll sink into the baby&#039;s brain too :)]]></description>
