Hi Jag,

The margins are huge for luxury watches. I would estimate at least 50%, if not closer to 80%. How do they do this? By building a brand.

Hence, you can&#039;t just buy any watch, you need to do research and buy the watch that is also most in high demand. 

Build a relationship, do more business, build your own brand and things get easier over time.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sam, could you let me know why a a dealer/jeweler would sell you a watch (for e.g. the Milgauss) for so much cheaper? Are their margins that high? I&#039;m interested in trading watches and I&quot;m trying to find out where i can source watches from besides buying from individual owners.]]></description>

Keep up the great work!

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been sitting on some savings drawing 0% and have been shopping for a luxury watch instead of PM&#039;s. Finding and buying a quality Rolex for my wife was a eye opening experience. Rolex seems to be a commodity in it&#039;s own class. Luxury watches in general do seem to find a floor of value in normal times. For the patient a diversified it could be an option.There are absolutely no VC&#039;s, PP&#039;S, or AP&#039;s in my area. Quality Rolex examples are hard to find with Pawn Shops being the only option for most. I visit my MIL out of state a lot and have and pass thru a major city along the way. I plan to see a few watch dealers next trip and maybe have shipped back home a Holy Trinity watch for enjoyment/resale. I echo the points made in the article. Make sure you understand what you own. Know the movement. Be able to identify fakes. Know the online price (including ebay auctions). Offer something not readily obtainable if you live in BFE. Buy mint quality pieces with no issues from reputable dealers. Buy something you might like owning for a few years. I have met with a few local CL watch dealers and they offer junk and problem Rolex Datejust&#039;s that I can buy anywhere. The Pawn Shops have redialed aftermarket crap bezels for their Rolex and a few Tags. The last CL dealer showed up in shorts and tee shirts and bragged about being friends with the low ball gold buyer. He had never heard of Vacheron. After our meet he texted me continuously over two hours and got upset because of my slow response ( I was Xmas shopping and driving home). Then criticized the gold and diamond ring I was thinking of trading as part of the purchase. If you plan to buy/sell a luxury watch one should dress the part. Set yourself apart from the crowd. Reputation is a two way street and means everything.]]></description>
