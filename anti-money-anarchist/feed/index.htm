I tend to go in baby steps too - gradually letting things sink in as I move one direction or the other :) I admire those who can pull the trigger fast like that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that&#039;s a bit too hard core for me. I&#039;d focus on gaining some skills and making more money. I guess I could live like they did for a while, but I wouldn&#039;t want to. It&#039;s nice that they are learning from their experience. They&#039;re young so they have a lot of time.]]></description>

Talk about creating a wealth of life experiences. Neither lifestyles are ones I&#039;d pick myself, but I have a lot of respect for Melanie&#039;s ability to make a decision and go full force.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I couldn&#039;t see myself dumpster diving, I do think it is really cool that people reduce waste this way. I am however, extremely interested in getting into urban foraging. The thought of fresh, local, wild food sounds really healthy and it is a great way to learn about the local ecosystem and appreciate the environment for how it sustains us. There is a cool website called fallingfruit.org and if you input your location, it will give you locations of dumpsters and actual edible wild food and fruit trees in your area.]]></description>
