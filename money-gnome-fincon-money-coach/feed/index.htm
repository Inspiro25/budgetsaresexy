					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Just because I ASKED. I literally said &#039;I’m not sure if I have the time to devote to this, but what’s your budget?” and they said “We can only do $1,000, is that okay?&#039; &quot;

Sounds like you have discovered additional benefits to being &quot;selfishly employed&quot;.

There is so much power in knowing what your time is worth...understanding the full opportunity cost of exchanging your time for money. Funny how, when we don&#039;t need the money, people are willing to give us more of it. Kind of like trying to get a loan at the bank...only the people who don&#039;t really need it get the great rates.]]></description>
