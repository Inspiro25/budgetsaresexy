					<description><![CDATA[I have been with Upromise over 10 years, and have earned back over $5000.  The first couple years I was not really into it too much and was only earning pennies here and there... but once I really read the fine print and read comments from other members, and I applied for the upromise Credit Card... then I started earning the rewards.  We do not eat out often or do a lot of online purchasing, but when I do need a purchase I check first to see if a Upromise partner has the items I need at the lowest price.   I charge almost all of our expenses on the Upromise Mastercard and pay it off in full when the bill come.

there are other rewards program out there also like Ebates and Goodsearch...  stores are willing to give &quot;rebates&quot; back for purchases.. you just have to figure our which one works best for you if any.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha... well, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d go that far, but I agree it hasn&#039;t amounted up to jack for me neither ;)  And I&#039;m not about to change my habits to earn a few more bucks into it either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[U-Promise to me = U- suck..  The biggest waste of time I have ever seen!!  Signed up for it 5 years ago and my account balance is about .13 cents.  Nothing you ever buy even in the correct time frame and sale date ever gets added to your account :(  This site is a data collection site and in my opinion has nothing to do with helping kid&#039;s with college.]]></description>
