Yes, home interest rates are super low. Honestly, would rather buy something cash that is cheap and not worry about owing anyone money. We saved 100k cash by 2017 without that money we would have never bought the house we did in 2017. We would have probably bought something already fixed up with a VA loan (paying a what 5% fee?). Instead we bought a house put 20% down so we didn&#039;t have to pay PMI put the other 50k into the house to fix it up and sold it in 2020 for double our investment. Without that cash I would have never took the risk on that house. So much of finance is mental we all have different thresholds and I lean pretty conservatively. I need to sleep at night. I am a planner and a worrier.]]></description>

Cash is king in real estate. (but it&#039;s also a great time to borrow money with low interest rates).

Good luck Jen, and I can definitely relate that it&#039;s not an easy decision!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in this boat with $200k plus cash most of it in 2.23% cds. Its not easy dumping that kind of money in the stock market. I&#039;m hoping our next move will be a place we can afford to buy a house with cash.]]></description>

Cheers David! Well it&#039;s important to note that lump sum investing is only applicable if you actually have a lump sum. Inheritance, stimulus check you don&#039;t need, big commission check, windfall of some sort, etc...  (or in my friend&#039;s case, hoarding).  But if you don&#039;t have a lump sum, there is no comparison and dollar cost averaging is the way to go :)]]></description>

Well thanks Martinus! But I can only count it as a success if my friend actually invests her money soon. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was one of the most data driven and interesting articles that breaks down dollar cost averaging vs lump sum investing. When I read personal finance articles that relate to investing, I read so much about how important it is to dollar cost average and how it can make you rich. 

They never actually dive into a statistical analysis of what percentage of the time when you actually do win. At a 72% win rate, I&#039;ll take it! 

Like many others though, I wish I had $200,000 in cash just laying around of which I can invest with :)]]></description>
