					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah!  I soooooo remember having clothes jammed into my drawers as a little kid - drove me nuts! But back then I didn&#039;t realize I could actually speak up and go through them all myself! haha... now that I know better it&#039;s much smoother of a process ;)  Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went through my closet this week. I started to get rid of all the clothes that just don&#039;t fit anymore. Next week I think I will go through my children&#039;s closet. With all the hand me downs we get, they have way too many clothes shoved in their drawers and closet. It feels good to free up some much needed space. :)]]></description>

@&lt;b&gt;Sunit&lt;/b&gt; -  Nice!  Funny how that works out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;DIYMILF&lt;/b&gt; - You know it!  Well, at least that would be the plan ;)  I could also come off as a wannabe, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;South County Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, that&#039;s pretty impressive.  I can go a few months without buying something but then I always miss it!  Esp clothes, cuz now that I keep giving it all away I actually run out of stuff to wear now! haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea J. Money!  I&#039;m down to a single suit these days.  And as for shoes, I only have five pairs, each with their own use.  

It&#039;s pure freedom to get rid of older clothes.  I&#039;m picking up quite a few polos from my work...  I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll sell those when I move companies!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a waste of money to have things with tags still on!
If your stuff still has the tags on you probably don&#039;t love the item, only the money you spent on it.  Just sell or donate and move on, at least that is what I would do.  

For my week of giving something up, I have decided to study an hour a day for 3-4 days.  Then if I can keep it up, do it for the month.  :)  

I picked up a second part-time job that is pretty lucky to have.  Studying would help this job and possibly future ones that are similar.  Not something I absolutely love doing, but it is a decent job and pays off my debt.]]></description>
