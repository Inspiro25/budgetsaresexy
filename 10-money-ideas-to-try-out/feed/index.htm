					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me so much of what I seemed to be able to do while I was in labour with my children (but rarely have experience since then!). I was somehow able to allow the experience of each contraction without wishing it to end and relax in the moments of relief without fearing or dreading the next contraction. I believe that this is why I often tell people that labour was really not all that bad even though in our culture people almost always fear it. I didn’t realize that practicing equanimity is what I was doing! It never really occurred to me to practice this skill in other areas until I read your piece. There are daily occurrences of discomfort that I almost always resist. Thanks for the great article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have TOTALLY been doing the Mortgage Time Travel thing since I bought my house!

I have a google doc where I have my payments calculated out based on the official 30 year term, and then on another sheet, I have my &quot;planned&quot; payment schedule where I can see what the impact is if i throw additional principal on the debt.

Every month, when I make my payment + additional principle, I get to scroll down to the bottom of the sheet and see that my loan balance ends a little bit earlier - I&#039;ve moved my end date from March 2043 to April 2022 so far!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[myezy is pretty close to a guild type concept.  With everyone helping each other become better bloggers.

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, wow the &quot;what to do after dead&quot; letter really hit a chord with me. Both for succession planning purposes, as well as just having a reality check.

Same concept as building out SOPs for employees - when you lay it all out, it all looks much clearer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey all, Leah here. Just wanted to say thanks for the input. I have personally tried Habitica, Chore Wars, and Nerd Fitness. Of the three, Nerd Fitness is my favorite, but I find it too pricey to maintain for long on my current budget. I haven&#039;t found any yet that are quite like what I&#039;m envisioning though. Having said that, another one that I haven&#039;t yet tried, is Octalysis Prime, but it seems very promising (though last I checked, it was more expensive than Nerd Fitness, for comparison). But absolutely, they are all good in their own ways, and if you use them and love them - keep on! :) 

And yes, J. Money, I do hope to start up that blog - but after my college coursework is finished. I think I&#039;ll aim for New Year&#039;s?? I&#039;ll keep you updated!]]></description>
