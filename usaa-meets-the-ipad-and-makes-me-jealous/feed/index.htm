					<description><![CDATA[J - you didn&#039;t avoid the money trap, you&#039;re just waiting for the iPad 2, which should be announced next week. *wink*

I got the iPad app when it first came out. It&#039;s pretty cool (as is their iPhone app). The only thing it really doesn&#039;t have is online trading built in. If USAA built in even nominal online trading, it would be like the ETrade iPad app on steroids!

And yes, to everyone out there, the iPad is as useful to have as being a USAA Member. But I would still give up my iPad in a heartbeat if I had to choose between the two!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dogs shot me a crazy look after I laughed at your comment about USAA naming you as their official Mascot... when my husband and I were dating he would tease me about being the &quot;poster child&quot; for USAA and that was usually my answer... 15 years later of him being a member, he&#039;s now spouting it&#039;s greatness.   I&#039;d rather never have and ipad (and I want one pretty bad) then give up USAA.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Erin--rub it in!!!  When we got info on the new app, we got to see a preview &quot;video&quot; and it took all I had not to buy an iPad the day the app got launched!  Especially since our bonus hit around that time!  I&#039;ve heard that the bill pay option is SO EASY!  

@J-dude!  you have more pull than I do!  You&#039;re the one that&#039;s getting iPads sent to you and going to visit home office!  I had to go on a family trip to SA in order to visit home office!  I&#039;m just the low man on the totem-pole, brutha!]]></description>
