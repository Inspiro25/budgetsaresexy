That&#039;s a helluva great (and simple!) equation! If only more people listened to it :(

My philosophy on investing savings? I just wrote up a post on the order of where all my &quot;extra&quot; money goes (ie your savings/investments). Is this what you mean?

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s great to hear about the different paths we take to reach our final destination of financial freedom...whether that be $1m, $5m, or heck $100m dollars or more.  

In my mind, it all comes down to a simple equation:

Income - Spending = Savings and Investment

(see my blog post: http://www.genwisewealth.com/the-simple-equation-for-wealth/)

J. Money,
What is your philosophy on how people should invest their savings?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can add Jim #99 as having crossed the $1M mark now too.  I didn&#039;t realize it &#039;cause my wife does most of our budgeting, but when I read your article I added the #&#039;s in my head, asked her if she realized we were past the $1M mark and she said, &quot;yeah&quot; - like so what?  She said ours doesn&#039;t really count (in her head) until our mortgage is paid in full and our investments are a much more over $1M than they currently are - in order to account for market risk.  Not quite sure how her brain works - but you may now mark off #99.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/proof-become-millionaire/#comment-129492&quot;&gt;JoeTaxpayer&lt;/a&gt;.

All good things to think about, brotha... I plan on having my expenses cut down wayyyyy less by the time I &quot;retire&quot; myself, and perhaps that will include getting rid of our house and living in a cabin in the woods I build by hand myself (Hah! yeah right).

Question for you though - if you don&#039;t include your house in your net worth, how do you offset the mortgage(s)? Or are you guys mortgage free these days?

I always feel like either both should be included, or none at all, or one side is more skewed than the other... Then again, I look at my net worth as all assets - liabilities which would be different if you&#039;re only tracking stuff for retirement income or accounts only, etc...]]></description>
