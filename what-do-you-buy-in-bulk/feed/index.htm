					<description><![CDATA[We have 6 in our family, and we resisted Costco for years, but there are some great deals there, and convenience, when you have a big group or you hate shopping often - and the price is right.  I find that I get a better deal at the grocery store on toilet paper than I do at Costco, so I choose what to buy at each place (and believe me, 28 years later you don&#039;t want your mother-in-law still bringing up the time you ran out of TP during one of her visits!). Working full-time makes it a challenge to shop (and plan - planning is what saves me money). I always thought I wouldn&#039;t have time to pick and choose where I shopped or to buy in bulk, once I went back to work, but I found that because I&#039;m working I really need to choose wisely. Now that I&#039;m working I can find us needing something at the store every day if my husband and I don&#039;t plan ahead. You can get so tired from the day at work that you don&#039;t realize how much money you are spending with each &quot;quick&quot; stop. I say close your eyes to the scary box-store crowds or discount outlets (Amelia&#039;s) but take a list and you can save some moola!]]></description>

Space IS pretty important - it&#039;s a good concern to raise :)]]></description>

Wow - $17/hr PLUS benefits is great! I had no idea... I know Home Depot is supposed to be pretty awesome with that too, but hadn&#039;t heard Costco before - good for them :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To answer your questions:

1. Stuff I buy in bulk: Not too much, because storage is a problem. There&#039;s limited space in my home, so loading up on too many bulk items creates clutter. That said, I&#039;ll grab a few extra bottles of hummus or salsa if they&#039;re on sale.

2. Favorite bulk purchases: The ones that don&#039;t take up too much space -- like toothbrushes. :-)

3. Most I ever spent: Hmmm, great question. I&#039;m not sure. Maybe $100?

4. Bulk buying tip: Okay, I realize that I keep talking about &quot;space&quot; again and again, but it really is an issue. I used to buy a lot more in bulk, but then I&#039;d feel stressed out about my jam-packed freezer, the rolls of paper towels on my living room floor, etc. And bulk-buying should not be a source of stress! So I&#039;d say my biggest tip is to be realistic about the amount of storage space in your home.

5. Seacrest Hot Meter: Uhhh ..... what?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this one! I am obsessed with Costco.  I think that they are a great place to shop, they give their employees at least $17/hr plus benefits. And the CEO only gets $350,000 because he believes in putting money into Costco and the employees. 

What do you buy in bulk? everything! Toliet paper, paper towel, meat (cut and freeze them into smaller portions), cleaning supplies
What’s your *favorite* thing you get in bulk? meat LOL 
What was the most you ever spent on it? $125 but that lasted us months! 
Tell us one secret or tip you use to get awesome deals (or maybe it’s a favorite store?)  compare prices
On a scale from 1-10, how sexy is Ryan Seacrest? 5.. he&#039;s too short]]></description>

I just pick up different colors of the same clothes I like and/or all other types of clothes too. Just usually in one big sitting or shopping trip vs spread out over the months :)]]></description>
