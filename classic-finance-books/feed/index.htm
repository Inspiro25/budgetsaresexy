					<description><![CDATA[Stay away from credit cards if you can&#039;t pay them off right away (they can be evil if you aren&#039;t disciplined like I am), start saving into a 401k/Roth at work or independently as soon as you can and steadily increase your investment percentage as much as possible, start out atleast putting in the &quot;matching&quot; % that your company offers or you are leaving money on the table, direct deposit into your 401K or retirement account is your best friend as you won&#039;t have to be disciplined to send money in or remember to make a contribution, read finance related books, meet regularly with financial experts to review your portfolio and to make adjustments as needed to meet your financial and retirement goals.  And one of my favorites is to use various websites like RetailMeNot, etc. to find Promo codes to enter when ordering various products online;  there&#039;s nothing like free money.  These are just a few tips that I have gathered over the years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a frustrating habit of buying lots of books and online courses. Frustrating because I wish I could be saving that money instead yet I LOVE learning beyond measure. This month I finally decided that I would finalize both libraries and I did. I have essentially saved my future self thousands of dollars as I am known to buy several books and courses and dabble across them all throughout the year and years. This year so far, I have spent $1875.68 on these.  I am excited that you are giving away this particular set of book as I am realizing that in my decision to finalize my library yesterday I don&#039;t have any of them. Thanks!]]></description>
