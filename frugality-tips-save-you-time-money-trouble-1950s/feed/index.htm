					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, late in commenting, but I wish I&#039;d known about #284 and the wet finger print this past weekend. I could have used that! I also struggle with squeaky floors so #47 might be interesting. For #66, I grew up eating peanut butter &#038; honey so maybe my mom read this booklet!
Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Words of wisdom from the ages! ;)

#66. Peanut butter mixed with honey and raisins make an ideal sandwich.

I will try this one and see how it works out...looks promising!]]></description>

It almost looked like a miniature mailbox like you see on the main floor of an apartment building, but much smaller. It only had maybe 30 boxes and each box had a small slot in it. The boxes couldn&#039;t be much more than 3&quot;x3&quot;x6&quot;. The people really had to fold up bills to get them shoved in the small slots. 

The money is counted by the bar man who is also the owner each week. There is a minimum amount of money that has to be deposited weekly and for every time you didn&#039;t deposit there is a small penalty when the money is taken out before Christmas. By the sounds of it you can&#039;t take money whenever you want, there is one specified day in December, the whole purpose was to have a way to buy Christmas presents, hence &quot;Christmas Club&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a fun list, even if a few of them were odd. I don&#039;t use a shower cap, and I don&#039;t think salad dressing made from ketchup sounds very appealing. Although I&#039;m not a big ketchup fan to begin with, anyway.

I&#039;m dying to know the typewriter hacks, though.]]></description>
