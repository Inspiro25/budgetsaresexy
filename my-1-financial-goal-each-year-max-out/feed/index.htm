It totally is! And if all you did was just max it out every year and nothing else you&#039;d still be sitting pretty come retirement time... It&#039;s not always easy, but it&#039;s a helluva goal to strive for :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had no idea there was a max on 401K contributions. I knew there were on IRAs but not 401Ks, I guess because it is so much higher.  That is kind of nice in the sense that it gives you something to shoot for!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My goal for 2010 is to have all credit card and car loan debt paid off and increase our emergency fund.  Our house is paid off so after that, I can start chipping away at my student loans, the last of our debt.  Oh, yeah, and save up to buy a car (with cash) to replace my rapidly failing 92 Corsica!]]></description>
