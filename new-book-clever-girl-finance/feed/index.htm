Are you worrying that you don&#039;t have enough or won&#039;t have enough later? Any way you can set your life up so it feels like you&#039;re kinda-retired now even though you aren&#039;t so you get a taste of it? (ie. like not working nights or weekends or looking for more passion-filled jobs...). Hopefully you&#039;re *over* worrying and just trying to speed things up, but either way I know it&#039;s not fun :( Another idea is connecting up with a financial advisor and having them reassure you that all is good! Or point you in a better direction if not!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need to stop worrying so much about them! I think about our finances most the day i. e. How can I make more money, what is my next side hustle, what don&#039;t I know yet and how do I learn about it. We&#039;re 33 but I can&#039;t wait for retirement! Also...I need to get started on our will too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/new-book-clever-girl-finance/#comment-279673&quot;&gt;J. Zoo&lt;/a&gt;.

How about keeping a &quot;house fund&quot; where you both contribute to, but then spend/save any remaining money however you wish? That&#039;s what we did when we moved in together before getting married :) (where now everything goes into the &quot;house fund&quot; and then divvied out from there...)]]></description>
