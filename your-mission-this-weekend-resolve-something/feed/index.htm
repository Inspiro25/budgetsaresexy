					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little late to the party, but I did resolve something that&#039;s been driving me freakin&#039; nuts. My banner on my blog. I kept trying to make it better each time and it just kept sucking. So finally, I hired a pro and have such an awesome banner now.

It&#039;s was way worth the time and money to get rid of that nagging voice that was scream &quot;GHETTO&quot; at me each time I saw it. :-)

PS- Your bathroom looks 100 times better now and the ring is pretty tight too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on kicking butt and getting things accomplished.  My plan for this weekend (aka Sunday) is to get a little caught up on work, pay bills, relax in the sunshine and head to church.  Nice having a week on the Cape, but now it&#039;s time to get back to business.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - All pretty do-able things at least!  I&#039;ve been meaning to go into our attic too - have nooooo idea what&#039;s in there and have actually totally forgotten we even HAD one to begin with!  Thinking of laying down some plywood and start using it for storage :)  Can&#039;t be *too* hard to do, right?  Hope you get a lot of your stuff done this weekend!
@&lt;b&gt;Manette @ Barbara Friedberg Personal Finance&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks :) I hope you get &#039;em done too, I know that feeling of being un-finished like that - I currently have like 5 posts in that stage right now :)  What works for me is writing stuff down as SOON as it&#039;s in my head and fresh - the longer I wait, the longer it takes me to finish them all up as I quickly lose interest at the same time, haha...  good luck to you though!
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - You know it!  Smaller, monthly, goals are SO MUCH EASIER to do for sure - I think you&#039;re onto something smart there :)
@&lt;b&gt;B. (Below Her Means)&lt;/b&gt; - *High Five* AND *beer cling!*
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal @ Prairie Ecothrifter&lt;/b&gt; - There&#039;s always something with houses, eh? :)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Nothing wrong with FEELING wealthy though ;)  Not many can pull that off!
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, well thank YOU for always reading and commenting, my friend :)  I wish you luck in both the post AND the winning of the PF Olympics! Pour your heart into, girl!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bathroom looks good; and it is important that they don&#039;t leak - though not certain what the solution to this is. I can be often seen staring at the kitchen ceiling, looking for tell tales stains - they never diappoint :). I was thinking about what I would like to resolve this weekend - and the only thing that comes to mind is that I have to finish the article for PF Olympics (and it is not going great). Thank you for you blog, thank you for providing a worthy distraction.]]></description>
