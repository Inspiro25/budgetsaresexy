No luck when your house is underwater :) But even if it was, I&#039;d prefer to have the extra cash laying around at the moment... Once business is back on track I&#039;ll consider trying to finagle a way to refinance and save more later on. If we haven&#039;t sold it by then! (I don&#039;t want it anymore, haha...)]]></description>

You should be able to take any money back that you put into it and reduce your interest rate at the same time :)]]></description>
