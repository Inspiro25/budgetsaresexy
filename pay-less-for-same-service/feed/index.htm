					<description><![CDATA[Great posting! I really enjoy the quality of your blog - both the personal and the informational content.

1. Our internet company (USI Wireless) has a significant discount from their monthly rate if you pay for the year up front. I had never seen this offered before and was pleasantly surprised. Our yearly rate for 25 mbps was $403.17 - I think that&#039;s one of the best rates we&#039;ve had for the fastest internet we&#039;ve had.

2.  Same internet company gave us $125 back from our yearly rate after we slowed down our internet speed from 50 mbps to 25 mbps. We found out from one of their technicians that our wireless internet speed was only able to work at a max of 12 - 22 mbps with the router/modem setup we have, so I asked if it would make a difference if we reduced our internet speed and the technician said he didn&#039;t think it it would. So it is technically a lesser service that we were receiving, but to us it functioned the same since we primarily use wireless internet at home (versus hard-wired).

3. Car insurance company (Progressive) offered a discount if we would plug in a device into our car to let them monitor our driving habits. Since we are fairly light users of our car, we agreed and got a 5% discount, which they mailed us a check for. I was reading online that the maximum discount for using this device could be up to 30%.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pet care is another example I&#039;ve come across. We have all sorts of pets and the initial cost of buying the animal, housing etc. can be quite high. However once you&#039;ve paid those initial costs, your outlay reduces considerably.

Think of fish as a perfect example. That big tank, all the equipment, the fish themselves: expensive. A tub of fish food and a few basic supplies each month? Next to nothing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Got a check once from the hospital because I apparently overpaid a $100 copay. It was for an emergency room visit that then I had to go back to the next day to be checked up again. $100 copay per visit! Luckily I was fine and nothing was seriously wrong.]]></description>
