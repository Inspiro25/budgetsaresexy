					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Peter&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, yeah that health insurance stuff is no joke.  If we didn&#039;t have my wife&#039;s coverage through school, we&#039;d be in a bit more trouble ;)  But I SO HOPE you can go full-time one day my man!  Love your stuff all the way and know that it&#039;s def. possible for you.  Without even getting laid off too! Haha...  see ya at the Blogger&#039;s Conference soon ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Pat S.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, good to know.  It&#039;s already 6:30 pm here and haven&#039;t even considered the shower yet! Still weird to accept.
@&lt;b&gt;Her Every Cent Counts&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, no I&#039;m not enjoying it! that&#039;s the sucky part - I feel &quot;lazy&quot;! :)  But interesting to hear abour your past experience w/ this kinda stuff yourself.  The old me would have done exactly that too, and in fact DID!  But starting this blog was the best thing I could have ever done with my &quot;professional&quot; life, and it&#039;s been a totally different mentality ever since.  I hope to see you out there full-time too one day :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I know how you feel right now. After getting laid off a year ago, I told myself I was not going to seriously apply to any jobs that I could get, beyond was I was required to apply to in order to collect unemployment. But I didn&#039;t do a good job at that... I was extremely unmotivated, depressed, etc, and managed to end up in another job within a month. The month off was, unfortunately, not one of productivity, but one where I slept a lot and moped around. It was such a waste when I finally had the freedom and opportunity to be my own boss!

It&#039;s great to read that you&#039;re being successful (at least to some extent) in being your own boss. Of course, you already have such a great blog (and likely other online properties?) that you&#039;re investing more time into now that you don&#039;t have a day job.

The whole showering at 4pm and working and eating breakfast at 2am and sleeping until 1pm thing is really great, for a while. I hope you are enjoying it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love reading about your progress and about how it&#039;s going for you working for yourself. I remember reading about the layoffs and about how you were going to be living the dream.  To me part of the dream would be sleeping in, showering at 4pm and working til the wee hours of the morning.

I think I&#039;ll be living vicariously until the time arrives that I can go full time as well. I have a feeling that&#039;s going to be a while - or at least until i can figure out the whole health insurance situation - with a wife who has health issues.  It&#039;s tough finding affordable health coverage without getting group coverage.

I&#039;ll look forward to reading more about you adventures and ups and downs as a self employed blogging and do-gooding mogul!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ross&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed 100% - All about diversifying and making sure there&#039;s multiple income streams coming.  Great point!  And hopefully I&#039;ll get to where you are too w/ the schedule - I woke up at 9am this morning, I&#039;m proud of myself! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Will @ HackingTheBank.com&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, there&#039;s always a way if you truly want it enough ;)  And you can spend the hundreds of hours working toward it! haha... it&#039;s not always easy, but so far it&#039;s rewarding.  Thanks for stopping by Will, would love to hear updates on you progress too as time goes on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seems like you&#039;re doing pretty awesome. I must admit, I am jealous you&#039;re living in the now and living the life you want. I know if I wait too long it will never happen, but maybe in a year or so? Who knows, we&#039;ll see. Definitely looking forward to the update in three months, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been working full time online since 2006. It&#039;s definitely had it&#039;s ups and down. Income is not as stable as i&#039;d like. But the key is to diversify your online projects, just like with stocks and have money coming in from a variety of sources.

Also a schedule is important. I used to stay up really late and not shower until late afternoon. But, once i realized i had to just stick to a normal work schedule to stay sane, things have gotten alot better. I had to move my office upstairs, just to keep the computer away from me at night]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Freedom&#039;s priceless... I had a similar situation myself recently (although I went voluntarily went unemployed).  I really appreciate that you take the time to respond to everyone... I think it goes a long way to connect with your readers.  Keep up the good work!

					<description><![CDATA[Glad you guys got something out of this :)  It was hard for me at times to get parts of this out, but I did my best to be as honest as possible.  I&#039;ll continue posting up updates as time goes on to see how things end up changing.  I can tell you that it def. messes with your brain at times! haha...

Some responses...errr.. a LOT of responses:

@&lt;b&gt;Wojo&lt;/b&gt; -  You better tell me the second you become a SAHD too!  Or should that be SAHB (Stay at home blogger?) ;)
@&lt;b&gt;laura&lt;/b&gt; - Haha we should all time it so that we&#039;re in at the exact same time every day!  Or would that be creepy? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Haha me too!  I know we *shouldn&#039;t* feel guilty for working different hours, but I guess we just can&#039;t help it yet.  One day we&#039;ll get better ;)  Thanks for the love!	
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger @ Ask the IRS&lt;/b&gt; - Hey thanks, I&#039;ll check them out :)  And small edit -- I didn&#039;t actually spend $70k in 3 months, I meant to say I lost my $70k salary now that I&#039;m working for myself.  Went back to clarify more in the post - thx!
@&lt;b&gt;Ray Martin&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah dude, totally!  I&#039;m a) still in my clothes from yesterday actually, and b)  all for you (and others) giving it a shot and experiencing the different lifestyle :)  Glad you found this post helpful!  Will continue doing them as time goes on.  Would love to hear your updates later too, cool?
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; -  Awwww, thanks Ashley - that means a lot.  My confidence most def. waivers and I think others in the same boat would agree too :)  Let&#039;s keep motivating each other and living the dream!
@&lt;b&gt;MainlineMom&lt;/b&gt; - Haha I bet!  In a small weird way that also gets me excited to have kids in the near future :)  So I am forced to get up every morning and take care of business!  Both with them, and w/ my own stuff.  I&#039;d totally be a stay at home dad/entrepreneur ;)  Go us!
@&lt;b&gt;Amber, Blonde and Balanced&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Amber, you too!
@&lt;b&gt;MD&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...  I&#039;ve already accepted that drinking on ANY day is just normal now ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; -  And you&#039;re doing a mighty fine job of it too, Trinnie :)  I&#039;m always inspired by how positive and smart you are!  You better send me a pic of baby #2 when he/she arrives :)


@&lt;b&gt;Andi B.&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  Exercise is def. something I&#039;ve been trying to incorporate somehow within my days.  I keep telling myself that as soon as Summer is here I&#039;ll be working out and then hitting the pool for one hour every morning which will DEF add to the awesomeness of self-employment ;)  The hardest part (Winter) is now over!!
@&lt;b&gt;Rafiki&lt;/b&gt; - Sweet!  Share the link with us if you end up writing about it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; -  You&#039;re def. right, I just need to work on it more.  As for job offers, they&#039;ve already been coming in but that goes against me working for myself silly! haha... I&#039;m not considering any of &#039;em until 1 year is officially over - then we&#039;ll adjust if need be ;)  Of course, if Britney Spears asked me to be her assistant then I&#039;d have to scrap my plan. Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Kelsey!  I like it that you&#039;ve been around for so long already - I haven&#039;t scared you away yet!
@&lt;b&gt;CgK&lt;/b&gt; - I know, you&#039;re SO RIGHT but I don&#039;t know how to not feel bad yet?  Was it just time for you or did something happen that snapped you out of it?
@&lt;b&gt;Dani @ OK, Dani&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you do realize that you can get canned and work on your projects too if you really wanted to, right? ;)  And cool you enjoyed the starfish post!  Of course that&#039;s okay!
@&lt;b&gt;Ron&lt;/b&gt; -  It&#039;s not fun, that&#039;s for sure - but at least you&#039;re THINKING about it so it wouldn&#039;t be a surprise if it happened all of a sudden, right?  Do you have a Plan B you&#039;re considering?
@&lt;b&gt;Too Funny&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah that&#039;s the downer of going into a place/restaurant - hard to talk and skype when you need to :(  We also still haven&#039;t met up yet!  Wanna connect soon?
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Look at you go!!  You should post about the 1st day leaving, and then your 3 months update too :)  Would be interesting to see how different or similar your experience is to mine.  Congrats!!!!  You can rock it!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Laura&lt;/b&gt; - Awww congrats!!!  If you ever want to Skype and chat about stuff, give me a shout:  jay_monee -- I love my full-time bloggers :)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah possibly, but that just doesn&#039;t excite me ;)  I love the ladies in my office now, it&#039;s just really getting OUT of my house in a timely manner.


@&lt;b&gt;Debbie Beardsley&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Debbie, I&#039;m working on it that&#039;s for sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kate&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, true dat.
@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That would be slick, actually.
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; -  YAY!  We can both talk about it at the same time :)  You better believe I&#039;ll still be doing this in 9 months so I&#039;m holding you to that!  (now who&#039;s got the pressure? haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;Mike Piper&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks bro, that means a lot.  Things going well for you?
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, my schedule is most def. off.  You&#039;d think I&#039;d have figured it out after 3 months now ;)
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - Ooh that&#039;s a good idea!  Maybe if I get myself to do something more fun and brain-less first thing in the morning I&#039;d get up faster too?  I might have to try that :)  Glad it&#039;s starting to become a blessing for you too!  I remember we both got laid off around the same time.  But now it&#039;s on, baby!
@&lt;b&gt;Money Reasons&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;d love that!  Only thing holding me back actually is my stupid house :(  Can&#039;t sell it, so we&#039;re trying to see if it&#039;s worth renting it anytime soon or not.  But you&#039;re right, that would be the life for sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for sharing Carol :)  Maybe I&#039;ll see you online one of these late nights?  I went to bed at 4 a.m. last night, haha... yay?
@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well you&#039;ll still get updates on my regular financial stuff, just not &quot;working for myself&quot; for a bit ;)  Unless something crazy comes up - which is always a possibility!
@&lt;b&gt;Jon &#124; Free Money Wisdom&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m da man?  no YOU are!  $150k is no joke brotha - you soak that in and keep doing your thang! :)]]></description>

@<b>MainlineMom</b> &#8211; Haha I bet!  In a small weird way that also gets me excited to have kids in the near future :)  So I am forced to get up every morning and take care of business!  Both with them, and w/ my own stuff.  I&#8217;d totally be a stay at home dad/entrepreneur ;)  Go us!<br />
@<b>Amber, Blonde and Balanced</b> &#8211; Thanks Amber, you too!<br />
@<b>MD</b> &#8211; Haha&#8230;  I&#8217;ve already accepted that drinking on ANY day is just normal now ;)<br />
@<b>Trinnie</b> &#8211;  And you&#8217;re doing a mighty fine job of it too, Trinnie :)  I&#8217;m always inspired by how positive and smart you are!  You better send me a pic of baby #2 when he/she arrives :)</p>
<p>@<b>Andi B.</b> &#8211; Yes!  Exercise is def. something I&#8217;ve been trying to incorporate somehow within my days.  I keep telling myself that as soon as Summer is here I&#8217;ll be working out and then hitting the pool for one hour every morning which will DEF add to the awesomeness of self-employment ;)  The hardest part (Winter) is now over!!<br />
@<b>Rafiki</b> &#8211; Sweet!  Share the link with us if you end up writing about it :)<br />
@<b>Investing Newbie</b> &#8211;  You&#8217;re def. right, I just need to work on it more.  As for job offers, they&#8217;ve already been coming in but that goes against me working for myself silly! haha&#8230; I&#8217;m not considering any of &#8217;em until 1 year is officially over &#8211; then we&#8217;ll adjust if need be ;)  Of course, if Britney Spears asked me to be her assistant then I&#8217;d have to scrap my plan. Haha&#8230;<br />
@<b>Kelsey</b> &#8211; Thanks Kelsey!  I like it that you&#8217;ve been around for so long already &#8211; I haven&#8217;t scared you away yet!<br />
@<b>CgK</b> &#8211; I know, you&#8217;re SO RIGHT but I don&#8217;t know how to not feel bad yet?  Was it just time for you or did something happen that snapped you out of it?<br />
@<b>Dani @ OK, Dani</b> &#8211; Haha, you do realize that you can get canned and work on your projects too if you really wanted to, right? ;)  And cool you enjoyed the starfish post!  Of course that&#8217;s okay!<br />
@<b>Ron</b> &#8211;  It&#8217;s not fun, that&#8217;s for sure &#8211; but at least you&#8217;re THINKING about it so it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if it happened all of a sudden, right?  Do you have a Plan B you&#8217;re considering?<br />
@<b>Too Funny</b> &#8211; Yeah that&#8217;s the downer of going into a place/restaurant &#8211; hard to talk and skype when you need to :(  We also still haven&#8217;t met up yet!  Wanna connect soon?<br />
@<b>retirebyforty</b> &#8211; Look at you go!!  You should post about the 1st day leaving, and then your 3 months update too :)  Would be interesting to see how different or similar your experience is to mine.  Congrats!!!!  You can rock it!!!<br />
@<b>Laura</b> &#8211; Awww congrats!!!  If you ever want to Skype and chat about stuff, give me a shout:  jay_monee &#8212; I love my full-time bloggers :)<br />
@<b>Evan</b> &#8211; Yeah possibly, but that just doesn&#8217;t excite me ;)  I love the ladies in my office now, it&#8217;s just really getting OUT of my house in a timely manner.</p>
<p>@<b>Debbie Beardsley</b> &#8211; Thanks Debbie, I&#8217;m working on it that&#8217;s for sure :)<br />
@<b>Kate</b> &#8211; Haha, true dat.<br />
@<b>Philip</b> &#8211; HAH!  That would be slick, actually.<br />
@<b>Crystal</b> &#8211;  YAY!  We can both talk about it at the same time :)  You better believe I&#8217;ll still be doing this in 9 months so I&#8217;m holding you to that!  (now who&#8217;s got the pressure? haha&#8230;)<br />
@<b>Mike Piper</b> &#8211; Thanks bro, that means a lot.  Things going well for you?<br />
@<b>Jenna</b> &#8211; Oh, my schedule is most def. off.  You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have figured it out after 3 months now ;)<br />
@<b>20 and Engaged</b> &#8211; Ooh that&#8217;s a good idea!  Maybe if I get myself to do something more fun and brain-less first thing in the morning I&#8217;d get up faster too?  I might have to try that :)  Glad it&#8217;s starting to become a blessing for you too!  I remember we both got laid off around the same time.  But now it&#8217;s on, baby!<br />
@<b>Money Reasons</b> &#8211; Yeah, I&#8217;d love that!  Only thing holding me back actually is my stupid house :(  Can&#8217;t sell it, so we&#8217;re trying to see if it&#8217;s worth renting it anytime soon or not.  But you&#8217;re right, that would be the life for sure :)<br />
@<b>Carol</b> &#8211; Thanks for sharing Carol :)  Maybe I&#8217;ll see you online one of these late nights?  I went to bed at 4 a.m. last night, haha&#8230; yay?<br />
@<b>Kathryn C</b> &#8211; Haha&#8230; well you&#8217;ll still get updates on my regular financial stuff, just not &#8220;working for myself&#8221; for a bit ;)  Unless something crazy comes up &#8211; which is always a possibility!<br />
@<b>Jon | Free Money Wisdom</b> &#8211; I&#8217;m da man?  no YOU are!  $150k is no joke brotha &#8211; you soak that in and keep doing your thang! :)</p>
