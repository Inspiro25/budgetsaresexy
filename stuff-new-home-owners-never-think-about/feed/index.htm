					<description><![CDATA[General maintenance crap from shoddy workmanship.

Both houses in my family have had shoddy workmanship where they didn&#039;t put the valve properly on the toilet to make it watertight, and it leaked onto the base floor over time, whereby the entire second floor collapsed.

BOTH HOUSES.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had no idea what I was in for when I bought my first house.  Even though I was the property’s first owner, I still ended up paying over $15,000 for repairs during my first three years.  I tried to collect from the builder, but the company filed for bankruptcy so I had no recourse.  I feel like I paid for the place twice at least.

					<description><![CDATA[Circumstances can change and screw it all up even if you think you are prepared. a series of circumstances has led me to having to let go of my house because the city is going to put me in jail if I don&#039;t paint my house. I&#039;m on a fixed income, yet there aren&#039;t any programs to help me. Sounds like a crazy reason to have to leave my home. But all to true.

I used to be a real estate investor. got sick. and now i&#039;m facing being homeless. Everybody should seriously consider all possibilities when deciding to rent or own. 

You made a great point about &quot;being stuck&quot;, as far as it not being easy to pick up and move. What you think is where you want to stay can quickly change.]]></description>
