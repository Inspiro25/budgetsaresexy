					<description><![CDATA[Very cool about the board game publishing job! I built an RPG with some friends from undergrad over the last year as a creative outlet besides studying and it has really been surprisingly fun. You&#039;re right about how wild it is to learn a new community - the gamers are definitely an enthusiastic and welcoming gang.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like fun. I sure wish you and your friend and the other board people you&#039;re working with can get kids off their phones. Or, are these board games on their phones now?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re lucky your friend hired you. If Monopoly comes up as the GOAT of board gaming during an interview, I&#039;m not hiring them.

While the day job pays the mortgage and major bills, my wife and I have enjoyed owning and operating Menagerie Games for the last 6 years after August. Having a place for people to disconnect from their phones and technology is more relevant than ever. We like to think of ourselves as a board game shop, but Magic the Gathering is the majority of sales these days. 

If you&#039;re looking for some good board game conventions check out GenCon in Indianapolis, IN (in August) and Origins in Columbus, OH (sorry just missed this one, it is typically in June).]]></description>

@Liz - sounds about right w/ monopoly &#128514; Either ends with someone getting pissed or (more typically) taking too long and the other one just simply gives up, haha... But for those who finish it gracefully it is joyous!!]]></description>
