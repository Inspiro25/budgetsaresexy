					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I thought we were already friends?
@&lt;b&gt;Jenn @ Paying Myself&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting point.  I&#039;ll agree with you on that :)
@&lt;b&gt;sarah&lt;/b&gt; - People are always so curious cuz they just don&#039;t GET IT!  And really, it&#039;s super easy as you know:  Save more than you spend.  If you can just accomplish that one thing you&#039;ll be able to have many of these options goign forward.  It&#039;s so crazy to me that it doesn&#039;t sink in to people.  And I should clarify &quot;people&quot; here - I say anyone 20 and up.  Before that you get a free pass in my books ;)  And MAJOR points if you are on top of your $hit back then!

@&lt;b&gt;Doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - Haha I like being immature during weekends too :)  I bet our two groups would really get a long!! Actually, I heard talks of a boys weekend up in Philly soon - I&#039;ll keep you posted.  And will save up my money questions for you...
@&lt;b&gt;The Skinny On&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, that&#039;s why you gotta do your all-time best to avoid it! But it&#039;s only natural, we all do it.  I was jealous of this guy&#039;s suit today.  I have no idea what brand it was but I know it was pretty custom!  And it shouldn&#039;t even matter to me since I never WEAR suits?!  Haha... weddings excluded.

@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - I like that! And it&#039;s exactly why most of my friends are now you guys online.  As sad as that sounds ;)  I party with my real life friends, but hang daily with the digital crowd.
@&lt;b&gt;K @ Out Smart Debt&lt;/b&gt; - True, it&#039;s a very natural thing.  Kinda like high school clicks in a way ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man that would blow. Esp if they weren&#039;t understanding when you said no to things.
@&lt;b&gt;Brucebucks&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a great question, and I don&#039;t think I do.  A few that will splurge at the bar on a Friday or Saturday night (like, dropping $200+ each night!!!)  but other than that I don&#039;t hear much of big spending.  Maybe in the traveling department but I&#039;m usually in that group :)
@&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah, that&#039;s always nice.  Game nights are killer!!  Miss doing those...I should get back into them, thx!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently moved to a new city, and am trying to cultivate friendships along a financial spectrum. I&#039;m a saver, and would generally prefer to entertain at home (game night!) or go to low-key bars. However, I also like to go to higher-cost events every once and awhile. I find it helps to have a &quot;roster&quot; of friends interested (and able) to do a variety of activities. Plus, it decreases the chance of feeling pressured to do something above my means (and likewise I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m pressuring others to overspend).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$ do you have friends that are big spenders, so whenever you kick it you tend to spend more money? I wouldn&#039;t get rid of a friend like that but we would probably hangout less often.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tend to hang out with people that are around my same net worth. I don&#039;t do intentionally it just kind of segregates itself. People from a similar background tend to flock together. I hung out with my girlfriends friends who are much more privileged then me and it to tends to happen that they all flock together too. It&#039;s not a bad thing I just think it happens naturally.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally have never chosen or associated myself with any friends due to net worth or salary size. I hang with whomever I have similar things in common with, however sometimes I am guilty of being jealous of those doing a lot better than me. (Buying new electronics and cars and such)  It can really make ya feel like crap sometimes when you are struggling and start comparing yourself to those who are a lot more fortunate.

					<description><![CDATA[My friends don&#039;t talk about these topics that much.  We are too busy being immature on the weekends.

However, we do have our moments, especially when there is something major going on in the world, we get into it.  Politics, the economy, elections, all bring out the views of our friends and we clash... Oh do we clash.

But everyone is pretty close to their chest about money.  I have shared the link to my blog with a few of them and many of them did not take it seriously, maybe they just don&#039;t believe I can talk about money or maybe they just don&#039;t understand it enough? 

I do find that they are willing to share this info in a private setting, just not in front of the group!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great insight! Here&#039;s the trouble I found myself to be having... my husband makes a VERY nice salary. I&#039;ll get to why that matters in a minute. I have been friends with, and still hang out with the same people I did in kindergarten. We have all gone out and done our own thing, college, and back home to start our lives and careers. I started working right out of college at a brokerage firm, and learned a great deal from my experience there. Thus making me the budget savvy person I am today. But since having kids, and my husband finding his niche I have since quit working (indefinitly) and stay home with the kids. Ok, here comes the problem. I would say that we make more then just about all my friends and their spouses. I don&#039;t flaunt it, and I try to to ever be showy or mention things we do, places we go or things we buy because it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I know they don&#039;t have the money we do, and most spend more then they make. It&#039;s very hard for me to handle that. Not that they don&#039;t make money but that I don&#039;t like playing the &quot;keeping up with the Jones&#039; game&quot; with anyone, especially not my friends. I have been friends with these people so long that nothing is off limits and they will ask us money questions, or &quot;how we do it&quot; and I don&#039;t like it. I just try to explain that I am &quot;cheap&quot; and I save and budget, but that never seems like a good enough answer. They don&#039;t understand how we have the house, paid for car, trips, and nice things (if only they knew our savings and retirement accounts).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think any of us choose our friends consciously based on how much money they make - but I think our financial status may act as a filter.
