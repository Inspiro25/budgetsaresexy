Good idea on trying to get family involved!! Not only for their estates to be in order, but also for everyone to know *who* might be able to help them navigate in the event they can&#039;t find any of your trust/will documents... An estate lawyer would be a good point of contact :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, and happy to hear one of the experts is taking as long as I am to get around to it. :)

Can I ask who you went through? We&#039;re considering an estate lawyer on Hood St in West Linn. Also wondering if I can convince my whole family (parents, siblings) to get on board, has anyone had any luck with a group discount? I&#039;m not necessarily looking for a bargain (though it&#039;s not cheap) but trying to lower one more hurdle keeping other family members from looking into it.]]></description>

Oh nice! Yeah, def. cheaper/easier without messing with the trust stuff.. Though wouldn&#039;t you have to then take everything out of it and dissolve somehow?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/i-can-officially-die-now-got-a-will-and-trust/#comment-299290&quot;&gt;Norma&lt;/a&gt;.

Felt better and I had a million questions to ask and sort through :) NO matter who I talked to or what I found researching there seemed to be pros and cons on either sides (lawyer vs app, etc), and since we had the money to do it we felt like it was just best to do it the old fashioned way - especially since it was with someone local to us who we could sit down with face to face and go over things, as well as easily update things in the future. 

If I were just starting out and didn&#039;t have the funds for it (or all the kids, house, biz, etc) I probably would have opted for the cheaper more automated route - which I think is GREAT btw. 1,000x more people will be getting their wills set up because of them and I&#039;m sure the process will only get better over time too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hooray for you Jay! I remember going through the same process when our kids were younger and it was no picnic but so worth the effort. Now that our youngest is no longer a minor, it&#039;s time to dust them off and revisit them. Shouldn&#039;t be as taxing as we don&#039;t need to make provisions for the welfare of the kids.

Reminder to your readers, when your kids become legal age, while they don&#039;t generally need a Will, you should get them to obtain Power of Attorney, Health Care Proxy, and complete a HIPAA release. Without them, when the unexpected happens, it&#039;s so much more difficult to act on their behalf.

Again..congrats to accomplishing such an important milestone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We redid ours last year, all the same stuff except with our grown kids there was no need for any kind of trust.  We just have them listed as contingent beneficiaries on all our accounts so none of the significant assets go to probate and the will has no bearing on where the money goes.  I know that isn’t the case for everybody but I executed my parents estate a few years ago and their trusts didn’t simplify the process at all, in fact they complicated things slightly.    In our case it only cost $500 last year to do all the documents, but without a trust it was simpler so cheaper makes sense.]]></description>
