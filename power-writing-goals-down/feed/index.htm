					<description><![CDATA[Very inspiring, J! I love lists, and I write a lot of goals down. Unfortunately, sometimes I ignore the lists :-). The one thing I believe is that I should be faithful to the things I set out to do, and so I&#039;ve recently started to look through the lists and cross things off. It has been wonderful, and I hope to keep going.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your reader&#039;s email. How inspiring!

I think what&#039;s key about your reader&#039;s story, and Frugal Fringe&#039;s post you linked to above, is constant focus. She developed a very specific list, kept track and had a deadline. What you focus on gets done. Period. 

I love using graphs to track progress and stay focused. I find they help visually. I first started using them for personal goals when I read &quot;Your Money Or Your Life&quot;. In fact, I&#039;m starting a one-month decluttering challenge tomorrow and will be tracking my progress daily. If the trend lines are not going the way they&#039;re supposed to, I know I&#039;m in trouble and I&#039;d better shape up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I strongly believe in writing goals down or having something visual as a reminder in a prominent place. We are saving up for a plot of woodland and have a picture of woodland on our wall given to us my sister-in-law as a reminder of our goal. It really works. We look at it every day. When one of us is tempted by festival tickets or holidays  the other points to the picture and suddenly the ‘want’ for other things slips away :)

					<description><![CDATA[These comments are awesome.

In addition to just writing down my goals, I post a picture on my refrigerator. I&#039;m a visual person, so that picture (of the beach) helps.

I love the password trick as well.

My passwords include positive affirmations. Think: urWORTHY, urSMART, urLOVED.  My friends think this is crazy, but it&#039;s a good way to remind yourself to stay positive throughout the day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this. I need to write &quot;Pay off student loans&quot; on like 100 sticky notes and put them EVERYWHERE. I&#039;m talkin&#039; computer screen, back of smartphone, toilet seat, baby&#039;s head....EVERYWHERE.

Thanks for the inspiration :)]]></description>
