					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently using a 2006 version of Quicken (and excel) to do all of my budgeting and account reconciliations. I&#039;m having a major issue though bc I just spent a bunch of money on things for our upcoming wedding, but my computer&#039;s video card just had 3 capacitors on it blow.  I&#039;m computerless and hence budgetless until I get a new video card.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right now, I budget using a combination of mint &#038; pocket smith.  I&#039;ve had a free pocket smith account for a while now, but have currently run out of &quot;budget events&quot; but the ones that I have set, I&#039;ve exported to my google calendar so I wont forget any of them.  It helps a lot, and I&#039;ve been thinking of upgrading to a paid pocketsmith account.  This would be even better, because it&#039;d be free.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I actually think it&#039;s awesome some of you are still doing it old-school w/ the pen and paper :)  While it&#039;s def. annoying and/or hard to maintain sometimes, there&#039;s still something about it that really gets in your brain.  At least when I was doing it.  Being able to see it there on paper in physical form tends to let the numbers sink in more.  That all being said though, there are plenty of other ways to get the job done too :)  Gotta keep trying things out till one sticks!]]></description>
