Hi Joe, you expect only real returns of 5% per year over a several decade time frame?  I already accounted for 2% inflation in those calculations against 10% annual returns for a 100% stock portfolio yielding an 8% real return.  I then wrote another article comparing if this exact strategy had been put in place at different points in history.   https://actionecon.com/gifting-an-inheritance-at-birth/ . No one can fully predict exactly what the stock market, or inflation will be over super long periods of time, but historically we are doing well over 5% in real returns.   Of course it could be even worse than your calculation and 65 years from now the dollar could have fully collapsed and be worth nothing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[65 years of inflation at 3%,  1.03^65 = 6.83X 

and $1M/6.83 = $146K in today&#039;s dollars. X 4%/ yr is $5856.

Not a bad perk for gramp&#039;s single deposit. But not a &#039;retirement&#039;. Nice try though.]]></description>

The point of deleting your social accounts is to step away from getting sucked into it all or being influenced by it - it&#039;s not a *marketing* play ;) In fact, it&#039;s an opposite marketing play for those who have blogs/etc!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[to me, it would seem totally against the grain if a person delete social media accounts, simply because there&#039;s all kinds of third-party automated posting tools to share content to multiple social platforms, resulting in a significant increase in traffic two published content. Your thoughts on this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The wife and McMansion post is positively adorable.
(I&#039;m like Megan wishing, my partner would get it as well... he&#039;s gotten into flowers lately. For Valentine&#039;s day he bought me a fliwer plant. I have no idea what it is, what it needs to live and even when it will bloom, and given I could probably kill a plastic plant... poor thing.)]]></description>

Glad you liked it!

Reminds me of another fun fact about $100 bills - that one out of every 2 or 3 contains traces of cocaine :)
