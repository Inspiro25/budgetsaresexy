					<description><![CDATA[Trying to be that shining light in someone else&#039;s life can be very gratifying not only to help them out, but to make us feel more fulfilled as well! I love helping people out, answering questions, and pointing people in a direction that will lead them further on their journey in a positive way!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Right?
@&lt;b&gt;Tea&lt;/b&gt; - Wow. That is really unfortunate, I&#039;m sorry to hear :(  You&#039;re totally right though - we gotta be careful in the ways we approach this money stuff w/ others. People are SO different once the topic changes to that.  Thanks for reminding us to tread lightly :)
@&lt;b&gt;Steph&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  Paying it forward is an *excellent* way to thank them, I love it.
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Hooray!  Glad you enjoyed it as much as I did :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - COOL!  That is a great reminder Trinnie, you never stop impressing me ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jon &#124; Free Money Wisdom&lt;/b&gt; - Of course!  You all are my family :)  We&#039;re all in this together my man.
@&lt;b&gt;Rafiki&lt;/b&gt; - :)
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  And you know what?  It can literally take 30 seconds to help someone too.  It&#039;s not that hard ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jason L&lt;/b&gt; - Great reminder Jason, even just a few dollars helps out.
@&lt;b&gt;Momma Star&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for reading my blog :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward 22&lt;/b&gt; - Hahhahahaa.... your kid is awesome.  Watch him grow up to be like the #1 specialist in starfish now ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Would be cool to meet the author of it one day, wouldn&#039;t it?  If you&#039;re reading this Loren Eisley, let me buy you a coffee!]]></description>
