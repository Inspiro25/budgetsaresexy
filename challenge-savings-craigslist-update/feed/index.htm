Hah - yeah, she only buys what we need. Which is why it takes us forever to get the ebate checks :)

I tell all the interesting stories w/ CL meetups each time I do one of these reviews. Nothing too crazy has happened outside of this last guy that gave me a quick scare. It is fun to ask them why they&#039;re picking up each of the items though, as sometimes there&#039;s an interesting back story and makes you feel good about selling to them. I&#039;ve mainly had all positive experiences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude is that a Sean Taylor jersey? #RIP

That must have been tough to let go of. I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;m a little skittish when it comes to selling on Craigslist. I&#039;m worried I&#039;ll get some totally sketchy dude showing up at my house. Seems like you&#039;ve had pretty good experiences though. You should totally do a story about any of the weird experiences you&#039;ve had with Craigslist-folk though.

Anyways, congrats on a strong month. I forgot about eBates - I think I have $1.57 pending in my account. Does your wife buy stuff she normally would anyways, but uses eBates? Or does she buy stuff just to get the cash back? I found myself doing the latter - I was so determined to get a rebate check I was buying crap I didn&#039;t even need, lol.]]></description>

haha, you are too much over there - I love it.

I found a ton of frames w/ pics in them too in my basement last month and didn&#039;t know what to do with them cuz didn&#039;t want to get rid of them all but they also take up so much room! Then it just hit me - &quot;take out the pics, you dummy, and put them in an album!&quot; So that&#039;s what I&#039;m doing now :) Takes up much less space and now can sell/get rid of the frames!

Funny about your $2 bill too. It&#039;s a commonly thought thing though, so don&#039;t worry about it :) A lot of people don&#039;t even know they&#039;re real currency and can be used to buy stuff! Every now and then you hear stories of people getting the cops called on them when they go to use them at the supermarket, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[UPDATE: I tore into the garage searching for items to sell. Lo &#038; behold...hiding in a corner, a set of 3 trunks I can sell. Ah, but what about the treasures hidden inside those trunks? Old family pics, the hard copy type before we had computers &#038; printers....oh my, look how young we all were, LOL. Value? worthless but priceless, LOL then a bag of jewelry I never use. Will check a pawn shop as to value. But wait, folded up in the bottom of the bag is a $2 bill I saved from 1995 just knowing it would increase in value. Surely by now, 20 years later it will be worth a cool $4? So I googled it. No such luck. It&#039;s worth $2, LOL so much for that pipe dream but I added the $2 to my new savings jar! And I found more treasures (cough cough) to sell on C/L. Had to add the 11 cents I found in the parking lot of Aldi too! Thanx again for all the ideas J$]]></description>

Hah! I would have saved them for you :)

We have something similar to your mortgage stuff called PMI - private mortgage insurance. Also for stuff over 80%. I don&#039;t know how but we ended up with two mortgages when we bought 8 years ago - one for 80% and one for 20%. Also with no money down at all. Which is probably how we all got in trouble here w/ the housing crash, ugh...

Anyways, I like your $10,000 plan :) And that you look for stuff to flip from garage sales too! Those are fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI J Money!

We are doing exactly this at the moment with a good declutter and hustle. I picked up an oil painting at a garage sale 12 months ago for $5 and kept listing it on ebay with no success until last week when I sold it for $40!  When I saw it at the garage sale i just knew that it would be harder to move but i also knew i could get a lot more for it when i did. We are doing the savings goal backwards. Our first goal is ten thousand to sink into our mortgage to get out of something we have in Australia called Lenders Mortgage insurance. If your house is mortgaged at more than 80% of its bank value you have to pay the LMI on top. We only need to put $10,000 now in mortgage to be out of that. I set the goal of $10,000 and then each time i sell something i subtract the profit. It&#039;s been a less overwhelming way to do it and I love seeing the balance drop!
PS I think those Jordans are awesome :) I think ill have to keep my eye out for some for the other half&#039;s birthday next year!]]></description>

Work it, Debbi! That&#039;s awesome! :)

@Zina - you&#039;re absolutely right - it&#039;s a perfect time to reevaluate stuff and start fresh somewhere else. Moving is one of my all-time fave things :) I wish you nothing but a smooth - and exciting - transition!]]></description>

Yeah - that&#039;s the main drawback. Have to buy a new phone (or a used one that&#039;s compatible online) but then you don&#039;t have any contracts or anything to worry about which helps the sting a little :) Unfort. iPhones don&#039;t work with them, but you can try Ting Wireless? They rock &#039;em and have similar budget conscious plans.]]></description>

I listed 2 items on C/L 2 months ago. No bites. This post motivated me to relist them &#038; I immediately heard from someone wanting to meet today. Bye Bye Christmas Sleigh, LOL not many buy Xmas stuff in the summer but C/L is free so it doesn&#039;t hurt to try. Now if only I could sell my husband&#039;s pre-historic golf clubs! Will dig out more junk...I mean, treasures...out of the attic/garage this weekend to list on C/L. Thanx for the inspiration J$.]]></description>
