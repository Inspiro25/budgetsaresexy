					<description><![CDATA[Awesome story! I heard your interview on ChooseFI and found you so inspiring. I&#039;m so glad you found your way through prison and have come out even better on the other side. You&#039;re correct that drugs have ravaged nearly every part of our American lives. They&#039;ve destroyed parts of my life, but those experiences have made me who I am today. Without them, I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d be on the path I&#039;m on. Not that I condone drugs, but I&#039;m just saying that sometimes something good can come out of something horrible.

Anyway, I hope this is allowed, but I included your interview on my favorite FIRE content of 2019. I&#039;m sorry I missed this post last year.

					<description><![CDATA[This story is amazing.  Thank you so much for sharing it; I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m so late in the game picking up on it.  I am so happy that you were able to put your mind in the right place and let nothing stop you.  As a public defender, I fight very hard to try to stop situations like yours from occurring.  As you can guess, I absolutely agree with you that prisons serve no purpose for the drug epidemic.  I just really love that you fought for yourself and are achieving your dreams.  Please keep writing about your journey and advice for others on how to reach for financial independence.  I will share your story with clients who feel like they have no hope.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[THanks David.  This comment means alot to me, because you&#039;ve been there, and you know how tough it is to fight back against a system that really doesn&#039;t care about your well being at all.  I feel truly blessed to be one of the ones who fought back against it and am free to make something of my life now.  Your compliment means a great deal to me.  When I was alone, I was motivated by thinking one day smart people would give me credit and compliments for all of my hard work, rather than looking down their noses at me.  Your comment shows me that my dreams are coming true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From a criminal defense attorney, former public defender, and FI fan, congratulations. 

So many kids never learn. The system couldn&#039;t care less about them, either. But some survive and eventually thrive by their own sheer will and smarts. I&#039;ve had a few go on to be responsible, successful people. And I&#039;ve had many more come back over and over again. 

Thanks for your story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well. thanks Mr. Groovy!  I&#039;d love it if you shared this article with the Mrs Groovy, as she was one of the first followers of our blog.  I am sure I&#039;ll eventually start sharing more of my experiences on my blog, but I have always been a little nervous about doing it before because of how it may reflect on my business.  (Even though some of my clients may even have MORE respect for me because of it)  But as I save more money, I am becoming less fearful of just being myself, because if someone doesn&#039;t like me because of the hand I was dealt in life, who cares!  I probably don&#039;t want them as my friend anyway. 

How do we end the drug problem?  That&#039;s a tough one.  Prison is a joke, and is probably why prison is just a revolving door for people who can&#039;t, or won&#039;t, figure life out.  My experience in prison was that they threw me in there for 10 years, and basically said good luck and we&#039;ll see you again when you&#039;re release date comes up.  I am not sure how that is supposed to help non-scary people like myself.  I mean, I&#039;ve never intentionally hurt anyone in my life!!  I have no idea on how incarcerating me for that length of time was beneficial for society in any way.   I suppose prison does have it&#039;s place for sadistic killers and rapists, who need to be in cages, but most drug-offenders aren&#039;t evil people.  They&#039;re our brothers, uncles, fathers, sons, mothers, and sisters who just got caught up in some bad stuff they probably regret. 

Personally, I am not a fan of drug legalization, as people who have a problem will have a problem with any substance no matter its potency.  It&#039;s like telling an alcoholic they can only drink beer instead of whisky.  Trust me, they&#039;ll just find a way to drink more beer because they don&#039;t have the off switch in their brain like everyone else. 

I&#039;ll really need time to think about how to solve the problem as a whole, because the only thing that really worked for me was just my discovery and dedication to my personal responsibility to change my life.  I wanted a better life.  I wanted to live.  I wanted to stay out of prison.  I wanted a better future for my family.  It wasn&#039;t until I wanted these things, that I was willing to change everything in my mind that led me into that mess.  

I think you have to give each person the choice: If they want help, they should be given help.  But if they don&#039;t want help, they will destroy themselves and their lives until they are dead no matter what help you give them.  There is nothing you can really do for people who don&#039;t want to change or get help.   

Ultimately, the truth is, that change is hard work.  And unfortunately, not everyone wants to work hard. But there are those people, like me, who want and are willing to do anything they can for a second chance.  Unfortunately, a lot of them, like me, are stuck in prison for years on end with absolutely no way to get out of there until their release date finally comes up.  It&#039;s a very sad story for everyone involved.  I&#039;m just grateful that it&#039;s over for me now. My mission now is focused on more preventative work, where I hopefully can show people that you can live a better life by choosing to work hard for your dreams, rather than going down the easy path of paying $5 for a hit of drugs to at least feel like you&#039;re in control of your life, when in reality your life is rotting away.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-survived-prison-accidentally-found-path-to-wealth/#comment-258521&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Andy, THANK YOU for being open, real, and honest and sharing your story with me.  It is helpful because it helps me realize that I am not alone in this world, and other people also have had to deal with significant challenges that they have had to overcome.  Drugs, even prescribed ones, can be a very deceiving substance in our lives and bodies, and like you, I am grateful I no longer have to deal with that nightmare. I am grateful to hear, that like me, you have been victorious over your challenges and gotten your life back on track.  Index funds worth half a mill???  What an awesome personal feat and testimony!  I bet you realize this life-truth as clearly as I do now:  Money is great, but it isn&#039;t nearly as great as the value of our health and freedom. 

I&#039;ll echo J$&#039;s comment:  Just start writing, and learn what you want to sound like through trial and error.  Your above comment communicated very clearly to me, so don&#039;t stress that it&#039;s not perfect.  Heck, I&#039;ve written thousands of pages, and I still write blog posts that I can barely look at because I think they are terrible writing!!!!  But you know what, at least I wrote something and I usually publish them anyway, because at least I did something, and my motto is that doing something terribly is better than the 95% of people who do nothing at all.  Just try.  You have nothing to lose.  You&#039;re already a winner. You can do it, friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Billy,

A very inspiring story.  I got sick from taking a controlled substance as prescribed for a very short amount of time.  A benzodiazapene.  I was sick for over two years bed, house and couch ridden.  I am finally mostly recovered.  I had to quit my job and I was judged by some friends and professionals because drug withdrawal comes with a stigma.  My true friends and family supported me during my recovery.  I started out blaming everyone.  Over time I practiced acceptance.  The Power of Now by Eckhardt Tolle helped me through the acceptance process.  I had to be patient and let my body heal.  Prior to this my wife and I saved 50% of our income into index funds but we were still big spenders.  While I was sick we had to live on one income.  We learned how  easy it was and came to conclusion that we have &quot;enough&quot; and have a networth over a half million and still growing at the young age of 39 and 41.  We now embrace simplicity and minimalism.  Sometimes suffering can bring positive changes to people.  Thanks for sharing your story.  I hope to blog about my journey someday.  I just need to practice my writing skills.]]></description>
