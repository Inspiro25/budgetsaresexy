					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the laugh.  I think a lot of people talk about personal finance and side hustles with such a serious tone that we forget to have fun.  Not spending every minute of your day slogging through activities designed solely to bring in money is important.  I have a few side projects I do for the joy of doing them and, every now and then, they result in profit too...but sometimes they don&#039;t, and that&#039;s okay.  Everyone needs a good laugh now and then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seemed like #5 branched into bad singing voices :P. 

I&#039;ll say that Carrie&#039;s episode definitely made me want to immediately launch into a voice acting career. Fun fact, I actually did some voice acting as a kid for radio commercials in both the US and when I lived in Japan. My voice is probably still coming out of some pachinko machines...]]></description>

Good! Go for it! It doesn&#039;t have to be perfect (or close to perfect) either. Just put yourself out there and learn and tweak as you go. Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rule #5 &quot;Don&#039;t waste good&quot; NCIS. Mine would be more, &quot;You can&#039;t waste good&quot; I have more projects in my &quot;vault of shame&quot; than I will ever own up to. But none of it is wasted. With every failure, I grew, developed skills, and learned something. If we limit ourselves to things that are a guaranteed win, we miss out on most of the good things we earn through failure. And if the failure can be fun and entertaining, all the better!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I needed this laugh!  This was hilarious and well, for lack of a better term, genius. You never really know who wants what until you put it out there and I&#039;ve been struggling with this a bit myself. You&#039;ve just inspired me to simply stop moping and go ahead and ask the questions that I need answers to...thanks!]]></description>

Oh man, accents are HUGE in the industry from what I hear! If you love voice over stuff and are good at it (disregard this nonsense here, haha...) it could really be something profitable - and fun - for you :)

Check out our serious guest post on it and see!
