					<description><![CDATA[Your post is amazing. I have started early in my 22 years. I have some savings and investments. It is growing a little bit. Each and every month I am investing on stocks. While starting it looks like too small. But now I have a little bit higher amount. I am also increasing multiple streams of income one by one. Thank you so much for this blog post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really a powerful story! Since there are no 401k plans in Germany, I haven&#039;t really had any contact with them yet. But one thing is always the same everywhere: If you start early, you will have more of it ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Low fees are very important. The other SUPER important 401k rule is be involved.  While contributing 10% I missed a notice of investment changes and my balance and future contributions rolled in to a cash account with basically zero growth for a long time.  I&#039;m contributing 16% now, but it doesn&#039;t make up for the lost compounding time.

Everytime I think about that mistake i sigh knowing I&#039;ll be working until I&#039;m 60 when I could be retired now!]]></description>

Haha... all that matters is that you&#039;re here now and making moves! Keep inching those %&#039;s as time goes on and you&#039;ll be sitting pretty :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the advice sir. I was thinking about when I get a raise put 2% in my pocket and invest the other 1% in my 401k and capping it at 10% with a 6% match from my company; this totaling 16% annually! Thanks to your update I realize that I’m getting older and should be more aggressive. Going forward I will do 2% in 401k and keep the remaining 1% in my pocket. God I wish I knew about you guys when I was 18 years old. I’d be a decamillionaire by now! lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This advice is GREAT! The first year out of college I definitely lived above my means. I had never seen that much money in my life, and all I knew what to do was either put it in a simple savings account or spend it.

Fast forward 3 years and my fiancée and I now contribute the MAX to my Roth 401(k) and our Roth IRA&#039;s so that we can learn at a young age how to truly live below our means. The crazy thing is that even after maxing out our retirement accounts, I still feel like we live a good life and have a great time! When you never see the money, you don&#039;t ever worry about it. Then it&#039;s always nice to check your retirement accounts at the end of the year and see how compound interest took affect:)]]></description>
