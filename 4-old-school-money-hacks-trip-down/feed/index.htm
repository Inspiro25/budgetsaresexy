					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s somewhat similar to the pay phone thing - Coinstar and similar coin machines will often reject a few coins, but people tend not to check. So there&#039;s a little coin slot that will sometimes have coins in them. Common rejected coins are foreign coins and coins worth more than 25 cents (e,g, half dollars and dollar coins).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny, when I mention pay phones to my kids they give me a blank stare.  Such a foreign concept to them.  But I wish I could do the Brady Bunch thing with the pay phone in the house rather than paying the cell phone bill every month!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always make it point to view my surrounding for even a coin on the ground...and I never worry if it heads up or heads down. You&#039;d be surprised how many people won&#039;t pick up a penny or a dime off the ground. I still live by the saying, &#034;A penny on the ground is mine once it&#039;s found.&#034; &lt;br /&gt;Some people still call collect. Unfortunately, they are in jail.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite coin finder used to be the cup that my husband would leave by the bedside, of course, just for me.]]></description>
