Or don&#039;t have kids :) 

Love the idea on banking the extra money saved! That&#039;s brilliant. I&#039;d even take it a step farther and dump it into investments every quarter or year so it keeps growing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[PS:  When I go to Wal-Mart and am aware I saved a certain amount of money, i.e., 50 cents on pet food or $1 on juice, I write a check over the amount and put it in my savings.  It&#039;s usually about $10 a week.  I consider cheap dinners (salad and grilled cheese or ravioli with $1 sauce) while there, also.  You can get by spending about $60 a week on groceries if you&#039;re flexible and don&#039;t eat much meat.]]></description>

We have saved over $11,000 in coins (bank has a free coin changer, too).  I force people to give me change, and I also ask for rolls at grocery stores every so often.  I also throw small bills in a large plastic container.  Savings accounts (unless long-term) don&#039;t work for me as we dip into them.]]></description>

Rock on - look at you go! And you even have a mission for all that $$$, love it :) Just don&#039;t forget to save/invest some for the future! So you can retire early and have even MORE fun in the States and everywhere else your travels lead you :) Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a hell of a lot for this. I did every step apart from the de - clutter.  I am from the UK and I have saved enough to pay for my flights and stay and leisure in the USA next may 2016. I have saved just over 4200 pounds by putting away spare change doing the 52 week challenge but I also got rid of all my guilty pleasures and used that money to save into my parents account. I am going to do it again for another year and have double the fun when I get to the states. Can&#039;t wait. Thanks a million]]></description>

This would be a nightmare for me.

I absolutely hate carrying change of any sort.

That&#039;s why I save it because I cannot stand having it on my person at any time so I offload it immediately into a jar etc.

You have paper and then you have heavy metal objects taking up too much space that have no organization in your pocket that take forever to find what you&#039;re looking for and then counting it out takes 10x as long as flipping through organized paper all in order.

No thanks from an American.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love all of these, and have tried most of them (selling 365 things from a bachelor pad would leave me itemless!). My best way is just figuring out an amount to live on, and direct depositing the remainder into savings. Raises, bonuses, and other windfalls just pile up in there!]]></description>
