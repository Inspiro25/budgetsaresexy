True that. I use my credit card for everything just in case, though I&#039;d still be worried to give it over to someone who may be shady. I&#039;d just use cash in that case, which I&#039;m sure they&#039;d much prefer to take anyways. At least w/ furniture stuff - no way I&#039;m buying meat out of a truck still!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a real business, they load furniture in NC and sell it door-to-door all over the country. If you see something you like but are worried about it, just make sure you pay by credit card, your credit card company will look out for you. Don&#039;t pay by debit card, your bank will NOT look out for you. Also ask to see their permits, there should be state and local permits. You can call the city hall or police department to make sure they are cleared for business. 

Here is some more info from the internet: http://furnituretrucks.blogspot.com/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Mikayla&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, that&#039;s a good remeinder for sure - we gotta be better about calling the police when something strange is going on! I&#039;m not sure this specific case would get me to do it since it never even crossed my mind, haha, but in other instances yes - def. good to specificy who will be calling/etc... hope you&#039;re having a drama-free weekend over there! :)
@&lt;b&gt;stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Well that&#039;s a happy ending :)
@&lt;b&gt;Money Madwoman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well it&#039;s sure not gonna be meat from a truck outside my house, that&#039;s for sure ;)  I&#039;m glad y&#039;all got some good deals though!

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! I had no idea everyone was so freaked out by the meat salesmen! I have purchased meat not once, but twice from these traveling meat salesmen. It was darn tasty! 

Ok, ok, so the first time was my house but my father-in-law was visiting and he actually negotiated the meat price and purchased it. However, having seen him in action I used his bargaining tactics to negotiate my own smokin&#039; cash deal (around half his asking price)when a guy came rolling through a couple years later. I still have an extra $20 box of Chicken Cordon Bleu in my freezer that the guy talked me into at the last minute.  

You guys worry to much! We&#039;ve all gotta die from something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once was offered the chance to buy brand new stereo equipment out of the back of a beat up Pontiac in a 711 parking lot (bet i know what ur thinking, because I was to). We called the cops and after the smoke cleared, it turned out the guy had a bill of sale for everything and was just trying get rid of it!!! Yep, 20 years later and speakers still work great LOL. Sometimes it is what it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J$ - I&#039;m assuming (dangerous I know) that these guys are talking about the Schwans type meat trucks... think ice cream man/dairy delivery truck but instead, he has frozen vac packed meat and fish portioned, skinned/boned, or marinated and ready to cook or refreeze...at an outrageous price of course... but when they make a delivery they hit up others in the neighborhood with an approved lower price for door to door sales, of which the driver gets a kickback...I would love to have been in your brain (esp since you are also a BAU fan) to see what hideous thing you were thinking it was!!!  Like meat just hanging on a hook in the back and you could come shave your own shank hahaha
And as far as the police... you may have heard of the psych term &quot;diffusion of responsibility&quot; where a group of people witness an event and assume someone else will do something about it (the murder of Kitty Genovese) or if you have ever taken a CPR class they remind you to point to someone specifically and say &quot;YOU call 9-1-1&quot; don&#039;t just say &quot;someone call&quot; cuz it might not happen in a group due to that bystander effect... just sayin it&#039;s prob nothing, but how bad would you feel if it was some new home invasion scheme you read about later? Officer such and such might tell you they&#039;ve been looking for them!! you could be a hero!!!! or most likely they&#039;ll put you on hold so long you get distracted and hang up but HEY you tried...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You guys bring up a ton of great points!  And who knew about all those *meat* trucks??? So weird!!

@&lt;b&gt;Gerard&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s true... guess we&#039;ll never know :(
@&lt;b&gt;Lance@MoneyLife&amp;More&lt;/b&gt; - Cursed you out??? Haha... wow.  That&#039;s messed up man.  It reminds me of the time someone came up to me thinking I was a drug dealer and asked to buy some weed.  I told him he&#039;s mistaken and he got all pissy and told me to F*ck off.  And the funniest part about it? I was literally with my MOM when he came up to me!!! Haha... she probably thought I was hiding something from her! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenny&lt;/b&gt; - Meat??? Hahhahaa... freaky!!
@&lt;b&gt;Jon B&lt;/b&gt; - Ohhhhh, yeah - didn&#039;t even think about that!  Could have totally been a sting operation!
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - What if he was hot and young? (he wasn&#039;t in this case, but would that change anything? :))
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Woah!  Hardcore! Haha... I wonder if anyone in my inlaw&#039;s neighborhood did call?
@&lt;b&gt;CrystalH&lt;/b&gt; - Y&#039;all are feisty! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Eunice&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... a lawn mower??? At 9 at night? What the.
@&lt;b&gt;Daydream Kate&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhh!! SCARY!!!  I didn&#039;t even think of that kinda stuff :(  A great reminder to always be aware of what&#039;s going on!
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I&#039;d love to see that post too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kandace&lt;/b&gt; - I can&#039;t believe so many of y&#039;all have these weird meat trucks? I have never EVER heard of such a thing and it totally freaks me out!  How do you even know it&#039;s safe to eat, even if you like the bargain?
@&lt;b&gt;AV&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.... an entrepreneur at heart, I see :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Man, I wonder if that was really this guy&#039;s ploy?  It&#039;s totally a good rouse since they WOULD have to get into your house to deliver it, it never crossed my mind at all! :(
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow!  That&#039;s a great idea to ask for one in the future, would certainly help ease more of the concerns... did you get a great deal I take it on the furniture?
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - I know, so scary!! You guys are much more careful than I am as I wasn&#039;t even thinking of the R word at all when I first heard of this :(
@&lt;b&gt;20&#039;s Finances&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! I doubt they&#039;d give you all that info though ;) Or at least the *correct* stuff!
@&lt;b&gt;Bryan&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s def. a weird situation, that&#039;s for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;Cecil&lt;/b&gt; - I think I&#039;ve seen those trucks and lots before - I used to live in the Fairfax area :)  Forgot about &#039;em!
@&lt;b&gt;Mo&#039; Money Mo&#039; Houses&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh there you go!  Good point! Though I know a lot of older people aren&#039;t that familiar with CL and/or the internet either, but who knows.
@&lt;b&gt;Carrie&lt;/b&gt; - This meat thing is SO WEIRD!! You&#039;re like the 4th person today to mention that, bleh.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - My thought exactly :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahahahaa... now THAT is awesome :)  I think your dad and I would get along famously.
@&lt;b&gt;Craig&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, really?? It would def. make you feel safer, that&#039;s for sure, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Mac&lt;/b&gt; - AMEN!!!  Very well put my friend, very well put.
@&lt;b&gt;Mikayla&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;or if you have a box of Samoas…&quot; Hahaha... you better hope these big burley men don&#039;t figure you and all the other ladies out w/ these cookie ideas ;)  y&#039;all would be lured out in a heartbeat!  (AND I LOVE CRIMINAL MINDS!!!  Would be awesome if they did one on this topic ;)  My mom did not end up calling the police (she called me instead), but it never even crossed my mind either... prob. a good idea just to be on the safe side)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Craig - you scare me a little bit, BUT in this case I&#039;m glad you have my back because ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING ME!?! &quot;would you like to see the furniture in my truck?&quot; come on people that&#039;s right up there with &quot;hey little girl want some candy?&quot; and &quot;does this smell like chloroform to you?&quot;
 I know this is a financial blog so we are sticking to the &quot;would you take the deal&quot; aspect, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see this on a Criminal Minds episode... How is anyone still conversing about whether or not it is stolen and no one has since asked... J money, did your mom call the cops?!? 
side note: I never answer the door for someone I don&#039;t know unless I&#039;m sure I can either overpower them and get the door closed again or outrun them... or if you have a box of Samoas... curse you and your gooey goodness!

@Michelle, Daydream Kate, Eunice, LB, and Kelsey - glad you listened to the stranger danger PSAs ;)

@J$ RE: &quot;friends&quot;... keep blogging worth posting ;)]]></description>

side note: I never answer the door for someone I don&#8217;t know unless I&#8217;m sure I can either overpower them and get the door closed again or outrun them&#8230; or if you have a box of Samoas&#8230; curse you and your gooey goodness!</p>
<p>@Michelle, Daydream Kate, Eunice, LB, and Kelsey &#8211; glad you listened to the stranger danger PSAs ;)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[hmmmm, I&#039;ve heard a lot of great ways to save on purchases, but sketchy vans isn&#039;t standard advice!

If I could feel out the situation and tell there were stolen goods involved, I think I&#039;d have to call the police. That option might be disappointing for the adventurous types. I think part of the benefit of budgeting and making wise financial decisions is that you don&#039;t have to take advantage of these situations in order to feel good about your finances.]]></description>
