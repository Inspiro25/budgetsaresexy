People did it to me when I was a server back in the day. I remember someone&#039;s bill once was $100 one night, and they gave me a $100 tip on top when they paid. It absolutely changed my life.

It&#039;s less about the money. More about paying it forward to others and changing their day. :)]]></description>

Glad to hear you&#039;re letting loose a bit and enjoying the money you spend. I still look at price tags, but since there&#039;s usually budget to spend - I spent it anyway! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Price is what you pay and value is what you get. I&#039;m slowly loosening the wallet a little bit and spending more on things without really caring or looking at the price tag and it&#039;s been such a liberating feeling.

Congrats! Good to hear. 

When I had a Prime membership i felt an obligation to buy everything on Amazon... to make the most of my subscription. Turns out many other places offer cheap goods online, and usually fast/free shipping.

I&#039;ve also noticed that even when I buy on Amazon and select 5 day shipping (or whatever is free) I usually get my stuff in 2 days anyway. If it&#039;s in their warehouse, it&#039;s in AMZ&#039;s best interest to ship as fast as possible anyway. It&#039;s not like they hold onto the order longer or use a slower shipping method... Most of my stuff comes faster and i don&#039;t have to pay for it.]]></description>

Rum/Whisky sounds so fun!  That&#039;s a cool thing to look forward to each month.

I think many people are a little negative about their budget or feel &quot;guilty&quot; all the time for messing up things. But we should remember that WE MAKE the budget... So we can put whatever reasonable things in there that bring us true joy. Glad you figured this out and enjoy the process more :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joel, thanks for such a good read. I found that I had to shift my thoughts on budgets later in life. I was being too restrictive and not adding any fun to the process. So, when I wasn’t having fun and it was too restrictive, I just threw it out the window.

It wasn’t till later I found that part of life is finding those valued items or entertainment to make the journey worthwhile!

What do I spend my money on that makes me happy? Once a month I like to spoil myself to a nice bottle of rum or whisky, to sit down and relax with.]]></description>
