I know, right? I&#039;ve only been paying attention to money for like 6 years - had I done so the previous 20-30 I&#039;d be on the beach by now! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey! I hand-washed all our laundry -- including baby clothes and cloth diapers -- for about 16 months when I was a broke single mom.
I *made* time for it -- because I had no other options. :-(  
That said, I&#039;m glad you and Mrs. J$ don&#039;t have to do this because yep, it&#039;s pretty tiring and your hands smell like Clorox all the time. (Could be worse, though, given what the CLOROX was taking care of...eeewwww.....)
P.S. I still don&#039;t use the dishwasher. My partner makes sure we run it at least once a month because moving parts. If it weren&#039;t for him, I&#039;d never touch the thing. When I lived in Seattle I used the dishwasher for canning-jar storage. Yep, I&#039;m old-school. Or maybe just old.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Stay with extended family
2.  LiLo.  All day long.
3. No dishwasher.  Washing dishes by hand is totally Zen.
4. Dropped off with a kiss.  Ain&#039;t nobody got time to walk a mile!

But this is seriously awesome.  I can only imagine the sexiness I would be throwing off left and right if I had known then what I do now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hum...DECISIONS!  
I&#039;ll skip Spring Break, no way no how could I stand vacationing with the whole extended family. For starters, we could fill up a whole cruise ship with family alone and the fun to annoying ratio is just way too low. 
I love doing laundry (hi, I&#039;m a freak) but I have this feeling that I could totally reform LiLo during a month with her.  Or she would drive me insane but I would have gone nutters trying to fight the good fight!  
We have a dishwasher but we still wash by hand since we have fewer dishes than laundry; add a hypothetical baby in that hypothetical mix and heck NO I wouldn&#039;t choose a broken washer. 
I miss my mama, she could drop me off every morning no problem. Heck, I had my dad drop me off at the train station every day for FIVE YEARS after college, so I didn&#039;t have to buy him a second car, he&#039;d just use mine during the day.  Merit Points Please!]]></description>
