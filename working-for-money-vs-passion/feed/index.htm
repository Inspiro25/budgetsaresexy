					<description><![CDATA[I dream of being on Broadway, but the day to day of auditioning makes me miserable.  I&#039;m even considered a successful actress, but the up and down of it all really makes me reconsider.  

I&#039;ve taken to blogging quite a bit these last few months and enjoy it much more than going to auditions.  Though I have yet to make it a significant source of income.  

Ps.  I LOVE rockstar finance and have no doubt you&#039;ll be reaching the million mark in no time.]]></description>

Yes, I was there in the early &#039;70&#039;s and it was Mad Men for real. Smokers everywhere; in fact I was in charge of a major tobacco account. Would be nice to meet up at a restaurant with dollar bills on the walls; I keep hearing about more and more of them in FL. Would make an interesting video to hunt &#039;em down and do a nationwide tour! Maybe in my next incarnation . . . ;)]]></description>

Haha VERY limited internet access. Your site is actually one of the few I can visit, somehow. They blocked my blog after a few weeks because I was probably on it too much...haha]]></description>

Wowww, I had no idea about all that in your past! So interesting!! I used to want to be an art director for a large NYC ad agency actually :) Way before it was super cool like on Mad Men, haha... perhaps when you were doing it it WAS like that? (hah!) One of these days we need to share a coffee or beer and chat... perhaps at one of those restaurants with all the dollar bills stapled across the walls ;)]]></description>
