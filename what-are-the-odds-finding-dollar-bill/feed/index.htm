					<description><![CDATA[My nickname always used to be Opie (Opie Taylor Show). However, I never had the idea of turning $1 into $10,000. Looks like that lady didn&#039;t either. :) Will you be doing the same give away anytime soon? Haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Serena@FromHousetoHome&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  Nope, I didn&#039;t find them but I think Richard up there did - I stole &#039;em from his site ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! I currently own two of them actually, haha... love &#039;em!  (though I should probably put them back into circulation so others can find them, right? :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a pretty cool stunt (and from the looks of it pretty safe) from OpieRadio! I&#039;m guessing he never said anything about it beforehand, otherwise there would have been people following him around everywhere. Now I&#039;m going to have to check all of my $1s :)

An interesting way to track where your money has been is called WheresGeorge, I&#039;ve found a couple of bills marked from there and tracked them. They&#039;re usually pretty marked up with markers, so they&#039;re hard to miss.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yes - very low odds here ;)  Didn&#039;t know about the 22 months thing though - that&#039;s interesting. No cool coins really except for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/5-for-friday-favorite-things-edition/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hobo Nickels&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#039;m also not that into coins as much as paper currency.  I do like me some foreign coins though - just cuz they&#039;re so interesting and usually pretty artistic :)
@&lt;b&gt;Richard Anthony&lt;/b&gt; - You got it brother!  Big fan of yours, and what you&#039;re doing over there on the site :)  Keep it up!  It&#039;s super fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, J$!  Not only have you enlightened your readers (including me) about Opie and Anthony&#039;s $10K giveway but you&#039;ve raised a key question about both their promotion and our 100x Face Value offer: what ARE the odds?  Would love to hear some statisticians put a fine pencil to it, rather than vague generalizations.

The bills in our payout roster are readily identifiable without having to squint at serial numbers, and they can be studied in all their pre-circulaltion glory at http://bit.ly/rATHYU .

Thanks for helping us to spread the word, the fun -- and the wealth!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not to ruin the fun, but the average dollar bill is only in circulation for 22 months before being destroyed. I think I would have better odds at ruling the world then I would at finding the winning $1.  BUUUUUT, I love collecting money and anything to do with money, so I know for a fact I will be going home and checking all my dollar bills from now on lol.  Got any cool coins I should know about?]]></description>
