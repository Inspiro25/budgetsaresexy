					<description><![CDATA[Look up &#039;Tithe&#039; online.  It literally translates into &quot;tenth part&quot;.  So a tenth is what I am asked for, and a tenth is what I give.  I don&#039;t even look at it like I&#039;m giving the church a tenth.  The way I figure it, God gives me 90% and asks if He can keep 10%.  That seems fair.  :)  After being a full tithe payer for the last decade or so, I don&#039;t think I could survive without the blessings I get from it.

Malachi 3:10 (New King James Version)

10 Bring all the tithes into the storehouse,
      That there may be food in My house,
      And try Me now in this,”
      Says the LORD of hosts,

      “ If I will not open for you the windows of heaven
      And pour out for you such blessing
      That there will not be room enough to receive it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, yeah there&#039;s some hardcore commenting going over on The Consumerist now. I think I&#039;d actually have to moderate my comments for once if some of those were left on here! :)

					<description><![CDATA[IF you can afford it, it is selfish not to give to your local church. Whenever you attend church, you are using the services of that church. There are the salaries of the people who work there. There is the upkeep of the building, including heating, lighting, repairs and more. Then there is all the good work that the church itself does. Remaining purposefully ignorant about this is not good for your conscience.

If you genuinely can&#039;t afford it, there is no shame in that. But if you can, you should give at least your fair share, and if you can give more, that helps pay for those who can&#039;t afford it.

Don&#039;t complain if a church cuts back on services or keeps the building freezing or whatever if you&#039;re not giving to the church.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, I think some of the earlier commenters need to take a deep breath. I don&#039;t judge people who choose to spend their money on video games or fancy shoes or anything else, and I don&#039;t think people should judge me --- or J. Money. If J. Money finds his religious institution valuable enough that he parks his behind in a pew every Sunday morning (or Saturday evening) then that&#039;s his choice. 

At the same time, they don&#039;t charge admission and leave the responsibility to individuals (or families) to decide how much to contribute toward the cost of basic expenses such as maintaining that very pew, as well as greater costs such as programming to help the poor, support parish schools, etc. There are some religious organizations (ones that rhyme with Schormon) that won&#039;t let you be a full member unless you&#039;ve paid your dues, and the Catholics aren&#039;t like that.

Some people over on the Consumerist post said the Vatican should take a vow of poverty and divest itself of its belongings. What, they should sell the Pieta before asking people to contribute?! That&#039;s like saying the Smithsonian should sell all its holdings to settle the national debt. I&#039;m sure that Judy Garland&#039;s ruby slippers would bring in a couple of million, but there&#039;s something known as cultural patrimony ... the Catholic Church has a responsibility to preserve these works of art. Selling them into private hands? Ridonkulous. 

But contributing to an organization you believe in? That&#039;s just common sense --- and I wager you can make your contribution in either money or time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks dude, much appreciated :)    I actually REALLY need to work on #2 also - I haven&#039;t confessed my sins in years!  Although I do pray about them a lot... don&#039;t think that &quot;counts&quot; though.  Thx again for dropping in!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J. Money,

Sorry I&#039;m late to this conversation. There are 5 precepts of the Catholic Church (ref. CCC 2042–2043, http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a3.htm#II): 1) You shall attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor. 2) You shall confess your sins at least once a year. 3) You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter season. 4) You shall observe the days of fasting and abstinence established by the Church. &lt;em&gt;5) You shall help to provide for the needs of the Church.&lt;/em&gt;

That last one is explicitly vague (both location- and amount-independent) because some people will be able to provide less than others, some closer and further away. Just letting you know this so you don&#039;t think there&#039;s something wrong if you can&#039;t manage 10%. &quot;Ten percent&quot; tithing is not a Catholic thing, per se.]]></description>
