					<description><![CDATA[First time commenting but have been reading for years. You have been an inspiration. 

Several years ago a divorce completely knocked all my plans off the rails... nearly bankrupt I found your site. After refinancing my mortgage from 6+% to 2.2% and paying down debts etc I&#039;ve snowballed all those payments into recovering financially.  

I&#039;m tracking net worth monthly and have seen it go from negative to currently $257k+ in 5 years. I must say your Franken caddie posts are some of the best for me as my pet peeve is I&#039;m still driving my late 90&#039;s crapilier and I used to love my cars... however the only thing wrong with my crapilier is that it drives like a brand new 1999 cavalier. (great car, easy to fix yourself btw. Could have been better driving)...


Thanks for the posts, the inspiration and the support of knowing there&#039;s method to this path some might say is crazy... it&#039;s working well for me. Makes me sad to see others haven&#039;t caught on yet. Wish I did earlier.]]></description>

Believe me - we&#039;ve gone down that road and won once (it used to be 6.75% on an interest-only loan!) and failed the 4 times afterwards... It&#039;s a funny thing with being under water - you have to bring lots of cash to the table to refi! ;)]]></description>

Yes, good point for sure :) I don&#039;t foresee us changing many of our habits whether we have 1 additional salary or 5! So def. good to figure out money stuff sooner than later before getting all caught up in things.]]></description>
