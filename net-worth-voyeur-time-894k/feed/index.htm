Haha, thanks J. 
I find that while I&#039;m young I&#039;m budgeting 50% of wages to holidays, having fun and just being 20, and the other 50% I invest into funds and recently got into property crowdfunding.

Goal is to be a home owner by 25, pay that off then aim for $1,000,000 by 40. Wishful thinking maybe ;D]]></description>

Appreciate that :) I can&#039;t see myself stopping since this blog was founded on the openness of numbers over 10 years ago, but I do need to figure out how to be &quot;okay&quot; with these recent feelings of ickiness for sure... It&#039;s not as fun posting these as it was back in the day :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You will continue to post when you reach the 1M mark correct? I see in some of your comments you say that its starting to feel weird the closer you get to it. Please continue to post as its an inspiration to many of us here. Don&#039;t let other peoples insecurities stop you from posting. I say be unapologetically proud of what you have accomplished.]]></description>

Very nice!! You guys have about 150,000 more than I did at 28 :)

I don&#039;t put any yearly goals on my finances outside of just maxing out my retirement accounts each year, but I&#039;d imagine you get a lot farther when you do! I&#039;ve just always gone with the flow with this stuff as I can never predict what&#039;ll happen in the future, no less the next day - especially with having kids, haha...

And nope - don&#039;t own a home! We&#039;re currently back to renting and we love it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats awesome, I love tracking net worth over time.  I am a new reader on your site and had a few questions when it comes to your net worth.  Do you just rent since I don&#039;t see a new worth for real estate and usually that is a big line item for a lot of people?  Also do you have a amount you plan to increase your net wirth by each year?

My wife and I are 28 and debt free minus our house and currently have a net worth of about 200k.  My plan is to try and increase it by 50k a year for the first year and slowly get a higher and higher amount due to the amazing workings of compound interest.

Sorry if you have answered these questions before, I am new to your site.

I&#039;ll retire from *thinking about money* daily, but not working on projects that I&#039;m passionate about ;) I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be that happy without using my brain on something, so I basically concentrate on hitting the ideal *lifestyle* vs trying to hit retirement - though of course I very much want to hit financial freedom!]]></description>
