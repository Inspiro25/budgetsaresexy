An interesting place to be in! There&#039;s nothing you can work on that&#039;s super exciting to you right now? Either personally or professionally? I know the feeling of not having a good dream or goal lined up though - that can suck... I hope you find something juicy to jump on :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This article actually made me feel a little bit better.  Honestly I just cant figure out what I am:  I&#039;m either unemployed, semi-retired or retired.  After a dozen years at a great company that I loved I had to &quot;move out&quot; when new management came in and the company&#039;s culture changed.  I supposedly have enough invested and saved not to ever work again even though I&#039;m not at retirement age.  I guess you could say I&#039;m lucky but then again man I&#039;m bored since most of my friends are still having to work.

Regardless, this article says it all:  Nothing&#039;s ever permanent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Used to manage a dept where we we often hired contract help through Temp Agencies.  My favorite was the guy who had build a lifestyle using temp jobs that allowed him the flexibility to pursue what mattered to him .   He was competent and took pride in his work but never took himself or anyone else too seriously.  Every time he worked for us he brought along a small wooden sign he displayed on his desk that said &quot;Life is a temporary assignment.&quot;  He believed that sign and, from what I could tell, lived his life accordingly.  At the time I thought him a little odd, in retrospect I think wise might be a better description.]]></description>
