					<description><![CDATA[ROFLMAO J! No offense but I think you already have parent brain.  Yes it is bad to be around marijuana when you have asthma, it is smoke after all.  All smoke= bad for lungs=bad for asthma.  I had a hard time when all the wildfires were happening this summer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loving it that so many of you are playing along! Was a nice break from reality for a bit ;)

@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - I love it that you&#039;re a Kiwi. Saver. :)
@&lt;b&gt;melissa&lt;/b&gt; - I love DC United games too!! We used to go all the time a few years back but since stopped... great way to spend an afternoon or evening though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Congrats on that baby in your belly! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;d be lying if I said I&#039;ve never thought about making a mag one day ;) Just a wee bit harder than blogging, haha... I used to be hooked on Fast Company too, but haven&#039;t read it in a while.
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - I hope your housing solution ended up well! That&#039;s an important part of living! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;I can drink cheap wine while watching netflix&quot; - haha... AGREED.
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - Not a bad combo at all :)  And also? SO GREAT MEETING YOU LAST WEEK!!  Your kid is soooooo cute! A little monkey - I love it :) Maybe one day both our boys will be hanging out with each other? That would be awesome... great hanging with your man too, he&#039;s got good taste in music.
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Are you saying we&#039;re both old now? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ally&lt;/b&gt; - Seeing all the States would be killer - you should totally go for it!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Huh. Never really thought about that before... if you have asthma it&#039;s bad to be around marijuana?
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that&#039;s so true on many level ;) (Drinking while walking)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus III&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;if I’m taking a cab, I’m probably somewhere exciting.&quot; - That&#039;s a good way of thinking of it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa@LittleHouseIntheValley&lt;/b&gt; - Good! It was a kinda fluffy post for sure, but I do think it&#039;s important to re-evaluate things every now and then too, and in a fun way :) So I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Magazines. Unless I lived in NYC/San Fran/Chicago/Boston. Then I&#039;d opt for cabs, because I hate public transportation (except in DC). 

2. Dinner out. FOR SURE. I literally never spend any money on iTunes as it is. 

3. Road Trips. Every time. 

4. Netflix. Don&#039;t know/care enough about wine to spend good money on it. 

5. 99% of the time - Retirement contributions. With an occasional concert - like once a year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Magazines or Cabs?
Not really into either, I have to say. I&#039;d guess I&#039;d go with cabs, because if I&#039;m taking a cab, I&#039;m probably somewhere exciting.
iTunes or Eating Dinner Out?
Eating out. Hands down. I&#039;ve never even used iTunes!
Road Trips or Recreational Sports?
I guess I&#039;d go with recreational sports, although I haven&#039;t played anything in a while.
Netflix or Good Wine?
We have Netflix, but I do enjoy a nice glass of cabernet sauvignon every now and again. I guess I&#039;ll go with the wine.
Concert Tickets or Retirement Fund Contributions?
Retirement fund contributions. I&#039;ve barely been to any concerts, although I was at the Philadelphia part of Live8 a few years ago. That was a blast, and it was free!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.	Magazines or Cabs? - I don&#039;t like magazines, and I&#039;d rather not need a cab!  If I were in a strange city, I&#039;d love cabs.  It would be rare to find a magazine with something useful in it.  Toss up ;)
2.	iTunes or Eating Dinner Out? - Easy.  Dinner out.
3.	Road Trips or Recreational Sports? - Road trips.
4.	Netflix or Good Wine? - Don&#039;t like either one of these either, but I keep trying to like wine, so I&#039;ll take the wine :)
5.	Concert Tickets or Retirement Fund Contributions? - Retirement fund contributions to my designated avenue of saving them.]]></description>
