					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s good to know I&#039;m not the only one going through the down turn.  @Jenna.  To ease your mind a bit on real estate prices.  There are always the highest during the summer, then drop for the winter and go back up again the next year.  Just hold tight.  

Stock prices tend to do the opposite, dropping during the summer when people go on vacation, then coming back up over the winter.  Unfortunately, they seem to be full of flux this fall.  But once again fear not, the will go back up, now&#039;s a good time to buy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the transparency. It really helps people (like me) who know I need to start budgeting better - but need a solid step to start at. 

I think there should be a Personal Finance Makeover (like HGTV) and I volunteer to be the first guinea pig. 

Anyhow, thought you all should know that you&#039;re all inspiring.

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s great - you guys are really on a good roll there :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Long term thinking is where it&#039;s at.  I don&#039;t dwell on the craziness too much, but I still like updating these every month to see how its&#039; going as time moves on.  It&#039;s fascinating stuff at the very least.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - It always goes back up at some point ;)  And until then, we can always buy low!
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats on paying off your car - that&#039;s awesome!!
@&lt;b&gt;Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - haha, yup!  that *does* suck when your overall worth doesn&#039;t go up like that though - I TOTALLY get it ;)  imagine how much lower it would have been though w/ out those bumps?
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Yep, always do my friend!
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - haha, nice.  yeah, once we get super serious I&#039;ll def. be doing that for sure - just not in our immediate plans yet.
@&lt;b&gt;Ludlow&lt;/b&gt; - I agree, except that I don&#039;t think Zillow or the other tools out there accurately reflect it.  So I&#039;d rather have it at the price my realtor said he&#039;d sell it for than marking it up down $15k-$45k as Zillow likes to think it fluctuates.  I already dropped the value down $60k as soon as I got word from the realtor, so I think we&#039;re fine for now.
@&lt;b&gt;brooklyn money&lt;/b&gt; - We&#039;re all in this together, my friend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Barb Friedberg&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;m too impatient to look every quarter ;)  I get the reasoning behind it though, whatever works.]]></description>
