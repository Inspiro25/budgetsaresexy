					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s cool to learn these. I knew about the monopoly money fact (and it&#039;s funny because we have three different monopoly games at home, so I get why there&#039;s so much floating around). I didn&#039;t know the sign originated from the Peso. That&#039;s a cool fact I&#039;ll have to share when I get the opportunity. Nothing wrong with learning new facts about money and sharing them.]]></description>

Yup - you can pick them up at all banks!

As a collector I love pennies and never like seeing any denominations go away, but if they really do cost us more to produce than they&#039;re worth, then yeah - I won&#039;t put up too much a fight if and when they do go away (and honestly I think it&#039;s just a matter of time, as much as I like them).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J!  I had no idea that $2s were still being printed, that&#039;s cool!  Where can you get them, the bank? Just curious...what&#039;s your thought on pennies?  Keep &#039;em as the lowest currency or ditch &#039;em and start with the nickel?]]></description>

Probably not, if you hail all the way from Switzerland! ;)

I&#039;d tell you to do a similar post on your country&#039;s currency for us to guess, but you can already assume we&#039;d all fail haha... (though I&#039;d still very much enjoy reading it!)]]></description>

Haha.... I always envision people trying to shave little bits off of them to make change in an apocalyptic world :) There&#039;s a ton of people who hoard this stuff waiting for exactly that, so hopefully they&#039;re picking up a variety of different sizes and amounts so they can continue on their trade okay ;)]]></description>

Thanks for this! Makes sense too as I&#039;m sure it&#039;s cheaper to produce the bars vs fancy looking coins :)]]></description>

As a collector I&#039;m very glad to hear that :) The beauty/values of coins are nice, but it&#039;s the *history* behind them that really makes our hobby fun! So I&#039;m glad y&#039;all are holding onto those!!]]></description>
