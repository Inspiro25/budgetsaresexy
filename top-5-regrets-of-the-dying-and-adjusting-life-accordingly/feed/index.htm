May i ask what your career is, and how you are a retired millionaire? Dud you get a family inheritance of some sort? 
Or did you get a kick start at life and have a parent that was wealthy to loan you money to maybe start your own business?
Sorry if im being blunt.  I just hate my job, and i dont know which direction to take in life. I would love to start my own business, but i have no money to start one, and im starting to take classes for school, but i dont know which career path i want to take, that will actually need the degree that i go for. And i have a hard time retaining information. So learning things is hard for me unless im shown how to do it step by step with soneone showing me how its done. 

Thank you for reading and im happy for your success! I look foward to receiving any feedback please. Take care.

-the struggle is real-]]></description>

Congrats and good luck with it Celia! Ultimately, even if you fail (you won&#039;t btw) you will still feel better living a life true to yourself vs. something thats not really you.   Congrats on taking the leap - I&#039;m excited for you!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article!  I really relate to regret #1.  I was asking the same thing when I left my job in December and went on sabbatical.  I am changing my career and launching my business as a life coach. I left a job with stable income to venture on my own.   It is exciting and scary at the same time.]]></description>

I agree that as more people drop the keep up with the Joneses mindset, they start living happier lives. :)]]></description>

I think the FIRE movement is helping many people avoid regrets around finance and working too hard.  So glad to hear your Dad has health left and time to reflect and pass on his wisdom from regrets. Others are not so lucky.]]></description>

Gracias Drago! That&#039;s why I started blogging in the first place. I wanted to scribble down notes and ideas I can read back to myself in future years :).  Have a great week my friend!]]></description>

Hey David! I don&#039;t think these are necessarily black and white regrets, more like a scale... Everyone has different levels of authenticity and outside influences, and it&#039;s on each person to find what feels best for them.]]></description>

I agree with you. If given a chance to reverse big mistakes or money losses in life, I can&#039;t say that I&#039;d want anything changed. I believe this feeling will continue as I get older, as long as I&#039;m constantly learning and trying my hardest to be better.

Congrats on 44 years married!!!  My wife&#039;s parents just past their 40th, and my parents are 38 years I think!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad I gave up on the &quot;Keep up with the Joneses&quot; mindset early in life. Life isn&#039;t all about money and who has the most stuff, but it&#039;s hard being around so many people that think so! Good to know there are so many others out there like me.

I can&#039;t imagine the feeling some of the people with these regrets had knowing they spent their lives going after the wrong things. Hopefully, more people can start to change their mindsets soon after reading articles like this.]]></description>
