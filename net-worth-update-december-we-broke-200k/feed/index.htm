					<description><![CDATA[yeah, i used to use Zillow but it would fluctuate a good $100k every other month - couldn&#039;t rely on it much.  since our realtor knows these places inside and out, figured his #&#039;s are much more accurate :) I did not know about Mint &amp; Zillow though - very cool!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[CONGRATS!! I am impressed!! I love how you break it all down for us too. (What can I say - I&#039;m a bit voyeuristic.) 

Have you checked out Zillow.com (which is now part of Mint.com) for your home&#039;s value? I don&#039;t know how accurate it is compared to a realtor&#039;s estimate, because they obviously don&#039;t look at the condition of YOUR particular home or any improvements you&#039;ve done on it. It&#039;s all based on neighborhood and other houses in it, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. . .

Let us know what you choose for a retirement account. . .like if you go w/ a SEP or what not.  My girlfriend is a hair stylist and I got her going with a Roth IRA but I know she would probably be better served to have additional space to save for retirement once she maxes the Roth.  Congrats on cracking the 200k threshold. . .I hope to make it there myself.  I cracked the 100k threshold 3 or 4 months back. . .felt pretty good, but I imagine 200 feels even better hah : )

					<description><![CDATA[It does hurt ;)  But at least we can afford it!  And it&#039;ll have to do until the market picks up or we pay off more of our 2nd mortgage... too underwater to refinance - and don&#039;t plan on sticking around for too long anyways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[6.875% fixed, interest-only mortgage....Yuck!  I&#039;m not trying to be negative here, but that has to hurt.  We&#039;ll have to talk about fixing that some day.  Great blogging, as usual!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Well you&#039;re lucky too that it&#039;s close!  Most people (myself especially) think they have much more before they start tracking. And then they jot it all down and give up before they finish cuz they&#039;re too afraid of what that number&#039;s gonna be! haha...  so good work.  Month 1 down, and lots more to come.  Keep watching it and comparing as the months go by!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Jenna :) I hope yours is going well too!
@&lt;b&gt;Finanzas Personales&lt;/b&gt; -  Ooooh that&#039;s a good point.  I do think of money WAY differently now than I did when all I wanted was LOTS of it ;)  Good point! (note to self:  add this to your future blog post ideas)
@&lt;b&gt;twentysomethingmoney&lt;/b&gt; - Because of all my side hustles aka my new jobs aka my saviors!  I&#039;d be F*cked without those lined up (although I would have found a better job long ago too - I remained cuz it was comfy while I was pimping my other stuff!)  But I&#039;ll probably have to dip into my E Fund soon anyways to pay off those credit cards once and for all, and to float cash when I&#039;m waiting for certain checks to clear. But the overall plan is to at least break even every month - with the idea that my projects would start bringing in more and eventually replace my salary completely.  
@&lt;b&gt;Niki&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Niki :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jess&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Jess :)]]></description>
