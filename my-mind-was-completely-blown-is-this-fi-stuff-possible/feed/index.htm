					<description><![CDATA[One of my first FIRE memories was listening to Waffles on Wednesday as guests on the Bigger Pockets Money Podcast (Episode 7).  I remember running home and telling my wife, &quot;I think I found some people that are just like us! There&#039;s a whole group of them called FIRE or something&quot;.

Then I went down the rabbithole. Quit my job shortly after. And I actually became very close friends with the Waffles on Wednesday couple - they happened to live in Los Angeles too at the time :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the touching tale, humble enthusiast of FI. I remember the first time FIRE clicked in my head, it set off a forest FIRE that changed my perception of work and saving, for the better. While I have had ups and downs on how to manage frugality and spending for pleasure, it has been quite the journey so far.]]></description>
