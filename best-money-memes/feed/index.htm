HELL YEAHHHH man! Agree 100%. I cant think of a &quot;jet ski&quot; experience I do that costs a lot of money, but I sure do enjoy walks in old cemeteries by myself which most people would *not* enjoy haha... Not only is it free, but it reminds me to be thankful I&#039;M ALIVE!!! And it&#039;s so peaceful in them! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hands down favorite --&quot;Have you ever seen anyone sad on a jet ski ?&quot; LOL.  Nope, sure haven&#039;t.  Those people are having a blast.   Now, personally, I judgementally think that jet skis are a frivolous waste of money and I would never buy one.  However, I would never turn down the opportunity to ride someone else&#039;s.  But whatever the equivalent of riding a jet ski is for each of us, I think it&#039;s important to do something regularly that makes you off-the-scale happy.  This is a new revelation for me because it took me a long time to find out what these activities were.  Some people seem to be more fun-oriented while others, like me, view life as a serious of goals to be reached by sacrifice and hard work.   By finding those activities that equal the &quot;jet ski&quot; experience, I find it much easier to make sacrifices in other areas because the spillover effect of the exhilaration makes any hardship more bearable.  I don&#039;t think that most people allow themselves to be jet ski level happy.  I bet it would radically change their life.]]></description>

HEYY!!!! Way to go, Ellie!!!

Such a huge move - hardly anyone ever does that! You should be super proud of yourself for sure :) Maybe you can sneak it into real life conversations by saying &quot;I know this friend who just paid for their car in all cash - isn&#039;t that so cool???&quot; haha.. I guarantee it would get a great discussion going! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Oprah meme is hitting home right now. Because I just got a car. 

I want to tell my recent story here because I don&#039;t feel comfortable telling anyone I know. 

I&#039;ve been driving a &#039;95 Mustang for the last 19 years. For the last 10 years I&#039;ve been saving up money for a replacement vehicle. The Mustang was becoming unsafe to drive, so I finally pulled the trigger.

I bought a 2016 Camry with only about 8K miles for under $18K. I was able to pay with cash!!! I&#039;m so stupid excited to have worked all those years to accomplish this.

Ya, I know all about how I could have invested the money and took a loan, but I did not want to. I wanted a solid car and no payments. 

It&#039;s all because of the financial journey I started around the time I found Budgets are Sexy! Thank you J Money and all the other bloggers who have helped me stay focused on my goals!]]></description>
