I agree. This was a jaw-dropping post. A loss of $60k! A red wedding indeed. I remember seeing that GoT episode. Like that episode, I had to stop watching my 401(k) balances so closely cause it was just loss after loss. But as you say, that is reality and it can&#039;t be escaped from. 

Great post!

This is true, the risk % is definitely larger if you have less wealth]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lost about $30K...and I was in the middle of a rollover when one of the dips occurred so I lost less than I should have.  Amusing timing.  

Also amusing:  my portfolio rebalanced itself.  Not in the way I would have preferred...but I don&#039;t have to bother anymore...]]></description>

Haha... Indeed on that house stuff ;) But we&#039;ll see how long it lasts - my wife just yesterday told me how much she&#039;s tired of moving around and wants to finally buy a house again! I&#039;m angling for one more move of renting while we *look* for the perfect house, but not entirely sure I&#039;m going to win that battle, haha.... It&#039;s getting harder to move with a billion kids in tow.

(and yup - I&#039;m 100% in stocks so your 20% mix is definitely stopping the bleeding on your end)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ouch!
6.65% has to hurt. 

I was down in Oct 5.7%, wiping out all the year-to-date gains. That tells me one thing. No, not that I&#039;m smarter, a better investor, or even luckier. I&#039;d bet that your investment mix is one with more stock than my mix. As a retiree, I&#039;m in an 80/20 mix. If we go into another crash, I wanted to have about 5 years worth of spending without having to sell low. The downside is that with rates so low, I&#039;m not going go see the high returns you will in up markets. 
Always interesting to have a peek at someone else&#039;s balance sheet. 

And I&#039;m reminded of the burden you don&#039;t have. No house means no property tax ($18K for me) insurance (another $4K) or ongoing routine maintenance. The mortgage is the least of it all. 

Be well!]]></description>
