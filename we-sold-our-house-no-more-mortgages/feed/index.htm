					<description><![CDATA[We are going to be listing our house this spring/summer that we bought in early 2008. With the other houses in the neighborhood selling we should be able to double our money! while we are not mortgage free, the equity will pay off all of our consumer debt and give us our 3-6 months emergency fund. Then we will start saving for a larger home.]]></description>

It really is amazing how much you end up paying at the end for houses! Almost double - if not more - when all is said and done!]]></description>

NICE!!! That&#039;s like a luxury car purchase right there - well done ;)

If the cost of living here was closer to that, and we were more stable and knew where we wanted to live long-term, I&#039;d definitely reconsider my stance on it. And might even do so next year when we move again as having no mortgages definitely makes up for the annoyances! Haha.... So good for you man, on both finding a steal AND paying it off so quickly. I can&#039;t say I know many people outside of our $$$ world here that&#039;s been able to do that so I&#039;m impressed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t imagine not having my home and having to pay rent... But, I got lucky and bought it right after the whole housing crash for 70k and its roughly got a value of double in the current market. I have also spent very little on having to maintain it. I was able to pay it off a few years ago, without paying any interest, so my expenses are only about $150 for electric/gas/home owners.  I feel bad for the family that had to sell, they paid over 140k just a couple years before the crash. It&#039;s too bad they couldn&#039;t ride it out, but it was my gain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating.
But here&#039;s how the situation is in our neck of the woods (Ventura county, California):
There are no rental properties. A 1-bedroom in the ghetto rents out for $1,750, but you&#039;d be in line with 40 Hispanics, all of who want to rent it out, in order to occupy it with 4 to 6 people.
So even if you got &quot;lucky,&quot; you&#039;d be living in the ghetto and in hell.
So you want a small 2-bedroom in a not too horrible neighborhood?
That&#039;ll be $2,600 to $3,500 per month. In rent. 
You&#039;ll be competing for the landlord&#039;s favors with many other applicants. If you get lucky, which my wife and I got twice, and get the keys, you still may get a note to vacate because the home owner all of a sudden decided to sell, as it happened to us -- twice.
So for the same money, you can have a mortgage on an entry-level home, somewhere between $500K and $545K.
You&#039;ll never have to fear having to move, and not being able to find a new place to live in time.
Priceless, but actually free, as renting costs the same as owning. That&#039;s why renting means paying somebody else&#039;s mortgage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats! lol.  I kinda want to hear that too. We are currently in a similar position, and as we&#039;ve found it, it&#039;s hard to find good renters. Especially for a home you&#039;ve cared about so much and they don&#039;t. So we will probably end up selling it and settling UP i hope.
We&#039;re now currently paying bills for 2 houses too. ANd I just can&#039;t wait to see that list cut almost in half when the other one is gone..... 
I felt your excitement in your blog and now I&#039;m getting kinda excited about ending ours. lol
