					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great comments, everyone! Update: I went to Target, and they have a 32-inch Samsung LED screen on sale from $399 for $250, because it&#039;s the display model. I&#039;m going to get that once the remaining three in storage are sold; only then will the Samsung be 30-percent off. I&#039;ll be saving about $150 and I&#039;ll have more money in my emergency savings. It&#039;s a win-win situation. Wee!

@Too Funny: What if I&#039;m watching P90X? Ooooooh....
@Stacking Cash: Good point. It will last longer, and I&#039;ll probably appreciate it more because I had to sell a kidney to purchase it.
@Robert: Nice, though marshmallows go straight to my hips
@J. Money: You&#039;re welcome, and thanks for the opportunity to mention Justin Beiber!
@Trina: Do it. Do it. Best part of &quot;Starsky &#038; Hutch.&quot; Do it!
@Elle: So wise, thanks!
@Richard Russell: I&#039;ve actually thought about doing that for a month at a time, just focus more on &quot;life stuff.&quot; Thing is, outside of the History Channel and sports, it&#039;s tough, lol.
@Jenna: Yup, that&#039;s what I&#039;ll do!
@Kira: Awesome explanation, thanks so much!
@anonymous: Appreciate you taking your precious time reading something you don&#039;t like.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The cost of the TV is peanuts. The true cost will come when you have a bigger waistline and have to buy a new wardrobe. 

And when you try to pick up chicks in the penny saver you&#039;ll soon have to write:
MSW: 29, single, own a condo, few bills, $800 free after all bills each month, no debt, no hair, nice shoes, slight paunch, love to watch The Biggest Loser and Designing Women. 

Just kidding. I say buy it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would get a $1500 TV.  Considering this thing should last you 10 years, you want to make sure you buy something that you will like for the long term.  I can&#039;t stand cheap TV&#039;s, unless it&#039;s for a small bedroom.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I say do both. Hunt around for a great deal on a TV (sales happen through out the year) and put some money towards savings. With $800/month, you can finish off your emergency fund in no time while enjoying your new TV.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t buy it. Here&#039;s why:

Spending money that you didn&#039;t &quot;work&quot; for (ie it&#039;s a windfall rather than a reward) devalues that money. Put it in savings, and then save up weekly for the TV if you really want it. If filing your taxes itself was significant work, and you had to overcome significant procrastination to do it, then the TV may well be a suitable reward for that work. The rule of thumb that I use is that I only spend hard-won money on luxuries.

But that aside, I recommend not buying the TV, and in fact, selling any TV you have, because a TV is a mechanism to consume your time and convince you to buy things. You will spend less and have a happier life if, instead of watching the box, you read, write, walk, exercise, socialise or just *do* something. I haven&#039;t had a TV for almost a decade (in fact, I don&#039;t watch or listen to any streaming or broadcast media at all), and haven&#039;t missed it once.]]></description>
