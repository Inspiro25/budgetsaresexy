					<description><![CDATA[It was so cool guys!!!  DEF worth the trip (even though I was barely alive when I made it back home to DC that night -- I was on the train more than I was IN New york! haha...)  And guess who surprised sang for us in the middle of lunch?  Country singer Josh Gracin from American Idol!  Haha... was pretty dope.

Check it out: &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/p/TtB-U/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;In Times Square looking at us ringing the bell!&lt;/a&gt; (Can you see me in the back?)

Big BIG thanks again to both Cooking With The Troops, and Heather Solos for the invite (whose book just hit a Top 10 list in Amazon! Congrats, girl!) -- y&#039;all totally made my week :)

@&lt;b&gt;Kristia {Family Balance Sheet}&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, and sleep/veg/work I def. did ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Miriam&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... that does seem to be a mythical thing, doesn&#039;t it? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Marilyn&lt;/b&gt; - You know, I had thought about that but just couldn&#039;t bring myself to take a bus in the end... wanted something more comfortable :(
@&lt;b&gt;@JustHeather&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  I was able to get a lot of email work done, but not too much on the laptop as the stupid wifi didn&#039;t work properly on it?  It did on the iPhone but not the computer :(  Oh well, I did a ton of reading though!
@&lt;b&gt;Babs&lt;/b&gt; - I tried to bring out the Mrs on the trip, but she had a class to T.A. for :(  And plus we were going home to visit my family over the weekend too, but believe me - the long weekend DID cross my mind. Gonna have to do it again soon - minus the ringing of the bell ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks Trinnie!  I&#039;ll pass along your message to my dad when I talk to him next - that&#039;s sweet of you :)  The group I was with (since they have to do w/ troops and veterans) was going into the streets and pulling Marines out to come eat all our food we had in the studio - it was awesome.  So nice of them... def. looking forward to FINALLY meeting you!  Can&#039;t believe it still hasn&#039;t happened! :)
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - It most def. was, thanks! Hope you had a most wonderful weekend too, friend :)
@&lt;b&gt;lora kathleen&lt;/b&gt; - It was a site to be seen, that&#039;s for sure :)  I hope you get a chance to participate in it one day, I think you&#039;d love it!
@&lt;b&gt;bethh&lt;/b&gt; - Now THAT could have been do-able... though not sure how late they ran? (Good idea though, didn&#039;t even think about it!)
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m a big fan of trains - so relaxing :)
@&lt;b&gt;CrystalH&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, if I weren&#039;t in a rush and I was staying longer, I probably would have just drove.  Or maybe taken the bus, but now that I took the train I may be spoiled and have to go that route again - it was SO EASY!
@&lt;b&gt;David Carlson&lt;/b&gt; - Why thank you sir, I believe I did as well :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, right?  Good find ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - You don&#039;t enjoy that part?  I actually do, to be honest with you... it&#039;s such a lead up for the excitment to come!  And sometimes I end up having more fun TRAVELING than I do when I get there! Haha... but that&#039;s usually on road trips vs. plane trips, I agree the end of the flights are usually the worst :)
@&lt;b&gt;CanadianSaver&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks my friend!  Hope you got into some fun too, over the weekend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bergie Powers&lt;/b&gt; - And I didn&#039;t even end up drinking any on it! Haha... though I, ofcourse, had a few in my belly to tide me over ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[TRAIN!!! I hate the actual &#039;travelling&#039; part of travelling. I only do it because I j&#039;adore the parts in between. :)

I have been known to pay an extra $100-$200 for a trip that is only 24 hours long vs 26+. Boy do you feel those extra few hours at the end! Misery...

p.s.  i took spanish so that is probably the wrong way to use j&#039;adore]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would have taken the train, as you did.  Driving you can&#039;t really do anything productive with your time, so immediately I prefer the bus or train option.  Train sounds a lot more comfortable, convenient, and fast.  You have to think about what you can do with that time as well (i.e. work on your laptop, sleep, read, etc.).  You made the most efficient and profitable choice as far as I&#039;m concerned ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I normally catch the bus when I head to NYC.  But I&#039;m glad you picked the train.  It sounds like a MUCH better ride and I&#039;m pretty sure the time savings makes it worth it.  Because that 2-3 hours saved is priceless!  I will seriously consider the train the next time I have to head up there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was tense; I was thinking &#039;I hope he din&#039;t take the bus and that he is not daft enough to drive there&#039;. Glad you went on the train - I would have done the same. In fact I do it often; though trains here are very expensive and in fact it is cheaper to fly. Trains are great for dong all the stuff I don&#039;t like doing - much work done and always some time left for rest and fun.]]></description>
