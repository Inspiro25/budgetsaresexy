					<description><![CDATA[I believe that super power is called &quot;nesting&quot; and it just hits some of the ladies harder than others. Our tenant moved in pregnant and the extent of her nesting was painting. I know another lady who nearly gutted her house. I guess regardless it means safety for all!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Blerg, babies end up being more than just babies don&#039;t they!  I like how every time you mention something kind of annoying or frustrating about the missus, there&#039;s a little smiley or haha next to it.  I know.  You have no choice.  ;)

PS - the new blog project is coming along, got the design almost done!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Sexy!!
@&lt;b&gt;Ash (in US)&lt;/b&gt; - I was nixed on the J$ colors, but we did end up going with some pretty sweet rock-like tiles :)  I&#039;ll be taking pictures of it soon and posting them up - it should look good.  And you&#039;re right on that shelving stuff - our guy said as long as you tilt it more so it can roll off, you should be fine - so we&#039;re gonna keep it in and just do that. If we wanted to get rid of it, it would require more work which would = more money :(
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - There you go!  Hook her up &lt;b&gt;Brian!&lt;/b&gt; :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance@MoneyLife&amp;More&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, much better to know it&#039;s coming than be surprised - that&#039;s the worst :(
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right?  I am thankful for that - for sure.  Just wish they&#039;d *never* happen, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD!!!  Get outta there and go on a fun adventure :)  So will you be renting going forward then?  I&#039;d totally do that right now if I could too.  One day though...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!! I want pics!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Pasadena&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhh, yes - you&#039;re probably right.  Airing it out should def. help out more - we try to do that as well.
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! I literally just finished a blog post which has ink costs in it - stay tuned for it ;)  But I agree - printer ink BLOWS big time... I hate it... and nowadays printers cost less than refill cartridges :(  But I still like keeping one handy because I print out all my invoices and other stuff for my online biz, so I have no intentions of pimping out FedEx like you are. But it&#039;s a great idea! (I&#039;m gonna remember &quot;Mold Armor&quot; too if anything creeps back up later, thanks for the tip.)
@&lt;b&gt;Amber&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m JEALOUS!!!  Think of me next time you&#039;re in it!! I mean...
@&lt;b&gt;ImpulseSave&lt;/b&gt; - Yep, for sure.  And it&#039;ll help with selling or renting the house faster too later!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree - you might as well go ahead and get something nice to look at while you&#039;re spending all the money. Plus, you will probably have to do it at some point and so you might as well have him do it while he&#039;s already there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When my brother moved out of my spare room, he conveniently left the far wall—with the window in it—covered in black mold. o_0

Of course, my rental agreement specifically states that this place is ~100 years old, there&#039;s mold in it, and there&#039;s nothing to be done to get rid of it permanently. It&#039;s our responsibility to keep it cleaned up, and to notify them only if it comes back super quickly after we&#039;ve cleaned it up.

I couldn&#039;t rightly call the property manager with it in the state that it was, since it was clear that it had been festering more or less since my brother moved in (I suspect mold spores got stirred up when they replaced the windows, since it had never been a problem before.) So, I went in search of a solution.

Mold Armor.

I kid you not. I don&#039;t usually pimp any particular products, but I sprayed that on the mold, and it just disappeared without any scrubbing. I didn&#039;t use a respirator, but in all likelihood, you probably should. Spores + potent chemical concoction, and all that. I mean, certainly, if it&#039;s inside walls/ventilation/etc. bring in a professional to deal with it properly, if you can guarantee that you&#039;ll get rid of it all. If it&#039;s just surface mold, you might give Mold Armor a try. I&#039;m going to pick up a big bottle of it so I can clean up some other problem areas I&#039;ve found.

But, what I really came to blog for is to comment on how much money I&#039;ve wasted on printers in the past, since I just went and had something printed at FedEx today and when I realized how much cheaper that is, I almost freaked out.

I don&#039;t currently have a printer. My former roommate had his printer set up on the network, and I used that. Today I had to print a contract and some tax documents for the new writing gig I scored. It ended up costing me $0.77 to print everything at FedEx. It&#039;s probably the only thing I&#039;ll have to print this year (since I do almost everything electronically, whenever possible.) How much does a printer cost per year once you factor in the printer itself, ink, paper, etc.? At least $10, but probably a lot more.

Printers just don&#039;t make sense anymore (unless you&#039;re a student and can&#039;t print for free), with the advent of smartphones and digital everything.

Plus, I totally feel like a boss when I go into FedEx and have some lackey do all of my printing for me. Haha. &quot;Make sure you only print the first page of document one, and print all of document two, double-sided, in grayscale, properly collated, and set for long-edge binding.&quot; Nailed it! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just my 2 cents on shower mold. It means : not enough aeration. After getting rid of it in my new apartment, I&#039;ve not had any since... I leave the bathroom door open (wide) all day after I shower in the morning. Oh, and if you have ceiling-high shower doors or curtain, leave them open. Might be tricky to leave a shower curtain open, since it might get moldy itself... need to find the middle ground here. Or get shower doors instead ;-)]]></description>
