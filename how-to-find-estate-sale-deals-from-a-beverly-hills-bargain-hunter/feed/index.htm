Awesome Shaun. I never thought about it from a seller side... But that is a great way to get rid of a problem, and hopefully profit at the same time. Nice!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is amazing! I could use this idea.  I actually buy houses in Denver  and too often, since we buy house as-is there are a lot of stuff left by the previous owner. I don&#039;t know maybe they don&#039;t like them anymore but  too often most of them are seems to be useful somewhere. I just think that this idea is the quickiest way to have them all out and profit. Thanks again Joel!]]></description>

Nice profit!! I&#039;ve bought a few old pocket watches and put them up on ebay. Fun way to make a few buck on the weekend!  I&#039;m a big thrift store shopper too!]]></description>

That&#039;s an awesome story! Hancock Park has some gorgeous homes and a lot of history. My favorite type of bargain is old/durable furniture. Some people don&#039;t realize the gold mine they&#039;re sitting on - or in your case, just want to get rid of it and don&#039;t care what they get for it.  Nice deal! Even better that you&#039;re paying it forward to your Sis! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hancock Park was my go to for estate sales when l lived in L.A. Like you l really enjoyed it and got some great deals. My best one ever was in 1992 when my housemate and l had just pooled our money together (yes, cashing in our 401K for the downpayment :-) ) so we had a gorgeous house in the hills and no furniture. I went to an estate sale of a recently deceased man that was being conducted by some twat company. I somehow ended up speaking to the daughter directly. She sold us a whole bedroom set furniture, an antique rug and some other things for 2500 dollars despite the complaints of the company and them telling her she could get at least 5 times more.. haha! She didn&#039;t care.  She even made her husband truck them home for us. We had the furniture till 2013. Shipped them to my sister in Nigeria where they are still going strong.]]></description>

Sometimes I go for fun - if it&#039;s in a crazy mansion area I&#039;ve never visited before or the house looks like it was lived in by someone interesting. But most of the time there&#039;s a specific item that piques my interest :)  Looking at the photos you can usually tell if it&#039;s worthwhile going to. Cheers!]]></description>

This implies that you are going to an estate sale just for fun. If that were the case, it is just like shopping at any store just for kicks, you will end up buying stuff you do not need. 
If you happen to be in the need of things, furniture for example, you can do quite well. I have found numerous antique/vintage furnishings for a steal. I would have paid far more at an antique or consignment store.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article Joel. 
I&#039;ve never actually been to a garage sale and they don&#039;t seem to be so popular in the UK. 

Over here we have &#039;car boot sales&#039; and they tend to host them in a field or park and they can be pretty big events. 

I used to go to them when I was a lot younger and pick up some good finds!

All the best!
