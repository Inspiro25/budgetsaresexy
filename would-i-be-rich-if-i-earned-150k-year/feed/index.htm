					<description><![CDATA[yeah - the &quot;when you don&#039;t save and invest&quot; being the important part there ;)  if I were making $150k i could guarantee that I would invest at LEAST $75k of that ASAP - thus dramatically increases my &quot;richness.&quot;  But I also don&#039;t have kids right now, so if you ask me in 5-10 years I&#039;m sure my # would be much higher ;)

Thx for dropping by sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I make about 150K in the bay area, and can tell you that I am not rich.  Nor do I look it.  We have a semi nice house which is NOT lanscaped, and no pool.  We have a 4 year old bmw (very nice, 450/mo) SUPER nice boat (another 400/mo) and a paid off 10yo SUV.  Our house payment is like 2800/mo.  4 kids, 15-22 one in college, paying half her tuition as we go, as we never saved.  She works.  Wife doesn&#039;t.
Life is good, we can eat out whenever we want, vacation once every 2-3 years, but I would say that we are barely living within our means, and not getting a whole lot for that.  The small stuff, computers, electronics--all the small things we can have whatever we like.  But the big things, new cars, big vacations every year, no way.  Want to buy my second daughter a new car for her 18th, but just did the math and I cannot.  150,000 doesn&#039;t go as far as you think, when you don&#039;t save and invest]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the way you think!  You&#039;ve got to have dreams brotha - and $100k is def. doable :)  It&#039;s unfortunate all the other comments here were wiped away from our Wordpress move as there was some great discussions going on....some saying you needed $300k+, and others saying you can be rich w/out much at all.  Pretty interesting stuff...]]></description>
