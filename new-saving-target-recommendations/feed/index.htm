					<description><![CDATA[Locally in Wisconsin, a finance &quot;expert&quot; offered some advice on how to save more, but at the end mentioned their $220 cable bill. Prime candidate for a financial face punch! After reading blogs such as this, MMM, Frugalwoods and others, most of the financial &quot;expert&quot; advice I read now drives me insane. And I would say one of the most common offenses is substituting annual &quot;salary&quot; when they mean &quot;expenses.&quot; I know of course that I am preaching to the choir here, but I had to rant somewhere! lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would not jump into the comparison part (because you should not bring a knife into a gunfight), but taking into account the US standards and responsible planning these targets should be easily achievable and more.

					<description><![CDATA[The LEGO movie!!!
I agree this is a weird metric but at 41yo, I have about 5x my salary (including current pension value), so I guess I&#039;m doing ok by their standards! More importantly, we&#039;re not spending nearly as much as we take in (we have a savings rate of about 40%), so we&#039;re doing ok by more reasonable standards as well!]]></description>

I know - it&#039;s bad :( You really have to stop and WANT IT BAD to get your finances in order because everything around us is in cahoots to take it from us! And the longer the spending becomes habit the harder it is to break those chains too :( Although still very much possible! I love seeing people in their 50s or 60s coming to this blog to start paying attention as much as it kills me.]]></description>
