Kids definitely throw a wrench in it all for sure :) But you&#039;re totally right - takes some getting used to with the 1st child! We&#039;re about to find out what it&#039;s like with the 2nd one come May - yikes! (And also - yay! :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this is sort of tangential -- but I find it fascinating as a man who always been the primary breadwinner, about how many women speak to the stress of the responsibility of that (and how, as Farnoosh comments, it often means you&#039;re also in charge of family finances, bills, planning etc) yet, it&#039;s one of those things that primary breadwinning men have rarely been credited for.  Couples are partners, and that doesn&#039;t always mean dividing every job equally.  But appreciating your partner for what they &quot;bring to the table&quot; is critical -- no matter which gender is earning.  I have seen this issue (women earning significantly more than men) grow and it definitely affects relationships -- although I think my kids generation handles it better -- so there&#039;s hope!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I make more than my husband - we got married right after college; I started a great full time career right away, but he had gotten a science degree. He worked really hard in college, was in the honors program, and is five times smarter than me, yet with some college degrees, there just aren&#039;t jobs out there without going back for more school. He tried finding a serious job to do for a year or so until starting professional school, but ended up as a cashier. It was really annoying and embarrassing to me (and didn&#039;t necessarily bother him) for a while, knowing we were both capable and college-educated, but I was bringing home the bacon and he was making minimum wage part time! I love my career, but I felt like I was holding up everything while he watched Netflix all day! (Even though I completely understood that he tried hard to find a good job and there just weren&#039;t a lot of options.) We talked to a family counselor about it, who assured us that we weren&#039;t the only ones in that situation, and to hold on to hope that our situation will eventually change. I had also been extremely frustrated that I was working more, but also doing all the housework, while he didn&#039;t seem to be doing anything house-related but paying the bills online. It turned out, all I needed to do was tell him I felt overwhelmed, and ask specifically for help around the house. We made a deal that he&#039;d do all the laundry and dishes, and things went so much better after that! It took some time for us to realize how we were going to go about it all as a team, but now that we&#039;ve come to terms with it and made a plan, we&#039;re happy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do make more money than my husband, actually. He&#039;s in school for a PhD, so I&#039;m working jobs that a) aren&#039;t that interesting to me b) not helping MY career. Sometime&#039;s it&#039;s pretty hard, especially because I&#039;d love to get my career on track (I&#039;m almost 28, not getting any younger!) but for now, I cover most of the bills as he goes through school. Good thing I like him! ;)]]></description>
