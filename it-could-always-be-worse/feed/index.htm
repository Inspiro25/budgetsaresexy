					<description><![CDATA[I strongly agree with J. Money. Sure there are people who have succeeded despite not going to college, but are they the rule or the exception? And are they in any way different from the average person?
Bottom line, it is easy to look at those who have succeeded, but also look at all of those who have not succeeded.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s okay, we can agree to disagree :)  I think you&#039;re certainly right for those types of personalities, but overall I&#039;d say the average person does NOT fit that bill.  And I&#039;d place my odds on better education than the chance of working for yourself based on a lot of things -- mainly laziness.  Lots of kids graduate high school and just want to play and do fun stuff, and if it weren&#039;t for our parents forcing us to go to college, we probably wouldn&#039;t have. Which would have been a huge waste of our youth.  Again, not for everyone, but for more than the average I&#039;d say. Entrepreneurs are slim in the general scheme of things,so my vote always goes to college degree.  Shoot, even for me - I never had an inkling of working for myself but it took college and 10 years in the workforce to realize what i want to be doing w/ my life. I wouldn&#039;t have gotten here if I didn&#039;t go through all that first.   Sure it can be a crap ton of money, and yeah - maybe financially it&#039;s not worth it in the end for a handful of people, but you learn MUCH more from school than just knowledge on subjects.  It&#039;s an experience I think most kids should go through before heading off into the &quot;real&quot; world.  But again, that&#039;s just my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to disagree with you Mr. Money...but I am one of those how is opposed to college UNLESS you have a clear career path.  Some may mock my choices--but I have every capacity for academia and have chosen the entrepreneur track because I know that the years I&#039;d have to put in in order to get to a place where I&#039;d be my own boss would probably KILL ME before I got there!  In addition to being a misfit for my personality and skills I think that the &#039;higher education&#039; propaganda has cost many a young person years and years of slavery to debt.  As Dave Ramsey says, those stats about folks who go to college making more money may just as easily have more to do with their character than with the education they receive. If more people did a TRUE cost-benefit analysis of education I think there would be a lot of second-thinking about blindly going for a college education.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, no kidding.  There are tons of people who are successful w/out having gone to college, but I think it&#039;s a lot rarer than we know, and either way they wouldn&#039;t advocate going that route for others anyways.  Maybe they wanted to go and didn&#039;t have the opportunity, or gave it a shot and realized it wasn&#039;t for them?  Regardless, most people I know who&#039;ve skipped would still tell people it&#039;s a good idea to do.  It&#039;s something you carry with you forever. I&#039;m glad you&#039;re going!! :)]]></description>
