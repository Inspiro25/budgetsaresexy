Nice!!! Y&#039;all are rockin&#039; it! Didn&#039;t know about the foreign transaction fee stuff (though since having kids I&#039;ve stopped all international (or almost any whatsoever) travel - hah).

Thanks for taking the time to share with everyone :) Now you have to try out their coaching sessions and report back!]]></description>

Oh, I forgot to add, they run promotions like the one WorkingMom mentioned pretty often (I got $400 for having a direct deposit set up, which I was then able to cancel after I met the time requirements) - so if there isn&#039;t one, I might wait a month or so to see if one pops up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/capital-one-offers-free-money-coaching-sessions/#comment-266903&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve had a Capital One money market for about a year now - I&#039;m very happy with their online interface, and another perk is that they monitor your TransUnion credit score for you, give you weekly updates, and monthly emails.  The only thing I&#039;m not a huge fan of is the time it takes to transfer money to an external account (although, that rarely takes place, so it&#039;s not much of an issue); the bank I keep my main checking account only takes 2-3 days, capital one (the couple times I&#039;ve done so), took nearly a calendar week.  They&#039;ve also been steadily raising the rate as the fed does, and they&#039;ll email you when they do so (I believe when I opened the account last year the rate was 1.05%).

*Bonus perk - the reason I opened the account was because I was about to do some international travel, and Capital One doesn&#039;t charge any foreign transaction fees or foreign ATM withdrawal fees on their debit cards, and the 360 checking doesn&#039;t have a minimum balance, so I could use it just for a travel account....then of course I was too OCD to have accounts all over, so I moved my savings, which was formerly with Discover (whom I also endorse, especially if you can&#039;t, or don&#039;t want to, meet the $10k required for the Capital One MMS).]]></description>

Great points, Kristen! I actually do have a child but that does mean that I often go for the job that is closer to home, with fewer working hours and no travel requirements so I can be more available for our child at home. This oftentimes means staying in a lower-paying position. Men are also statistically favored for managerial positions, although I will admit that does seem to be improving.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;ve been looking for a place to park a $10k emergency fund and this 360 Money Market looks like a great fit. After a little research, found a promo code of QUICKONE for a $200 bonus if you deposit $10k by 5/31/18 and keep it in for 90 days (Disclosure- You are supposed to get an email from Quicken with this promo code). Even though there are a few money markets with slightly higher APY, this 1.5% APY and the bonus code make it worth it. Will be signing up!]]></description>

GO MOM!!!

Oddly enough similar to mine too a few years back when her advisor told her - &#039;What are you waiting for?? You could have stopped awhile ago.&quot; Haha.... (My mom - and my dad - finally pulled the cord shortly there after... even though it&#039;s super weird to not be saving/investing anymore and now *pulling from it*, as my dad laments :))]]></description>

Jennifer, I had this very same thought!
My mom finally met with a financial advisor for the first time at 58 (I&#039;ve been trying for years, but it&#039;s been a process) and he outlined that she&#039;s actually in a lot better shape than she thought between her pension, social security, and mandated state retirement. She won&#039;t have a crazy amount to spend in retirement like she wanted, but she can definitely live comfortably and go on vacations once a year without changing much of her behavior. The crazy part is prior to that meeting, she firmly believed she could never retire, when she was on track to retire at 65 this entire time.]]></description>
