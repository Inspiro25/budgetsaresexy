					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s unfortunate.  Would be interesting to actually *know* the founders and hear their side of things.. if they even own it still.  If they sold/merged it wouldn&#039;t surprise me then.  The people who build it usually care the most and can go 100% pure business ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[JMoney, I know what you mean about adventure when it comes to finding places to eat.  In fact, if it weren&#039;t for a sense of adventure I would not have found the best burger in town (except what I make, of couse) and for the lowest price at a local tavern.  Apparently, checking out bar food is worth it once in a while.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - haha, wouldn&#039;t THAT be something?  i&#039;ll have to make a parody for you one day - from my new blogging office! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - yeah, i hear they&#039;re great for restaurants all the time just always like experiencing them for myself and hoping for the best!  haha....  i usually get let down when someone tells me how awesome a place is cuz then i expect incredible-ness ;)  plus, i like the adventure.
@&lt;b&gt;Halahblue&lt;/b&gt; - that makes me happy :)  i really feel like if everyone did GOOD, and not always what&#039;s in the best interest for themselves, we could function pretty damn well as a universe.  we&#039;ll never find out, of course, but it&#039;s nice to dream. haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Burnette&lt;/b&gt; - hmmm.. auto shops!  that would be PERFECT for yelp!  good one... those are hard to come by.
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin I&lt;/b&gt; - WOW.  that is awesome!  i would have totally fallen for it!
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyCone&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that doesn&#039;t sound good.  At the end of the day they&#039;re in business to make money, but def. gotta watch how that money comes in!  Thx for the other side of things, pretty interesting.
@&lt;b&gt;Desi Guy&lt;/b&gt; -  I guess i just don&#039;t like expecting stuff beforehand when it comes to food.  other things, most def!  but food?  i like to be surprised :)  unless i&#039;m like starving, cuz then it&#039;s horrible if you guess wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yelp has surely helped me find the right restaurants when i am in a different city, and have no clue where to go eat :) I found one of the best mexican food restaurant i have been to, using their iphone app.
It saves time and money, and you also know what to expect before hand. The key is to read reviews from registered and trusted users.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually Yelp has been called out on some not-so-honest practices - removal of negative reviews for payment.  A class action lawsuit was filed along with several other lawsuits.

Personally I have no idea who is right.  But Yelp was in the news recently, though not for the right reasons.

					<description><![CDATA[It saved us once when passing through a town on a road trip we wanted to hit a notable local food spot, thinking we found it, we checked it with the Yelp Monocle and found out it was a dubiously named spot made specifically to fool tourists like myself! Drove a few more miles and found the actual spot we intended to hit.]]></description>
