Yup yup... And it&#039;s SUPER easy to move banks too once/if someone does finally find out where the business keeps their cash! Especially since it takes forever to get the legal paperwork done to even pull out the money when you find where it is...

If I recall correctly in my case, I believe our company had already gone bankrupt or was on the verge of it when the case was finally settled, so even if we did track it down there probably wasn&#039;t much left over to even pay us with... Which sucks, but turns out I was one of the lucky ones losing only a paycheck.. Some of my colleagues ended up losing *months* worth when all was said and done &#128579;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is super interesting! I had always heard that once you win a judgment, such as in small claims court, the court gives you the right to garnish their wages or seize money from their bank accounts if they don&#039;t pay. But you have to know where they bank, and I assume garnishing wages opens a whole can of worms. 

It sure would be nice when you do win, they have to pay the court before they are allowed to leave, and then the court disburses the money to you.]]></description>
