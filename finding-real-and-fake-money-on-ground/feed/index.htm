					<description><![CDATA[I think that&#039;s a great strategy.... I guess I would be angry that I was tricked but it certainly gets the word out effectively.

A few months ago I found a 20 dollar bill in a parking lot and no one was around to claim it...

					<description><![CDATA[I was at the casino one night, many years ago, with my then girlfriend and her family. Me and my girl were walking around the casino watching everyone play. We walk around the table games and then head over to the slot machines. Shortly After walking around the machines, i spot a folded up $10 dollar bill hiding in the corner. Trying not to look down and make it too obvious to everyone around me, I made a beeline to the corner. I step on the bill, quickly pick it up &#038; stash it in my pocket. I then find a safe spot to unwrap it. While unwrapping it i discover this $10 bill had two $20&#039;s inside. I didn&#039;t gamble...but i was a winner that night!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is pretty coincidental that this post was written this weekend.... 

On Saturday, I was at Target and I was walking out of the store and found about $150.00 in gift cards to a big box electronic store...I couldn&#039;t believe that people were just walking over these gift cards! I scooped &#039;em up and got a brand new Tablet :)

I find money all of the time...I&#039;ve found many $20 bills--once on top of a book at a college book store, a lot in parking lots. My friends and I were leaving a waterpark and in the parking lot and they BOTH walked over a $10 bill. I bent down and picked it up and laughed at them, haha. 

Anyway....my find this weekend is BY FAR the most I&#039;ve ever found]]></description>
