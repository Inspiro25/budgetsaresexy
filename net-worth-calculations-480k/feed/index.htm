					<description><![CDATA[I love reading about your net worth.  I laughed out loud when you wrote about ignoring the market swings, because really, who needs all that stress and worry anyway? What was your financially free mark again? I looked at the spreadsheet and it looked like it was 2 million.  That&#039;s a lot to live off of! Does it have to be that high? I guess it&#039;s also hard to tell when your expenses will change and what they may become so I am assuming you are doing it off of your current expenses.]]></description>

That&#039;s fabulous! And you&#039;ve already got the hardest/scariest part done - the very first reveal! :) In theory it should all be much happier as time goes on, haha... 

And yes - everyone has a net worth whether it&#039;s negative or not. But the important thing to keep in mind is that you&#039;re actively *doing something* about it. So congrats on getting all over it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! JM!  Increases are always a great thing.  Well done!

Thank you for always inspiring us by posting your own net worth.  Before seeing one of your posts I didn&#039;t think I had a &quot;Net Worth&quot; as I thought this was only something multi-milliionaires calculated.  Now that I have followed your lead and mapped out my own I enjoy watching it rise!  Its still way too low for my age (retirement goals) but Im almost debt free!!!!!!]]></description>

Yes, it does make sense. If I had the money now, I would invest it instead of holding on to it.

That Jim Collins article is right on. I especially like his emphasis on adjusting your psychology to the right investment strategy, as opposed to the other way around. Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our month was not quite as great as yours, but it was still good. $2,500 off the business debt, bringing it down to $15,000 (from an original starting point of $80,800). Looking forward to the day when we&#039;ll be more focused on the growth of our investments! Keep enjoying yours : )]]></description>

You&#039;re right! This is why the rich keep getting richer - their wealth just multiplies while they sleep &#039;cuz of this momentum!!! (well, and other reasons too of course, but it&#039;s def. a factor ;))]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you bring up a &quot;different stage of the journey&quot; as that&#039;s an important thing to keep in mind with this stuff :) We&#039;re all finding our way here at different points in life and at different ages/countries around the world so you can rarely do a fair comparison!

And the $100,000 mark btw is a biggie. I remember it as if it were yesterday, and I feel like things start snowballing a lot more after that point.
