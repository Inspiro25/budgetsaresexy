					<description><![CDATA[I was a computer programmer in my 12th year of a career at a National Laboratory when I saw that issue of the Weekly World News at the register in a supermarket. I bought it and it hung in my office until I retired last May. Started selling off my collection of toys and collectibles shortly after retirement and the Y2K scare issue of Weekly World News sold on eBay for $14.95 in January. Not a great return on my investment but it was cool that it sold at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[June 24, 2001: Turning 10 :)

Probably had about $400 in my piggy bank/pencil box with an eel sticker that said &quot;electrifying&quot; because it was shocking how much money I had! haha I was such a nerd ;) But somehow I was a natural saver, and it&#039;s served me well over the past 15 years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just moved to San Francisco after escaping NYC prison! In corporate housing. Didn&#039;t know a soul, and was on a new adventure. 

Slummed it in a really crappy apartment for 1 year too. LOVE SF and the West Coast. I don&#039;t think I can ever leave.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[June 24, 2001?  

My wife and I were anticipating our trip to Hawaii for our 20th wedding anniversary, and I had just landed a new gig as a high school counselor, so I was going over senior transcripts, counting credits and looking at graduation plans.  Fun Fun!!!

Not a real exciting life, but we sure enjoyed Hawaii!!!  Hard to believe that it&#039;s been 15 years already.

Thanks, J., for reminding me that I&#039;m getting old.  :-D]]></description>
