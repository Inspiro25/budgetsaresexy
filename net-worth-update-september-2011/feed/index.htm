					<description><![CDATA[Oh nice, I love it.  I&#039;d much rather go back to renting too to be honest with you, but a bit too underwater for that yet ;)  Glad you found a system that works for you!  Do you count investments too? Like stocks and 401k, even though their not totally liquid? I use our net worth to show all assets &amp; liabilities over just the liquid stuff.  I think as long as we&#039;re all getting what we want out of tracking it though, we&#039;re on the right paths.  So thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money

I do not count my mortgage. I calculated many times, and there is incentive to buy a house. It is cheaper to rent and live happily ever after.

I have to confess, I invested some money in two apartments, but I paid in full, but I do not count them as asset, either. It is a fall back scenario, to live in them. I will only count the rent I receive : -) 

Historically property prices did not change much, what important is liquid assets and cash flow. I will concentrate on that. Enough playing with the properties : -) Perhaps I will buy parking lot, to make them more appealing as rentals.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;UltimateSmartMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, a lot of people have stopped watching it actually and just log in when it&#039;s time to update their net worth or check on something.  Since I do it every single month though (cuz to me, it&#039;s all rather fascinating!), I have no choice but to see it every few weeks :)  But I really like it that way - keeps me involved and learning.  Even though the times where it&#039;s up is much more exciting, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Independence&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, yeah - keep up whatever works for you :)  Quick question though -- if you don&#039;t count your house as your asset, how do you count your mortgage(s)?  Cuz that&#039;s a 100% true debt no matter how you look at it. (or do you guys have it paid of like rock stars?)
@&lt;b&gt;Walnut&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwwww work it, yo!  That is hotness - congrats! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While the markets sucked this month, I ended the month with a 3k increase in net worth to surpass 60k for the first time.  Plus, I was the recipient of a surprise 10% midyear raise yesterday, so I expect good things in the months to come.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not count our prime residence as an asset. We need a place to leave. If something happens that we need to sell it, it will be a completely different ball game and financial independence is least of our problems at that time. 

But thank you for concise and open discussion here. I am doing the same in my blog - just related financial statements and moves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My 401K value keeps going down...  It&#039;s so sad to look at every month.  I just need to stop looking at it so often.  It looks like you are doing well.  Keep it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Between the husband&#039;s annual bonus coming in and our house actually going up in value on zillow (which has happened maybe three times since I started tracking a year and a half ago), our net worth is up 30g&#039;s this month.  It&#039;s much less impressive than it sounds because that brings our net worth up to $40,000.  I started tracking my net worth in June &#039;10 and my house has lost $100,000 in value since then, so we&#039;re just treading water over here, trying to stop the hemorrhaging.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - My thoughts on that is that it&#039;s always been work &quot;to get paid&quot; over career, at least w/ the younger people I know.  Rarely do I come across someone that actually ENJOYS their work and really wants to do it for a living no matter if they get paid a crap ton or just enough to pay the bills. W/ the exception of my online friends, of course :)  Most of you guys have your heads on straight, as well as all the people I run into at conferences/etc, but in normal everyday land I find most people work for the money, and that&#039;s that.  I&#039;m sure it&#039;s became even more pressing too w/ the latest rounds of economic troubles.
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Khaleef!  And I&#039;m def. not gonna jump in and do all that betting, haha... I&#039;m perfectly content letting the market run itself ;)  Hope to see you again before our next conference!
@&lt;b&gt;Babs&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you do have a point I know.  I just tend to use my Net Worth as the &quot;amount I have right now, at this given point in time&quot; - which means I need to account for the taxes, whether I have them saved or not.  But over time I&#039;m starting to maybe think about dropping it too, and not listing it in either place, esp now that I&#039;m getting used to seeing the &quot;hurt&quot; (I wanted to physically watch it build and drop so I could let it sink in that it is, indeed, REAL, but I think I&#039;m finally okay with it :)  So who knows.  Maybe I&#039;ll actually listen to you for once! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, we all got problems - they just differ ;)  Anyone here CAN get to the amounts I have saved up, but most people don&#039;t want to put in the hard work for it, haha.... it&#039;s the same thing as those celebrities who get rich and famous &quot;over night.&quot;  They&#039;ve actually been doing it for yeearrrrrrrrs, but only now did they get all mainstream!  I don&#039;t gear all this to you, specifically though - you guys have your head on straight - but just the others out there who wanna hate and make up excuses why they aren&#039;t where they want to be.  All you gotta do is use focus and TIME to your side, baby!
@&lt;b&gt;Justin Wright&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, exactly.  Great mentality to have though!  If only we had MORE MONEY to invest in them! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... are you offering? :)]]></description>
