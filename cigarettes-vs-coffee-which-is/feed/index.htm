					<description><![CDATA[I actually got that &quot;1 pack a day&quot; average from researching around a bit. It could be wrong of course, but I&#039;m still not convinced coffee costs the same as cigarettes.  All my comments here from last year were erased from my Wordpress conversion, but what I failed to mention was the health-risks involved too.  More times than not a smoker will also pay higher health bills over the course of their lives than those who just drink coffee.  Regardless though, doing either costs a lot of money over time...not saying people should stop or anything, just pointing it out as it seemed interesting to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is totally bias! You are comparing the annual cost of a pack a day smoker who is obviously in the throws of a full on addiction, to a person who buys 1 cup of coffee a day.
Addiction wise, there is no way a person who has 1 coffee a day (occasionally skipping a day or two) like you said, is on par with a person who sucks down 20 cigarettes in a day.

When the comparisons are even, you&#039;ll find that monetarily speaking, there&#039;s no real difference.]]></description>
