I personally haven&#039;t tried it, but from what I hear from others, NO it doesn&#039;t. They have a pretty strict sensor on what qualifies, and sometimes even REAL DD&#039;s from employers don&#039;t trigger and you need to open a ticket *each month* to correct it.  Pretty killer interest rate though still if you can swing it.]]></description>

Hey I would check out Porte Bank. Although it says direct deposit $1000 each month to earn 3%. A normal deposit works.

T-Mobile money also offers a checking that gives 1% APY. If you&#039;re a T-Mobile customer you can get up to 4% on the first $3k after making 10 debit transactions a month and 1% on the rest.

One finance bank also offers a 1% savings up to $5k without doing anything.]]></description>

Definitely needs to be a paycheck vs. just an ACH transfer from bank --&gt; bank to qualify.  Most employers allow a split of paychecks to a few different banks. Either a % split, or sometimes a specific dollar amount.
I know what you mean about the security and insurance aspect. As with any start-up, fintech banks are probably mostly concerned with meeting the minimum possible regulations first to get their product out the door. Any additional effort/money spent on security might be overkill for a company just starting out.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing this! I know there&#039;s a feature where you can &quot;dispute&quot; transactions and prove that they are technically payroll related. But, I think this needs to be done every single month, and it&#039;s approved at their discression.

I agree that if it&#039;s too much of a hassle (or required additional paid software) it isn&#039;t really worth it!  Churning is an option (many other banks unofficially approve ACH transfers as payroll deposits).]]></description>

Chime is a good one! SoFi is the other one my wife and I did recently. I think it&#039;s $50 for those also, very similar to Chime. (Pretty sure my Chase ACH counted as a DD FYI).]]></description>

Ally was crushing it for so long, but I know many people that are pulling out now and looking elsewhere too. I think there&#039;s gonna be a good shift over the next few years if these new fintech banks can offer good rates like this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be honest, even though I do have quite a bit of cash, I don&#039;t have a lot of trust in most fintechs.  Some of them are starting to offer accounts that are FDIC insured by partnering with existing banks, or maybe by qualifying on their own.  However, it doesn&#039;t seem as clear to me that they are regulated by the FDIC and/or Federal Reserve.  I would really prefer that oversight as it can protect my information and data security more than &quot;suggested best practices&quot; that are often shorted in order to meet shareholder/investor/owner value goals.  The banks (online and traditional) that are regulated don&#039;t just put in stringent systems and controls to protect their reputations, they do it because they have to in order to keep being a bank.  That doesn&#039;t mean fintechs won&#039;t one day get there.  That being said, your suggested trick with the deposits is a good one.  Especially if you can get your employer to split the pay check.  I&#039;m sure there is some fine print about the deposit needing to come from payroll vs being a bank to back transfer initiated by the customer.  Thanks for keeping an eye out for new ideas.]]></description>
