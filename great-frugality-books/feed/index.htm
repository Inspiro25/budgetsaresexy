					<description><![CDATA[I was able to get my car fixed using savings vs trying to find the money in the budget. I spent 2 hours fighting with my cell phone provider to get my bill as low as it&#039;s supposed to be. I severely limited my excess spending to about a third of last months spending!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[RATS I missed this yesterday but I&#039;ll answer anyway. We took our first vacation in 14 years. Road trip to Savannah. Packed the cooler with food/drinks so we paid no $$ for meals the first day. It was National Donut Day (June 1st). We stopped at Dunkin Donuts. They said they never heard of it. But Krispy Kreme down the street gave us 2 free donuts. When I got home I emailed DD Corporate Office asking why they advertised Nat&#039;l Donut Day on the radio/tv but their store knew nothing of it. They apologized &#038; sent me a $5 gift card for a future purchase. Also, we booked an admission online &#038; saved $8 on a bus tour. Today I got 2 tubes of Colgate toothpaste FREE. They were on sale for $1 each at Harris Teeter. I had 2 coupons for 50 cents off each. HT doubles all coupons under $1. I only paid 6 cents tax for the 2 tubes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I received a free week trial of a dinner delivery box subscription, which gave three dinners for my husband and I completely free of charge! I cancelled after the trial, so I won&#039;t be charged later. I&#039;m also starting a second batch of quail eggs in the incubator, which we will either sell when they&#039;re older or keep for additional laying hens. They cost less than $0.03 per day to keep, and their eggs sell for upwards of $0.10 each if fertilized or $0.05 each for eating. The quail sell for $4 each, full grown, but cost about $2 to raise. Not a ton of profit margin, but it pays for the upkeep of our personal laying hens and the quail we keep for ourselves to eat. It&#039;s just a small part of our mini farm, but it&#039;s hard to beat nearly free organic food!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I now make sure to take my lunch each day. I work in Boston MA and take out lunch is no less then $10. If I don’t bring my lunch I don’t eat and have to wait till I get home. This gives me the push to make sure my luck is packed each night.]]></description>
