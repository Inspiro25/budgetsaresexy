					<description><![CDATA[I know!  I leave and then get slammed by these spammers - they&#039;re getting better over time ;) But I have a few tricks up my sleeve - we&#039;ll see if that fixes it.  Sorry for the annoyance! I&#039;m deleting them all now...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money, your absence is conspicuous!  I would be so content right now if I&#039;d had access to your controls so I could have annihilated all the spam posts.  I have an old blog that I largely ignore, but on occasion I get a notification of a post that turns out to be spam.  I love being such a disappointment to the spammers.  They don&#039;t last long anywhere that I have control.  You need backup staff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Kathryn C&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooooh yeah that would be super annoying!  sucks someone&#039;s treating ya like that :(  very interesing issue though - haven&#039;t heard that one before.
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - This is true!  And you can always take on a side gig too to bring in some extra cash if the main gig you love doesn&#039;t do the trick.  Just a matter of priorities.
@&lt;b&gt;Little House&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  For sure... MUCH better to make the switch with some hefty savings in the bank. Let&#039;s you be a bit more risky with the perk of being more comfortable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Been there, done that and still alive to tell about it. ;) Over 10 years ago, I quite a 9 to 5 job that I hated. I helped my husband build up a business and then went on to working part time as a substitute teacher. The only drawback was that I HADN&#039;T saved up a ton of money before making my decision. Which led to a bunch of financial disasters. However, now that I&#039;m much wiser, I&#039;ve figured out how to save money on an erratic income. It just takes time to adjust and get a budget in place (tracking and averaging out income and expenses over a couple of years helps.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kathryn reminded me of that line, &quot;Do what you love and the money will follow&quot;.  I find that totally not true.  If you want money to follow you, you have to follow It - and doing what you love might not be according to the rules of money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[go for the dream job, but don&#039;t complain about not having money if your dream job doesn&#039;t entail making $$$!! There&#039;s nothing worse than someone who chose a job because they&#039;re &quot;passionate&quot; about it (but it pays little $$),  but then they snark at you when you take a nice vacation because you chose a career that pays more, but you&#039;re a little less passionate about it. I&#039;m getting heartburn when I think about this......can&#039;t write any more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can totally see that.  Once I accomplish something myself, I can go a cple months being happy but then I feel the urge to 1-up it and keep pushing forward.  I love that about myself (as I&#039;m sure you do to!), but I also hate it ;)  Sometimes I feel like I can&#039;t appreciate what I have at any given time unless something crazy puts it i perspective for me.]]></description>
