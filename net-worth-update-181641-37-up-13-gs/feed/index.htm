					<description><![CDATA[GOOD JOB Sam!!!!  Keep doing that too, you will be SO MUCH better down the road starting out now :)  And yes, sadly my employer nixed the entire 401(k) plan altogether.  I can&#039;t even contribute $1.00 if I wanted too.  #FAIL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J,

Love the site like a fat kid loves cake. Did your employer end the 401(k) completely or just stop matching?  My employer only matches 25% of the first 6% of my salary, but even though the investment options are mediocre I contribute 15% to avoid paying taxes. (15% is the most I can contribute and still contribute big $$ to my Roth). Since I started reading this site I&#039;ve been tracking my net worth and it&#039;s nice to see the number tick up a little more because of tax savings.  So far this year I have an extra $1k in my account because of my extra un-matched 401(k) contributions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good points J- I did not realize you were underwater as this would obviously cause you to be unable to re-fi.

On another note, I read this blog every day and am EXTREMELY impressed with your retirement savings and your boat loads of liquidity!  I strive to get there myself someday.

Congrats- and thanks for the inspiration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly, 

I read some good information on Depositaccounts(Dot)com, its a website that is comparable to bankrates(Dot)com but actually in my opinion alot better. Just go there and search for CD ladders and read up on how to structure it so that you can see your options. As far as the penalties go it depends on the institution and it varies, but I heard that some dont even charge. Hope this helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone!  It&#039;s definitely nice when all your hard work pays up over time... even if non-directly like this month ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Uncle El&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, you&#039;re totally right dude.  I&#039;ve been laxed on just letting it sit there for so long and honestly never think about it.  In fact I still probably won&#039;t touch it for a while until more time frees up and it becomes a priority :(
@&lt;b&gt;DD&lt;/b&gt; - How wonderful! I LOVE hearing that it helps other people! :)  I know how much it helped me so I&#039;m really glad it&#039;s getting passed around.  Thx for letting me know!
@&lt;b&gt;James&lt;/b&gt; - You two would know ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Right?  If only we can find a suger momma to lend us a few Hundred Gs interest-free ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Trina&lt;/b&gt; - YES YES YES!  I recommend EVERYONE and their moms track their net worth every month. For two reasons:
1) It&#039;s good to know where all your money is no matter if you have -$56,000 or +$5.3 million! *Knowing* allows you to make quicker decisions and plan better.
2) You can&#039;t track your progress (or problem areas) if you don&#039;t pay attention every month.  You gotta compare the current w/ the past and see if all looks good or if you need to make some changes.
3)  (just remembered this one) It helps psychologically!  I started spending less and trying to figure out ways to save MORE because I knew I&#039;d be calculating it again in a few weeks!  And would be really pissed if I did poorly ;)

And also, I&#039;m not big balling ;)  But I am more comfortable after working hard all these years.

@&lt;b&gt;Doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - We motivate each other Mr. Promotion man! It&#039;s kinda like our football teams too if you think about it. The skins are always 1 step ahead of your Eagles ;) ooooooooooh...

@&lt;b&gt;S W&lt;/b&gt; - I see your point, but I can assure you no disasters are looming ;) A few things:
1)  I can always use my cash at any point in time to pay it down.  So if something crazy were to happen for some reason, I&#039;d have some coverage
2)  It&#039;s a fixed rate.  
3) I couldn&#039;t refinance even if I wanted too - we&#039;re too far underwater.
4)  It allows me to be more flexible.  Other mortgages would require me to pay a couple hundred more every month whether I wanted to do it or not. Interest-Only allows ME to choose, like these past 12 or so months when my priorities is banking the cash instead.  
5)  I&#039;m pretty good at paying off extra when It&#039;s my goal.  This is not the case for other people, but I have total confidence in myself.
6)  I don&#039;t plan on waiting 30 years to pay it off.  As soon as I have my $50k cash cushion, plus or minus a little more to start my own business, I&#039;ll beging forumulating a plan to kill it much much sooner.

But again, this just works for ME.  It&#039;s a conscious decision while for others it can cause much much more problems than it&#039;s worth.  Does that make sense?  I like that you brought it up though so I could share more :)

@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, way too underwater to refinance.  A plan will be in the works at some point, just not in the very near future.
&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, do it!  I&#039;m telling you, it helps even just psychologically :)]]></description>
