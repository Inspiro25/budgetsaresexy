					<description><![CDATA[I totally want to do some early Xmas shopping now ;)

@&lt;b&gt;The Financial Blogger&lt;/b&gt; - I wish someone would play Monopoly with ME!!! Everyone hates it around here because it &quot;takes too long&quot;... And the worst is when people quite in the middle of a game too, you gotta finish through! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Maybe he&#039;d put it on the wall? I&#039;d totally do that if I got some crazy awesome one... In fact, I have some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/N7DzuoQRlI/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;old stock certificates&lt;/a&gt; I picked up at yard sales over the years, they&#039;re just not matted and framed or anything.  And would look mighty silly just being stapled to the wall, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I did see similar glasses like that on Amazon too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, why you taking so long, go and buy it! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sean @ One Smart Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - Would suck if you paid all that money for it though and then you killed it! Knowing my luck w/ them I would :( 
@&lt;b&gt;Em&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome! Go for it!!
@&lt;b&gt;MakinSense Babe&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, and it&#039;s not fake ;)
@&lt;b&gt;SMB&lt;/b&gt; - YEAH! $2 bills are awesome too :)  And cheaper than the rest, haha... maybe you can do both over time? (BTW check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/two-dollar-bills-savings-trick/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recent post on $2 bills&lt;/a&gt; too if you haven&#039;t seen it already.)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! That is awesome!! And weird?
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah put them up!! They&#039;re super cool and you&#039;ll look like a pimp ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Did you really? Are you going to send me one too? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - I think it&#039;s all electronic these days. The certificates are probably just for show (though I could be wrong).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny, I have two stock certificates at home that I just leave in my safe...  Guess I never thought of hanging them up.  Of course they value of them is a little more than something I just want to leave on the wall.  But a single share might be fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I keep a money tree in my office just to bring me good luck! This is perfect timing as I&#039;m trying to come up with some birthday/christmas gift ideas for the nieces and nephews. I&#039;ve been leaning towards getting them $2 bills thanks to you, but I&#039;m looking at the stock certificates and that place mat now too. I&#039;m the financially responsible sibling, so got to pass on the interest to the little ones!]]></description>
