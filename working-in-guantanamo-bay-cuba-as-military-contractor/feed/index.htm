					<description><![CDATA[I am currently deployed here to GTMO.  It is my 3rd deployment here since 2014.  My first 2 deployments there was no cell phone and the internet was horrible at best, but the government has finally installed the long awaited for fiber optic line and we have great internet.  T Mobile is also here so I have a T Mobile phone and it works as if I were in the states.  Same issue with the shopping and flights are still bad but they fly every Tuesday and Friday.  I am retiring from the Army soon so I am looking at contract work here and will bring my family back with me the next time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was trained at gtmo on ground combat in defence of the bass. It was e company. We would be called to the hills for a defence exercise and set up in bunkers for a day just looking at the cubans across the minefields. Gtmo is the biggest minefield in the world. I manned a M60 machine gun some times I was just a rifle man. We had ww2 M1 grands no M 16s . The thing that I didnt like was the spiders in the hills. And the heat. I loved the fishing. What I miss to this day was the stubby beer and those wonderful grilled Polish meat with cheese on grilled bread.One thing that I didnt miss was standing in line at the mess hall staring down at the ousters the guys would spit coming out after breakfist. You had to have a strong gut in those days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was stationed there for 13 months. In Gtmo you had to make your mind small in other words involve yourself in reading go to movies do sports fish just keep your mind busy. I was in the Navy and worked on bay hill compartment cleaning . On my off time i developed a boxing team and trained some good fighters. We fought the marines at camp Buckly and kicked there ass big time. I trained my boys to pick them apart and it worked and I have the pictures to prove it. The officer that headed the navy team that never came to a training session was Lut. Trojen. But he was there to except the trophys that I was supposed to get. lololo He called himself the coach. His new name was trophy Trojen. In Gtmo you just had to keep yourself busy.]]></description>

Michelle,

Hi, 
They are hiring now like your post Store Clerk ... But I don&#039;t know in your Country who is recruiting applicant for GTMO.

In the Philippines there is a Recruitment Agency hiring workers to work at US NAVAL Base in Guatamano.

Regards]]></description>

Hello Joy,

I am excited to work in GTMO. I already send my application /CV to the recruiter in the Philippines. He said to me he will send my CV to the employer in GTMO. I told him I am here in Qatar but I will be leaving on April 28 back home to Philippines.
Joy can you share me  some info about  Lifes and works inside the Base.

Thanks You ...]]></description>
