There we go!!! That&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about, brother...

Big pain today, not even noticeable later :) 

How are those waves today, btw?]]></description>

Oh cool!!

My next post for tomorrow is all about Emergency Funds too - and more specifically *what* exactly they&#039;re used for :) Some interesting convos are going around Twitter right now that&#039;s making me think a bit differently about things...

Though sorry to hear about your pup :( It&#039;s still never fun whether you have the money or not!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just got done selling some ETFs a financial planner had me buy about eight years ago… As soon as I bought them, they immediately lost over half their value, and then sat there for the next eight years of the same price. So I secured of a loss of about 10,000 in my IRA’s, but at least I’m not holding onto stinkers any longer. I should’ve done it long ago! But “locking in” a loss in stocks, even in a retirement account that has plenty, felt not great.  So Thanks for this timely post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We had to spend over 1000$ last year trying to figure out why my dog was vomiting and diarrhea after Vaccines and Spay. She could not hold anything down and it was a month of visiting the Vet pretty regularly and having exploratory tests done out of pocket.  

We had the money to cover her bills and she eventually had to go through many allergy pet foods to be Ok, but this ordeal showed us the importance of having an emergency fund. 

In Your previous post you break down several bank accounts for different purposes. We also do this and have accounts  for house maintenance, emergency, vacation and car.]]></description>

As someone who is fostering a dog for the first time in their life, I can totally see that :) We&#039;ve only had her for two days now and already feels like a part of the family! Which is good or bad depending on what happens at the end of the week foster period, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great perspective question, J$!

I looked up our old Quicken data from our journey to financial independence-- we had at least one of those $1000 &quot;surprises&quot; every year, and sometimes two.  It only amounted to less than 1% (two months) of our time to FI, which was only noticeable in the math and not in our in our feelings about needing a few more paychecks.  17 years after retirement, those expensive speed bumps are not even a blip on our radar.]]></description>
