					<description><![CDATA[Ouch - so glad you were safe after that!

Have you tried doing a &quot;no spend&quot; month? Where you can only spend $$ on bills/food/necessities? That one challenge for me changed my whole outlook after doing it 7 years ago. Not only have I since been saving $200/mo from what I learned (mainly - don&#039;t go to the mall when you&#039;re bored!) but it totally changed my habits and mindset. I&#039;ll still splurge here and there, but it&#039;s always *consciously* now.

(And the F+ was due to me writing all in CAPS which improved legibility :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[... so what happened in 2006 that resulted in the F+ in handwriting???
My resolution this year was to stop spending so frivolously, since i barely broke even last year, and that was with a cut in the hours i&#039;ve been working starting last summer. It went surprisingly well in January, but the last couple months haven&#039;t been so good. But since I wrecked my car a few weeks ago, I&#039;ve really cut down on spending since I know I need to replace it. (life advice: hitting the possum will do less damage to your car than ending up upside-down in a ditch. it will also be much less terrifying. also thank GOD i always wear my seat belt)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great question. (And by the way: I get the same - failing - grades for improving my handwriting:).

I am dedicated to becoming a really good writer and kung fu practitioner. My business activities are designed to support them!]]></description>

I agree the boredom fear can be high. I left my phone at home the other day on purpose when running some errands, and it was nice to just *think* whenever I had down time waiting in lines or at the lights, etc... we don&#039;t have to fill up every free moment with a screen!]]></description>
