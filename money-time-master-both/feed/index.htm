					<description><![CDATA[Great read! I struggle so much with my budgeting and trying to save money when I am with my friends. They always want to go out and eat or go somewhere that costs money, and I don&#039;t want to miss out! I read this article, https://www.ez.insure/landing/2021/06/being-firm-about-your-finances/ that had some great tips about saying no to them so I can save more. I am struggling and still trying but it had great tips. What do you think I should do? Advice? haha i don&#039;t want to not see my friends but I need to save more!]]></description>

Great quote Kae! I know what you mean about mastering time management - just when you think you&#039;ve got it, stuff changes and you have to figure it all out over again. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also love that $$ vs Time chart! I&#039;ve been super into time management stuff for the last few years. It fascinates me and it&#039;s one of my favorite topics. Still don&#039;t feel I&#039;ve totally &quot;mastered&quot; it, but maybe moving in the right direction at least?? It&#039;s easy to slip away from you if you&#039;re not super careful. I really want my life to feel very intentional, although some days it feels more like treading water, what with kids and jobs and all. :) I read a quote in a book the other day I really liked that said something like, &quot;The minutes of our life are a concrete and valuable substance- arguably the most valuable substance we possess.&quot;]]></description>

I felt the same about vacation time. Also I was in sales so when you take vacation, you don&#039;t make any sales (nobody does your job for you while you&#039;re out), and your income drops. I missed many fun trips because I was too focussed on income. Changing that now though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, it&#039;s sickening my average screen time on my iphone 3+ hours a day! Given, it&#039;s usually 5- 10 minutes, so it&#039;s hard to notice. I almost gasp every time I get that little notification on my phone. 

I could work out, cook dinner, and probably clean my entire apt in that amount of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Diversify your life is an excellent turn of phrase. The first aha moment for me in terms of time tracking is this god forsaken screen time tracker on the iphone. My goodness do I need to stop staring at my device! Excellent tips. I used to be hesitant to take my vacation time for fear of looking like a slacker at work, but I have since shed that fear.]]></description>

Yeah, that is why I just built my own spreadsheet. There are apps that can track what you do in the computer, but they are still wildly inaccurate as to what you are actually working on,

I highly recommend tracking your time though, I even released a version of my spreadsheet on my site a few weeks ago.]]></description>
