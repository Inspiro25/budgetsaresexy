					<description><![CDATA[Thanks SO much for this post!

Not only was it hilarious (especially the Bill Gates bit), but it was exceptionally reassuring to people like me, who dedicate $30 a month (IF THAT), to the clothing portion of my budget. 

I may not have the best or most expensive clothes, but guess who&#039;s well on their way to paying off all her debt!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for the post Babs!  REALLY glad to hear positive feedback here.... that column is getting closer to being real ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Darla&lt;/b&gt; - YES!!! &quot;At the end of the day – I can relax knowing I don’t owe anyone anything… even explanations… &quot;
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie, Miss Delish, Well Heeled Blog&lt;/b&gt; - I agree too with that actually - that you can want nicer clothes other than to just show off.  I&#039;ve been starting to buy higher quality too lately.
@&lt;b&gt;Maria, Rafiki, Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Good to know!! I&#039;m really considering it, so that helps me out - thank you :)
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... that comment was cute!
@&lt;b&gt;Sophie&lt;/b&gt; - Maybe it was a crystal one? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, a friend of mine by way of being the wife of my fiance&#039;s best guy friend is pregnant. YAY for babies! BUT, she wanted me to help her with choosing a chandelier for the nursery (don&#039;t get me started on THAT). She said one was crazy pricey, and the other was more affordable. She showed me one, and I asked how much it was $100.00. I pretty much blew my top! $100.00 for a chandelier....or a nursery?!?! Then I found out that was the &quot;affordable&quot; one. Oy vey. I understand kids are expensive...but sheesh! I told my fiance that I don&#039;t think we need fancy furniture and a chandelier for our future kids; money for their future is so much more important. Neither he nor I had fancy things growing up or now, but life is GREAT without them. &quot;We got heaven on a paper plate&quot; -Roger Clyne.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Babs, a movado watch I do not have, but I have been saving for one.  But then again, I love watches and have all sort of them.  Michael Kors, Skaagen, D&#038;G, Burberry... Yeah, I am a bit obsessed with my watches.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, what a fun read!! Hmm, aspirational spending. I aspire to .... er .... look cute. But I don&#039;t think I need to spend money for that. I think I just need to stop eating so much darn ice cream.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s all a matter of values - spend on what matters to you and what makes you the happiest (and won&#039;t drive you to the poorhouse, of course). There&#039;s nothing wrong with aspirational spending on things that bring you more joy and that you can afford.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to all for your comments.  I enjoy sharing my ideas, especially when it enables J$ to keep goofing off on the road--hearing YOUR thoughts is just the icing on the cake.

Brandon, Molly, Maria, Jenna and Rafiki:  thanks for your kind words.  If I was 40 years younger, you&#039;d all be my BFFs.

Stephanie, I hear ya on Sam, definitely scratched my head to see him on a list of aspirational brands.  I feel so sorry for the poor drinkers with nothing better to aspire to.  (Note to SA corporate lawyers--I&#039;m not hating on you).  

Miss Delish:  I totally agree with you and Stephanie, buying a few quality items isn&#039;t the same as aspirational spending.  I myself have forsaken cheap t-shirts for more classic styles.  But I&#039;ll bet none of us has a Movado watch!

Darla, I prefer to characterize my thoughts as &quot;rant&quot; not diatribe.  But really dear, let&#039;s stay on the moral high ground.  Relax, smile and say to yourself, &quot;I&#039;m gonna be rich and you&#039;re not--neener, neener, neener!&quot;  Doesn&#039;t that feel better?  :)]]></description>
