					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/my-a-ha-moment-accumulation/#comment-138882&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

Well this is the first post in my &quot;how to get a free car&quot; series (It is completely legal, and for USA users Nectar points are accumulated on a loyalty card that you can use in supermarkets and on ebay in the UK.) http://yourbudgetoryourlife.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/my-mad-plan-to-buy-car-using-only-side.html

I have done 8 updates showing my progress since that post, read it if you get a chance! :) I dont know if you remember but I was the guy that did the side hustle post on here &quot;I wash cars&quot; :)

Cheers

Cameron]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for joining the movement! I love your money a-ha because it&#039;s so simple and one so many people miss. It&#039;s really a shame that so few people realize what a 401k even is or why they should care. And this is why -  &quot;Your stash can only grow once it’s *started*. SO START IT NOW no matter what stage or age you’re at! It doesn’t have to be via 401(k) either, put it wherever you want as long as you KEEP DOING IT.&quot; I can&#039;t even count how many times people have told me they regretted waiting to invest in their 401k. I always hate to tell them how much money they lost because they waited and how much of difference that money could have made. Thanks for your support of The Financial Literacy Awareness Carnival and helping spread the word!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great explanation for how the 401k works.  Here is how I once described a 401k to a financially illiterate friend of mine.  &quot; If you don&#039;t contribute up to the matching amount of your 401k you will be poor forever. If contribute up to the matching amount of your 401k and leave it in there you will be poor until you retire. &quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, thanks for this post, I really needed to hear this today after a dilemma I have been having this weekend, on my blog posts I am attempting to get a free car, (A Fiat Panda Sisley 4 x 4 no less!!) and my dilemma has been whether to use some of my savings money to get further with some of my short term projects, such as building a large hut and a wooden double garage from scratch (I will be blogging about these soon)

Youve saved me from dipping into the pot and reaching my goals later, thanks again J :)
