					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys! It&#039;s taken FOREVER, but the disgust finally got stinky enough. The Adams&#039; family is finally OFF all government assistance, starting May 2014. Just this past week I became gainfully employed, in addition to my husbands full time position...but it took some drastic steps (moving across country, clarifying our goals, etc.) to get us here! I cannot begin to tell you how THRILLED I am that we will NEVER AGAIN be back in that truly sticky (I hate gov. assistance even MORE now) place of depending on food stamps and free health care.  Stop by my new website for the latest....now we need to work on getting fully out of debt and building a BIG future!  Last word to all the doubters, it took us three years to figure out how not to be stupid--don&#039;t give up on all those &quot;lost&quot; freeloaders you know....either they&#039;ll get it one day or they won&#039;t--hatin&#039; on them won&#039;t help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes!  I remember Robert Kiyoaski once said that the poor think talking about money is taboo and off limits (right up there with religion and politics), and rich people talk a lot about money.  If you talk about Game of Thrones, you&#039;ll get into it.  If you talk about money, you&#039;ll get into that too!]]></description>
