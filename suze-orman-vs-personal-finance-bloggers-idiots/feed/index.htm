					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s def. an interesting move, that&#039;s for sure. I don&#039;t know enough to debate her one way or the other, but I do know that you can&#039;t blast people online for everyone to see if you want to remain successful.  It&#039;s just a shame that she looks down on those who goes against her own thinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I think is oddest about her mission to have everyone have a FICO score, and a great one is if you&#039;re that unable to manage your finances that you can&#039;t handle a regular checking account and/or CC, HOW can this card help you? Having a good FICO score with the inablity to handle credit so that you can get a car loan or house loan just makes me think that you would end up with a car repossesion and foreclosure on your house, and thereby ruining your credit for the future. I see no upside to this card, only a way for Suze Orman to make even more $$$$$. 
Sometimes once people get enough recognition they no longer do what they initially set out to do, and start just looking out for #1, this seems to be where Suze Orman is at.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And I just read an interview with Suze in Parade magazine yesterday.  First question: You started out as a waitress.  What did you learn from that?  Suze&#039;s answer: I learned to treat people with honesty and gentleness.  
She&#039;s come a long way, baby!  I know we all say dumb things we regret later...and she gets to do it on a large scale.  I don&#039;t envy her, and now I don&#039;t really respect her much, either.]]></description>
