I can&#039;t even imagine how much that would be worth.... I wonder if they&#039;ve since destroyed them all or if maybe the Smithsonian or some place is showcasing it for history?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the cool factoids I found out about money was that there actually was a $100,000 bill made with President Woodrow Wilson on it. It was only used for transfers between the federal reserve bank though. I imagine if someone saw that in the street they would think its monopoly money as I had never heard of such a high denomination bill before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kudos for finally realizing the importance of reading (online or off-line) :)). I grew up without a computer and barely any TV channels, so reading was one of my favorite entertainments from an early age. Can&#039;t say I regret it!]]></description>

I have no idea, but yeah - the Secret Service is def. doing different stuff these days, haha... I once applied to work for them if you can believe it! I dropped out after interview #2 (didn&#039;t want to be a bike cop in the ghetto), but it was fun to think about for a while :)]]></description>

I would take both policies @slackerjo!  It is crazy to pay that much for each penny produced considering most people give pennies very little value anymore.  The metric system is also better IMO, and it is a world standard.  We do some odd things here in the US.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting fact about the Secret Service; I doubt this accounts for much of their activities now!  Actually, isn&#039;t the FBI in charge of counterfeiting operations?]]></description>
