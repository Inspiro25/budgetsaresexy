Invest early, invest often! :)  The first $100k also build a lot of confidence and reenforces that you&#039;re on the right track. It&#039;s easier to make good money decisions when can see the benefits directly reflected in your growing accounts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is totally true. It was so difficult to reach the first $100K but then it has been a breeze for the following $100K. I&#039;m also able to diversify, invest and reduce risk while bringing amazing compounding returns. The key is to start early and invest in early 20s like I did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J$,

This is one of the best posts about personal finance on the internet, IMPO. Thank you for being a blogger.  You have been a big inspiration to me. I found your website in 2015 and started using your net worth tracker. I enjoy reading your daily emails and of course the net worth updates. Congrats on making it to the double comma club. I remember when we hit $100k, we had a little party and had a bowl of hundred grand candy bars on the table. I am now 50 net worth statement into my FIRE journey. When we started, we were $40k in debt. I’m happy to report we are at the $200k mark and still going strong. I don’t know how you do it without burning out. Thanks for doing what you do! It would be interesting to know the number of lives you have impacted through this blog. However, it is not only the people who read the blog that you have effected, but also their children and their other family members through conversations. Unfortunately, I don’t think this is a metric we could track but it is a nice thought.]]></description>

Posting regularly certainly helps :) 

So does doing guest posts on other blogs and sharing juicy ideas/numbers/stories/etc...

Just did a quick once over on your blog and couldn&#039;t even *find* the blog part? I see the main hello on the front but not the scrolling blog... maybe swap that from the homepage so people can easily find your most recent stuff? 

I do like the name and how clean everything looks :)]]></description>

Thanks J.
I admire how you have created such a successful blog
I do wonder what it takes for my website at www.onceamillenium.com to gain some traction.
Would appreciate any tips! 
Perhaps I am not posting regularly enough haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just hit officially the $100k mark (but I don&#039;t change the value of my home until I refi or sell, so I may have hit it before).

Thanks to the sell we are 100% debt free (except for the next house we buy), and we will have a much better ability to invest going forward.

I am 32 years-9 months, I got my first real job at 24 year 1 month. So that puts me at...
8 years-8 months for my first 100k! 

Looking at the other comments, and at your track, I feel like I am in great company in how long it took me. No it is time to start putting my accumulated resources to better use and get that next 100k in the next two years!]]></description>

Killin&#039; it!

What type of stuff do you invest in? Are you making decent money too or growth mainly based on this savvy investing? Can&#039;t imagine it would be too much longer for you to hit that $3MM at the rate you&#039;re going! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my timeline, took awhile because I was accumulating CASH and was afraid of investing after the Great Recession. Could have made it to $1MM probably 5 years earlier if I had more guts to invest, but took many years off and just hoarded cash during that time. Huge mistake there. Timeline is from 21 years old in 2001 (year I graduated college) though 2019.

$100,000 net worth: 8 years
$200,000 net worth: 2 years
$300,000 net worth: 1.5 years
$400,000 net worth: 1 year
$500,000 net worth: 1 year
$1,000,000 net worth: 3 years
$1,250,000 net worth: 1 year
$1,500,000 net worth: 1 year

Hoping I can achieve $2MM within 5 to 6 years. Hoping to retire when/if I hit $3MM, which I would love to achieve by 52 or 53 if all goes well. Currently 39 years old.]]></description>
