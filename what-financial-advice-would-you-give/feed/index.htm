					<description><![CDATA[Tiger may be worth more than any of us reading, commenting or blogging ... so instinctively, we don&#039;t think he needs advice on every day savings and budgeting. 

Everyone can use self-control in spending and savings. Think of an Olympic athlete. They may be healthy and fit, but would you recommend they go out and eat Mcdonalds every day? My point is even though you have the opportunity to spend, doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s necessary financial healthy.

But, I&#039;m positive Tiger could benefit from professional financial planning advice for estate and tax purposes. Having your financial advisor, tax advisor and estate attorney talk - helps to coordinate a meaningful financial plan. When you rake in a few million a year, most go towards taxes or &quot;other women&quot; rather than a desired and meaningful purpose like kids&#039; education, family trust, etc.]]></description>
