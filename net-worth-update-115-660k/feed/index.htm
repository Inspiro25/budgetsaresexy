					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-update-115-660k/#comment-257077&quot;&gt;Dobie&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;re probably getting my numbers confused with Mr 1500&#039;s numbers who writes for us on Wednesdays :) He&#039;s got $1.8 million net worth and is retired early, while I&#039;m at the $660k and still working on attaining that beautiful freedom.

Tiers of investments -- I do not personally have anything like that set up as my plan is to just keep throwing more money into it when they&#039;re all 50% off in that example, but again I&#039;m not retired and needing to live off it yet. I&#039;d check out some of the FIRE bloggers already there or working on it as they tend to focus much more on this stuff than the daily $$$ life that I do :)

Here&#039;s a handful of them from our Directory, followed by our &quot;best list&quot; which also features some FIRE bloggers:

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m confused.  I see your networth listed as both $1.8M and $660k.  I&#039;m sure house is part, but where can I read where you post the difference in what is tracked here vs your total?  I hope I&#039;m not missing it above.

Second question...as I contemplate FIRE, do you or have you read of a strategy beyond an emergency fund of cash?  Example: Stock market for us crashes, and your VTSAX is at 50% value for 60 months.  Do you have tiers of investments that are more conservative to replenish your emergency fund when it is depleted during that 5 year drought?]]></description>

Smart to change it up like that when you figure it out! I&#039;m 100% in stocks right now like the old you :) 100% in VTSAX specifically, with Vanguard. I may branch out to international and bonds later to have the 3-fund portfolio going as it&#039;s probably smarter, but for now just trying to reap it all in before I get conservative in my old age... Check in again though after this upcoming crash ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I probably say this every time, but that rate of return is awesome! 9.6%!

What is your allocation J.Money? Are you 100% stocks? We&#039;ve got 70% of our portfolio in mix of domestic and international stocks plus 30% in bonds/bank deposits. Early in my investing &quot;career&quot; I had a big loss that made me realize my risk tolerance isn&#039;t as high as I thought. As a result my wife and I are somewhat conservative with our portfolio. Less return but less worry too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J - 

Another positive month from the market, haha.  Great job to reduce expense to allocate more towards experiences, though, has been the big takeaway from your post this go around.   Talk soon JM, and keep the cash flow coming in to continue to build those assets up.  Let the cycle do it&#039;s thing.
