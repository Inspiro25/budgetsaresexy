LOL

The article recommends USAA, but the problem is that most people don&#039;t quality for them. (You need to be a military family).

My advice is to look into every company you can. Even ones hard to qualify for. USAA you might not be able to get, but you might be part of some other club or organization that will get you some good rates. Expect to spend a few hours researching. It will pay off - literally - in the end.  I found $25/month rates (thru Insurance Panda) and $30+ rates from a few other places.  The research really was worth it.]]></description>

Fun fact: take any sort of defensive driving course (online too), lower your cost!]]></description>

Ooh, good reminder! I did know they had something like that but never took the time to look into really. AAA seemed to have dominated the market where we don&#039;t even consider the alternatives! Haha... Adding to my list to check out again though - thx for the note ZM.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J-- late to the party here, but did you know that USAA offers towing assistance for a fraction of the price of AAA (literally dollars a month)?

 I haven&#039;t compared the benefits head to head but I&#039;ve used USAA for both a jump on my girlfriend&#039;s vehicle and a tow for mine and they were speedy and fine.]]></description>

That&#039;s a good idea!! Hadn&#039;t actually heard of that one before, not sure if it&#039;s a thing here in Virginia but worth looking into. Thx for stopping by and checking out the site, glad you&#039;re enjoying it so far :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Surprised you didn&#039;t mention the defensive drivers class you can take to lower it by 20%. You can in new jersey, the tax me state.

					<description><![CDATA[my car insurance has slowly been going up every year since i got it, with no increased benefits to me.   this year i challenged my home and car insurance and got both to come down. i dropped my car insurance from 320 for 6 months to 257, and my home insurance from 550 a year to 301.    a savings of 31 a month, or 376 a year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m adding car insurance to my list of costs to reduce ... We pay $460 every 6 months but haven&#039;t examined our policies in 2 years, so it&#039;s time. Since then, our commuting patterns have changed and we definitely don&#039;t need rental coverage bc my husband works from home and we barely use his car. I&#039;ll keep you posted on what happens!]]></description>

Haha, will keep that in mind :) 

But you&#039;re right - we&#039;ve been with AAA just because it&#039;s been &quot;the norm&quot; but we probably should revisit and see if it&#039;s still worth it.]]></description>
