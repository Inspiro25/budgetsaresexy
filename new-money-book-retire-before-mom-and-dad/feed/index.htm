Awesome to get a copy of &quot;Retire Before Mom and Dad&quot;.  I haven&#039;t won anything in years! Thanks!  :)

Mom&#039;s not quite to &quot;baller&quot; status yet, but she&#039;s working on it.  I threw together a quick net worth statement for her a couple of times and then a few months later she asked when the next one was coming out. :)  So now I&#039;ve made a spreadsheet for her so she can see where she stands every month as well as her history.  I think I have become a good influence. (not sure the world is ready for that)

I&#039;d say her job was equal measure social interaction and income supplementation.

It allows her to get the occasional gadget (iphone, ipad etc.) or take a trip.  Next month we are driving to New Mexico to see the Hot Air Balloon festival. 

We even kicked in a little extra to get the most out of our trip by staying right on site in Glamping Safari tents.  No fighting traffic driving back and forth to a hotel.  Totally worth the extra $$$.

Thanks again,
Gene]]></description>

Damn - 50% is no joke!! Well done!

And yes to being a stay-at-home parent being hard, haha... I only do it part-time myself and some days I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll make it out okay ;)

Thanks for playing along here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dad was a doctor who worked until he was 65, when his group had him age out.  I am incredibly grateful to him for providing for our family, including providing me with the opportunity to receive a solid education and inspiring me to have a strong work ethic.  However, I am equally grateful I did not inherit his financial decision making. Three investments in &quot;get rich quick&quot; schemes cost him close to a million dollars over the course of his career (a fact I did not learn until recently)!

My mom was initially a stay at home mom and later a part time nurse.  Now that my wife and I have a baby of our own, I realize that being a stay at home mom is much, much harder than any 9-5 job.  She is 70 now and still works part time partially because she enjoys helping others and partially because, well, see above.

I discovered FIRE just this year, so I have a ways to go and am helping my parents out along the way, which will increase the length of my journey but with absolutely no hesitation in doing so.  We started to save about 50% of our take home pay, so I am hopeful we can still retire by 50 (we are currently in our mid to late 30s).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My mom was a housewife. My father retired at 55. My husband&#039;s father and mother worked into their early 70&#039;s. 
I retired at 55 and my husband retired at 58 (his was a second retirement- working only to build a nest egg and keep busy). We live on his pension. (Mine don&#039;t start for another three years). We haven&#039;t touched our nest egg. 
My kids each are married living on one income  w/ a full time parent at home. Everyone seems to love their jobs.
 One family  will be FI (barring crazy stuff- there has already been one with cancer) at 42 and the other around 45. They each have three kids who will be in college at that time.  All four plan to be working to pay for state college tuitions.  Who knows what they will do come 2040! I think the world will be completely different by then. We shall see. 
 I hope to give book a good discussion this Christmas- we always spend one night on finance when we are together.]]></description>
