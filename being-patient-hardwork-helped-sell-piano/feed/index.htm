					<description><![CDATA[Ha, this made me laugh out loud cos I too have an old piano sitting in my study, unplayed except by my four-your old and her friends who love to bash on the keys! I was given it by a friend&#039;s aunt who was downsizing so I didn&#039;t pay, but spent the equivalent of $200 on removal and another $100 on getting it tuned. Oh, I was so desperate to learn and had visions of me knocking great tunes and fun-filled nights with friends gathered around, all singing. Two years later . . .  still nothing! Who has the time to learn an instruments when they&#039;ve got a job, run a blog and have a family? I&#039;m still hoping that one day I will though, so my piano&#039;s staying put for now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For my first CL outing I sold all the dishes from my vintage Fiesta collection. Kept the more unusual pieces, but let go of the plates, cups and saucers. Looking at eBay I got a better fix on pricing, and ended up with $225 in my pocket. Took a nice photo of them, just for the memories. No more dusting, and someone else gets to have fun entertaining with all the rainbow colors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - A musical family - I like it! I half-way considered keeping the piano in the off chance our baby liked the sounds from it too, but in the end realized it was a pretty stupid reason to keep it around &quot;just in case&quot; haha... If I ever come out there to visit, will you have Mrs. RB40 play a tune for me? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. K @ Get Worth&lt;/b&gt; - Great!  I still haven&#039;t read The Happiness Project but I&#039;ve heard some awesome things about it. I&#039;m glad it helped you take action!
@&lt;b&gt;Brittany&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhh, haha, that&#039;s crazy... maybe you should add a &quot;free case of beer&quot; along with the kit and see what happens? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it&#039;s a lot more tougher when you can&#039;t budge on the price - that&#039;s usually one of the only things you can control yourself when selling stuff online.  But if she&#039;s not in a rush to get rid of it, I guess you can just keep re-posting for months until the lucky buyer comes along?
@&lt;b&gt;John @ Married (with Debt)&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! That&#039;s a good way to do it :) Never even heard of radio trading before? Love the concept though!
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus III&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well, it does help having a lot of more valuable stuff, or a BIG house, that&#039;s for sure ;)  Or that you&#039;re a hoarder/yard sale addict like me and constantly bring things in!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - I AM!!  I&#039;ve temporarily filled it with more stuff to get rid of, but this time it&#039;s all going in the back of my car to the Salvation Army once I&#039;m back from vacation :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs PoP @Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Free is great, but it also comes with the annoyances of flakers, that&#039;s for sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cat@BudgetBlonde.com&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, that&#039;s a long time! Way to stick with it though and get something you&#039;re comfortable with :)  If only we KNEW the time frame when they&#039;d sell - it would make the patience game a lot easier! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww!!! Good for you!!! And awesome plan your husband had - he&#039;s a keeper ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Dena&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!! Congrats!!! I LOVE the idea of downsizing - feels so good on the brain!! I&#039;d totally come to your everything-must-go sale too if I lived in the area - those are my fave ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Once I wanted to buy a $90 home fitness program. My hubby told me I could - if I did the 15 minute &quot;try-before-you-buy&quot; exercises five days a week for four weeks. He figured if I could do that I&#039;d actually use the program.

I did the four weeks of exercising, bought the program, and lost thirty pounds. I doubt I would have been successful without starting the routine beforehand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome! This reminds me of the time we tried to sell hubby&#039;s schmancy $600 bike. It took us 6 months to get $350 for it but that was great to us considering all the lowballs we got!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, totally here you on Craigslist respondents not being the most reliable about showing up.  (Mentioned it in our post on being landlords today, actually.)  But, it&#039;s hard to argue with free advertising.  

Hope you enjoy the extra space it cleared up!]]></description>
