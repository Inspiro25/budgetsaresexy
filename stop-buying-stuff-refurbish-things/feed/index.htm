					<description><![CDATA[Fun ideas! I love how this is not only a great way to save money, but also a great way to surround yourself with fun, &quot;new&quot; stuff when the feeling strikes you to spend money.

One thing I do often is rearrange my furniture and clean out my closets.  It definitely helps me feel like I&#039;m in a completely new space without spending any money - and sometimes you can actually MAKE money on the stuff you&#039;re clearing out.

Thanks for the article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I won JDs book. But it was all about the shelving! The guy who won built his own house. It&#039;s pretty impressive.

Bo the Sock Monkey can&#039;t drive so he drinks the beer and I do the driving!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I make shelves from busted furniture I get from the garbage. I live in a 1 bedroom apartment and have installed 40 shelves. Yes, 40. It&#039;s a bit of an obssession. Most of the shelves (33) are in the living room and bedroom.  The only purchased shelves are 4 glass shelves I bought over 10 years ago. I made a video for a contest on Get Rich Slowly about how shelving saves me money and you can see it here:

					<description><![CDATA[@Serena - Love your blog! I particularly like your new Thrift Store Thursdays column :) I am happy that you are putting the refurbishing concepts to great use - just look at that gorgeous light fixture you painted!! 

@C The Writer - If you&#039;re feeling particularly handy, you could also apply the tile concept to a new walkway in a garden!! Let me know if you end up trying any of this or have questions!

@Leslie - I am sure it does! The lamp would be a great addition to a room that has a pop-art, 50&#039;s them, no?

@Andrew - I will say, it can take a while to collect wine corks if you don&#039;t drink wine regularly (hey you might be like me and not have that problem :) but I know places like Whole Foods collects them, so I am sure you can grab some from there!]]></description>
