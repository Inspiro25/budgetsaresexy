					<description><![CDATA[I highly encourage (or annoy to the point of exasperation) my friends and family to have a wish list. When they say &quot;but I feel bad asking for specific stuff&quot; I point out that this is all about ME, not them. I could wrack my brain trying to remember that book they said they were interested in 7 months ago, or I could just go to the list and see exactly what it is! I could buy them a sweater that is soooo out of style, or I could shop at that new hip store they really like.

This is the same reason why I think everyone should have a clearly identified favorite color, animal, restaurant, and collectible item. And mention it often. 

@Molly My parents actually received 20 salad bowls for their wedding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude, that&#039;s totally cheating having Mrs Micah there to help you migrate!!  You&#039;re supposed to go through those pains on you own like the rest of us.  Haha.  I was always amazed at how good you made the site look on Blogger.

I keep a couple of lists in Evernote for things I want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, oddly enough the only thing my wife and I argued about during the wedding was the whole Wedding Registry stuff...it was the start of my new minimalism mentality and I just didn&#039;t want more &quot;stuff!&quot; We had a house full of everything we pretty much needed already, and it just felt strange/wrong asking for more.

What we did though, was create a &quot;honeymoon registry&quot; online so that people could donate portions towards our honeymoon!  Cuz THAT we could experience and really get a lot of - and in the end we got enough to pay it off in full so we didn&#039;t start our lives w/ more debt ;)

Then we chose items that we wanted to upgrade for our actual registry. That way we could replace all the older stuff with all this newer stuff we&#039;d be getting.  I would have never saw this coming!  Who knew I wouldn&#039;t want nice new shiny stuff?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As my Mother said to me years ago when she was trying to convince my &#039;why&#039; I needed a wedding registry a mile long, &#039;If you don&#039;t have a gift list your going to receive 20 crystal vases!&#039;.
As Iget older people seem to want to give me gifts that I will actually use and a wish list is a great instrument for that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My mom just asked me what I wanted as a College graduation present. My response? &quot;Brag to everyone in our retard family!&quot; 

She wasn&#039;t satisfied with that and continued to ask until I finally said something about a flashy new awesome video camera and editing software (since that is what my degree is in, Radio/TV) and she was like &quot;DONE&quot;. 

If I had a wish list, I probably could have gotten something else I want or need more. Yes, the camera and software will be cool to have, but I really wish I could have thought of something else on the spur of the moment. Like a trip to Tahiti that I have been wanting for years, yet will never actually pay for myself!]]></description>
