nice! 

that would be cool if single people could throw in more too - I agree :) maybe you can start a campaign on Valentine&#039;s Day and see if you can drum up enough support for it, haha... I&#039;ll share it around if you blog about it! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very smart to max out your Roth IRA - I max out my Roth IRA at the beginning of the year as a birthday present to myself.  As a single person I do wish they would at least double the amount you can contribute annually.  For me I see the most important benefit of a Roth IRA is having the ability to control the money during retirement - meaning there are no required minimum distributions so you can allow the money to continue compounding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did a little more research, and I&#039;d like to revise my response.  Lending Club does have a Roth IRA option, but if I could only plunk down $5,000, I&#039;d probably not put it there because they take a $100 fee out of retirement account for balances less than $10,000. 

However, if I was pretty sure I&#039;d be able to put $5,000 in next year, I&#039;d go with Lending Club because there&#039;s some sort of grace period the first year with a Roth where there&#039;s no fee if your balance is $5,000 or more during the first year, but it goes up to a $10,000 minimum balance the next year.

I don&#039;t think I explained that well, but I think you get the idea. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had to be disciplined and not max out my IRA because I&#039;m trying to pay off the last of my debt..my car loan. I can&#039;t wait till I can completely focus on retirement, investing and savings. Your post here makes me want to really kick it into gear :) 

Also, you could check out Betterment.com which will be rolling out IRA&#039;s in about a month. I attended a webinar with the CEO and it looks really great. I like having more control over my investments but it&#039;s still simple. Hope that helps some.]]></description>
