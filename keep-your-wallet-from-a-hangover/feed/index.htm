@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Dang, son - good for you!
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - What&#039;s sleep? :)
@&lt;b&gt;CityFlips&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s where it&#039;s at!
@&lt;b&gt;B. Myself&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, 1 day a week is pretty decent.  Much better than the 4 from college days ;)  Although back then I had many more cooler stories, haha...

@&lt;b&gt;Ryan&lt;/b&gt; - Says that guy knocking on your door w/ the badge! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jon &#124; Free Money Wisdom&lt;/b&gt; - I will be one to disagree ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m starting to get into more local breweries myself.  Not sure if it&#039;s really cheaper, but it feels better for some reason?
@&lt;b&gt;Amy Saves&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I can&#039;t tell the diff. either... but I&#039;m sure there is one if you were a big vodka drinker.
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie &amp; Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - I would LOVE to make my own!!!  Come teach me how! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - no drinking age??? dang!!!  and heck yeah we got box wine here every now and then - ain&#039;t afraid to admit it, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Man, I never get to hit up BYOB places... I don&#039;t think there are a lot in the DC area, but I&#039;d be a huge fan of it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Boxed wine is my favorite way to save on adult beverages!  So much more economical than bottles, and there really are some good brands out there now.

Also, if you&#039;re doing the dinner thing, look for restaurants that don&#039;t sell wine and have a BYOB policy - they&#039;ll let you bring your own bottle for little or no cost.  Most restaurants will still let you bring in a bottle, but their corking fee would be higher and it&#039;s less of an overall savings.  If you&#039;re not sure, call ahead and ask about their policy.  This is a great way to save, especially if you&#039;ve received the wine as a gift!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Paula:  My friendships have been great lol why do you ask?  I drink one or two beers at the most.  I&#039;ve found it&#039;s actually a necessity to drink to network, especially within the construction world.  One beer away from a new construction contract!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In Australia....no drinking age....you buy wine in a box, they call it Chateau Cardboard. After consuming the contents you can use the internal bladder as a pillow on the beach. Now that&#039;s a cheap night out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Cassie -- Some Canadian provinces allow drinking at 18 and up?? Why, oh why, did I not go to university in Canada???? I was young for my grade level, and couldn&#039;t go to the pubs until the middle of my senior year of university. :-(

@Jenna -- homebrew sounds fascinating! I would make ginger beer ... extra ginger-y.

@Amy Saves -- there&#039;s a Polish vodka called Wodka that recieved great reviews by vodka critics and is much cheaper than Grey Goose -- I did a post about it on my blog:  http://afford-anything.com/2011/03/24/wine-value/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some of the Canadian provinces are actually 18 and up ;)

One way to keep costs down (if you drink a lot of it) is to just make your own. You don&#039;t get the same economy if you&#039;re an occasional drinker, but if you like a couple beers a night with your roommate it&#039;s pretty economical.]]></description>

@Investing Newbie -- why do you restrict drinking only to Thursdays (as opposed to Fridays or Saturdays)??
