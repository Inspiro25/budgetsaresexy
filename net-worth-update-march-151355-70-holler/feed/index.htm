					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing a similar networth calculation as well.  One thing that I&#039;ve been meaning to revise is how I account for 401K earnings (since there&#039;s tax).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way to go on the increase!  We are one month away from our 10K emergency fund.  Never in my life thought I would see the day.  Up next:  Investing {again}.  Can&#039;t wait!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I totally get why you think your coworkers are nuts not to contribute!  I have never heard of a company that has that sort of plan, it&#039;s amazing.  of course, job secruity is nice but you are certainly taking advantage of your situation.

You&#039;ve got a good head on your shoulders!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;laura@nms&lt;/b&gt; - Very interesting, so you just get one set amount once you hit 65?  Does everyone get the same # or are there a lot of variables that come into play?  Or am I just a big moron for not knowing? ;)

@&lt;b&gt;duddes02&lt;/b&gt; - haha...2 things:

1) Oh yeah, they def. know! In fact, it was set up so the big dawgs could max out easier and as crazy AWESOME as our matches are, hardly anyone else takes advantage!!!  So crazy man, that&#039;s FREE money right there on the table...$hit, even if you can&#039;t afford to max out, at least contribute *something* to the post, you know?  Put in 5% and get 5% back, put in 10% or just put in 1% - something!  man...getting all fired up now just thinking about it, sorry ;)

2) It&#039;s an excellent perk, but the trade off is I don&#039;t have job security. I could literally walk into work tomorrow and be told we&#039;ve sold or are shutting down.  I&#039;m going on 4 years now and at this point I feel like I&#039;m on &quot;extra time&quot; - every day i&#039;m here is a day i&#039;m not counting on ;)  But you better believe I&#039;ll be riding it out until it ends!

@&lt;b&gt;Money Funk&lt;/b&gt; - Hell yeah girl!  Keep it up!!!  Looking forward to the post too, I&#039;ll keep my eyes open for it.]]></description>
