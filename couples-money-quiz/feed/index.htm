It is more stressful than my Roth IRA.  But I really love the idea of owning 5-6 rental properties and being able to live off of just that income (even if we have a kid).  All our side hustles and even our online business could be extra that could be divided between retirement savings and fun stuff like vacations.  When we are financially independent, I plan to volunteer more and visit all of my close blogging buddies at some point (I&#039;ve visited 2 so far but have a lot to go).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Who manages your day-to-day household finances (paying bills, deposits, budgets, etc)? I do. He wants nothing to do with it. He and his deployed friends joke that us wives could be chilling in Monaco and they would never know it.
2. In case of an emergency, do you know where your financial and legal documents are? Big honking safe in the living room. Can&#039;t miss it. :)
3. You inherited $10,000. What’s your first instinct? Save half, spend half. Meet him in the middle for a vacation, most likely.
4. Your favorite store is having a blowout sale. What will you do? Can&#039;t think of what that might be. Book store, maybe. Home Depot. Yea, not a big shopper.
5. You’ve decided to refinance the mortgage on your house. Who will take the lead? Just did this a few months ago. His freaking mortgage (he bought the house before we got married, I have no desire to have a mortgage in my name) and you better believe that I read every one of the 7 gazillion documents that came into the house.]]></description>
