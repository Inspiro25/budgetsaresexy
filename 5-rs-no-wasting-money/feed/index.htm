Awesome about all that trading around like that! Thanks so much for passing over my articles to people you know - love hearing that :) Keep working on that debt payoff! You&#039;ll have phases - good and bad - throughout the journey, but you&#039;re gonna be sooooo well off once it&#039;s all done and taken care of. Here&#039;s to a great new year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love your posts, I&#039;m from Canada and send them over to my son and daughter in law. I buy Melaleuca products that save me hundreds of dollars. Eg: mela magic cleaning product, 7.95 and makes 3 large spray bottles, can&#039;t beat that plus the products are non toxic and everything is 100% guaranteed. That&#039;s one way I save money. Because I save animals we trade our neighbours hay for the horses and they use 30 acres of our pasture for their cattle. We trade our eggs for things out of their garden. I feel these are great ways to save money the old way, trade work or whatever so there&#039;s no money exchanged. Thanks for your great advice once again we are trying hard but our debt is high because of my husband losing 600.00 a month in wages and not sure when he will get that back as wage is frozen at the present and not sure for how long.

					<description><![CDATA[Good stuff!  Even small steps start to add up.  Even if you only focus on the small steps, it puts your mind in the right place so that your subconscious directs you to make the smart choices out of habit.  Keep it up!

I saw a great idea on a blog a year ago. The woman took old towels and cut them into 8 x8 squares and sewed around them to minimize fraying and would put them in a basket on the kitchen counter. She put a diaper pail under the sink with soapy water for the used ones. She emptied it every few days.]]></description>

We are trying so hard to reduce our waste, too!  The best substitute for paper towels that I&#039;ve found is a stack of cloth diapers.  The material is super absorbent :) and I keep a stack in a kitchen drawer.  Once they are used, I throw them directly into the washing machine to go through the next time I do laundry.  We&#039;ve been paper towel free for about 2 months now.]]></description>

The thing that works for me is using sponges instead of paper towels OR microfiber cloths. I tried to use microfiber and it was just gross, they&#039;re hard to wash and I felt gross using a clean cloth to wipe up nasty stuff. But with sponges, you can have a dedicated gross sponge for the floor or other areas like that and a basic cleaning sponge for countertops and such. Easy to clean and soaks up wet messes.]]></description>
