					<description><![CDATA[If we are talking about suddenly being teleported to 1900, no way! I am not good at roughing it, and the lack of amenities would feel like a serious hardship. In fact, Id rather make &#060;$50K in modern times than be rich in 1900.

However, if we are talking being born into that reality....I think I might take 1900.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;MariaN&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah!!!  War is horrible, great great point. Even though we&#039;re still living through one now :(  Just a different kind.
@&lt;b&gt;Maggie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah for sure :)  I was actually trying to make a joke... though it seems it wasn&#039;t a good one, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jerry&lt;/b&gt; - Polio is scary man.  Good thing you don&#039;t have it!
@&lt;b&gt;Finanzas Personales&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  Although not sure how you would have come about all that money.... maybe you worked your ass off and still continue to in order to keep your lifestyle ;)  Maybe it takes $700k to pay all your bills!  Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Karen&lt;/b&gt; - Good reason :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yup!
@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - :)
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - You can still go across the world! It would just take a year there, and a year back ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was thinking I would love to go back but then the comments reminded me that I would have many less rights as woman and I would have to give up indoor plumbing and even worse the internet.  I think I&#039;ll have to stay here but I would not mind the $45k raise. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think today... but maybe I&#039;m comming from a modern life contaminated perspective. If you lived back then, I&#039;m sure that kind of money would have allowed you to have the many luxuries that were unavailable for the regular income households, just as today those of us with a regular income have lots of things we can&#039;t afford. It must have also been a very chilled out life!!]]></description>
