Hi Robin,

I&#039;m single and retired also and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/ynab&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;YNAB&lt;/a&gt; to be a great accountability partner.  And found J Money after I had some success.  I highly recommend it, along with their educational podcasts.  I tried regular budgeting and spread sheets, for years and years, but didn&#039;t know enough to make them work.

In 5 years, I went from over spending all the time to having sizable saving.  Things still get better all the time.  Wishing you similar progress.]]></description>

Please do! Once it becomes habit it&#039;s so much easier as time goes on! Especially when the markets are back in full upswing again ;) You could also connect up with a Money Coach who would not only help you stay accountable, but also be a fresh pair of eyes on your goals too?

Here&#039;s a list I curated a few years ago from coaches in our community, and while I&#039;m not sure how updated it is now (I no longer run the site), I&#039;m sure many are still active:

Haha glad I could help! The good part is that it gets easier and easier as time goes on, and one day you&#039;ll realize you&#039;re not even thinking about money anymore :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While the 19 page power point presentation sounds over the top (and really never expected to see another power point presentation after I retired), I would have appreciated someone taking the time to help me work through my finances.  Being single you really don&#039;t have to be accountable to anyone and that can be a problem at least for me.  Only been tracking my net worth for several months and while I was excited initially, didn&#039;t feel that excitement for month of Dec.  Will keep chugging away at it though.]]></description>
