					<description><![CDATA[For me, the first quote by Buffet in this article sums up the measure of true wealth. Arranging ones life in a way one can do what one wants is actually true wealth - meaning having TIME.

I have a small business and some investments, and people always ask my why I don&#039;t do more and grow it even bigger. The answer is always the same - I don&#039;t want to - I like working 20 hours a week, and having all the time for my son and wife.

I&#039;ve just stumbled upon this blog, and I am excited to read what else is on offer. If this article is anything to go by, I will fit right in :)]]></description>

My husband has been having hip pain for the past 3 years. He&#039;s seen many doctors and tried different kinds of PT, but nothing worked. He&#039;s in pain most of the time, which worries me, but we don&#039;t know what to do except for seeing more doctors. Money just can&#039;t seem to fix the pain!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Years ago, I completed a triathlon and afterwards, my friends and I were talking to a guy who was probably about 80. He had a really nice (i.e. super expensive) bike and we were asking him about it. He said that he would rather trade the bike in and do the race in a crappy beater bike just to have his youth back. 

I generally live my life as if I could die tomorrow. And it really doesn&#039;t take a lot of money. I just saw the total eclipse and it floored me. After it, I was thinking the same thing as this article.... that chasing or hoarding money isn&#039;t worth it if you can&#039;t experience some of the natural joys and wonders in life. This is exactly why I choose the blog name &quot;Primal Prosperity&quot;. :)]]></description>

&quot;I think the realization that money isn’t everything – ironically enough – dawns after you accumulate enough money to be called financially independent.&quot;

Haha yeah... Or at least on your way towards financial independence :) I think it clicked with me around the $300k net worth range when the $$ was on track and I started doing more reflecting. Having kids help with that too :)]]></description>

Yeah, it&#039;s like when people say &quot;my time is worth more than that&quot; so they go and pay people to mow their lawns or clean their houses or cook them food. True, their hourly rate could be more, but if you end up just sitting there doing nothing then you&#039;re actually SPENDING MONEY than earning/saving money so it&#039;s not a fair comparison. No shame in relaxing and/or paying others to do stuff you don&#039;t want to do, but then just call it that, right? Not tricking yourself into thinking it&#039;s mathematically better.]]></description>

Only when we were pre-college all we wanted to be was older with money! :)]]></description>
