					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that&#039;s awesome :)  Haven&#039;t heard of an appraisal going in THAT direction in a while, congrats!
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, you got that right.  I lost like $15k the other month and it blew... although I am getting used to all the ups and downs now that I&#039;ve been tracking it for a while now, so I only get pissed/excited for a day or so until I return back to normal ;)  I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s a good thing or a bad thing either, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Ryan @ RppFinancial.com&lt;/b&gt; - YUP!  Go for it - at the very least it helps you stay accountable to yourself :)  Not sure which values you&#039;re talking about, but most of them come from just me logging into my accounts and adding them up, and our cars come from KBB.com and house from my realtor or if a similar house down the street sells and I recalculate it myself.  I don&#039;t trust Zillow really as it&#039;s all kinds of wonky in my neighborhood. Does that answer your question?
@&lt;b&gt;MrsPoP @ PlantingOurPennies&lt;/b&gt; - Nice work!  We&#039;re like net worth twins this month! :) Our HELOC is incredibly low cuz we got &quot;prime minus something%&quot; when we got it 4+ years ago... it was at the peak of the market and started at like 9+% but quickly went down when everything crashed and interest rates fell to a national record... and since they haven&#039;t gone up at ALL over the years, neither does our interest rate on that loan ;) Either way though you and I both are trying to rid ourselves of it so we gotta keep on going for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our nmbers are scehduled to go up on our blog later today or tomorrow, but we had a gain of $12K on our net worth in July!  I&#039;m amazed your HELOC rate is so low. We are focusing all of our extra money right now towards paying down our $38K HELOC as it&#039;s our highest rate - 5.99%, but we&#039;ve paid down $8.5K on it in the last two months, so we&#039;ve got to keep chipping away!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great site.  I think I am going to start adding a net worth tracker myself.  I think it will make some of the tid bits I talk about a little more trusted by visitors.  Quick question though, where do you get the values from and do you specificly list the assets you invest in anywhere?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woah nelly a 12K+ Month is awesome.  Isn&#039;t it weird that a loss half of that would feel doubly as worse as the gain?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you&#039;re back!  Congrats on the new addition, I can&#039;t wait to read about your experiences with fatherhood.  

This month was flippin&#039; fantastic, my net worth has gone up $75,000!!!  How?  I had my house appraised and it came in over 20% higher than zillow had estimated.  So now I&#039;ve got a sweet net worth, positive equity and tomorrow I sign to refinance my mortgage, taking my interest down from 6.25 to 2.75%!  Yes, it&#039;s been a fantastic month indeed.

Now that our net worth is shooting up, my husband keeps trying to take over my spreadsheet.  Apparently, it&#039;s much more fun to track net worth when it&#039;s on the rise!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Nicole C.&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re not alone, I&#039;m afraid, friend.  None of my accounts of cash are getting much play either :(  Depending on how liquid or not you want it you can get into CDs or Money Markets and other like-minded funds, but in the general scheme of things it&#039;s all gonna be low across the board until the main prime rates rise in this country... aka when the economy gets better ;)  So right now a lot of us are out of luck in that department, but in others it&#039;s awesome! (like getting a loan, buying a house, etc etc... rates there are super low too). And I will most def. let you know if/when Love Drop goes back into action :)  That particular drop you mention happen to be one of our all-time favorites too!  It&#039;s been over a year since we did that, crazy, huh?
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMateKate&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! I wonder if that DOES make me worth more actually, good one ;)  And suck-ass on that IRS audit, man... that blows.  You can thank all those assholes out there who game the system and thus makes all of us honest ones have to put up with these checks!  I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll hit me any year now too - odds are against us small business owners :(
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;d LOVE it if all pf bloggers did!  It&#039;s just so incredibly interesting at the very least :)  I imagine a lot of the &quot;bigger&quot; ones don&#039;t though because they make a KILLING on their blogs and it would probably (but not appropriately) piss people off... I know a few that make $30,000-$50,000+ a month and wouldn&#039;t dare put it on their blogs, haha... I&#039;ll welcome that problem the day it comes :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ornella @ Moneylicious&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, that IS what those two second accounts are!  They are actively managed funds that the team at USAA manually handles - not mutual funds that are managed like that (did I say that right?).  Which is why I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s been losing more money over time - because of the fees they&#039;ve taken out ;)  But we&#039;ll see when I get to speak to them on it... though I&#039;m sure they won&#039;t be able to talk purely off the record, especially knowing I&#039;m going to turn around and blog about it! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;K @ Get Worth&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!  It takes a handful of minutes more each month, but it&#039;s totally worth having it all set up EXACTLY like you want it :)  And having a soft copy on your computer ain&#039;t too bad of an idea either - esp if you print them off each month and keep records (which I just reminded myself I need to do - it&#039;s fun!)
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... &quot;for now&quot; exactly ;)  See you at FINCON again this year, my friend?  Give my love to Mrs. Khaleef!
@&lt;b&gt;Sean @ One Smart Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - Well done!  Let&#039;s see if you can duplicate it over and over again now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J$,

Glad you are back in action, man! Well, you are on top of it.  I think your signature changed??? hmm...

Your passive approach IRA is kicking butt. Index funds are much more cost-efficient. In regards to the USAA funds, it might be the fees. 
You may want to consider even active money management (different than actively managed mutual funds...not the same thing).  

Talk to you later!]]></description>
