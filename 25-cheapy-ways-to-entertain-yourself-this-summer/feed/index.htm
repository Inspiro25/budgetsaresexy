					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - What I like about those kinds of articles is that they grab our attention and forces us to think ;)  I don&#039;t always agree with them at times, but for someone to get me to stop and actually read an entire long post like that is amazing.  You&#039;d never see it on a corporate site or newspaper ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Dustin &#124; Engaged Marriage&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, was that yours?  I could have sworn you told me you and the mrs go hunting in the nude...fishing too, right? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those favorite articles of yours are interesting.  Re:  Why immigrants are more successful than  you, I don&#039;t agree.  I don&#039;t think particularly successful immigrants are all about money; rather, they value money and put it in its correct place.  They do the work they are able to do, and in the case of certain immigrants, they do this in order to save and send/take the money where it has much more value than here.

http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/27/immigrant.money/index.html - Old story, but it reflects a real work ethic and good sense of the value of actual work and money.  Americans in general do not aspire to become dishwashers because they consider it beneath them, but they may not have the saving ability that this man has.

As far as rich people being miserable, that article is about miserable work, and could be applied to people at any income level.

Love that list of summer activities.  I like a couple of them ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Amy&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  And I could have sworn I had that in there...at the beach.  I probably swapped it out for SEX or something :)
@&lt;b&gt;Robin&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha....yes, drive-in, that&#039;s the one. Although I just copied &amp; pasted that one in there.  At like 2 a.m. ;)
@&lt;b&gt;michelle&lt;/b&gt; - You might even be able to make some $? haha...what?
@&lt;b&gt;Kimberly&lt;/b&gt; - I agree!  One of Mrs Budgetsaresexy and I&#039;s first dates were at the zoo. It&#039;s great in the Fall too when the weather&#039;s behaving.
@&lt;b&gt;Aury (Thunderdrake)&lt;/b&gt; - Are you making fun of me too? :)	
@&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt; - Naked Bowhunting! haha...now that&#039;s something you don&#039;t hear everyday.  If I ever try it you&#039;ll be the first to know.
@&lt;b&gt;Miss Jane&lt;/b&gt; - Damn, I wish I had friends that talented!  We all just pretend we&#039;re rockstars and go out partying and telling people we&#039;re working on a music video ;)  It actually works sometimes too.  Only thing is none of us can play an instrument which kinda sucks.... one day, though!
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...well obviously you&#039;ve never gone camping in Awesome-ville ;)  There, only good things happen.  I&#039;ll go check out your other ideas but only if there&#039;s a reference to beer. (is there?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[14. Camping. Naked.
Um...mosquitoes???
I recently wrote a post called &quot;14 insanely cheap ways to entertain yourself this summer.&quot; Here&#039;s one that riffs off your second suggestion:
Create your own “drive-in&quot;: Weather permitting, set up a TV in your driveway and screen movies outdoors. Kids are especially delighted by anything out of the ordinary. But don’t be surprised if grown-up neighbors also walk over to see what’s on.
To see the other 13 ideas, go to http://www.donnafreedman.com/2010/06/27/14-insanely-cheap-ways-to-have-fun-this-summer/
And seriously: Mosquitoes! Mosquitoes having at parts of your body that are usually protected -- and that later on are difficult to scratch in public. And don&#039;t get me started on ticks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We call them &quot;Album Nights&quot;, basically getting your musician friends and making up songs on the fly and recording the whole session. Essentially writing an &quot;album&quot;. Good times, silliness, and cheap if you tell your friends to BYOB :) 

Works just as well with acoustic instruments and a porch :)

I&#039;ve been wanting to try the Geocaching thing. Sounds fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What? no naked Bowhunting???? I am soo disappointed in you :P

Geocaching is fantastic!! My boys love it and there are so many spots around here we didn&#039;t even know about. 

It&#039;s times like these I wish we lived in a larger center. Lots more to do for free. Enjoy the camping with your parents.]]></description>
