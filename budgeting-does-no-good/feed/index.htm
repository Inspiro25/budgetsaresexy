					<description><![CDATA[@J.Money

Or you could go REALLY old school with   paper and pencil :) 

Every 1st of the month my wife and I sit down with Dave Ramsey&#039;s Monthly cashflow planning sheet.  Has worked really really great for us and we get some dedicated, uninterrupted hour or so together as a bonus.

And we don&#039;t track each penny....just round everything up or down.  We figure the change evens itself out over the course of the year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi 

I created a Excel based spreadsheet at http://www.easy-budgeting.com after family and friends were complaining about budgeting and how hard it was.

Hundred&#039;s of people worldwide have benefited from my budgeting tool and I thought maybe people viewing this artcile may also find it useful.

Cheers

					<description><![CDATA[Me, personally?  I wouldn&#039;t even bother with my budget if I didn&#039;t track EVERY SINGLE PENNY.  I have been doing this since 2007 in an Excel spreadsheet, and from my point of view, all that work is worth nothing unless I track everything.  Otherwise, what is the point?  Do I have almost $800 to save this month?  or do I have $850 or $900?  As you know, little amounts add up quickly.  For me, the whole reason I budget is so I can look at that number (Earned - Spent) at the end of the month and know how much EXACTLY I can bank towards my latest goal.  It makes it so rewarding to spend less than I earn!

Oh, potato, po-tah-to.  Everyone budgets differently.  Find what works for you, it is the only way you&#039;ll stick with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been tracking every penny for years.  I like knowing where every cent goes and comes from.  But I&#039;m not sure that I&#039;m a budgeter in its &quot;pure&quot; form.  I just try to spend as little as possible, particularly on things that are not a choice.  Habitual saving might be easier if one realizes that he can have something he runs into when he wants it, or if some emergency comes up with a car, it is not a problem.  Emergencies should be expected and planned for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally I don&#039;t agree with #5 (…if you track every single penny that comes in and out.  and I mean that literally – every. single. one.)

This was the ONE thing that allowed me to see in a glance (a) where our total income was going, (b) the places at which we were spending it, (c) exactly how much we were blowing daily and (d) the fact that we were saving nothing at all.  For the past almost 3 years I have tracked our spending daily and reconciled with bank accounts daily. That may sound obsessive but it&#039;s the only thing that works for me.  It has to be in my face constantly.  Daily tracking has been the one thing that has turned around my bad financial habits.  It&#039;s all a matter of what works for the individual.  Alcoholics and drug addicts take it minute by minute, day by day.  Spendaholics are no different.  I agree mostly with your other points though!]]></description>
