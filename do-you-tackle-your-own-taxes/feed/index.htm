					<description><![CDATA[Taxes are my side hustle!!  Seriously.  Its a part time gig, low overhead, and I earn $75 an hour.  There are some costs associated with the gig.  I have to pay the IRS and  CTEC (California Tax Education Council) annually.  There is errors and omissions insurance, paper and ink and a tax software program. There is an annual 20 hour continuing education requirement.  All told I clear $50 an hour, and I could charge more.  I charge an initial $75, which covers the majority of my returns.  Businesses, estates, and people who drop off a box of receipts that takes me 3 hours to organize pay more.  It always feels good to help people get more back.  And for those that owe, I try to identify the specific reasons so they can plan for future years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I like it!  I&#039;m going through memory lane checking out all these comments you&#039;re leaving ;)  Maybe you&#039;ll strike up some more discussion on these oldies since the others was wiped away during our Wordpress conversion... so thanks! (and good luck!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re probably like &quot;Why is she answering old -@$$ posts?&quot; 

Well, the answer, is because I need something to look at besides all the receipts as I prepare MY financial statements for taxes - choke.]]></description>
