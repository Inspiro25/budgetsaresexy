					<description><![CDATA[There have been many jobs I&#039;d have loved to have walked out in style, however I was always to scared to burn bridges just in case anything went wrong in the new job. One of those jobs I had to go back to 3 years after leaving, luckily I had left on good terms and they wholeheartedly welcomed me back - phew!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah Finance Superhero, nice to see you guest posting! I love the end goal of personal finance enthusiasts, they have the power to be completely independent from the employer that income isn&#039;t a huge factor in life. The people mentioned above definitely took a lot of thought in how they want to leave.. I wouldn&#039;t want to be remembered in such a way but to each own!]]></description>

Nnnoope, They didn&#039;t try one bit. :) My bosses boss actually said, &quot;Well, when we said we wanted to keep you and not let you move, Um, I guess we chose wrong there huh?&quot; He was really nice about it, but to say he and my immediate boss were shocked was an understatement. :)]]></description>

Wow, that&#039;s gutsy Paul, but I can&#039;t say I blame you. What kind of horrible person doesn&#039;t allow an absence to deal with a death in the family? I think she deserved to lose a bit of money, to be honest.]]></description>
