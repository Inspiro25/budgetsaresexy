					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/10-or-under-buy-it/#comment-400405&quot;&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt;.

Good point about taking stuff in even if it&#039;s free! It&#039;s never free - it always adds to your stuff (or brain) one way or the other. Hopefully my rule here doesn&#039;t encourage &quot;more stuff&quot; just for the sake of it though :) It&#039;s more about not stressing out about small decisions when it comes to stuff - and experiences (like coffee!) - that genuinely make you happy... We tend to not give ourselves many breaks when it comes to pursuing financial goals and that&#039;s a shame as we&#039;re allowed to live a little through the process! Don&#039;t wanna get burned out or lead a boring life, even with money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a lot of stuff out there for $10 or less, or even free! But there&#039;s the balance of &#039;stuff&#039; in my life. I was at an outdoor event a few weeks ago and there at least 3 tables giving away reusable grocery bags. Only I&#039;ve got about 10 for groceries. Then my mom sews, so I have plenty of bags with sentimental ties to carry non groceries. 
If the $10 item will add to my life and not be a source of stress, I&#039;m in!]]></description>
