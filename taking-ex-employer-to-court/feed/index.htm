					<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone!!! It felt DAMN GOOD being up there today!  Not gonna say what happened yet, but there shall be a new update post about it soon ;) Here&#039;s to sticking up for ourselves!!

@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Amen to that, sister.
@&lt;b&gt;Peliroo&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, for sure.  He seemed really genuine at first, and we all thought he&#039;d do whatever it takes to get us our pay, but as the weeks (and then months) went on, we realized it was a lost cause.  Even *if* the company has no money anymore, at least he could have been real with us and not turn into such a jack a$$.  Some of the people in our suit blatantly caught him lying about this stuff, so F. that.
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Who you calling little? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Funny you should mention that. I learned in court today that we&#039;re going after damages and penalties too - I hadn&#039;t heard that before until we were smack in the middle of it... I&#039;ll tell you all how that panned out soon.
@&lt;b&gt;Niki&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you!!
@&lt;b&gt;Brandi&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, I am both sad AND happy for you!! :)  Much smarter than I was in leaving on your own terms like that.  Good for you.  I hope they surprise you and you get all your money owed! (and watch out for deer still -- this is your weekly reminder, haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;daisy&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you!  And I agree.  One of my other reasons for filing it, and going through with it all, is to make sure they double think at least next time they&#039;re up to no good.  Of course if they just don&#039;t care at all, it&#039;s not going to matter much, but even if it stops ONE PERSON from getting screwed I&#039;d call that a win :) So we see what happens now!
@&lt;b&gt;Jennie Kohl Austin&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh cool, okay I will!!!  You just made my Friday!!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well, I can tell you this.  I def. did something almost-stupid!  You&#039;ll hear about it soon in my next update post :)
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  I agree.  The sick thing is that some people even do this to their friends and family members. I&#039;ve seen people be super cool and loving in social settings, and then turn their backs on them when it came to money or business, etc.  Just unbelievable...
@&lt;b&gt;crashdamage1957&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s an excellent way to put it, my friend - I love it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right???  All Christians(and non-Christians) make mistakes and ofcourse aren&#039;t perfect, but DON&#039;T GO AROUND acting all high and mighty when you&#039;re certainly far from it. It&#039;s not even professional to walk around spouting that to all your employees anyways, regardless of your actions in this world.
@&lt;b&gt;Christine&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you, Christine! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Andrea&lt;/b&gt; - I totally get you on that!  Most of the other people in our suit were bashing Christians because of the way he acted, and it made me feel uncomfortable to say I was a Christian too.  I think that&#039;s just human nature because of the situation, but maybe we&#039;ll get better at it as we keep practicing over time :)  I appreciate you bringing this up.
@&lt;b&gt;Daraius&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks D!  We&#039;ll see what happens :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - I know, and you&#039;re right :)  I change some things around to be a little safer, but the rawness is what got me blogging to begin with.  Sometimes I have to embrace it and ride it wherever it takes me!
@&lt;b&gt;Ash&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That guy who wanted me to do the freelancing?  (the one who fired me?) Guess who was sitting next to me at court ;)  He&#039;s now &quot;one of us.&quot;
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Yes we do, sir!
@&lt;b&gt;Sam&lt;/b&gt; - There are a dozen or so of us on the suit, all represented by one lawyer.  We paid a little to get things started, but basically she gets paid when/if we all get paid.  Which means she&#039;ll get a LOT (40% or so) or nothing at all... and with all the people on the suit - and the circumstances - it&#039;s a good bet ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; -Thanks Jenna!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Jen!  I was definitely an experience! :)]]></description>
