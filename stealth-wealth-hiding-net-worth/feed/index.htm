Interesting ones for sure!! And really there&#039;s no &quot;right&quot; answer so I&#039;d say you&#039;re doing things just fine as better to be overly conservative than not ;) for the 529s we figure it&#039;s really not our money anymore as we&#039;ll be giving it to our kids (hopefully!), and if for some reason it comes back to us, well, we&#039;ll just add it back in *then*. That&#039;s the nice part about all this stealth wealth - it can always be incorporated in at a later date when it makes more sense!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the &quot;Stealth Wealth&quot; idea.  One that I was recently thinking about (trying to decide if I should add to net worth or not) was my HSA account and my Dependent care FSA account as I typically allow them to accumulate as much as possible.  My Dependent care FSA I typically clear out at year end....but until that happens, it&#039;s like a stealth savings account for myself.  On the HSA front, that account continually grows and I disregard it when tracking net worth.

Still have a hard time trying to figure out the 529 savings plan and whether to include that in my wealth or not, I haven&#039;t to this point so I figure I&#039;ll leave it until I see good reasoning to include it in my financial picture.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stealth wealth is the way to go. I love surprising people around the cocktail table when the topic of investing comes up. I have learned to take there comments as compliments. “Dang I had know idea you no so much about investing! You drive an old rustly Honda.” Apparently investing IQ was exclusive to non-Honda drives.]]></description>

All about the stealth wealth here! Most of mates think I don&#039;t have a pot to p**s in I am sure because I don&#039;t go out and but ridiculous expensive junk all the time. Ah well.

I used to gamble quite heavily and learned quickly to conceal any big wins if I could. &quot;Beers are on you then&quot; was the common phrase.... Ermmm hang on a minute I don&#039;t remember anyone buying me a beer last week when I list a packet?!

People are ridiculous indeed! :)]]></description>

Yeah man! The old stuff (1800s) is my fave, but I like all kinds of coins and currency really :) Why - you want to send any to me for my birthday? Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, J! And everything one owns definitely doesn&#039;t need to be added to one&#039;s net worth. Telling people about one&#039;s wealth is a big no-no for me too; mostly because of changes in their attitudes and in the way they perceive you. It can be annoying. And I didn&#039;t know you were into numismatics! What kind of coins do you collect? Any particular preference?]]></description>
