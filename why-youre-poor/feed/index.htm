					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Clever Dude&lt;/b&gt; - For sure, those of us who were born in better off countries were blessed form the beginning and have a much bigger advantage from the start. There are always exceptions to things we blog about.

@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... you&#039;re right that there are lots of variables though! Luckily some of them we have more control over than others ;) 

@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - You got that right!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You mya be poor because you don&#039;t earn enough so there is nothing much to spend or save. And this may be because the economy is sh*t and one is so under qualified, under educated and over confident that...Oh, well...you are right :).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just messing with ya J. I agree most people are poor because they spend more than they make, even if they make nothing. But then you get into the situations where people are &quot;born into poverty&quot;, which is a reality and it&#039;s tough to move up in the world when you&#039;re surrounded by those willing to bring you down to their level or don&#039;t know any better to teach you. The cycle continues over and over in these portions of society, except for a select few who make it out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Austin&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... never thought about it like that ;)  You&#039;d def. be the opposite of poor going that route!
@&lt;b&gt;philip&lt;/b&gt; - Is it bad that I had to Google &quot;TL:DR&quot; ? :) Glad you liked it!
@&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Wolfe&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome! Love pot lucks myself :)  Def. true - it&#039;s OK to spend money in some areas, as long as you&#039;re cutting out in others and being more CONSCIOUS about where that money is going.  All about prioritizing!
@&lt;b&gt;Maggie@SquarePennies&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, amen to that ;)  A lot easier said than done too!
@&lt;b&gt;Anthony @ EachPesoCounts&lt;/b&gt; -  Haha, yup!  Everyone KNOWS what they should be doing with this stuff, they just don&#039;t do it.  The trick is finding out how to motivate yourself and take action :)
@&lt;b&gt;Alunda @ My Take on Money&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  And only took me 30 seconds this time, rather than 2 hours to come up with a good post - yay! Thanks for commenting :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AND keep spending more than you make.  Saving can only come when people first live within thier income.  If the income is not high enough, they can try to get a higher paying job.  But they will still need to live within their means.  A three-year-old near and dear to my heart has a habit of saying , &quot;But I WANT to!&quot;  We all need to get beyond our 3 year-old selves.  ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your comment back to me- I think  you are right , sometimes we just  do not do what is best for  ourselves. I know I could  do a lot better nutritionally etc.. 
 I also think that once you have had a time of unemployment, when you get a little money, you feel like celebrating a bit. I am guilty of that too. I do think that  cutting back on a few non- necessities like  Latte&#039;s for lunch or going out to eat instead of brown baggin&#039; it, is a great way to  save cash that is usually spent and forgotten. I also liked the comment about enjoying yourself more and doing what you like to do, instead of spending lots of cash!
Movie nights with friends, old fashioned block parties and pot lucks are so much fun! Just being together we those we care about is more  fun than the fancy restaurant or clubs... We do a lot of pot luck dinners in my community and love it!]]></description>
