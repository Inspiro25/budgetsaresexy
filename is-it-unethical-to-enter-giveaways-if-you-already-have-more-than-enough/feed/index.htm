					<description><![CDATA[Another ex-poor person who doesn’t enter giveaways because others might need it more. Everyone knows their own situation best, and I know mine - and I can buy whatever I need or truly want to prioritize. 

Passing on the giveaways reminds me that I am grateful for having that, though, so giveaways still bring me joy.]]></description>

I think this is the better argument rather than ethical vs unethical. Is it actually something that you would use?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enter giveaways if I really want or can use the item. And there&#039;s not much that I want anymore.

As for the mega millions lottery, a guy at work had 37 of us pitch in to win. We didn&#039;t, obviously, but to me, we all share in something like that. Most of us can use the $, if not all of us. We have mortgages, kids, car issues and struggles.

 I also took the pool idea and when I buy tickets, I copy them and mail them to friends/family. That way, we can all share if we win. 

 Even if I won a smaller amount of money, say, $5,000. I&#039;d share it with my sisters. My big sister sent me and my other sister something like $300 or something. She said she &quot;fell into some money&quot; and wanted to share. I will pay her back one day. I never forgot that.]]></description>

Bizzare, I didn&#039;t buy the ticket for same thinking. I looked at price money and though I was tempter (like everyone else) at first but then I thought that it is way too money, who needs that type of money? I don&#039;t want that kind of life story (like I would have totally won ;)) and I didn&#039;t buy the ticket. :)]]></description>

Being a minimal minimalist means I do it minimally. I hate extra crap and buying things I don&#039;t really need but I don&#039;t even want to attempt to live scorched earth style. I have a 5-year old so we have toys and hockey gear but I HATE knick knacks and useless items.

I get the thing where your wife spent time to win a freaking sleep number bed. Those things are expensive and that is an awesome giveaway. Most giveaways are junk you wouldn&#039;t have bought with real money anyway. Or they&#039;re cheap enough that you could just save your time and buy whatever it is at a minimal cost. Most (not all) giveaways aren&#039;t worth the time.]]></description>
