					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome! 
Big shout out to USPS that allows you to ship all sort of stuff. That&#039;s a decent amount of cash and a fun biz.
I just had a go with my kids breeding and selling Angel fish on eBay and it was awesome.  I cash believe all the places we gut to send live fish too. Not as much money, like 200 fish, $5 we, but the kids thought we were getting rich with the orders. 
Kind of cute to see their minds turning and getting ideas. 
Great article.  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a timely post.  I actually have 2 guitars that I need to sell that I just don&#039;t have the time to learn to play.  To be honest, I would need to pick my viola and violin back up first before I would pick up the guitars since I have many years of prior experience with those instruments.  I&#039;ve always wanted to play the guitar, but I wasn&#039;t able to get lessons for very long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This, as well as all the other side hustles in the series, legit proves that there is opportunity to make money anywhere/everywhere. 

Opportunity is all around us. Sometimes we just have to look for it or at it from a different angle! 

Great post!

PS: we have had a side hustle through Zazzle for years. Might be one that you could try, or write about in the future.]]></description>
