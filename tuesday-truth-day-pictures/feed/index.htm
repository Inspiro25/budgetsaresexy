Oh man, you don&#039;t want to look inside my portfolio - it&#039;s all over the place :) I&#039;ve got handfuls of index funds in one area, and then individual stocks in the other (for when I&#039;m feeling risky and more playful). Then of course all kinds of mutual funds interspersed throughout. I&#039;m one of those people who believe in all kids of theories with investing, but what I *really* need to do one of these days is just take a look at them all and condense and make sure everything&#039;s lined up exactly how I want it/it should be. It just bores the pants off me so I keep things the way they are (and I really can&#039;t complain w/ the results too, since I&#039;ve skewed aggressive with most things over the years).

Whenever I get to that I&#039;ll be sure to post about it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J,

That pic re: index investing got me thinking. If J$ agrees with the idea of index funds being &quot;lazy investing&quot;, what does J$ have in his portfolio??? I&#039;ve always thought of index funds as a pretty solid choice when it comes to investing, but perhaps you could shed a little light on the situation. 
Cheers, good sir!]]></description>

Maybe that&#039;s how the most interesting man in the world got to be the most interesting man in the world? The freedom all that index investing gave him allowed him to go out and spend his time learning how to be so damn sexy! Errrr... Interesting!]]></description>
