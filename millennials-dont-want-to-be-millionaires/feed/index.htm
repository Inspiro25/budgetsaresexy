I guess... Seems like it would be good to understand that you can have investments that are much safer than others even IN the stock market too. Like with mutual funds/index funds/etc. I think that scares a lot of younger people as they focus on all the bad that can come w/ investing vs all the good long term :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With the question is posed the way it is, the responses make sense.  If you can truly only have ONE of the following - a steady job with modest income OR a risky portfolio of a million bucks that could disappear within three years - risk-averse Millennials more often choose the first option.  I can understand why; in once case at least you have an income no matter what!  

They are also less likely to invest in stocks or exhibit other risk-averse behaviors due probably to the two major recessions they have witnessed so far in their adult lives (the tech bust and the Great Recession).  But if the question was simply: &quot;Would you rather have a job or a million dollars?&quot; the responses may have been different.]]></description>

Sounds like you do a good job of appreciating what you have :) Though I wouldn&#039;t say being a millionaire is &quot;extreme wealth.&quot; Most people will need that to be able to retire semi-comfortably later. It&#039;s one thing to work because you enjoy it, and another because you&#039;re forced to when you&#039;re in your 60s, 70s, 80s :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a millennial who doesn&#039;t care to be a millionaire.  When I first told my dad that extreme wealth was not a high priority he told me that I was crazy.
