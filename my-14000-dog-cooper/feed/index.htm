:( I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d spend that much on an old dog. Then again, I haven&#039;t been in that situation so I can&#039;t imaging that tough decision. I guess if you have disposable money at the time it&#039;s worth it to give the dog another year of life?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought you were going to have a story like ours!  Two blown ACLs within about 9 months, resulting in two $4-5000 surgeries.  But, she&#039;s made a full recovery and I would spend it again :)]]></description>

Did you say BEARS?  Ah, yes, definitely worth keeping those dogs around if they scare the bears away!
Sorry to hear about the tumor and leg issues! Good you got the $$ and budget to keep them well.  Cheers for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have two dogs and one has cost us a lot of money.  We live in northern Canada and have had to fly her twice to another city for treatment.  To Calgary for a broken canine tooth that could not be pulled.  Second to Vancouver for a dislocated femur.  The monthly average cost in the femur year was $974.00.  Now we have a tumour in the tail.  That is a cool $1K to have the tail amputated.  All that said, our budget line is $400/month for the dogs.  So the cash is there.  And interestingly, the other dog is only food and regular vet visits.  Up north a simple check up with the regular shots is nearly $200/dog.  not cheap.  Oh well, they are our fur babies that bring us much joy and terror when they scare up a bear.]]></description>

So sorry for your loss. RIP Lacey :( 
Glad to hear you track your expenses and it&#039;s interesting to hear insurance wouldn&#039;t have worked out, even with the surgery cost. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/my-14000-dog-cooper/#comment-302320&quot;&gt;Papa&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Papa, great point!!  We are renting currently (from family members who own our house). We have wooden floorboards, no carpet, and are pretty good about keeping things clean. That said, when we move out, there are definitely things we&#039;ll need to pay for and fix. Not sure what it will do to the property value, but the house is definitely more &quot;worn&quot; with having a dog here!
My brother pays a extra pet rent to have a dog. I think it&#039;s $50 per month or something, so that&#039;s a huge cost to consider for people renting. Maybe the place that they live in now allows dogs, but maybe the next place they move to will charge a premium. Something to research for sure!]]></description>
