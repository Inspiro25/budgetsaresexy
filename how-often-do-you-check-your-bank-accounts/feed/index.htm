					<description><![CDATA[I check fairly often, my partner doesn&#039;t and it&#039;s his failing.

I generally know how much is there without having to check, but it&#039;s always safer to check just incase!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I vary.  I check my 401(k) balance daily during the week, and not during weekdays.  I go through phases of checking my USAA and local accounts 1-3 times per day, and then phases where I&#039;ll go 4-5 days without checking.

I try to work out a net worth calculation (write down all checking/savings/investment balances vs. the three loans, and any outstanding credit card balances) once per month.

One of the reasons I need/try to stay on top of it is because my husband uses the same checking accounts, and doesn&#039;t remember to tell me what he&#039;s spent.  Or, he knows he spent money, but he can&#039;t tell me how much and he lost the receipt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;MKG&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that makes me happy for some reason :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - Are you talking about your savings or your debt?  I hope it&#039;s the latter! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;jaythebanker&lt;/b&gt; - Yet another reason why I don&#039;t use Debit cards!  It&#039;s all credit for me, baby.  And one of these days I&#039;m gonna join you at the bank.  I still want to work for one at somet point :)
@&lt;b&gt;JennyDee&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s the downside of automating -- it&#039;s easy to just forget about it and not catch things as often.  But usually the pros outweigh these kinda cons :)  Congrats on having a nice buffer in place for checking!
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - WOW. I&#039;m sure your husband woulda caught it at some point... at least I&#039;d like to think :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - That peace of mind is well worth it - I&#039;m with you on that one.
@&lt;b&gt;Shawanda&lt;/b&gt; - Damn straight.  Only person who cares enough about your money is YOU! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Phil Bryant, CEO&lt;/b&gt; - Wikinvest?  Not me but I like the way it sounds!
@&lt;b&gt;sarah r&lt;/b&gt; - If I had BofA I&#039;d check every single hour!!  Can&#039;t stand that place, haha.. no offense.
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah there&#039;s no hope when you work AT the bank ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Louise M&lt;/b&gt; - The reason for that is because you are AWESOME :)  I tweak my budget a lot too.
@&lt;b&gt;JMK&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  All about the credit cards too.  Makes budgeting and tracking SOOOO much easier.  Esp if you&#039;re good at paying them off on time and all.
@&lt;b&gt;caroline&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s pretty hardcore.  I couldn&#039;t do it, but I totally dig that you do!
@&lt;b&gt;Courtney&lt;/b&gt; - And as that net worth rises, so does your motivation and excitedness!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I check the balance once every week to see if the number looks confusing.  Then I read through everything once a month when I&#039;m doing bills..

I figure this could be like stocks and you could waste time checking 27 times a day if you got out of control so I take the opposite and just hope that all my automatic deductions are doing their thing.]]></description>
