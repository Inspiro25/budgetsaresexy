					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/yard-sale-tips-tricks/#comment-126045&quot;&gt;Advocate&lt;/a&gt;.

I personally agree with you on that one, as long as they&#039;re not ridiculously overpriced. If I know the money&#039;s going to a charity, or perhaps a small business (like those cute kids who sell lemonade and cookies for $1.00 at them ;)) I&#039;ll pay full price all day, every day. If it&#039;s a straight up normal yard sale though, I&#039;ll do my best to haggle but not to the point of ripping anyone off. At the end of the day you&#039;re really not saving that much money anyways unless you&#039;re picking up a car or something (true story - my mom once did!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do slightly different rules apply to charity yard sales? Nickel and diming to get the price down when it&#039;s going to a non-profit group seems gauch. Supporters can also usually donate items for sale to these groups, or can hold multi family sales and donate some or all of proceeds to charity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Weekend Yard Sale(ing) trips for my wife and I are and essential part of our money-saving plan. 
Since we&#039;re 3 months pregnant we&#039;ve saved soooo much on toys, clothes and other misc. items that I&#039;ve lost count on the $ amount that we&#039;ve saved. Great ideas from everyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;jesse.anne.o&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... if it makes you feel better, I haven&#039;t either yet ;)  Though I did once come across this 8 ft tall gorilla stuffed animal!  Was pretty freaky looking!

@&lt;b&gt;Melissa@LittleHouseInTheValley&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re right on that one! Though sometimes you can get lucky :)  

And I did! I found a handful of goodies this weekend, including a stack of awesome CDs, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/p/LGNCzvQRmn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;new decanter&lt;/a&gt; for my pimp office, an oil painting for our bathroom (a cool flowery concoction), and a few other odds and ends... always a fun time :)  Did you go out?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love garage sales and find the best deals at middle class neighborhoods.  If you go to upscale, the sellers want too much for their items and aren&#039;t willing to negotiate.

Did you find anything good this weekend?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually really enjoy hitting up yard sales but the list of things we still need for the apartment is down to &quot;new only&quot; (e.g. - shower curtain) and I am really at a perfect point with storage space so I don&#039;t want to add any unneeded stuff.

But - may the force be with YOU.  Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah!  That&#039;s a great tip too - though usually I don&#039;t get as lucky finding THAT many things at one place, haha... but I guess it&#039;s great for hauling stuff at the end of the morning to your house too, eh?  Good thinking :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Take your own bags too! They always run out and it&#039;s not much fun trying to balance six items in your arms while you&#039;re still on the hunt for more. One of those huge roomy Ikea bags with the shoulder straps always comes with me to garage sales - big enough to dump all my new treasures in while I keep looking.]]></description>
