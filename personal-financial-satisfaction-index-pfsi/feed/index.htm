					<description><![CDATA[You guess right, and you can believe I thank my lucky stars for that. I heard there might be some sort of temporary unfreeze for yours... hope your wife can start soon!
Maybe I should dock a point though, to take into account the possibility that our beloved overlords here get ideas.]]></description>

Why not feeling optimistic about the blog stuff? More a personal thing or &quot;the state of blogging&quot; as a whole?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I give myself a 54. 

Investments: 7. So far, mostly my apartment, which I consider an investment : scored for not too many €€, with excellent financing, and that I trust will resell well. I intend to move back home, where housing costs are WAY lower, when I FIRE.
Financial Outlook: 9. I&#039;d say 10, mostly thanks to the employment, but I need to consider the life partner factor.
Home Equity: 0. Bahh. I haven&#039;t even begun my mortgage (buying new, currently watching the building grow, renting until it&#039;s done.)
Employment Status: 10. Government job, well paid, can&#039;t be laid off.
Personal Inflation: 5. I&#039;m part-time for the year, so all spending seems bigger in comparison. But I&#039;ve cut expenses back.
Personal Taxes: 9. Going part-time allows me to decrease my tax vs income ratio.
Debts Owed: 6. Mortgage only, but I have yet to begin to pay it back.
Career Potential: 8. Never gonna make a fortune but the salary will be steadily growing in the next 16 years. I hope to FIRE in 20, so good enough for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got 55. Not too bad, but not too great either. I&#039;m just not feeling too optimistic this year. The shutdown, global economy, trade war, etc... There is a lot of bad news lately.

Investments: ____6____ (I&#039;m not very optimistic this year. I just want to keep up with inflation.)
Financial Outlook: __8____ (Long term is good)
Home Equity: ___6____(Home equity is okay, we still have a mortgage.)
Employment Status: ___7____ (self employed, probably won&#039;t make much $$ this year)
Personal Inflation: ___7____ (Not sure until we&#039;re done with our move across town)
Personal Taxes: ___8___ (Pretty good. I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll owe anything this April)
Debts Owed: ___8____(Just the mortgage.)
Career Potential: __5____ (Not too optimistic about blogging in the future.)
PFSiONE Total Score: ___55___]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this J! Such a great find! Gotta love us CPA&#039;s :)

I give myself a 77:
Investments: 7 (doing ok, still keeping up with inflation since I retired but the last few months . . . )
Financial Outlook: 10 (expenses are running at 2% of spendable net worth)
Home Equity: 10 (100% equity)
Employment Status: 10 (barely funemployed)
Personal Inflation: 10 (hiking, biking and Pickleball are almost free)
Personal Taxes: 10 (only pay self employment and state tax, in the sweet spot on federal income tax)
Debts Owed: 10 (none)
Career Potential: 10 (I could still go back if I wanted to but can&#039;t see wanting to)
PFSiONE Total Score: 77

Wow, feeling pretty good here!]]></description>
