					<description><![CDATA[Happy Thanksgiving to you too, friend!  So nice seeing you here :) I don&#039;t know of any resources online really about selling/buying blogs (though of course there probably are!), but I&#039;ll shoot you an email on the side and we can see what you&#039;re up to over there... hopefully we can get some FatWallet partnerships going too!  Woo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J.

Whew, the past couple of weeks have had me lost in the black hole of Black Friday blogging. :)  I&#039;ve wanted to connect with you since our meeting in LA and finally, today, I made it over here to see what you&#039;ve been up to.  While I&#039;m not a fit for what you&#039;re looking for here, I&#039;ve got a personal blog that&#039;s not in the PF niche that I&#039;d love to sell to a good home biz blogger who will keep it going and benefit from the subscriber list.  Are there resources you&#039;d recommend to someone wanting to sell a blog?

I&#039;m off to explore more of your recent posts. :) 

Hope you had a very happy Thanksgiving!
