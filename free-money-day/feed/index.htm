It should be done every day - you&#039;re right :) We&#039;re always so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that any nice (small) gestures stand out pretty big!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, free money day?! That is rather interesting, I think that free money day should happen more than once a year. Giving away money to random people in the  streets I think would bring a lot of joy not just to the receivers but the givers as well. This is really a good initiative and i hope that one day it will be known to the world and people will really be excited about giving and not receiving. It could start a ripple effect. Knowing that someone went out of their way to give away money is really a conversation starter and it would probably help our greedy world to learn humanity and to think of others in life.]]></description>

I&#039;m sure not everyone follows through but it&#039;s still worth the effort and chance :) Similar to giving to the homeless and not being 100% sure they&#039;ll use it for what you want/think they should use it for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is an interesting concept.  I wonder how many people actually fallow through with it though.  I can see why they chose that date, it is very symbolic.  The bottom fell out of the economy less than a month before my husband and I were married, so it is a yearly reminder around that time for me when the Second Great Depression hit.]]></description>
