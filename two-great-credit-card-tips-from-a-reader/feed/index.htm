					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s interesting...  although, why not just charge and get some goodies FIRST rather than wait a while and get them later?  Don&#039;t you still end up with the same things?  (If you are a thief, of course, which I am not ;))

And thanks for stopping by!  Nice to have you here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[New here, via The Daily Brainstorm.

I&#039;ve been told that someone that steals a CC will use it a time or two for a small charge (such as the $1.00 online charges, or a few gallons of gas) to see whether it has been reported stolen - THEN they start the big purchases &#038; make several quickly, so they get the goods before the CC company or you realize what&#039;s going on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I tell friends &#038; family this story, some people were like &quot;I never buy stuff on the internet so this will never happen to me.&quot; And then I reply, &quot;do you ever eat in a restaurant and hand over your credit card to a waitress who disappears with it for several minutes? Well, guess what? Your info could be stolen just as easy...have you seen those tiny new credit card scanners that plug into a cell phone (https://squareup.com)? Scary!!!

Another co-worker had her info stolen when a second co-worker &quot;borrowed&quot; her credit card out of her work desk for just a few minutes and then put it back right back into her purse.

My sister had an actual bank employee use several of those &quot;convenience checks&quot; that credit cards mail out to you and ran up several hundred dollars in my sister&#039;s name. The bank employee had access to sis&#039;s electronic signature (on file) but physically went into a bank branch to cash one - on video - proving that it wasn&#039;t my sister. They caught the woman and filed charges.

I tell everyone that it&#039;s only a matter of time WHEN your info is stolen not IF it will be stolen. You have to be proactive, not reactive. Hubby got right online to his Capital One acct. and set up his alerts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;DIYMILF&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, sounds like it!  Annoying at first, but better to be safe than sorry with that kind of money.  Also nice companies are watching out for people liket that too :)  Although, probably more so that THEY don&#039;t end up with the loss! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;aj&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I prefer that too :)  Although PayPal drives me crazyyyy!!! They kept freezing our account w/ Love Drop in the beginning and would take DAYS for us to get access to it again...arghhh... and nothing due to fraud either, they kept miscategorizing it or something on their end.  Never dealt w/ their debit/credit cards, but prob. won&#039;t either due to this ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Amy Saves&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... maybe they had a lot of pictures to develop? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;kh&lt;/b&gt; - Rawr!  I think everyone got the point ;)  And actually, &quot;hacked&quot; can mean a lot more than just computer stuff too with the way it&#039;s used these days.  Esp. like &quot;money hacks&quot; that PF bloggers use - tricks to save more money and what not.
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - Indeed!!  I like how you say the &quot;old-fashioned way&quot; too, haha...  crazy how technology is changing things.  For the good and the bad!
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Weird!  yeah, I mean you can&#039;t just go over there during lunch time or anything, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;fifi&lt;/b&gt; - Coool!  Does that mean you went to Egypt?? Forgot that&#039;s on my top 5 list!!! Mmmmm...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I forgot to tell my bank when I went abroad once and after a few day, my credit card would not work any more.  Luckily, I still had a debit card, otherwise I never would&#039;ve gotten that papyrus with my name written in heiroglyphics :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My credit cards have been the subject of fraud a scary number of times .... starting when I was 17 and had my card stolen the old-fashioned way (by a purse-thief who broke into my car), and continuing up through a few months ago when my account was hacked the new-fangled way. Each time, the credit card company has alerted me promptly about suspicious charges. Wahoo for the fraud protection department!!]]></description>
