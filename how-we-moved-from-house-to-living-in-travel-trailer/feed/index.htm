Thank you Eric, and sure I fight with that every day still. You feel like you should spend, while saving is better for you. So I&#039;m learning day by day :-)]]></description>

Yeah, the internet access part would have to be on LOCK to continue working full-time or close to it... Although, I guess depending on what you&#039;re doing you might get even MORE productive without it and just hooking up once or twice a week to report/send stuff over? Imagine how much you could get done without the temptation all day long? Haha...]]></description>

We&#039;re the same way. Especially now that we have kids, we couldn&#039;t imagine living without our village. This from a military brat that gets itchy feet every few years! It also doesn&#039;t help that we have one with as special needs, and we have pretty good services in our area. If that weren&#039;t the case, I&#039;d probably hop on board the unschooling movement and live in a bus/RV/whatever it took to be exploring new places all the time. But the lessons I&#039;ve learned through this experience are priceless... Travel is good, but your village can be greater.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is really nothing better than freedom. You&#039;ve achieved what most people don&#039;t even dare to dream of. Congrats.

You also overcame the #1 problem....that&#039;s the spending and debt mentality. That is such a hard mental barrier to overcome, then to actually get out of debt is even harder. Again, great job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Deep down inside this is exactly what I want to do and I just might someday.  I would just feel a lot better about it my passive income stream was already coming in to pay for everything.  I just wouldnt want to have to work even online or anything while out on the road.

Really cool story!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very cool! I love the tiny house movement, and the freedom of mobility, but I&#039;m also a minimalist without a car and a city gal, so I don&#039;t want to tow it and have to be parked in a location where I have to drive places. So, my husband and I found our version of tiny house living... we bought a condotel on the lakefront of a thriving city. Basically, it is a condo in a hotel. And yes, it is the size of a standard King size hotel room with a small kitchenette. Around 380 SF. We only paid $41k, so we are free and clear of the mortgage with a few additional rental properties paying our living expenses. When we want to do extended travel, we can just throw our belongings in one closet and rent it out. I cringe when I hear of my friends buying $350k+ houses in non-walkable areas with high taxes being chained to their jobs. You can always make more money, but you can&#039;t buy more time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so cool!  I’m very impressed with the decisions we can make when we abandon stuff for experiences.  Not sure I could do that unless I moved to Canada&#039;s west coast and then with the real estate prices there that might be all that I could afford. Thank you for the inspiration.]]></description>
