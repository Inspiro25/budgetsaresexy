Awesome. I&#039;m glad you are back at it then! I&#039;ll be sure to re-bookmark and check back regularly!

I think the last time I read regularly was when I had a job in a physical office. Not saying I was reading instead of working....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#6.  Even though I have a Costco membership, I do not agree. Especially for a typical family of 4.  TBH, When I rebelled and said no to warehouse memberships we saved a significant amount.  Even if we were paying more per unit on average, we were buying significantly less overall. I estimate that not having a warehouse membership saved my family around $250 a month for that one glorious year.  

But than again... How would I get my MEGA pack of Mochi... ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with a lot of these things. Although I do use credit cards a lot (and pay off every month). I think that&#039;s true if you carry a balance then yes you should avoid using them. But otherwise the protections, etc are worth it.

I try to live as a student and budget and negotiate when I can.  Glad to see J.Money writing? i thought I had read it was sold awhile back? Maybe I messed that up but its been awhile since I&#039;ve read indeed.]]></description>

I believe the credit agencies only check your accounts once per month, but I have noticed my score will bounce up 1 or 2 points if they happen to check on a day when the balances are a little higher than normal  - like if I&#039;m traveling and skip payoffs that week.

Yes - my credit score goes up a meaningless amount when I use 2% instead of 0% of my available credit. Credit scores are stupid.]]></description>

Smart to get out once you realized it’s doing more harm than good! I did that with the first round of bitcoin “investing” a few years back (came ahead by a couple hundred) but this time around I have been the opposite of smart, lol… Good thing I’m always too conservative to bet the farm!]]></description>

Weekly pay offs - impressive! I wonder if that helps with your debt-to-credit ratio any? It should since you&#039;re only &quot;in debt&quot; for a week at a time.... That&#039;s way too many logins for me though haha... My mind isn&#039;t as bothered seeing a high number there, though I agree it would feel better with a lower one &#128514;]]></description>
