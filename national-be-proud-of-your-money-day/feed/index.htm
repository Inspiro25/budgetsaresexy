					<description><![CDATA[Hi money lovers! My name is April, and I’ve been paying attention to my finances for many (?) years now. I’ve accomplished the following this year and I’m damn proud of it: I’m finally down to owing under $25,000 on my mortgage!  I can’t wait to be done!  Solo parent, teacher income… it’s been work.]]></description>

very cool!! What a great set of mentors you had there :) All of our lives would be different depending on how/when/where/why/who we were born to! For the better or the worse!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been paying attention to finances since I was 5 years old. My mother took me to the corner store to buy something with my money (a handful of change). I picked out my candy and put it on the counter. When the lady at the counter wanted my money and I realized to get the candy I had to give her my money I took back my money and left the candy there. 
When I was 30 and realized that I could significantly save money by simply paying more on my principal every month on my house mortgage I got very excited and began doing that. I have been debt-free since I was 40 and I am now 64 years old, 
I can&#039;t say I am proud without a shout out to my mom and dad who always lived within their means and saved. It is a gift in my opinion. I know it can be learned but I feel like I was given a gift and can&#039;t take credit for it. It makes me wonder if I had had a different type upbringing, would I still be debt free?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My name is Jillian and in 2015 I had been paying attention to money since 2006. Then I graduated from college (2 sep schools) and got really serious about money in 2011. In 2015 I would have back surgery and loads of medical effects leading to more debt. In 2020 I am happy to report that I am happy and have a good relationship with money. Less than 7000 of student loans and will completely debt free.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi money lovers! My name is Karl, and I’ve been paying attention to my finances for 17 months now. I’ve accomplished the following this year and I’m damn proud of it: I will be maxing out my 2015 contributions to my 401(k), Roth IRA, and HSA. Now I have enough in the HSA to invest any further contributions. The HSA is inspired by J$ because currently all of it is going into VTSAX.]]></description>
