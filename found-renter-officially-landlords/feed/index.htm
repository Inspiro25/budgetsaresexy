					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations that is awesome news. Thank goodness for great tenants hey! We had a couple of beauties in our old rental. had permission for one dog and then we found out they had three plus 8 puppies that they were just letting fend for themselves in 40 degree heat and no water! We &quot;encouraged&quot; them to leave pretty quickly. The agent had done a really bad job so I fired her and took over myself with much better success.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think you&#039;re being negative, you&#039;re being real :) And that&#039;s exactly why I love blogging cuz we get to hear all different sides of the story with situations! So thanks to all of you who are stopping by and sharing - it helps out our little ecosystem here.]]></description>

I think you&#039;ve put in way more time in this than most people already :) Which is great. No, I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to the majority of people out there, but to some (with the right personality and skills) they&#039;d def. kill it. Shoot, thousands every day are killin&#039; it in the rental game! The only reason we&#039;re doing it right now is to a) learn and experience it and b) we aren&#039;t in a position to sell yet. We&#039;ll see how time changes our path here, but for the next 12 months at least we&#039;re sitting still and learning. And doing so in our new home that we&#039;re now in miles away :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rick: Thanks for the info on no SSA garnishments. Read some of the other rules for beneficiaries and think I will report the little scam artist anyway so she can share some of the pain she has caused myself and others. Since she&#039;s getting a free ride on our tax dollars I feel like she has scammed me TWICE!  I also see a collection agency in her near future - they report to all 3 credit bureaus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Drew:  DON&#039;T DO IT.  Your thinking is correct. The stress level is high and expenses will likely exceed your estimates. They only go in one direction: UP - and guess what?  Market rents do not go up proportionately.  Also factor in tenants who don&#039;t pay and the laws that protect them, written by state legislators who are the attorneys representing them!  Also don&#039;t forget you won&#039;t have 100% occupancy all the time. I would never, ever do it again, and when the market recovers may yet bail.  Not to be negative and don&#039;t you all start beating up on me now, but Drew asked and I am giving him my honest opinion and the wisdom I have gained over the last 7 years. It is very difficult to make money this way.]]></description>

NICE!!! That&#039;s the one thing we were missing from our other original applicants - the handyman&#039;ness of them :) You&#039;re very fortunate to have someone who knows how to do all that and more importantly, WANTS to! Haha... Hooray for us!]]></description>
