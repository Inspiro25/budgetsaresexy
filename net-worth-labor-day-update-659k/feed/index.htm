I wouldn&#039;t change a thing financial-wise, but LIFESTYLE wise I totally would: I&#039;d have become WAY more minimalist right off the bat and started designing my life around *freedom* vs just going with the flow and hustling and chasing money so much once I got a taste of it. I&#039;m super thankful for how things have ended up thus far, but even just starting a year or two earlier could have catapulted my mindset even farther. The money is nice, but the freedom and happiness is nicer!! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made the same mistake on my car loan a long time ago.  I think it would be worth your while to see if they will reamortize your loan.  As if is you are a year ahead, you&#039;ve prepaid that extra interest and you can&#039;t get it back.   Worst they could do is say no.  

If they won&#039;t, then I would stop paying your car loan until your next payment is due.  Use that money to your benefit for the year.]]></description>

Her TSP funds aren&#039;t generating 12% returns, it&#039;s just that the amount she&#039;s *putting in* right now is 12% more than last month :) Plus/minus any returns... (she&#039;s just begun investing in it this last year, which is why it skews so high and is noticable)

As for the funds she&#039;s in though, she&#039;s actually 100% in the Lifecycle Fund L 2040 I believe (it&#039;s one of those years). I personally wouldn&#039;t be as conservative with it, but it&#039;s her $$$ and makes her feel more comfortable so it&#039;s a Lifecycle all the way :)]]></description>

Today was day #2 and apparently the &quot;best day ever&quot; according to my kid, so as much as I miss him, it&#039;s good to know he&#039;s enjoying it! :) I think it&#039;s always harder on us than them, haha...]]></description>

Hope your kids first day of school went well! We&#039;re a year away from that. My wife is already tearing up thinking about it. Its going to be an emotional day a year from now.]]></description>
