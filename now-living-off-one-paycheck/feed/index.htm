					<description><![CDATA[We are a family of 3: mom, dad and a son. We are a fairly young family too; I am in my mid-30s, my wife is in her early-30s and our son will be 8 in July. My wife and I were both career focused with our outside jobs. We were living in a rental house in the city when we got married. Within 2 years of our marriage, our bundle of joy joined us 

Our son is one of the main driving forces for our financial success. As a matter of fact, I recently blogged about it at http://earlyfinancialfreedom.com/our-familys-financial-practices/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The unknown is always scary, but with all the personal finance knowledge you have, I&#039;m positive that you will not only adjust but prosper! I think it&#039;s wonderful that she can stay home with the baby because I worked in a private daycare for 4 years and the costs to parents is enormous, and not just in terms of money:

 It cost $1000-1300 per month for an infant up to 12 months old; There is a lot of time and extra expense involved in increased doctor&#039;s visits for a sick baby, because they will get every cold and virus that comes around, and one parent has to take the time off of work to take the baby to the doctor and care for them at home until they can return to daycare; As wonderful and caring as the teachers are, there is so much development that occurs in the first year and a stay at home parent knows what works best for their child;There&#039;s nothing like being able to experience your baby&#039;s milestones in person. (smiling, rolling over, crawling) 

&quot;Mom groups&quot; are great ways to socialize with other parents, and often members swap babysitting for each other&#039;s children, which would allow your wife quiet time to work on her thesis. I&#039;m sure that everything will work out beautifully and best wishes to both of you as the adventure begins!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so exciting J$! I love how you are so supportive of your wife, no matter what decision she chooses. She is so lucky to have you!

I like that most of the cons are pressure on dad :P But you still are so positive about it. My BF and I are always thinking like this and I adore the fact that he is so supportive of me and always willing to make things work, no matter what my decision is and even if it means we&#039;re strapped for cash. Btw, I LOVE lists!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks, I&#039;ll take all the luck I can get! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Matthew Doyle&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, you got that right.  It&#039;s amazing what we can get used to over time.
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh cool!!!  Congrats on your new lifestyle too - you&#039;ll have to tell me how you like it over time :)
@&lt;b&gt;Alice @ EarningMyTwoCents&lt;/b&gt; - EXCELLENT line! &quot;The less money you have, the more you have to pay attention to it&quot; - I&#039;m totally going to Tweet that right now, then put it on Facebook ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Emily @ evolvingPF&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! Exactly.  She&#039;s no longer TA&#039;ing, or taking on any other side projects, so the income in that department is zilch. It&#039;ll probably take her a year or two to finish up her dissertation (we&#039;re not sure how she&#039;s gonna do it yet), and then in the meantime either stay at home w/ baby, or get another job or two to stay active and bring in some more money... we&#039;re playing it all by ear at the moment, but for the next 3 months she&#039;ll def. not be working.
@&lt;b&gt;Craig&lt;/b&gt; - I know, that&#039;s the scary part. We&#039;re hoping once we get a good rythm down, that I can do my work for the first half of the day, and then she can do hers for the 2nd half and we take turns watching the babe.  But it&#039;s always better in theory, eh? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Shannon-ReadyForZero&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Shannon!  We can&#039;t wait! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, thanks.  I hope so!
@&lt;b&gt;Lance@MoneyLife&amp;More&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Maybe a silver dollar, ya never know ;)  And I LOVE working on the weekend! So much more relaxing!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah man, I hate that stuff but it&#039;s gotta be done!
@&lt;b&gt;spendbrite&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks so much! And congrats to you all too with your family additions :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus III&lt;/b&gt; - I know, something is wrong with their heads :)
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I get the same way around *other* people&#039;s kids ;)  From what I hear though, having your own is MUCH different. And in the &quot;better&quot; department too.   CONGRATS on your new work!!! That&#039;s wonderful!
@&lt;b&gt;Squeezer&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, she was a TA for 4 years helping teach classes. And then worked on paid projects in the summers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post and Congratulations! We&#039;ve lived on one salary before and are about to do it again with me staying home with the kids. After the 2nd came we just found that having both of us working makes life even more crazy (if that is possible). There&#039;s extra income but everything else falls to ruin; the kids, the dogs the house-eek the laundry. 

Best of luck to the three of you!]]></description>
