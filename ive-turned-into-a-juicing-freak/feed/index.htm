yes!!! I do need to look into gardening!! Nooooo idea how hard or easy or time/effort/costs are involved etc, but man would that be great being fully sustainable.... Or even partially! I feel like it&#039;s one of those things that will forever pay dividends over the years too once you figure it out. I&#039;ll let you know if I do - but don&#039;t hold your breath ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome stuff J, you&#039;ve inspired me to at least watch those documentaries and see where it leads to then.  I eat pretty healthy already and generally like fruits and veggies, but never thought to get mix them all together in a juicer.  Next summer you need to start a garden and grow all this....Ok maybe most of it, yourself.   You can seriously cut down on your material costs ;-)
I&#039;ll let you know how it goes!]]></description>

Only one way to find out!! ;)

it does get annoying having to clean it every time afterwards, but it only takes a few mins (probably depends on the type of juicier you use). That said, the recipe above will make you 2 full glasses+ so you could just save one for the next day and only need to juice every two days. Probably wouldn’t want to store much more than that anyways as the freshness goes away, but that will def. save you some time 

as for ginger, yup – you can just use a carrot peeler to peel the skin off but prob not the worst thing in the world to leave on either… I just peel for a few seconds and then throw it in even with 20% or so of the skin still on (and in the beginning i wasn’t peeling it at all and i survived! lol..)

I think it’s just one of those things you have to try out for a week and adjust as you go. You’ll find out real quick what works for you and what doesn’t :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pretty awesome J,
We did the juicing also &quot;back in the day&quot; after watching the film back then.  Ginger is no joke..haha.  Beet too...you need to cut it with some carrots..haha.  We then moved on from the juicer to the NutriBullet.  It grinds everything...pulp, seeds and all so you get the fiber and the entire plant.  Lots of fun and good for you.  Happy juicing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, curious.

Thinking of barriers. How long does it take to clean out the juicer afterwards?

Can you save some if you make extra?

Do you need to peel the ginger?

Following you for a while, I was actually considering hiring a registered dietician. Im trying to get back to a more comfortable weight, I have about 10 lbs to go. Perhaps this might be a better step!]]></description>

Probably is cheaper but yeah, not as good as juicing real veggies, which is not as good as EATING real veggies but hey - you do whatever you can to get some in your body as it&#039;s all better than NO veggies!! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Curious if this is more or less cost effective than green powders.  I started drinking one recently (after doing a lot of research) and its been great (not the overpriced overhyped product everyone shills for affiliate $$$) . Though if you have the time to prep, I am very sure you cant beat fresh.]]></description>

hey dude!

1) It costs me about $20 to pick up all the ingredients I need for the Green Juice, and I grab them every 3-4 days or so so it probably costs me around $5-$6 per drink? And probably even less since it makes me not snack on a lot of garbage, and thus less $$$ going there as well ;)

2) I&#039;m not sure how it works exactly if you do the *fasting* part (ie ONLY juicing for 2 months and that&#039;s it!), but since I&#039;m just using it as a supplement in general I&#039;m not too worried about what it doesn&#039;t contain since I&#039;m still eating and drinking other stuff throughout the day. I bet between my fruit smoothie and this veggie juice though it hits a bulk of what you need!

3) Not yet on the 2nd fridge but BOY WOULD THAT BE HELPFUL!!! I am getting tired of playing Tetris in my fridge and not being able to access stuff easily, lol... Def. a top 3 con so far.

4) Can&#039;t recommend any juicers yet as I haven&#039;t gone out and bought one (I&#039;m borrowing one), but I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about it until you know it&#039;s going to stick... For now if you&#039;re interested in trying it just borrow one or find a cheap one off Craigslist/Marketplace/etc!]]></description>
