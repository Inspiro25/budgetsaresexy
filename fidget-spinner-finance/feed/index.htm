					<description><![CDATA[A relative of mine who&#039;s an elementary school teachers really doesn&#039;t like fidget spinners. The kids tend to use them ABOVE the desk or table, no matter how many times they&#039;re asked not to do that, which means their fellow students are mesmerized by what&#039;s going on in their hands. Teacher, on the other hand, is trying to get everyone&#039;s eyes on that day&#039;s lesson.

As far as kids and money lessons go, this article is a classic:

(Full disclosure: I&#039;m the free-range parent who left the author in the hotel room to be traumatized by a malfunctioning plaything.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am all about money saving so I am trying to teach my son the same.  I bought him one fidget spinner as a reward for a good week at school, but then he saw another one that he said was &#039;rare&#039;.  He&#039;s only 7 and doesn&#039;t actually know what that really means!  He had some money left from his birthday so I told him I thought it was a waste of money and money would be better spent elsewhere, so  if he wanted it then he needed to use his own money so he did.  I really wish he hadn&#039;t spent his money on it, but hopefully when the fidget spinner is left sitting on the side and he wants something else that he hasn&#039;t got the money for, he&#039;ll get the message.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These fidget spinners are everywhere! lol

That is an insanely wise daughter. I wouldn&#039;t have made some of those comments when I was at that age. I probably would have whined. I SO want to smack younger me....

I have friends who gave their children a decent allounce, but they had to buy everything on their own that they wanted and also encouraged to save. So those times when the children asked for something, they always got the same response &quot;you have your own money, you can buy it or save it for later&quot;. I always thought that was SO cool. It sounds like you have something similar and that&#039;s awesome.

Keep it up!

I have no doubt he will part with the cash.  He wanted me to buy it with my credit card and then to pay me back and I told him no.  I want him to buy it himself with all that money he took so long to save up, like you said.  It always hurts a little handing it over, even if you really want it.  But, I also want him to feel the pride of saving up for it and buying it himself.  Mowing our yard in the heat of the South is hard work.  He is working hard for that cash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re doing it just right - it sounds like your daughter has already learned a ton about the value of money. I hope we can do the same with our kids.

Our oldest is almost a bit obsessive about money - she&#039;s always looking for extra chores that she can do to make money. Last night she told my wife that we were &quot;getting cheaper&quot; because we haven&#039;t been giving her as much as she used to get for some of the chores.

We explained that it&#039;s proportional - If dad&#039;s not making much money, then you don&#039;t get much. Now she wants to help me make money blogging. Just gotta figure out what a 6-year-old can do... :)]]></description>
