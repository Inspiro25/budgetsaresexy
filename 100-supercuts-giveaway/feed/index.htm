					<description><![CDATA[I get my hair cut at Beehive Salon.  I always get it colored too, so I don&#039;t know how much just a haircut costs - I think around $40.  My husband is the sexy budget follower in our family and he&#039;s Supercuts all the way!  It&#039;s right around the corner from our house.

					<description><![CDATA[Elements Salon for $60(?).  I usually get a cut and highlights every 3 months, so I&#039;m not sure what the cut alone would cost.  I&#039;m entering this giveaway for my husband though, who spends about $25 w/ tip at Supercuts (we live in an extremely HCOL city).
@Gretchen - $80 for cut AND color is pretty cheap at a salon, so you&#039;re definitely not spending a ton IMO.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, looks like I&#039;m the only reader who spends a little more money on my hair!  I go to a salon in my hometown, which is about an hour drive from where I live.  my parents still live there, so i get to see them too.  and I spend $80 on a cut and color.  sometimes it might be a little more depending on how much hair she cuts.  I have been going to the same hairdresser since i was 2 (first haircut, seriously).  I have friends who easily spend $250+ on their hair, so i figured $80 was pretty good.  I only get my hair cut two or three times per year.  to me, its worth it.  
p.s. I cut my husband&#039;s hair, so that balances out the cost, right?]]></description>
