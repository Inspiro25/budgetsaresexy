					<description><![CDATA[I was having alot of back/shoulder pain recently and I couldnt figure out why.  Well, after a weekend of not leaving the house, I noticed it felt better.  That was, until the next day when I left for work, and threw my purse on my shoulder.  I realized my bag was causing my pain.  That night I decided to clean it out.  To my surprise, I found (besides 12 lipsticks), $27 in change in my purse.  OUCH.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OKAY -- THE WINNING # IS....... &lt;strong&gt;$84.76!&lt;/strong&gt;  Jeff @ My Multiple Streams got the closest with his $85.32 guess!  Great job guys, this was hella fun ;) Have a beautiful weekend!

@&lt;b&gt;UltimateSmartMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I hope coins don&#039;t go away in the future -- I&#039;d miss them too much!
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That is awesome. I love me some coin counters ;)  And yup!  I always try to have more quarters than the rest.  I used to save them for laundry too in NYC, but it&#039;s been a few years since those days.... I just try and empty my pockets w/ them before I spend them - I&#039;d rather delay gratification w/ all my change :)  
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @My Multiple Streams&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  That works.  AND GUESS WHAT?  You got the closest!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to keep all the coins, (I still am, but I use credit card more often), especially in quarters. At first, they were for collection (50 states design). Later, I used them to feed the parking meter in NYC and do the laudry in the laudromat.  Now, I don&#039;t need the quarters to do both anymore. I deposit the charge into my bank. I get the roll paper from the bank, and sort the coins thru the coin sorter. I just did that after reading your blog. And I have 3- $10 worth in quarters, 2- $0.50 worth in pennies, 1- $5 worth dimes. Yay, I am $36 richer. 
Are you just like me having the most in quarters?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hunter @Financially Consumed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the closest so far!!  You guys are getting warmer! :)

@&lt;b&gt;Tim&lt;/b&gt; - Man, Coinstar keeps jacking up the rates I suppose!  Unless it&#039;s different in different areas? (that&#039;s more than likely the case).  Your $120 beats any of mine so far - well done ;)
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - REALLY??? that&#039;s so weird? Haha... I mean I dont like touching hundreds of coins and not washing my hands afterward, but coins in my pocket? yeah - that&#039;s okay.  I certainly wouldn&#039;t dump them all over my floor, haha... very interesting indeed.
@&lt;b&gt;Corie&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww that&#039;s sexy!!!  $1,000 is no joke!  And I totally agree -- I&#039;d much rather have that excitement of the big &quot;wow&quot; than $5 extra dollars in my pockets over the year ;)  Let us know how big this next one is!
@&lt;b&gt;bogofdebt&lt;/b&gt; - I like it.  Though, what really costs under .25? haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - No shame in that, my friend!  I collect coins too :)  I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing, but I certainly have fun at it.
@&lt;b&gt;judyyy&lt;/b&gt; - Nope!
@&lt;b&gt;Robert&lt;/b&gt; - Nope. (though you&#039;re closer than Judyyy up there)
@&lt;b&gt;TARA&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;m liking the sound of that too!  I have around $300 in my Amazon account just waiting to be used... I love it cuz every now and then something pops up and I&#039;m like &quot;Perfect!  Oooh! And it&#039;s free!!!&quot; hehe... so I&#039;d be up for that option too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Courtney&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I bet he&#039;s secretly doing it on purpose and let&#039;s it be your payment to clean up so he doesn&#039;t have to ;) Ask him!
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Mmmmm... I love those Folger cans.  Reminds me of my grandparents!
@&lt;b&gt;Shane&lt;/b&gt; - Nope, sorry.
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Getting warmer...
@&lt;b&gt;Clever Dude&lt;/b&gt; - There is???  I&#039;m gonna make you show me the next time I come visit you at your house ;) We don&#039;t have them up here.
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Coool!  I actually took out THREE golden dollar coins from this latest batch! I wasn&#039;t sure if the coin machine would catch it?? (and also, I secretly wanted them for my collection ;) even though they&#039;re not worth anything more than $1.00, haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;Ellen&lt;/b&gt; - Awww that is wonderful!  I like your yearly projects - keep them up! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Adam&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... it was probably an owner of a casino ;)  Get them to lure you in so you will stick around! (But yes, you&#039;re also right - they will def. give you cash for free cuz they&#039;ll think you won it there)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! I agree -- I use credit as often as I possibily can too for those exact same reasons... I also like me some dollar coins as well!  I saved THREE from this last batch that I didn&#039;t even remember getting?
@&lt;b&gt;Hunter - Financially Consumed&lt;/b&gt; - WOWWWW that&#039;s stupid.  I&#039;m glad they got caught! (and also -- you have the closest answer so far!!)
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Dang girl!  $500 is no joke!!  Good work!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - You are now the 2nd closest to the winning number ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Cathy&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Cuz people are sneaky!! Smart move on your behalf ;)
@&lt;b&gt;wldflr&lt;/b&gt; - I like it :)  And no, sadly we did not hit the $90s this time... but I can always wait later until the next dump? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - I never said they were &quot;smart&quot; tips ;)]]></description>
