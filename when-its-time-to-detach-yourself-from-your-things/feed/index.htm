					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-its-time-to-detach-yourself-from-your-things/#comment-229462&quot;&gt;Distilled Dollar&lt;/a&gt;.

I would still scan a few things and put them on multiple hard drives.    I down sized a few years ago...started teaching my children to do same.  We move a lot and once you&#039;ve cooked a few meals with just one large pan and a couple utensils, you realize, we don&#039;t need as much as we think!

I didn&#039;t scan any old love letters though...may have to get that done!]]></description>

Sounds like a wonderful adventure! I bet you realize just how much LESS you need too as you&#039;re out traveling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man, this really resonates with me.  We recently sold nearly all of our stuff (and our kids stuff) and are going to be traveling for the next 6 months.  The constant weight that all of our stuff kept on us wasn&#039;t as noticeable before, but now that it&#039;s gone it feels like we&#039;re almost worry free, even though we just got ride of a bunch of junk we hardly ever used.  Weird, right?  

I can see how the &quot;Minimalist&quot; crowd really gets into it.  Less is more for sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like you got caught up on the hedonistic treadmill, my friend. The theory that once we have attained sufficient wealth to be comfortable, we start to work harder to attain more until getting trapped in the endless cycle. Four years ago, I sold virtually all of my possessions, except my work tools, and moved to Australia with two suitcases. Now I have just the things I need to be comfortable (and my tools) and have not been happier. I found it refreshing to cleanse my life of all of the clutter that I&#039;d bought to make my life more comfortable, but never did. Good on you for de-cluttering your collection. That takes some balls, man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, stuff is just that, stuff. I&#039;m long over it after years of moving country to country, but you&#039;d never know it looking inside my four walls. We&#039;re purging, slowly but surely. 

I can confidently say there is nothing in my house, bar people and pets, that I would want to save.

Somehow, the two statements above need to collide.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With respect to the house-on-fire question, I believe I&#039;d grab my pool cue. :)

I&#039;m attracted to the idea of detaching from everything I own. Most would call me a natural minimalist because I&#039;ve always disliked having a lot of stuff around. And when we relocated 3,000 miles in 2009, I downsized my personal belongings by probably 70%. Still, I feel an urge to get rid of more. Seems to me there&#039;s a lot of crap around and stashed in closet back corners that I never use and have forgotten I own. What&#039;s the point? Watch out, I feel another purge coming on! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great set of ground rules to keep things in check...I&#039;m constantly having to monitor my hobbies and keep myself from financial sabotage.  It was classic cars...ditched that habit...now it&#039;s my dirt bikes.  I have to remember to enjoy and not sabotage.

Awesome pics btw!  thanks for writing this up!]]></description>
