					<description><![CDATA[HELOC - $118,000 (balance 0). When DH was laid off (and the bank didn&#039;t know) we had this raised to the maximum we qualified for, just in case. Never needed it and never bothered to have it reduced after he found a new job soon after.
Visa - $20,000 (balance 0) original card (from 25yrs ago) kept only for long credit history. Not actively used. Should check to see if we actually still need to keep this.
Visa - $15,000 (balance ~0) New card ~14mths ago. Earns flight miles and is used for everything. Paid off weekly.
Visa - $1,000 (balance 0) our low limit &quot;internet card&quot; used only for online purchases from unfamiliar sites.
AMEX - $20,000 (balance 0) Hubby&#039;s corporate card for business travel. Paid within a week of charges (when expense check arrives).

TOTAL  $174,000!  Good thing misusing credit cards isn&#039;t concern for us, just a tool for earning mileage for free vacation flights. I know if you are applying for a loan they look at all your available credit as actual debt, but I don&#039;t foresee us ever applying for a loan in our lifetime.  We&#039;re paying off our mortgage ASAP and don&#039;t intend to apply for another. We pay cash for our cars.  Should it ever become an issue, we&#039;ll simply have the HELOC cut down to something more normal.]]></description>
