					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-report-9-doctors-orders/#comment-328392&quot;&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Greg! Great discussion and I think about this a lot. Some assets are more valuable than others, even if they seems to have the same value.

If you were going to account for tax (and things like commissions/fees for selling assets), then I would probably *deduct* the taxes from the deferred accounts vs. inflate the tax free accounts higher than their value. Make sense?

For example if you have a 100k Roth and a 100k 401k... Instead of mentally bumping up the roth 15-25%, maybe try bumping *down* the 401k instead. This will a) make sure you&#039;re not overestimating your FI numbers and b) it&#039;s technically more correct because deferred tax is kind of like a loan from the government. Just a thought.

I know many people do this with real estate, too. They take out 6% for sales commissions and some transaction fees because they true &quot;cash value&quot; is lower than just the listing price.

I guess there&#039;s a bunch of ways to chop it up. In the end all I&#039;m really concerned about is that the number is getting bigger and bigger over time. I like having a mix of both pre-tax and post-tax accounts so I&#039;ll have withdrawal flexibility later in life :)]]></description>

Glad you admit to the dumb speculation... Most people only talk about the times they win, vs. lose :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! Long time reader, first time poster. 
Not sure if I&#039;m overthinking this but thought it might make for a fun discussion/debate.  When calculating your Roth IRA for net worth, it looks like you simply put it&#039;s cash value along with other accounts.   Fair enough, my net worth file does the same as none of us will know what tax rates will be 20+ years into the future.  

But I know $100K in a Roth isn&#039;t the same value as $100K in a 401k/Traditional IRA with the Roth being post-tax and the other pre-tax.  Same goes for the HSA which won&#039;t be taxed in the future either.  To get to some equivalency, I mentally bump my Roth/HSA  up 15-20% based on income/capital gains taxes.  Does that make sense?  Am I missing something here?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had never seen a dog x-ray... until now! Any net worth increase is a good net worth increase. Mine was slightly off the pace thanks to some dumb speculation that unfortunately did not include AMC! Great stuff as always!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[we hold about 9% cash in our total asset mix, but 7% of that is in a stable value fund which should gain us about 2% this year in my 401k.  just a quick note for any of your readers retiring in their 50&#039;s.  if you quit your job and roll your 401k into an ira you can miss out on the &quot;rule of 55.&quot;  that is where you are allowed to start withdrawing from a 401k if you retire in your 55th year without penalty.  doesn&#039;t apply to an ira.  that&#039;s just a fun fact.]]></description>

True!  Actually I re-read my post this morning and thought, &quot;I bet there are people out there that have money market funds *intentionally*!&quot;  So yeah, it was a dumb move for me, because I made a mistake.

Love your views on risk, Steve. The goal is no longer growth when you&#039;ve won the game :). Have a great weekend my friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Leaving investments in cash is only a dumb move when it is unintentional.  Right now I&#039;ve got multiple six figures sitting in cash because it&#039;s just about the same as my bond funds and actually has less downside risk.  I don&#039;t want much more than 50% stock exposure because I don&#039;t need the risk.  I&#039;ve already won the game so I&#039;m playing more conservatively than younger me did when I had 100% equity exposure. You are doing an awesome job of growing your net worth!]]></description>
