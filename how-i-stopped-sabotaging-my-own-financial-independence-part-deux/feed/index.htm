					<description><![CDATA[Great job Monica, I lost my father in 2019, and like you the last 3-5 years prior our relationship improved.  It was hard to let him go, but knowing we parted on good terms was fantastic.  You have a great success story!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tilak,  I&#039;m glad you have a sense of humor about it all and more importantly learned many lessons from it.  It&#039;s a wonderful thing to keep perspective and learn the lessons taught by our own mistakes. What is life without a grand adventure?]]></description>

It&#039;s true rentals have been very good for me. But it&#039;s not for everyone. The biggest take away is to make sure you have multiple streams of passive income. That way if one drops you are covered by the others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can see Rock&#039;s point, especially when a large amount of homes in your neighborhood are rentals. It just isn&#039;t the same community, and can be predatory and greedy when people buy more for the sake of buying more, when they don&#039;t need the money. 

However, like Monica said landlords come in various forms, and they are also giving a place to live to a family. Hopefully the tenants are taking pride in the home and integrating into the community!

Good job on your journey Monica! I self-published a book almost 2 years ago, it&#039;s a wild journey but wonderful accomplishment. Congrats on your book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[wow! You have had quite a negative experience. I can see why you would be so bitter.  The couple on your street has chosen to run their business one way but it 
 does not mean it&#039;s the only way. Landlords come in as many versions as renters. Good luck to you and congratulations on owning your home outright... not everyone can claim that win!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find rental properties to be the most predatory and unethical investment out there.

There&#039;s a couple on my street who literally own about 6 of the houses. So guess what, it means noone can buy a house here, landlords are hogging all the buildings, increasing demand because there&#039;s less availability, pumping prices, people can&#039;t afford to buy a house, renting getting more expensive for the same reason.

I&#039;m happy I own my paid off house but would never be part of that shit.]]></description>
