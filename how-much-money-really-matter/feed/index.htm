Thank you so much, I will - appreciate it :) And a perfect time to be thinking about this stuff too with Thanksgiving and family all around - we need constant reminders so we don&#039;t get sucked into our own little worlds! We&#039;re all very blessed to be living and breathing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post has been on my mind all weekend - thank you for putting it out there. It&#039;s important to remember that we might not always have our family or friends with us, and we need to enjoy them and really live each day. But it&#039;s also to remember that we can&#039;t spend all of our time living in the now - we have to be prepared for the future too, whatever it may bring.

I&#039;ve kept your young friend in my thoughts - please keep us updated on how he&#039;s doing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[GOOD FOR YOU!!! Sucky situations that got you to this point, but great job enjoying some pleasantries on a day-to-day level. I love hearing that :) Saving for the future is of course still pretty important, but you need some mini-splurging along the way to enjoy ourselves in the now as well. And I hope the future brings your family, and your town, a lot more happiness than pain in the years ahead. Thanks so much for stopping by.]]></description>

Awww, thanks so much Kristie!! I needed that :) You&#039;re right - blog or no blog I&#039;d be feeling, and wondering, the same. Good point. So glad you&#039;re getting something out of my blog too and that you enjoy it. My goal is to remain on the more positive side, so I&#039;m happy it&#039;s coming across that way despite posts like this one :) Hope you had a most wonderful Thanksgiving! And a future Christmas too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-much-money-really-matter/#comment-129978&quot;&gt;Dear Debt&lt;/a&gt;.

I hope things get lighter for you and your family as these weeks go by :) I&#039;m a bit better now than I was this time last week (the power of being around family and soul searching), but still not back to the &quot;normal&quot; me... perhaps sometimes we just create a new normal?]]></description>
