Hi Lundy,
I can&#039;t list the websites because of confidentiality agreements that were a part of the sales. But I sold a couple web/graphic design blogs and a couple photography blogs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great advice! I absolutely love what you said in pretty much all of the tips but #12 really hits home.  Being a single parent, working long hours to increase income is not an option, but diligent saving and realistic budgeting are what&#039;s helping me.  I am on my way to being financially free and chronicle my journey too.  I&#039;d love to link to some of your articles! Take care - www.singleparentsaves.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good list - enjoyed going through it.  As one who&#039;s got a year or two over you ... oh heck, how about a decade or two,  I agree with your list and then some. Co-incidentally I&#039;ve been going through a similar review and wish I had YOUR list in my 40&#039;s and followed through on at least a few.  Looking back now, I would  include develop &#038; nurture a strong network right right alongside of  with start saving early, and, #2, forgo credit/debt for instant gratification- in your early 20&#039;s - the money you save will fund investments that will help build your net worth. As they say, your network is your net worth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like tip #11. For a long time, I felt terrible about my savings until my boss, who makes like 3 times what I make, showed me his 403B account. We had very similar amounts in the pot.
Earning more is definitely not always the answer. It can make a difference for sure, as long as you have a sexy budget ;-)]]></description>
