					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Totally was! And that Mint is hot yo! Though I don&#039;t have anything else to compare it too since it was my first ;) But honestly, how can any place housing so much money be bad?
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;Sometimes money is more important, sometimes time is more important.&quot; - SO. TRUE.  And as long as you adjust whenever those times fluctuate, you&#039;ll be a-okay :) Though easily said than done. (And 100% get that subwoofer!  That is always worth spending $ on! Haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;Scott&lt;/b&gt; - Yep! It&#039;s all about stopping and thinking about it first - even for just a few mins - before acting on impulse.  Makes you feel a ton better :)
@&lt;b&gt;DC @ Young Adult Money&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right? I&#039;d have been suuuuper pissed if I paid a lot AND missed it, boy... I was a lucky one that day.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - You know it!
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ Afford Anything&lt;/b&gt; - Hooray!! Good for you!! That same thing happened to me *last* FINCON and I did make that trek out of the hotel, only into a crap-ass one @ $50/night, haha... I should have tried cozying up to other bloggers staying around first ;)
@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, thanks for stopping by :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus III&lt;/b&gt; - Oh boy, at least it wasn&#039;t $40/mile! I&#039;ve seen some crazy freakin&#039; modes of transportation when living in NYC, but sometimes you just get caught off guard.
@&lt;b&gt;The Financial Blogger&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! At least you had a killer time there ;) I was jealous I didn&#039;t stay behind and join you guys - looked like so much fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think money is made to be spent :-).

I always rather spend more and try to make it. Sometimes you lose but you live an interesting life. If you just pile up your cash, you might be rich but your life isn&#039;t that fun :-).

We actually had to take a cab in Denver to see the Football game.... that was &#039;cause we got to the Rookies&#039; Sadium instead of the Bronco&#039;s... darn Canadian Tourist! heh? hahaha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last December, we were in NYC walking around and being touristy until my buddy who lives there got out of work so we could meet up for dinner. Not knowing any better, we got into one of those black cars that are kind of cabs but not quite. Guy charged us $20 for a mile and a half! When I told my friend he just laughed. Turns out you can negotiate a price ahead of time, but otherwise you&#039;re just going to get ripped off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a similiar experience! My flight home from FINCON wasn&#039;t scheduled to leave until Monday. That meant I needed a place to stay on Sunday night.

I planned to check out of the hotel, board a public bus (with all my luggage), ride down to a Denver suburb, walk 4-5 blocks to a friend&#039;s house, and stay there while my friend is out of town. (She left me a key).

But by the end of the conference, I was exhausted. And that plan sounded terrible. Ugh. 

So I called the hotel desk and asked what it would cost to stay an extra night. $209, they said. Yikes! At that rate, I&#039;d rather take the bus / walk.

Fortunately, I found some awesome bloggers who snagged Sunday night at the $99 rate, and they let me stay with them in their room (roommates!!), bringing the cost down to $33 for each of us ($38 with tax). Hooray!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly you can only plan ahead so much.  There is going to be those times that you have to bite the bullet and pay more than you&#039;d like for something like transportation.  At least you made it to the Mint in time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah the dilemma&#039;s of personal finance.  I encounter many people making that decision everyday.  Sometimes money is more important, sometimes time is more important.  So many times we beat ourselves with the &quot;cheapy&quot; stick which saves us money but makes life crappy.  I have a big problem with that.  But I am adjusting.  Seeing you spend money with little regret but always concious of the pros and cons inspires me :)  I&#039;ve begin to outsource chores and purchase things with less regret.  Finding the right balance will definately bring about some happiness.  Now if I can get myself to justify buying a new computer and a bigger subwoofer for my car...]]></description>
