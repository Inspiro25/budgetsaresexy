					<description><![CDATA[Happy Friday Joel and Alise!

I love your Stircrazi idea... and can see why it came off as such a hit - congrats! It&#039;s amazing to see how despite COVID-19, which certainly has not been the easiest of times for many of us, some people have taken the bull by the horns and have turned the situation around for themselves - for the better. It&#039;s amazing how you turned a simple idea into a thriving business. 

Good luck on your journey and I look forward to reading more from you :)
