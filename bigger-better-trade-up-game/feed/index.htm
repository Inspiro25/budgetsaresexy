Yeah, possibly? I know there&#039;s an auction house near where I am right now actually - I should show them a pic and see what happens :)

I also wondered if I could turn it into some sort of cool coffee table and THEN pawn it off? So it&#039;s actually more functional in the real world, ya know? Would get more use out of than just sitting somewhere collecting dust probably.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats one pimp stroller J Money!  Even got the white walled tires lol.  Nice one I would keep that one though for a few more years and then but it in the antique.  The right person would gladly spend more then 100$ for that one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way back in the eighties, before I learned the value of a dollar (gosh I sound old but boy was I dumb), my dh and I bought a new stroller like this and it came with all sorts of goodies.  Cost us around $800 !! Yes, naive. Young and no family or Internet to advise us. But we loved that thing and used it till it got shabby after four kids. We kept it in our room for a bassinet when we weren&#039;t strolling around with it. And it came with a regular seat for when the baby got older. Wow, thanks for the walk down memory lane!!  I always thought you could make a great go-cart out of it. If it doesn&#039;t sell you&#039;ll have to try it.]]></description>
