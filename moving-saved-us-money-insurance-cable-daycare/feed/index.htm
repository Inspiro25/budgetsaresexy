Haha how much does your home cost there? If you ever want to guest post about what it&#039;s like to live (financially) in Romania, you have a spot here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those are some great savings! Makes me consider moving to a different place (although if I&#039;m moving away from Romania, everything, anywhere will be probably more expensive lol). And for the insurance, to make things even better, you could say that it dropped from 940 since that would&#039;ve been the amount you had to pay :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a large chunk of savings. I live in nyc and I&#039;ve always wondered how much I would save if  I moved somewhere else. But at the same time, I wouldn&#039;t be making nearly as much. There&#039;s definitely a lot of things to consider, maybe one day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We had to buy a short term policy for July and August and we used ehealthinsurance as well!  We got the same Anthem plan we had before...at a similar cost.  I was so worried about buying a plan on the open market...but it really wasn&#039;t that bad!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Living in Dallas means we have a lower cost of living than DC. But money still adds up :(
We saved $10 every month by asking State Farm to add us to their Safe Driving program! When we moved within the city to where we live now our costs went up. Higher rent for a supposedly better apartment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J-Money. Great that you are saving  money.  I worry a little bit about the daycare.  Daycares that charge so little are probably not paying their teachers/staff very well.  That is  a big problem for staff retention and quality.  Quality staff is the number one thing I&#039;d be looking for, after all these are the people spending time with your child for many hours.   Do yourself a favor and call your state office that oversees day cares and make sure they are not in violation and have good records. Our state is heavily, heavily regulated and I was very grateful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woot! Congrats on the money savings! Sounds nice:P 

I&#039;ve got good news: I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to GEICO! Haha...actually I really did. Geico has one of the lowest prices and good customer service ratings. So far so good! I filed a report once but haven&#039;t had to make a claim yet.

I was also debating on switching hosting services...but decided to try calling them first to see if they could offer me a deal. Dropped the monthly $2!]]></description>
