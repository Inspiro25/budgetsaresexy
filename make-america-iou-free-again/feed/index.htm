					<description><![CDATA[WOE is me. This old post struck a bad nerve. OUCH!
1) loaned family member $1000. She paid back $100.
2) loaned old boyfriend $1000. He paid back na dah.
3) loaned co-worker $50. She quit &#038; moved. Paid back na dah.
4) loaned friend $300. She paid back $50.
Friend was going to pay back $50 a month. After 6 months I emailed asking the status. I finally received a check for $50 with a note somehow blaming me saying &quot;here&#039;s $50. Our grocery $$. Now we don&#039;t eat this week&quot;. I never emailed/heard from her again. 10 year friendship gone.
Hubby&#039;s best friend asked to borrow $8000 last year. Hubby told him &quot;friends and $$ don&#039;t mix&quot;. He knew we were flush with cash as we&#039;d just sold our home &#038; were temporarily renting. He sold his motorcycle for $5000 &#038; moved overseas!
No more wallet WOES for me. For now on, only wallet WOAH&#039;S! Better to gift the $$ unless you get a promissory note &#038; even then some don&#039;t pay back what they borrowed. When they ask what&#039;s in your wallet, I tell them &quot;dust&quot;.
Thanx for the archives. A lot of interesting old posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I somehow missed the page!  I&#039;m not shocked that more LGBT folks have ended a relationship over money. Our community, as a whole, is more economically insecure. We are more likely to be un/underemployed. There is also a lot of substance abuse in segments of our community that leads to even bigger money issues. My girlfriend&#039;s uncle was in town recently and was so surprised at the number of AA/NA meetings that were focused on the LGBT community. We explained to him why that was; he found places he felt welcome, but had not realized that the LGBT community was such a big part of the AA/NA community.  This is partially from the number of LGBT teenagers who are kicked out of their homes for their sexuality and gender identity and also from the untreated mental suffering inflicted by some dangerous homophobia.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;It’s not so much the money part itself that would kill me, it’s all the LYING and then repeated broken promises over time.&quot; 

Absolutely! And that goes for any vice. It&#039;s so much more damaging when a partner finds out by accident too. Better fess up and deal with it when it&#039;s a molehill and not a mountain...

And unfortunately, the guilt and the shame can lead to the person who did wrong to make some pretty awful decisions for their life and for that of others that can have dire and permanent consequences. The movie &quot;Maxed Out&quot; is a good reminder of that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ack! Lying to one&#039;s partner about spending is so bad - it&#039;s a recipe for disaster, fights, unhappiness... how depressing!

Hmmm, on the bright side, at least 74% haven&#039;t lied to their partners about their spending, right?

re: Millennials feel more secure about their retirement (20 percent) versus those aged 35-54 (12 percent

I wonder if this is because retirement seems soooo far away to Millennials, and this makes them feel like they have plenty of time to save up compared to the older age group.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey so far not owed anything. I do owe my parents as they raised me so many years, and that can never be fully paid back, thanks MnD. Stats are fun to read, and it helps people feel good or bad depending on where you fall on the stat line. Good luck PF readers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It surprised me too. I don&#039;t owe or lend any money to friends. I guess we are all doing well financially so we don&#039;t need to lean on each other that much. I prefer to gift if they really need it. 
I agree with you about the Millenial data. They don&#039;t worry about it much because they are too busy having fun.]]></description>
