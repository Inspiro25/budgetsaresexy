					<description><![CDATA[Living in a place where we can only afford to rent, I try to remind myself to be thankful for never having to replace a boiler.  &quot;Replace a boiler&quot; is short hand for my husband and I about all the terrifying things we know nothing about, being renters. I am vague on exactly what the boiler does, but I have some sense it is an expensive big deal.  But it does suck when your landlord won&#039;t let you paint your kitchen cabinets- that&#039;s when I wish I owned my kitchen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/there-are-no-rules-in-money-life/#comment-234148&quot;&gt;Financial Samurai&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh wow!

Well, I don&#039;t know about the sitting empty part haha, but yes - I can confidently say that I don&#039;t miss an ounce of owning that old place :) I still have some happy memories from first moving in and having our child there and all that goodness, but it was 100% the right move and it feels a ton lighter walking around these days! 

The best is when it rains or snows hard and I don&#039;t have to worry about anything breaking since I&#039;m not responsible for anything anymore :) It does feel strange to pay rent sometimes, but I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way right now. 

Def. worth considering for simplification reasons. Especially if you love to travel and like moving around a lot... We haven&#039;t done much of that since having kids, but we hope to again sometime soon. It&#039;s great not having &quot;things&quot; you&#039;re attached to out there :) At least psychologically speaking... I think you&#039;re more in tune w/ the financial aspect of things than I am though, so of course you have to weigh that part pretty heavily as well.]]></description>

Yes indeed! Every day is a chance to redo or change or start anything you want :) It won&#039;t always be easy but we&#039;re lucky to have free will!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this post! It is so true... When I took a risk and went from full time to per-diem work I took a giant leap. But I wasn&#039;t really scared because in the back of my head I knew I could simply resume full-time work again. A giant risky leap all wrapped up in a security blanket! mylittlebluekayak.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J,

Do you still feel great not owning your place versus when you first sold? How does it compare now (even happier you sold) versus then?

I ask b/c I&#039;m contemplating selling my own condo this year to simplify life. I might even just let the place sit empty for 2 years to try and get as much tax free profit as possible due to this rule. I don&#039;t want to deal w/ tenants and responsibility anymore!

					<description><![CDATA[This is something that I need to remind myself of more.

I get really frustrated and fixated in one moment, and then I snap back to reality and realize that there are no rules, and that I can make my own decisions!

Great post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a huge debate and even here in New Zealand we see this talked about from time to time. Personally I like the fact that we own our own home, but that is more about the security and stability rather than for any economic reason.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is very inspiring and something that everyone should remember.  I believe that individuality is the best part about personal finance but a lot of people get to a point where it is one way or no way to succeed. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.]]></description>
