					<description><![CDATA[Although it is fun, I sincerely have to agree with Karen. I&#039;ve been dog-walking and pet-sitting for 6 years now and have taken it upon myself to further my knowledge by taking the Pet Saver First Aid and CPR class, and by continuing my own education thru Pet Sitters International(PSI), which had blogs and we binary regarding pet-sitting and dog-walking. I&#039;ve also purchased pet-sitting and dog-walking insurance thru Pet Care Insurance (can also purchase thru PSI). There is also a national organization of pet-sitters. Both the national and PSI offer certification courses for pet-sitting. It&#039;s really more than just a side hustle or gig.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Extremely irresponsible! You are encouraging people who just want to make a little extra money to do a very important job of taking care of people’s precious pets and their homes! Look at the records of the “gig” companies like Rover and Wag. Multiple stories of lost and dead pets because people aren’t really responsible and skilled enough to take good care. 

As a consumer you are best served to hire a reputable, established, locally owned dog walking/pet sitting company who has insurance to protect your interests and who has a team of educated and skilled dog and cat handlers. 

There’s a lot more to dog walking than holding a leash and picking up poop. Liking dogs is not enough]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dog-walking sounds like my kind of side hustle... although my dog would get pretty jealous and he doesn&#039;t really like to walk with stranger dogs. Alright, I&#039;ll reconsider. Maybe counting worms is more up my alley :o)  At Mango Money we have a post on side hustles as well, and dog walking was on our list! If you&#039;re in search of a great side hustle, check out our post too and keep your options open. Thanks for the great post, J.

					<description><![CDATA[Brooklyn Money, 

I personally do not own a dog walking business, so I am not licensed or insured. I guess the best way to answer this is to say that there are different &quot;levels&quot; of dog walking. You can start your own actual dog walking business (which is to say you get incorporated and apply to be bonded and insured, etc), you can apply for a job with a dog walking/pet sitting company that is already licensed and insured and be an employee who gets the advantage of being with a company who has those credentials, or you can go at it on your own and get jobs that do not require you to be licensed and insured. Sites like Sittercity.com have background checks that show up on your profile to give you some credibility, and then you can meet with potential clients who will judge your trustworthiness, etc on their own and decide to hire you or not. 

If hired by a client on your own, I&#039;d suggest coming up with a Terms &#038; Conditions form (I just made mine in a Word doc) that lists things like payment terms, what you are not responsible for, what you are responsible for, etc. Have both parties sign and retain a copy for yourself just in case anything does happen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Justin, 

It&#039;s totally fun and can be really profitable if your schedule and lifestyle can accommodate the most needed walking times (11am-2pm)! Good luck :)]]></description>
