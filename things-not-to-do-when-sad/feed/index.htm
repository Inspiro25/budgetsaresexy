					<description><![CDATA[Thanks guys, your messages and prayers are helping! :)  A bit better tonight but we still got a ways to go...and yeah, def. not good to touch food in this mood! haha... forgot about that one.  After I shoved my face full of chocolates already.  oops.

@&lt;b&gt;Ahnie&lt;/b&gt; - I totally 100% love this idea of helping others! It&#039;s so true - the days I physically go out of my way to help other people it feels sooooo good and I get an automatic high.  Whether it&#039;s donating my time or money or skills or whatever.  I&#039;m going to try this really soon because of you, thanks for the reminder :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook seems to help me when I am down.  Last night I had the worse migraine of all time, and turned to Facebook for help.  I got some good advice and even some funny comments that helped lighten the mood.  Yes, I do agree with Chris@TheSnackHound hilarious writing happens when things have hit the fan.  Let&#039;s just say I now believe that eating too many crackers leads to cocaine usage ;).]]></description>
