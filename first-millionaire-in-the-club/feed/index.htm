You are already part of the 1%. You are already a millionaire in mindset. It&#039;s just that the &#039;facts&#039; haven&#039;t caught up yet! But they will!]]></description>

Yes, its been mandatory since the early 1990&#039;s.  Means Australia has one of the larger pots of retirement savings in the world on a per capita basis.  These type of accounts are about $1.5T, where as the Australian population is about 22M.  However, such a big pool of funds makes it pretty tempting for government to keep trying to change the rules, so there is a lot of perceived policy risk for it as an investment vehicle.]]></description>

D&#039;uh. Yeah, that makes a lot more sense, haha... I must have been half-sleeping while trying to calculate that in my head ;)

And also, congrats again my man! Or better yet, Mr. Millionaire!]]></description>

Good question!  By &quot;net&quot; I mean the value of my assets (about $1.6M) less the value of my debt (about $550k).  The debt is all investment debt (business loan and margin debt against stocks). 

However, the same method would be true if looking at a house.  A $1,000,000 house with a $900,000 mortgage would not (in my opinion) make you worth $1,000,000, but just the difference, $100,000.

Hope that helps!]]></description>

Yes, I&#039;m in Australia.  The retirement system here is based around superannuation accounts (retirement account by another name).  You must contribute 9% (rising to 12%) of pre-tax salary, and can choose to contribute more than this.  Both contributions and earnings are taxed at 15%, as opposed to whatever your marginal tax rate may be (38.5% for me).]]></description>
