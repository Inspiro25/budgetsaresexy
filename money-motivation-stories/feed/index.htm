					<description><![CDATA[I think that saving money is not all about income.  It has more to do with your discipline and mindset.  You have to want to do it and believe that you can.  Without these two things, no matter how much money you make, you won&#039;t save a dime.  If Michael Jackson can go broke, anyone can.  So motivate yourself to build a better financial future for yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great J$!!!!! There&#039;s too much negativity out there and having a shot of motivation from real people is great. Thanks for putting this up! Yours is the first personal finance blog I started reading when I graduated from college, moved to LA and was trying to figure out what to do with money. Fast forward to now and I now have built up my net worth and am aiming to be a millionaire. Just shared your blog with a friend who is trying to figure out their finances too, hope they get as much out of it as I do!]]></description>

I get it, I think once I get to 250k Ill feel that sense of accomplishment, given my age  and the timing to reach 250K, that should put me at a mil by retirement no matter what I do afterwards.  Granted my goal is much larger than that but I think psychologically knowing that there is a great chance of a 7 fig retirement would take a weight off.]]></description>

You are already! Less than 1% of people ever reach out to tell you how your story is affecting them, but I can assure you that it is. Keep pouring your heart into it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing and inspiring stories.

Proves to show that it is never too early or too late to start getting serious about one&#039;s finances. No matter how bad the situation, one can overcome things if he/she sets their mind on it - it won&#039;t be easy and it won&#039;t be quick, but eventually it will happen.

It is so awesome that you&#039;ve made such a big impact on people&#039;s lives and I am sure this is only a very very very small sample of the other appreciative emails you get! Continue doing what you are doing!

I hope to be as inspiring to my readers one day.]]></description>

Haha,

We didn&#039;t have a choice.  That&#039;s the only place we could afford.  Would we go back now and live there? Hell No :-)]]></description>
