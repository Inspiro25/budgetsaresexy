					<description><![CDATA[I am delighted to read of all your NON-DIGITAL activities with granddaughters: library books, baking from scratch, sewing and gardening. Those girls have a wonderful head start on their adult lives.

Thanks for posting this, J!]]></description>

I am part of a no spend group on Facebook and if I ever feel like a I need a boost, I get on and read/participate. I feel like I can do better too. I&#039;m going to see how much better I can do in 2020!  My oldest daughter manages our yearly secret Santa name  picking by some app she found.  We have a $50 limit.  We even have the three granddaughters do the same, even though two of the are sisters!]]></description>

I started listening to The Year of Less by Cate Flanders yesterday.  Her story is very interesting. I encourage you to read or listen (I buy super cheap audio books from Chirp.com).   I&#039;m sure I will finish it today.  Start with one or two things. Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/our-no-spend-year/#comment-286868&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;.

I was raised by a very frugal mother. We had to practically force her to buy a new bed when she was in her 70s.  On a teacher&#039;s salary, in 7 years after she and my father split up, she saved and paid off her home.  At 90 she has enough money to live in a nice assisted living facility near my home (that I used to run until my retirement).  I think my spending was trying to make my children&#039;s life better than mine as a child.  I didn&#039;t have enough socks and by the ages of 2 and 4, both my older daughters had about 30 pairs of socks.  I figured that out!  I still love socks but I can walk in a store without buying any now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/our-no-spend-year/#comment-286867&quot;&gt;Working Mom&lt;/a&gt;.

We had two young teenage boys trick or treat and ask for canned food for some food drive.  We have always had a full pantry so I got a grocery bag and filled it up.  His eyes got wide when he saw the bag.  I love being able to do that and wish I could do more, but stupid spending in our earlier years prevents that now. We do donate to St. Jude&#039;s every month.  Also we have a very wealthy friend from high school,  who responded to me on Facebook, after I said something about getting my husband in a costume, saying he would pay money to see that.  I said how much? I got DH to put on the Santa Costume I bought after Christmas last year for 75% off, we took a picture, posted on Facebook tagging friend that sending a check directly to St. Jude&#039;s would be fine.  A week later we got a card from St. Jude&#039;s saying a donation was made in DH&#039;s name.  We were so happy!]]></description>
