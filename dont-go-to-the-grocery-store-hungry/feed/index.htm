					<description><![CDATA[@Khaleef: Well, that&#039;s not the *only* reason I carry it. I got into the habit when I was a student and sometimes wound up on campus longer than I&#039;d planned. I didn&#039;t want to have to buy a snack, especially since I&#039;m an avid couponer and have bought granola bars for as little as one penny each.
Now I think it&#039;s a good idea to have something to eat just in case, say, my bus breaks down and it takes me an extra hour to get home when I&#039;m already pretty hungry. I&#039;ve also given away a couple: Once to a panhandler and once on the bus on Halloween, as I walked past a costumed preschooler carrying a plastic pumpkin half-full of sugary loot. He looked surprised. His mother smiled and said &quot;Gracias.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Donna, that&#039;s a great tip! I do that in general to avoid buying fast food on the road, but I never thought about carrying a snack just in case you need to stop by the market.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always have at least one granola bar in my backpack, in case I get low blood sugar when I&#039;m a long way from home. Any time I find myself near a market with good prices, I eat the granola bar before I go in. A quick snack goes straight to my ears: I can&#039;t hear the siren songs of potato chips, cookies, etc. (And believe me: All junk food knows my name.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s pretty good!  Makes my $110 a week look bad considering there are just TWO of us ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ace&lt;/b&gt; - Haha....I hear ya brotha.  My wife will stop me too...but if I&#039;m really hungry I&#039;ll buy it anyways!
@&lt;b&gt;Nunzio Bruno&lt;/b&gt; - We&#039;re like doctors who smoke ;)  We KNOW what&#039;s best but we don&#039;t always follow our advice.  At least we&#039;re aware of it though!
@&lt;b&gt;finallygettingtoeven.com&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  That makes a lot of sense actually.  I take it you don&#039;t open up food and eat it there while shopping then, eh?  Every now and then I&#039;ll do that (and pay for it of course) to help sooth me.
@&lt;b&gt;Caitlin&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you guys!!  I&#039;m hoping/thinking we&#039;ll change our ways once we start producing bebes ;)  It&#039;ll at least get us on a regular eating schedule again, we&#039;ve been eating dinner at 11pm lately - crazy.
@&lt;b&gt;Everyday Tips&lt;/b&gt; - Mmmmmmm...I can go for some Panera right now!  Love that place :)
@&lt;b&gt;Suzanne&lt;/b&gt; - Blasphemy!  Haha...it&#039;s true though.  Us husbands &amp; kids shop with our eyes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never go to the grocery store hungry; and I try at all costs to leave my family at home! My kids and hubby are the worst shoppers and totally throw off my coupon, sale, and bargain shopping mojo! They throw items in the cart that are not on the list, not on sale, and without a coupon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are so right on this one.  I try to hit the grocery store right after a big, filling meal from Panera.  :)

I know if we get a bonus or something, it is easy to say &#039;hey, lets just go out to dinner&#039;.  That&#039;s fine if you do it once if you are going to celebrate.  But, it has to stop there.  I think part of why athletes and such go broke is because they just see a lump of money and have no self control.  I try to preallocate any &#039;extra&#039; money so I don&#039;t feel like there actually is any extra.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We used to just buy whatever struck our fancy, but that was KILLING our budget. So I started planning out our meals for a two week period and making the list from that. And I have to stick exactly to the list when I go shopping--which is difficult when my husband comes along. He is always trying to sneak in the box of twinkies. :) We also cut out snack foods (besides fruits, vegetables &#038; yogurts) and I can&#039;t remember the last time I bought something like a taco kit or hamburger helper. Making things from scratch can save so much money! It&#039;s a lot of work, but right now with both of us working on our masters and working probationary student positions, it&#039;s a must!]]></description>
