					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - haha, you and your pirate&#039;s gold :)  you should take a picture of it and throw it up on the blog for all of us to see!  And good call w/ ING too - those sub-accounts are crucial.
@&lt;b&gt;katie&lt;/b&gt; - WOW, cool! I lived in Itaewon too!!!  They had no housing for us on base, so we had to go outside and live for the year we were there :)  Imagine if we crossed paths back then and didn&#039;t even know it?  That would be awesome... actually, would be funnier if we DO know each other! haha... kinda hard when one of us remains anonymous though ;)  That&#039;s awesome you&#039;ve been back since, I need to do that again... one of my all-time favorite years of my life.
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Wealthy barber,yeah - that one comes up every now and then - still have to read it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Andrew&lt;/b&gt; - OOoooh I like Amex too.  Have my company card through them and love it.
@&lt;b&gt;myloverswife&lt;/b&gt; - I know right?  I see them more than usual if I&#039;m down in DC since they spit &#039;em out at all metro stations as change (instead of dollar bills), but other than that it&#039;s rare I see one in the wild.
@&lt;b&gt;Erica Mueller&lt;/b&gt; - haha, yeah a quarter is like $20 to a kid! :)  and still have to poke around Freshbooks too.  some of my friends use &#039;em and swear by them. Thanks for popping over my friend!
@&lt;b&gt;diane&lt;/b&gt; - Great! That&#039;s exactly what I wanted to get outta this post - lots of good ways to learn :)  Good thinking with the library!
@&lt;b&gt;Little House&lt;/b&gt; - Amex has mutual funds??  Intereeeeeesting... gonna have to look into that!
@&lt;b&gt;Marilyn @ our cheap disney vacation&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha... you crack me up, girl :) And you&#039;re the first person I know to use PearBudgets! Even though I&#039;ve only ever heard great things about them.  Totally forgot they were around, good job bringing &#039;em bck ;)
@&lt;b&gt;South County Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for posting about it!  And I&#039;m totally with you on Excel- it&#039;s HUGE in my budgeting/tracking too.... well, Google&#039;s version anyways, haha.... the generic &quot;Excel&quot; ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[http://southcountygirl.blogspot.com/2011/05/five-for-friday-round-3.html

It&#039;s posted over at the blog, but here are my answers:
1) What’s your favorite credit card?

HSBC&#039;s Household Credit Card... 2 % cash back on everything!!!!! I get $25 checks in the mail... Cash is King!

2) What’s your favorite financial book?

Actually, I&#039;ve yet to read one so I don&#039;t have a favorite.

3) What’s your all-time favorite financial company?

Tricky... hmmmm Disney, I&#039;m a little kiddo on the inside.

4) What’s your favorite financial tool? (could be software, investment vehicles, or anything you consider a “tool” really)

Excell and my $5 flash drive. I&#039;d die without them.

5) And lastly, what’s your favorite coin? ;)

I like the golden dollar... I love randomly getting them when I use cash some place... Fan-tastic! and its great when I empty the change drawer and find them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fun questions J money.

1) What’s your favorite credit card?
Meh, don&#039;t have favorite card.  Maybe when I saving up for a trip to DisneyWorld I like the Disney visa.

2) What’s your favorite financial book?
Kinda financial - it&#039;s called Mindset by Carol Dweck. She&#039;s a PhD psychologist at Stanford and presents some amazing anecdotes and research. Basic premise is people who aren&#039;t afraid to do hard work and believe they can grow, are more successful and happier. Seems simple, duh, why wouldn&#039;t everyone think like that.  But many times we don&#039;t.  And she points out some areas of peoples lives where the don&#039;t. One of those books that completely shifts the way I think about the world.

3) What’s your all-time favorite financial company?
Vangaurd.  Thank your for cheap, well managed mutual funds.  And thier logo is practically a pirate ship.  Awesome.

4) What’s your favorite financial tool? (could be software, investment vehicles, or anything you consider a “tool” really)
Hands down, PearBudgets free downloadable spreadsheet. I had the worst time budgeting before I found it.  Now I&#039;ve been using them strong goin on 4 years now. Simple, cheap, I enter my purchases in and it tracks things really well.  Informercial end.

5) And lastly, what’s your favorite coin? ;)
Sacagawea dollar. How many women make it onto American currency? And she was a rockin awesome lady too.  And it&#039;s simplier to pay for public transit, you don&#039;t have to worry if the dumb machine will accept your paper dollar bill.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love USAA as well. Love the AMEX card (and rewards) and the fact that I opened a mutual fund up with them and the interface to add money, check the balance, transfer it, etc. is soooo easy to use. Favorite tool - my BIKE! Favorite book, hmmm....I&#039;m not sure about that one. Favorite coin - the quarter; only takes 4 to make a dollar. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) What’s your favorite credit card?
None. I don&#039;t even own one, and never have. My husband has two with Capital One and they seem to be good.
2) What’s your favorite financial book?
Have to agree with you on The Richest Man in Babylon! Love it!
3) What’s your all-time favorite financial company?
Probably Capital One. We&#039;ve tried several banks, and no one has treated us as well as they do. Their online tools are phenomenal too. I have a couple business accounts there, as well as a savings. (We keep the personal checking at a separate bank)
4) What’s your favorite financial tool? (could be software, investment vehicles, or anything you consider a “tool” really)
Mint.com for personal finance/budget. Freshbooks.com for business.
5) And lastly, what’s your favorite coin? ;)
The quarter. I think this is because I have a 4yr old. He knows that any change he finds laying on the dresser can be his (and boy does he snatch it up fast) except the quarters. Mommy and Daddy save those for washing the car. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) What’s your favorite credit card?
I don&#039;t have a favorite credit card. They&#039;re all evil! Or at least they&#039;re evil when in my possession.

2) What’s your favorite financial book?
I&#039;d have to save Total Money Makeover since it&#039;s the one that I&#039;ve read most recently.

3) What’s your all-time favorite financial company?
Not sure...perhaps LPL Financial since they manage my investments.

4) What’s your favorite financial tool? 
It was MS Money until they did away with the program. I&#039;m now using mint.com...it&#039;s okay.

5) And lastly, what’s your favorite coin? ;)
The $1 coin because I rarely come as across one.]]></description>

Book: Not a fan of fiction, so anything educational (technical, etc.)

Company: American Express

Tool: Computer--I couldn&#039;t track my finances without it. I&#039;m not sure I remember how those &quot;pen and paper&quot; things work anymore. 

Coin: The British pound sterling. It seems like the perfect size and weight for a coin.]]></description>
