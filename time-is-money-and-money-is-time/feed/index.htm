					<description><![CDATA[Agreed - time is definitely money. And I&#039;ve been guilty of taking it too far myself by doing a day job that was already paying 6 figures and sneaking off to drive Lyft while working so I can earn a few extra books. I&#039;d also keep driving until like 2-3am at night, having to wake up the next day to get to work lol.

And then I realized that I really should only trade time for money if one unit of time equates to much more money than I can currently make at my W-2. Otherwise, I&#039;m burning my otherwise free time as diminishing returns on money I feel like.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the added benefits, I have found, is the stress relief in paying someone else to do a chore.  I have my yard mowed, weed whacked and cleaned up; knowing it is going to be done every week is a great stress reliever to me.  Not spending my free time on it; I have 1.5 acres, but knowing it will still look lovely is worth the price.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love it! Thanks for sharing this Joel. Reminds me of one of my favorite Thoreau quotes:

&quot;The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run&quot;

Thanks for highlighting that it&#039;s a two-way exchange rate!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Makes sense to me. And as you get older, the more you a value time over money. Probably because your best time, and partly because you have more money.

My motto for the next decade is, “do what you want!”]]></description>
