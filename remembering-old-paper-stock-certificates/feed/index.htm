A great problem to have!! :) Maybe they&#039;ll let you keep them after you convert &#039;em? Just put a bunch of holes all over and stamps showing they&#039;re redeemed or something - that&#039;s what mine look like. Or turn around and sell them for $5 a piece and re-invest THAT money back into more stock! haha.... YES!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome posts today!  I bought my daughter savings bonds when she was first born, for her first birthdays, etc.  She&#039;s now 32, and still has them; won&#039;t let them go for anything!  I was surprised when she told me some of her friends had never seen such a thing...so the next time I hit a garage sale I&#039;m definitely going to be looking for these.  Also, thanks to all who shared ideas &#038; links.  Very cool.  Also love the old album covers as wall art but most of all-is there anything as sweet as that crackly sound when you put the needle on the vinyl????]]></description>

Yeah, totally. You can do it pretty much 24/7 now without any hassle - it&#039;s great... And for those who miss the certificates we can just go buy some oldies :)]]></description>
