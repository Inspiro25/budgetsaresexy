					<description><![CDATA[This has been super encouraging to me. Especially when you said you paid off that amount of debt in 3 1/2 years with a 40k salary. Sometimes I feel like I&#039;m paying large sums only to never see a change. I have been told to try bankruptcy but I&#039;m only around $15,500 in credit card debt that I&#039;m trying to pay off so I think I can make this happen. It&#039;s just one credit card that is massively getting bigger and bigger. But I know that being sober now, my money will be used for more good than bad and that things will happen if I trust, don&#039;t get too far ahead of myself, breathe, pray, and trust. I am also tithing again and every time I do that I have been blessed financially. Thanks again for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wahoo! Well done to you Deanna! Your chat actually looks like a chart of my mental health!
I&#039;m 40 years old and 5y 10m sober and my life (and my finances!) have totally turned around too! 
I went from waking up with receipts in my purse of bars I&#039;ve never been to (!!) to a fully up-to-date YNAB account with savings for rainy days, the next few months bills, next year&#039;s summer vacation, etc. I have no debt (in fairness, I&#039;ve always been debt adverse even when partying all the time), and a totally manageable mortgage. Sober living is good living!  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your story is so inspiring! Thank you for being so vulnerable and sharing from your heart. It will help others see that it&#039;s never too late to make a change, to get out of debt, or to catch-up savings!]]></description>
