					<description><![CDATA[Yes, but you know what?  You have DREAMS!!!  And that is by far the biggest importance here.  You&#039;re in the mindset of reaching your goals, whatever they may be, and you can keep striving toward this amazing end point :)  Well, not really endpoint cuz it actually STARTS there, but you get what I&#039;m saying.  

You can do it!!  Keep hustling and working your temp jobs &amp; side gigs, cuz one day it&#039;ll be all about YOUR projects and you can look back and be glad you don&#039;t have to go back to it :)  Fellow designers unite!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;As crazy as it sounds, I am MUCH happier now making 50% less than I was rolling in the money. &quot;

Like you a person who just got laid off their full time job in March (but always had freelance hustle on the side) this is SO freaggin inspiring to me.  This past week I&#039;ve been temping in an office, doing boring design work I gotta say it&#039;s painful to sit there for 8 hours straight when there is SO much I want to do in life, and nights and weekends aren&#039;t enough! 

I want to become a way better designer, I want to learn After Effects, I want to get Adobe Certified I want to travel and see family and friends. I think there is a huge shift happening with more people being creative and working from home. It seems like more of a common lifestyle that&#039;s not so strange anymore.

Unfortunately right now I&#039;m totally hustling with the part time jobs too (but thankfully some are work from home) , but I gotta pay the rent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;C Ann&lt;/b&gt; - Haha Nope!  I actually didn&#039;t get a &quot;real&quot; salaried job until almost a year after college ;)  I was hustlin&#039; with 3 part-time jobs at the same time and trying to make it in NYC as a graphic designer (which I later realized wasn&#039;t what I wanted to do as a career).  So I washed cars (wrecked ones as I mentioned up in an earlier question up there), washed dishes (yeah Applebees!) and then spent my days at Old Navy.  I did this combination for around a year, and then ended up working for the airlines as my first salaried job.  Then hopped to other salaried jobs until I got laid off last December.  Does this inspire you? :)

@&lt;b&gt;Kari&lt;/b&gt; - No worries!  It&#039;s basically just a bunch of bloggers who submit their best articles of the week to another blogger who rounds all their favorites up and then posts them on their site when it&#039;s their turn (you have to sign up to participate, and each &quot;carnival&quot; has their own rules and regulations around it). It&#039;s a great way for bloggers to get their articles in front of a different audience each week, and for the hosting blogger to give their readers new voices to check out too.  It&#039;s win-win when done right :)  (aka - you only put the &quot;best&quot; ones in there and not 100+ that overwhelms people).  There are a good 5-8 different carnivals out there in the PF world, which is probably why you see them pop up a lot.  Does this help?]]></description>
