					<description><![CDATA[@ all – I apologize for not responding earlier, but I was out of town and didn’t know that the article was getting posted so soon.

@Call Me What You Want Even Cheap – Amen, brother.  That’s what makes budgeting so important – to help ensure you can take advantage of these types of investments.

@Lance@MoneyLife&#038;More – Yeah, in this fluctuating market you want to make sure that you can sell right away.

@Joe@Retire By 40 – I agree it’s not a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket.  As an employee, I already have my wages coming from the company.  It would be too risky to carry a significant portion of my investments in the stock of the same company.

@bobbi – Luckily for me, my company still offers the %15 discount. They have reduced the % of my pay I can put into the program from each paycheck though. 
I ran some quick numbers.  At a 5% discount to market, the annualized return would be comparable to a 19% interest rate.  Depending on how much they let you put into the program maybe it’s not worth it.  But 19% still smokes most other investments with comparable risk.

@Edward Antrobus III – That’s why I sell my stock right away.  This minimizes your risk.  Were I required to hold onto the stock for a significant amount of time I would have to give it a lot more thought.  But if you are allowed to sell immediately (3 days per stock sale settlement rules) this risk is minimal.

@Supadad33 – Wow, that 2-year look back thing sounds great when the stock price is going up.  And without the 3 day waiting period there is exactly ZERO risk.  

@Marvin @ San Jose Options – I disagree.  If you’ll re-read the article I don’t advocate holding onto ESPP stock.  Your wages are already tied to your job and if your investments are tied their as well you are doubly at risk should the company go south. Executive malfeasance aside, your risk of losing 18% in a 3 day period is minimal.

@Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager – I applaud you for saving for your future. However, I would be cautious about carrying a significant portion of your investments in the stock of your employer. For longer term goals you might consider selling the stock and putting the money into a mutual fund to lower your risk.

@matt  -  That’s awesome! I’m glad that I could help you make your decision. 

@Big Dion – Yup, it’s always a good idea to keep an eye on your nest egg. 

@ Emily – But that was because he held onto the stock.  If you sell it right away, you should be good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is everyone worrying about the company&#039;s stock? Don&#039;t you just get the 15% discount off the current price (or, better yet, the lower of the current price and a previous price) and sell immediately?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My company does not offer this service since it is a privately held company, but If I ever have an opportunity like that I would do it in a heart beat. As long as it is not more than 20% of your networth you should be ok in case things go wrong with the company&#039;s stock.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Marvin makes a great point here. In 2008, when they were living high on the hog who would&#039;ve thought that WaMu would go belly up. It&#039;s important to make sure you have a safety net, because that could be your company. Jamie Dimon just lost $8 billion of Chase&#039;s money on bad investments and no one has even batted an eyelash. 

I&#039;m a big fan of ESPPs in general, but just make sure that you are watching your company&#039;s stock and the market, in general. You could lose all that money and your bosses will NOT be looking out for you.

That said, if I had the chance to get some ESPP stock, I would be all over that. As the late poet laureate Russell Jones once pondered, &quot;Why would you not want some free money?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post! I literally just signed up after reading this. I&#039;ve been considering doing it for years, but just had too many questions and not enough money to risk. this was finally th extra push I needed. My company has a quarterly espp at a 15% discount and this quarter closes tomorrow. It allows you to invest 2-10% your quarterly income. I am happy to say that I just invested 10%! My companies stock isn&#039;t very volatile and it sounds like the dividends are around 4% each year. I feel great about this investment, thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I participate in my ESSP and love it.  I set up an account and they pull from my paycheck so I never see the money before hand.

					<description><![CDATA[To preface, I used to work for WAMU in 2008.  Like most major companies, we also had a ESPP.  I remember vividly our stock go from mid-40s to less than $5 in 6 months.  During the entire stock decline, employees became nervous and reached out many times on the internal company forum (a forum that all 20,000+ employees had access to) where the CEO (Kerry Killinger) continued to assure everyone that the stock was going to bounce back.  Oh man, it was bad when the company went belly up that same year.  That internal company forum blew up and all of the company execs disappeared.

So definitely YMMV.  As an ESPP participant, you owe it to yourself to take the time to at least understand a few basics of stock market investing.  Because in the end, that&#039;s exactly what you are doing, playing the markets at a 15% discount.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My company caps your participation at 15% of your salary+bonus. We purchase every 6 months with up to a 2 year look back (resetting every 6 months if the price is lower).
