					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Financial Samurai&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks dude :)  We went with an LLC Partnership with this one.  The money the members give gets divided like so ---&gt;  50% directly to the family we&#039;re helping, 30% operations, 20% taxes.  The 30% operations doesn&#039;t cover much after all is said and done, so we rely on sponsors to help pay a bulk of the rest (which includes transportation, hotels etc.)  Luckily we know a lot of people in a lot of places so we should be able to do a lot of this stuff on the cheap.  We&#039;re def. not trying to spend just for the sake of it.

@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Matt!  I&#039;m so glad you like what we&#039;re doing :)  And if you happen to join our VIP membership that&#039;s great too! We&#039;d love to have you on our team. But either way I appreciate you stopping by and sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J-Money- 

I just wanted to commend you for taking risks and inspiring others to take risks as well. You&#039;re doing an awesome thing by impacting the lives of others. Plus you are giving others tangible ways to give back. I am still talking to my wife about what type of membership we want to do. V.I.P membership seems pretty awesome!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE this J!  Way to go!  Such a great initiative and I really hope you guys do many more and make it bigger and bigger.

Did you guys set it up as a LLC or SCorp?  Is the money that&#039;s contributed used to pay for your hotels, transportation (cars/flights) too?

Cheers]]></description>
