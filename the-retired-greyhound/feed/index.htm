I&#039;m a fan of the opposite (I love the market but not real estate!) but admire those of you who have figured it out and enjoy it :) Haven&#039;t thought about it in the way that you do though (providing a valuable product/service) and I really like that! I bet that feels good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is exactly why I like investing in real estate over the stock market. I do the minimum IRA contributions every year, and maxed the employer match IRAs percentages, when I was working full time, but after that, it is all toward real estate. I always put people before profit, and I like knowing that I am providing a valuable service/product to someone (i.e. clean, safe shelter), instead of investing in the stock market, which seems like thin air to me. :)]]></description>

Indeed, friend :( I tend to go in spurts myself of extreme savings or earnings and then switch to just plain mediocrity at times until re-energized again :) Also - lots of long (free) walks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently I&#039;ve been thinking more about how we can begin finding joy in the journey while still making progress towards the end goal. I have been expending all my energy on building the financial foundation to allow us to become financially stable later on in life when we have found what we really want to spend out time doing. But I am seeing some signs that make me worry that we are starting to burn out a bit from it. Balance can be very difficult at times.]]></description>

Thank you for the words of support...we&#039;re going for it!...but hearing about others that have already taken the plunge, and are happy to have done so, gives us more inspiration...and courage. :)]]></description>
