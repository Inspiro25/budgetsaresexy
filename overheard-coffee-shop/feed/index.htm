					<description><![CDATA[I still have yet to be in a Panera working and NOT hear someone around me doing a sales pitch for a pyramid scheme.  Essential Oils, real estate, newspaper subscriptions etc.  Panera is the new gathering place for those of us who need to meet clients but don&#039;t have an office!  Our local coffee shops have gotten smart and no longer have outlets for me to mooch power off of but the restaurants seem okay with it.]]></description>

Oh yeah, some of that stuff is no joke. I think it&#039;s going to be hard for me personally to say no to anything sports/musical/hobby-related if it enriches their lives and makes them happy. I&#039;ll need to figure out where to draw the line or else I&#039;m in trouble :)]]></description>

Oh jeez, I can&#039;t imagine... I bet they do things like talk real loud too as if you were deaf as well - that happens to a family member of my own that&#039;s in a chair ;) Sometimes he plays along just to be funny.]]></description>

Yeah, I focus much better with stuff happening around me actually. And in coffee shops I just put on the ol&#039; ear phones (when I&#039;m not eaves dropping) and it helps a lot too.

I&#039;m gonna have to look out for you at the cafes and see if I can overhear any juiciness ;)]]></description>
