					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!!  It&#039;s so hard to do that, huh?  I always feel like I&#039;m failing if I don&#039;t get it PERFECT like that, but you&#039;re totally right - Something IS usally better than nothing. Thanks for the reminder!
@&lt;b&gt;Randall&lt;/b&gt; - COOL!!  I&#039;m so glad to hear it my friend - that totally makes me happy :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, there you go :)  I&#039;d tend to go w/ the appraisal as the closest to value on the site too - so hopefully it goes in your favor!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Indeed!  As long as it has plenty of toys and shiny things he&#039;ll be one happy little boy ;)
@&lt;b&gt;BryanM&lt;/b&gt; - You could have a point there.  Though I think it&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve changed it in like 3 years, haha... I only do it when I get super good intel on it ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, I don&#039;t think you should track the monthly value of your home in these calculations since home values are not an exact science and the market is pretty volatile right now. I would just maintain a conservative price and keep it through out the year, evaluating it annually. Either way, you are way ahead of the curve to begin with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Up 15k this month!  However, we&#039;re trying to refinance our house and had an official appraisal last week.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J$! Reading your blogs inspired me to do some better net worth tracking too. I&#039;ve been watching it on mint.com for the past couple years, but decided to make a spreadsheet so I can see the trends a little more clearly. In my first month of &quot;official&quot; tracking, my net worth went up $2500! Yay! It&#039;s really encouraging to see that number and stay focused on my financial goals. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J:

Sorry to hear about the home appraisal, but you&#039;re in excellent company with most of us I think these days. :)

I wanted to say good for you on continuing to do the mortgage payoff despite the fact that it wasn&#039;t as much as you wanted to. Doing anything is better than nothing (as my partner would tell me every time *I* would whine about it not being the exact same amount each month). You&#039;re still chipping away at that interest and getting closer to mortgage freedom!

Take care!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the support guys!  It always helps hearing from y&#039;all :)

@&lt;b&gt;Lance@MoneyLife&amp;More&lt;/b&gt; - You know it bro!  Nothing like a good decrease to wake my ass up!
@&lt;b&gt;Devan&lt;/b&gt; - Good!!! I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re tracking it too :)  And so far that means you&#039;ve only seen my net worth go DOWN! haha... I think it&#039;s on a record now ever since starting to track it all 4+ years ago.  But a comeback it shall be!! Thanks for all the support and kind words too, appreciate it.  As far as 529 stuff - yup, we&#039;re waiting for the ss# too and will then start filling it right up.  I&#039;ve already got $350 earmarked for it from a contest I won 2 months ago :)  Congrats on your new baby too!
@&lt;b&gt;Jake&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, who knows... it usually follows suit, but every now and then it&#039;s a lot higher or lower - I&#039;ll have to get a re-check on everything sometime in the next few months to make sure I&#039;m still where I should be with those.
@&lt;b&gt;Laura Brown&lt;/b&gt; - You know, I&#039;ve never thought of just doing them every 3 months anyways - that&#039;s not a bad idea?  I guess it would work out too since you&#039;d be paying that first one earlier, I&#039;m gonna think about that one, thanks :)  And hopefully both our homes go up too by the time we want to get out of them! I have faith that they will, just a matter of time.
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lynn&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! You&#039;re right - I have a 1 oz gold coin I picked up a few months ago to diversify a bit (and to keep something in PHYSICAL form over electrnic). I do plan on picking up more metals in the future, but next on the list is silver.  Probably another $1,500 worth or so and then I&#039;ll call it quits from there for a while.  I just wanted a few thousand in something &quot;real&quot; in case of a crazy apocolypse ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks, us too!
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Aww, well you keep your yead up too, good sir!  Maybe it&#039;s better if you look at them every quarter instead of every month?  Maybe that&#039;ll make you feel better?
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Independence&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks, appreciate that :)  I have faith in myself longterm, but I do let it get to me every now and then.  Guess it&#039;s a part of life, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;RichUncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I cannot WAIT until I don&#039;t need to mess w/ a mortgage anymore :) Whether that means we&#039;ve sold it or that we&#039;ve paid it off 100% - which I&#039;m equally excited about, it&#039;s just a matter of what happens first.  Though it&#039;s true I&#039;m not the biggest fan of home ownership just in general - too much responsibility for me.
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, get in a good habit of it too so you don&#039;t make stupid mistakes like me!  Although I will say they do kick your ass in gear too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I def. need to re-look at it all here sometime soon just to double check I&#039;m at where I should be still. It&#039;s on the to-do list in the next few months :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kurt @ Money Counselor&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Kurt! It&#039;s too bad you don&#039;t live closer cuz I&#039;d totally treat you to some beers to get more of those pep talks when I need them! Haha...  thanks for always looking out :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - I know, the stuff out of your control is always the hardest to deal with but it&#039;s gotta be done!  That&#039;s how the world works :)
@&lt;b&gt;Adam Hathaway&lt;/b&gt; - That is frustrating!  I don&#039;t track every penny any more (not worth the time to me at this point), but I&#039;m sure you remember a lot more about that kinda stuff than I do &quot;generally&quot; overseeing everything. I&#039;ve been known to forget bills worth $200+ sometimes, haha... but then I figure out a system to not let it happen again in the future. Always tweaking!
@&lt;b&gt;Miriam&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s the FUN part of budgeting - when you have less debt and more cash flow to apply towards new goals!  You def. gotta adjust your budget for that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Samurai&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man, and you&#039;re right!  I know the market and real estate will be up long term for sure (or else I&#039;d never be investing in either), so right now it&#039;s just all fluff numbers giving me a run for my sanity.  In the end we&#039;ll all be winners! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For those of us who track our budgets to the most minute detail I do have to say that any loss is a serious aggravation.  I was a bit bothered by the fact that I did not remember that we had our $80 AAA membership due nevermind a 2k loss in taxes and a 15k housing drop in value.  However, you are still beating that debt down and have a much higher net worth than most so you will get through this pretty easily.]]></description>
