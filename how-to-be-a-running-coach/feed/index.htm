					<description><![CDATA[Hi again... I&#039;m aiming to get a website back up. I&#039;ve been pretty busy getting my second degree (nursing) and working as a CNA...along with coaching a good amount of people right now and they still take up most of my time :P ...some runners are not needy. Those are the ones that seem to make good coaches. However, many many runners are in need of that second voice in their head to confirm that they are doing the right thing, they are doing well, and to tell them when they are torturing themselves with bad thoughts that can be self destructive...the mental side of running is so much harder than the physical part, I swear!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently started running and I fell in love with it. I could never see myself as a running coach, but it is cool to see that you can take your passion and turn it into a career!

Also, who said runners were needy? :p]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can only dream of a sub 3:00 PR...  I am so impressed.  I think it&#039;s great that your side hustle didn&#039;t require any credentials - other than your personal success at running.  I&#039;ve always dreamed of teaching yoga as a side gig, but the huge amount of training hours (not to mention) the cost to be certified to teach it in my state is definitely a big factor in that not happening anytime soon.  

Kim - do you have a website?  I&#039;m totally curious about the details of what services you offer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow Kim, that is awesome you took something you did in your personal life and made profit off of it.  It is also cool you had a mentor in the beginning; isn&#039;t that how a lot of people become great, because of mentors!

I would hate doing what you are doing, just because I love running for me.  I also haven&#039;t found a reason to make myself go through the torture of a race like I thought I would have been able to.  It was a goal, but I find running for myself and to keep my butt looking great enough reason to run. lol (tmi)

I love your reasoning behind being a coach: &quot;Don’t be one of those fat lazy ex runners filled with regret and trying to live through the people you coach&quot;.  Isn&#039;t that something that can be used in all forms of life.  Don&#039;t be someone who is full of regrets or jealous because it will only cause you pain and never give you the satisfaction you are looking for.  At least in my own personal experiences I have found that true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback, folks! Coaching runners is often a criticized activity as some people think it to be a scam. There are bad coaches out there that only offer up online services and never actually talk to their clients. So, it can be tough to beat that bad reputation. I just figure, if I keep working hard on myself, others will trust that I know what I&#039;m doing and love the sport!]]></description>
