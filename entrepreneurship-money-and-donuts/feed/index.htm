					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing!
My favorite response: YES! If you get a good grasp of your money early on, the “job market” or economy or anything else matters much less as time goes on because you hold all the power.

My wife and I have been talking with our six-year old son about money and saving and opportunity cost...it&#039;s been an interesting process as I sometimes feel like I&#039;m talking in circles and confusing him more than anything. The way you put it about getting an early start is the point I&#039;m trying to get across. Trying is the operative word here. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can totally resonate with this entire post! I&#039;m in my mid 20&#039;s and was just made redundant. Luckily I&#039;ve been taught good money practices form an early age and don&#039;t have to stress too much at the moment. I really wish though they taught a bit pf personal finance in high school, as you never know when you may be out of a job or how long for. I never thought it would happen to me, but it did. 
Having said that though, I do feel completely inspired to really work on our own financial blog and expand it. I feel like my mindset is shifting to thinking more outside of the box now and getting more creative with ideas. Your 20&#039;s is such a great time to take risks and I think it&#039;s all to do with how you approach situations and the power of positivity. 
Very inspiring post :)

					<description><![CDATA[Nice article and thanks for a good blog! 

I&#039;m rather new here so I&#039;m not sure how old your children are.. but are you trying to teach them to have a good financial sense too?

I&#039;m asking because I&#039;ve got a daughter who is almost two years old now, and I&#039;m planning to do my best to teach her as much as I can of what I know (and what I learn) about economy and finance. I was just wondering if you&#039;ve had a plan for teaching your kids, or if you hope it will just rub off on them since you&#039;re on top of your money? :)

Take care!]]></description>
