Really smart advice, but what to do when you are a new immigrant with absolutely no credit history in the US? We&#039;ll have to get credit cards and use VERY wisely.

I despise the idea of credit cards, we are debt free for a long time and don&#039;t like the idea of getting into this. And yet, from what I understand, just using a debit card with zero overdraft won&#039;t help build a credit score. And we&#039;ll need one for insurance, rent and all the jazz :(]]></description>

Smart on the separate email! Much less annoying when you start getting spammed all over :)

(I used to make midnight meals too, until having kids... I swear they&#039;ve made me 1,000% more healthy!! Haha... that should be written about by someone, as well as the fact you save a lot of money too when you don&#039;t even have the time to shop/eat out/etc :) People always say kids are expensive, but maybe it evens out with all the hidden savings?!)]]></description>

Yup! And then from there it&#039;s super easy to take a shower and get into comfy clothes and pick up a book or whatever else helps you unwind at night and then just *RELAX* :) One tiny little habit to help jump start a bunch of other great habits!]]></description>

YES to tiny house please!!! What an accomplishment if you can pull that off! I&#039;d like to think I could do it too - and, maybe later once the kids are out of the house - but for now will have to live vicariously through people like you :) So Please do make it happen!! I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s incredible once you make it there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#4 : &quot;Delete all shopping apps from your phone&quot;.
Or even just: disable their notifications. Less radical, but it helps.
Also, it can help to avoid checking Facebook through the app. There is no Adblock on the app, and the ads are VERY WELL tailored to your interests. Better through a browser with an ad blocker.

Like Revanche, I have the newsletter-dedicated e-mail address. With filters isolating the order confirmations and receipts in a special folder, any mention of coupons in another (which I check when I purchase the thing), and the rest is regularly binned (I need to automate that part too... so I won&#039;t even see most of them).

#5 : I wish. I still carry my card around, which annoys me to no end. I&#039;d love to keep it at home, but most workdays I incur a payment very impractical with cash - fixed, not round and they just never have change. The alternative would be to order rolls of coins (3 types) on a regular basis - I have yet to try that.
I wish I could take advantage of debit cards cashback, miles etc. but as far as I know, I spend too little to take advantage of any of them.]]></description>
