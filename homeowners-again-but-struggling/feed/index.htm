Do you have friends or family in the area? That&#039;s what helped us a lot - talking to them and asking them a million questions :) We also drove around to all the schools to get a better idea, although of course looks can be deceiving (some of the nicer looking schools aren&#039;t so great here, while some of the more dilapidated ones are!). If you don&#039;t know anyone there, maybe you can find some local facebook or similar groups? Maybe nextdoor.com?! There&#039;s gotta be a way to get plugged in and talk to people who live there... I always prefer that vs the rating sites, but then again I didn&#039;t poke around too much on them so not sure how great or not they are. Wishing you loads of luck either way!!]]></description>

Haha... Maybe we can race our mowers one day together?! ;) Mustered up the courage to finally try mine the other day and wow did it go faster than expected!]]></description>

Nothing was bad about renting!! I wanted to keep on doing it! :)

But see: https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/my-wife-is-itching-to-own-a-home-again/

Weird about the emails stopping, sorry to hear that :(

Here&#039;s the sign up page to get them again if you want to re-sign up and see if that fixes it?

					<description><![CDATA[What was so bad about renting?   Happy for you and your new house purchase! 

P.S.
after you sold rockstar finance I stopped getting email updates from you I thought you had sold this site as well.   Happy that you&#039;re still writing J$!

Thanks C$ :)

Mowed the lawn for the first time the other day and actually wasn&#039;t too bad!

You should have seen me on that riding lawnmower acting as if I were a cowboy, hahahahha.... 

You can go pretty fast in those things!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry you feel so overwhelmed.  I&#039;m around Houston, Texas where home ownership is just outright cheaper than renting (even with all the maintenance and stuff), but I can feel your hesitation from here.  *HUGS*.  

I guess just concentrate on all of those child smiles and wife love.  :-D  And pay it off as fast as possible so you don&#039;t feel as weighed down.  I hope you&#039;ll love it when it becomes cheaper than renting.  ;-)

Good luck, dude.]]></description>
