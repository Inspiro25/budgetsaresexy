					<description><![CDATA[Maybe not teleportation but there is some fun stuff coming out in the next few years.

Fusion could be viable within a decade meaning cheap clean near unlimited power, 3D printers, 3D bio printers for food and organ replacement, gene therapies curing disease, nano technologies, self driving cars and big leaps in computing. All of this is either in prototype stage now or is being worked on.

So give it a few decades and you&#039;ll have an immortal android body but still no teleportation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha.... yes, you do :) But at least it&#039;s fun stuff you&#039;re thinking about! If you ever figure out a way to make it happen, please let me know... but I won&#039;t be your guinea pig ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Better question would be $50 million or teleportation.

Would still take the power as long as it was Jumper rules. You can take a person, you can teleport where you have been or can see (or have seen) and you can move very large things as long as they are moving themselves (truck, bus). Also the fact you seem to pass through a tear in space rather than be destroyed and recreated is a bonus.

The only way to make serious money without turning to crime would be to join up with a billionaire futurist who didn&#039;t get where they are by screwing over everyone else, so probably one of the Google founders. Even if all they did was run tests on you to try to recreate the power it would be lucrative. I&#039;d still worry about the golden goose scenario where they think dissecting my brain would be worthwhile but at least you would know you can escape easily.

I think about this way to much. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is true... but I feel like it could get lonely/mess with your head after a while. Always going back and forth and no longer having any reality, ya know? I still wouldn&#039;t turn it down though - it would be amazing to try!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Teleportation probably has the most value of all the standard super powers.

You wouldnt even really need a house as you could set up camp somewhere hot with a tent and not have to worry about clean water as you can get anything you like in seconds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you could teleport others and large items like the movie jumper then i&#039;d choose teleporting.

You could approach a benefactor like a tech billionaire and help teleport people and equipment up to the moon. Mining the lunar surface with you porting containers to earth could net you billions, thats not even counting space exploration from the moons lower gravity and what you could make moving equipment and supplies.

Even if you didnt want to risk that could take goods from a to z avoiding customs and taxes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like it!!  Very well put, my friend.  You could do TONS of awesomeness w/ teleporting.  Only part I see which could backfire is if all this teleporting does something to your body over time. Like gives you cancer/etc.  Since you&#039;d be the first person doing it, no one would know the answer...  If that was a possibility, would you still take it? ;)  Get all the fame, money, etc, but have the chance of dying faster cuz of it all? Tricky one!]]></description>
