I feel like this statistic will change quickly over the next decade. Now that many people can work remotely, travel easier and have access to instant apps for bookings and convenience, I think travel spend will just keep increasing.

That being said, there&#039;s nothing wrong with being a homebody! I live most of my life in a 10 mile radius of my house and love it. :)]]></description>

Hey Ann! You are definitely not missing out! Love the couch-surfing to save money, and also you can meet a bunch of interesting new friends that way.

I think my large travel budget stems from being born in Australia. I was 22 when I moved to the US, and tried to fly home each year for Christmas. So I just always had to set aside thousands for flights and travel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like millionaires are either homebodies or need to spend less time playing defense and go on vacation! Seriously.  What&#039;s the point on winning with money if you don&#039;t enjoy it? Or maybe 45% are new to travel. 55% have already been everywhere they want to go?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fun read! I definitely do not have multiple income streams going (just two, and that&#039;s only if you count investment income!) but otherwise seem to check most boxes. 

I cannot even imagine what a 6 or 10k vacation budget would be like! My vacations are usually centered on camping trips and are consequently dirt cheap. I&#039;ve done a couple international trips but doing a combination of hitchiking and couchsurfing kept costs below $1000 for a 2 month trip. Do you think I&#039;m seriously missing out?! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I drive a 06 Nissan truck that I&#039;ve had since 09&#039; (13 years) that I bought for $11,500 cash.  It has 250k miles now, and I plan to drive it for at least another 10 years (if I can keep from crashing it) because I just like it and it meets all my needs.  I make decisions on repairs and maintaince with that in mind.  I also don&#039;t freak out when the kids scratch it or it gets dinging up in parking lots.   I&#039;ll probably transition into an electric truck when the time comes. 

No gambling or expensive vacations here. Read a ton but could use more concentrated cardio exercise routine ( I walk about 4-5 miles per day due to nature of my work)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I noticed there was no mention of how much millionaires spend on beer. Of course, they probably buy expensive fancy beer like you, or do they drain cans of PBR like me?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post!  I don&#039;t own a TV (but I spend too much time on the internet).  I have always bought used car.  I have never spent one cent and never plan to on gambling or the lottery.  We spend less than $6,000 a year on vacation, which is helped immensely with credit card promotions.  We consider ourselves frugal.  We both exercise multiple days a week - in fact my husband walks at least 10 miles a day on his job.  We have not branched out too much into multiple streams of income, however.  I probably read less than 30 minutes a day, and sometimes more.]]></description>
