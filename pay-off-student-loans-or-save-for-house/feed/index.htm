					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, def. tricky... I&#039;d probably work towards both if it were me (lame answer, but it&#039;s the truth) but I think it really comes down to personal preference and what makes you FEEL better in the end... both routes give you an incredible advantage financially though, so at least you&#039;re winning either way! :)  If it&#039;s gonna take you years to pay off your loans, and you think housing prices will go up (and you DEF want a house soon), maybe prioritize that way too? I don&#039;t think there are wrong answers here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I are $80,000 in debt from student loans.  Yikes!  Due to recent lifestyle changes and my husband found a job, we are now able to save $3,500 to $4,000 per month.  Should we pay the loans off or save agressively for a house.  Every month I write a rent check, I feel like I am giving money away.  Also, with compound interest, we would be able to put 30-40% down after a few years of saving.  Which direction should we go?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tough one!  Sucks that all the comments here were erased before I ported over to Wordpress (I think a lot of them would have helped you out!) but I&#039;d say wiping out that $70k (if it&#039;s your highest) should be priority #1. But only if you&#039;ve changed your ways and know how to live w/out getting back into debt (not all of that is student loans, right?).

So if it were me, I&#039;d probably throw $500 of it towards that high % rate first, and then the other $200+ into your house account.  But that&#039;s just me.  In fact, I&#039;d use that house account as an emergency fund and just keep renting for a while ;)  Not sure where you live, or why you want to buy a house, but it&#039;s much easier/stress-free to do so after you&#039;ve wiped out a lot of the other issues on hand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$5000 in debt is nothing.  I WISH that was my problem.  I&#039;m 170K in debt at various interest rates including 70K at 8.25% (it&#039;s ridiculous, I know).  I&#039;m already saving 20% of my monthly net income for a down payment and paying the minimum payment for the student loans. I have an EXTRA $700-1K every month to contribute to EITHER my down payment savings or an additional payment to my student loans.  I don&#039;t know which to do!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, if you&#039;re worried about saving $5,000 for your loans or shoveling that $5,000 to a house downpayment, then you can&#039;t afford a house.  It&#039;s financially irresponsible not to have a 10% or 20% downpayment, and that&#039;s a lot more than five grand.]]></description>
