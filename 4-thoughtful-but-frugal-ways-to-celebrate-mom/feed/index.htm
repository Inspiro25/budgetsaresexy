					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s too late for anyone who reads this, but Brighton is selling a &quot;key to my heart&quot; that is really beautiful.  It is a silver key with a scrolled/jewelled heart instead of the basic head of the key.  You can buy it for Kwikset or Schlage and have it cut at a hardware store to fit your door.  It&#039;s only $25 bucks, totally useful, and perfect for a mom like mine who has everything!]]></description>
