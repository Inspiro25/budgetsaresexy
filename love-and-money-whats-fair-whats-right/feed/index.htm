					<description><![CDATA[@Neel, Agree 100%!
@J, My Pleasure!  Hope all is going well with the $pawn and no more trips to the hospital!  :)
@Elizabeth, oh my!  Well that&#039;s unfortunate, but at least they talked about it BEFORE they got married and realized they had completely different financial goals.  Breaking up is a lot messier post-nuptials.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was supposed to be a bridesmaid for an old college friend a few years ago when she called off the wedding - they&#039;d never talked about finances, and when they did, it was a deal breaker for her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Budget I think life IS easier if you have similar habits but it doesn&#039;t HAVE to be that way. Regardless, communication IS ALWAYS key.  That alone can be tough for some.  Sometimes it helps to ask the question, &quot;Okay, what did you just hear me say?&quot;  ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s absolutely essential for couples to thrive that they have to be pretty close to the same page financially. They don&#039;t have to make the same amount, but they need to have essentially the same spending and saving habits, otherwise there can be major tension. Just like a lot of aspects in a relationship, communication is key.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@AverageJoe I like the family meeting approach. Yep, never good to be in FantasyLand when it comes to numbers. They give you no leeway!
@Savvy Sometimes this is the case, one person is just not interested in the finances. It&#039;s good that you are and I think you&#039;re right on relooking at it later. As soon as he wants something you guys can&#039;t afford, he&#039;ll probably start taking a second look at the bills and expenses. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I basically manage the finances in our house. I set aside money for savings, bills, etc. My husband knows a high level strategy, but I am the strategist and executor. I would try to go over bills with him, but I&#039;ll bore him to death. He has access to accounts, etc. Everything is open. We might have to relook at this system in a year, but so far it&#039;s working.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We use a family meeting where we look at the bills, investment statements, and goals together. This helped us open up about money and talk freely. It also made it so that we weren&#039;t in &quot;Fantasyland&quot; about what the other was doing. Great tips here!]]></description>
