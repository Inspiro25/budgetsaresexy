					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re very welcome, J! It was my pleasure. I remember the first time I got it in the eye ; boys are &quot;special&quot; that way.  ha ha

@Glen: Oh yes, crayon-marked walls is another &quot;joy&quot; us parents get to deal with! Stained carpets too due to, well ... lots of stuff -- some edible, some not. And as I said before,thankfully we wisely held off on getting new furniture and nice floors until after the kids outgrew their destructive phase. 

@Robin: Kids are expensive, but you definitely get your money&#039;s worth!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this article!  I have always said they underestimated that total.  They forget the bikes and roller blades and keeping up with the electronic trend (insane)  Budgeting for college and their weddings.  Perfect way to teach the kids how to budget and keep the costs down. 
Meanwhile, You just have to love the little people!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gifts - how about all the gifts you have to buy going to OTHER kids parties!  And then you have to put together birthday parties for your own kids.

Good to know about the mini tools.  I&#039;ve seen sets like that and considered them when my 5 yr old guy gets a little older.  Now I know to keep them on lockdown.  Similarly, you can expect to do some painting to cover up crayon and marker drawing somewhere in the house and some piece of furniture will need to be replaced because of the kids.

And how&#039;s this for extra costs - you may get to a point where you just need a bigger place to live.  Where does that fit into the $235k?  Add to that a bigger car (our poor little Corolla just couldn&#039;t handle a trip to BJs with a couple of car seats in the back).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for guest posting, &lt;strong&gt;Len&lt;/strong&gt;!  A lot of things to look forward to, eh? ;) I think I already need to buy a whole bunch of more shirts for myself - that little booger pees/poops all over me every day! Haha... it&#039;s a good thing they make &#039;em so cute.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so true!  Our 8 year old is still fairly insulated from peer pressure.  He doesn&#039;t yet have a cell phone or even much care about video games.  However, his extracurricular activities are starting to add up, and he has two younger siblings behind him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am with everyone else on the other kids birthday presents - I am amazed at how much I spend yearly on birthday presents for other kids.  My son is also not capable of walking by a light switch that he does not believe needs to be on - even if it is the middle of a bright sunny day!

What we do for love! :)]]></description>
