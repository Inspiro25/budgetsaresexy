					<description><![CDATA[Awesome though man, seriously! You&#039;re *doing something* about your dreams and goals which is more than a lot of people can say - so keep that up :) It&#039;s totally cool to change your mind and work on stuff as the heart and mind wants as well, but of course much easier/saner to do if you have enough money to hold you over in case any of them fail. The whole &quot;work on your dream stuff on the side until it makes enough to replace your main job&quot; type mentality. 

But yes - overall very interesting to see what you&#039;ve been getting into and I hope you find something that sticks and excites you for a long time to come :) Thx for commenting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been a long uphill climb getting over my anxieties, starting over a decade ago.  Of course I had not written down plan, just my tenacity to &quot;get out&quot;.

Completed goal: Getting my drivers license - 2003 (age 21)

Something I wouldn&#039;t live without today.  It took me forever get over my anxiety of actually making the phone call to sign up to the course.

Completed goal: Receiving my Plumbing Red Seal - 5+ years.

I&#039;m not sure how much I&#039;ll continue with the trade but going off to study and learn the trade was a significant step in getting me where I am today.  Going through the motions of actually signing up to the plumbing program (Sept. 2006 - March 2007) was still quite difficult and mentally taxing for me at this time. I creeped forward.  Working as an apprentice (March 2006 - March 2011) was the first job I had outside the family farm.  More life learning stress.  It was great to finally get that paper.

Ongoing Stuff: March 2011 - Present

At the same time I finished my plumbing apprenticeship the company I worked for closed up shop.  I decided to focus more time on the farm and start up my own plumbing business.  You guessed right, I did minimal research when starting my plumbing business.  Wing it as you go eh? (ha)  Recently I was involved with a MLM company for six weeks, though I have since left that behind.  Through various reasons my brief involvement with the MLM has led me to the wonderful world of financial blogs such as &quot;BudgetsAre$exy&quot;.  Pretty sweet if I say so.

As for the plumbing company, I&#039;ve been thinking for a while now to put that on hold and revisit it some day down to road.  I have the strong itch to seek out other endeavours and opportunities at this time.  When your heart isn&#039;t in something it&#039;s hard for one to keep pressing forward.

Women:  A looooooonng journey.  Still single, but learning.  I know confidence in myself is the ticket there.

Going through many trials and tribulations of life over the past six plus years I can see a compounding list of accomplishments and improvements I&#039;ve made.  Seeing that has allowed me to keep pressing forward (that and realizing I wasn&#039;t the only one in the world walking in my shoes).

Now I just have to start writing out my goals and I should be set.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Time certainly does go quickly and when you have kids it leads to even more time gone!  I think the insurance for making the best use of your time is to not waste it on stupid activities.  We don&#039;t have a TV anymore and I have not regretted it one bit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad y&#039;all liked this :) Want to hear the funny part about this specific article?  It took me TWO YEARS to finally finish!  I&#039;ve had it in draft form forever, haha.... LAME.

@&lt;b&gt;Laura Brown&lt;/b&gt; - You know it!  Life fills us with tons of work and responsibilities, but luckily we get a lot of love and other stuff too :)  Once you get a good game plan down, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll feel a lot better and ready to start killing it.  Before you know it 5 years will pass!
@&lt;b&gt;John @ Married (with Debt)&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah!  And we forget how GOOD life is too all things considered :)
@&lt;b&gt;L Bee @ Money Tree&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  It&#039;s true - we all have massive A.D.D. and need instant gratification these days.  It&#039;s very hard for me at times too!
@&lt;b&gt;graduate.living&lt;/b&gt; - Work it!  That&#039;s great!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re damn good!!  No more mortgage??? Wowwww, I&#039;m jealous! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kurt @ Money Counselor&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, that would be crazy!  And I actually think I&#039;d do things the SAME way for right now (cuz you&#039;d still need money to survive and all that - unless you can never die? Of like starvation and what not?), and then once I&#039;ve got things humming and growing, start enjoying life more.  Man... that&#039;s an interesting one though... maybe I should blog about it? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - OOooh I love that!  I convinced all my family to go on a cruise this last December, and then the planned it and the dates were bad for me and the wife!!  Who suggested it all in the beginning!  So they went without us :(  A cruise is still on my dang &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/my-life-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Life List&lt;/a&gt; now! Arghh...
@&lt;b&gt;DebtsnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahahaa... you and me both ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan @ HSA Edge&lt;/b&gt; - Great quote indeed - I like that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Good!!! That&#039;s exciting!
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  6 month checkups are smart - not many people remember to do that (myself included) so great job!
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly.  And as time goes on, that snowball will grow and you&#039;ll be inching higher and higher even faster with the same amount of effort :)  So keep going, friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post - the big picture is important.  This really is about goal setting and being cognizant of your life, or your mortality.  What are you going to do with your life? What do you want to accomplish in the next 30 years?  10 years? 1 year?  Start now.

Your daily actions should align with those goals.

At the same time, John Lennon noted that &quot;Life is what happens to you while you&#039;re busy making other plans&quot;]]></description>
