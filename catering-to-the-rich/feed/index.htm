					<description><![CDATA[I think that providing a valuable product or service to your customers is the foundation of a successful business enterprise. It doesn&#039;t matter if your customers are rich or not. The basics of starting a business are still the same. The rich may just be willing to pay more than others and your marketing strategies should specifically target the richer customers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been my experience when dealing with high net worth families and individuals that they&#039;re very discerning with their finances and prefer to deal with service providers who can offer the best service AND a great service experience.  

Qualities important but generally speaking, the biggest asset to wealthy families is the same as you and me - their time. Find any service that adds real value to their lives by saving time, wrap it up in some great &#039;experiential&#039; packaging, and you&#039;re on to a winner.]]></description>

&quot;change this from customers being rich people, to customers who spend a lot&quot; - agreed! Assuming rich people spend a lot is definitely not the best, good catch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I may go all Millionaire Next Door here, I think that if we change this from customers being rich people, to customers who spend a lot, maybe it opens it up more? Like if you can come up with something that makes sheeple feel like they are increasing their status relative to the Joneses?  And also if you think about markers and what you can sell/create that allows people to show their &#039;belonging&#039; in some way to some kind of group.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/catering-to-the-rich/#comment-118409&quot;&gt;My Financial Independence Journey&lt;/a&gt;.

Capitalize on the three triggers of charity, 1. Old - people give away their stuff in the hope that others will think well of them when gone. 2. Wealthy - Let the media bombard them with how bad they are because to be rich they must have taken money away from the hard working folk. 3. Guilty - If you have; you must give, religion keeps this one going strong.]]></description>

That&#039;s really true actually - you could KILL IT being a realtor. Just takes a lot of time and being available 24/7 which sucks. I&#039;ve tried it!]]></description>
