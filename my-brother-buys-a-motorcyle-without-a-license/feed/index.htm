					<description><![CDATA[T-Penney,
It&#039;s nice to hear you thought about the purchase and didn&#039;t just blow your money.  From the sound of the OP you lost your marbles lol.  I totally agree if you want to live your life, go live it, just do it smart and within budget :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post, bro!

In response to the comments, I bought a 1999 Honda Shadow Aero (1100cc) for $3k from my father&#039;s good friend, whom he trusts explicitly. I spent close to two hours checking out the bike, asking all kinds of questions (and as my bro can attest, I LIKE asking questions!) and getting all of the details before leaving to mull it over that night. The next day, I said yes, and here we are. Ba da bing, ba da ... you know the rest.

To my bro&#039;s point, I&#039;ve been talking/thinking/dreaming about getting a motorcycle for about four years now, and honestly, it really didn&#039;t have a lot to do with my sister&#039;s new purchase. Frankly, I&#039;m turning 30 in August, and I don&#039;t want to live my life THINKING and WISHING. I want to live. my. life. I need to start accomplishing the things I want to do in this life, rather than simply talk about it all the time.

I can afford the bike, it has 18k miles in 12 years (you know a car like that?) and I&#039;m getting about $1k worth of gear with it (4 helmets, winter suit, leather jacket with reflective vest, summer/winter gloves, original seat). What&#039;s more, there&#039;s a ton of add-ons, including a $1k Corbin seat. Blue book value on the bike is around the cost of the bike, and when you throw in all of the gear, it&#039;s definitely a good investment. Helmets alone cost $200-300 a piece. 

Sure, I bought it before getting my license, but it&#039;s a no-brainer of a buy, and it worked out perfectly when it comes down to how I heard about it, what it comes with and how the bike looks/feels/runs. It&#039;s almost like someone said, T-Penny, you want that bike you&#039;ve been talking about forever? Boom, here&#039;s everything you need to ride! Awesome. I&#039;m a frugal mo fo (I never did buy that flat-screen TV), and this is one purchase I&#039;m proud of. Worst case, I don&#039;t like the bike or riding in general, I can sell it for a profit with all that gear! Or at least get the same amount I originally paid for it. Booyah! Or rather, vroom vroom!]]></description>

Money is meant to be spent. As long as you take care of the little stuff, like debt reduction, emergency funds, retirement goals, then I think it&#039;s important to enjoy yourself. If we can&#039;t do that every once in a while then what&#039;s it all for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOL! My fiance JUST bought a motorbike too, without a licence (he ended up finding a second hand steal, rather than going brand new). 

I always thought that made sense, as you can&#039;t get a licence without a bike. Although I&#039;ve just found out that here for the basic handling skills test they provide the bike. Go figure...

But yeah, it&#039;s not like he&#039;s never ridden before. 

I don&#039;t really think it&#039;s wise of commenters to judge the validity of buying a bike. I&#039;m going to go out on a limb and say most people buy one not for practical reasons (ie saving petrol, although that will CERTAINLY help seeing as petrol is now $2.19 a litre!!!) but because THEY WANT A BIKE. T has been wanting a motorbike for the longest time now, so this is him achieving a dream. Registration is expensive, but insurance and gas will be really cheap, especially given how much he travels around...and most importantly, it&#039;s fun and and it&#039;s a hobby for him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;It leads me to believe that when others are taking big risks around you, that perhaps it increases the odds of YOU doing the same too? Not saying that we copy each other or try to 1-up another person or anything, but just that it may loosen up our own inhibitions a bit.  If everyone else is doing crazy things, maybe it rubs off on us and gives us the courage to take on something larger than normal ourselves too – know what I’m saying?&quot;

Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler have a huge line of research on how we&#039;re affected when people in our social network do something.  So they agree with you!  And hey, maybe you started it all with your job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Andi B.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I was wondering if anyone would bring that up ;)  It&#039;s not that I&#039;m not happy with my sister&#039;s choice, it just really came out of nowhere to me so I don&#039;t &quot;get it&quot; yet. But I love her and suppport her to death, I was just using her story as a way to talk about my own feelings on the whole home ownership thing in general. My brother&#039;s bike talk, on the other hand, has been going on for yearrrrrrrs and while it was a shock that it happened right *now*, esp without a license, I&#039;m glad that he&#039;s finally giving it a shot once.  And I think the smaller amounts of money def. changes the perspective too.  If he hates the bike he can always sell it and recoup a good chunk of his money back, wherease the house is a much larger pain.
@&lt;b&gt;Rafiki&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I like that way of putting it - &quot;Others chasing their dreams&quot; gets you to want to do the same.  For sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - He got extra helmets, jackets, all kinds of good stuff!
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - Oh really?  Huh... did not know that.  Thx for sharing :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - I think it&#039;s for the joy of the ride, baby!  I&#039;ve never rode a bike before, but I know my dad absolutely LOVES getting on that road and driving through the mountains.  I can def. see the appeal of it :)
@&lt;b&gt;RT&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  Maybe you&#039;ll be ridin&#039; next to my brother then at some point - we&#039;re in the DC area too :)]]></description>
