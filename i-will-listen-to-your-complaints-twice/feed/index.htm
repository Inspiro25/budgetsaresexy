Complaints come with &quot;ughs&quot; and *sighs* and emotional changes in their voice, whereas observations are more like facts being said out loud :) Also - you only make observations *once*!

(Had to marinate on this for a good 20 mins btw.... such a good question - hadn&#039;t ever thought about it before!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;You’ll be hard pressed to find someone worse off 10 or 20 years ago than they are now (and if so – they had some major changes in their life and are allowed to complain!!),&quot;

Shouldn&#039;t that say &quot;better off 10 or 20 years ago&quot;? You wouldn&#039;t be complaining if you are better now than in the past.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true.  
I had a friend in college that complained and whined about a girlfriend that left him for someone else and moved.  Could not get over it the last 6 months of his senior year.  Our friends named his behavior a disease - Brouillardian Syndrome.

A few months later when I graduated and leaving my g/f in school, she broke up with me for another student.  I complained for about 3 days.  One of my buddies stopped me and said, &quot;Dude, you have Brouillardian Syndrome&quot;.....  

I immediately did a 180 with my attitude.]]></description>

Very true that some people drain you more than others...

I&#039;ll try my best to just keep it in my head after I&#039;ve said my peace, but you&#039;re right it gets trickier when you&#039;re an authoritative figure. Though at least you get to make the rules and the consequences! Then it&#039;s up to them to listen or not ;)]]></description>
