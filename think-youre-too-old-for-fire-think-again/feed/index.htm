					<description><![CDATA[Love this! I’m a late starter too and another benefit I see?  In my 40’s, I’m far less concerned with what other people are doing, don’t care about the Joneses and am more sure of myself than I used to be. I don’t engage in spending to impress anyone. Maturity also makes our values ever clearer, meaning I spend in alignment with those.]]></description>

Love it - retired before conception! We are fortunate now that as the community grows, there are many more people sharing different ways to achieve FIRE - Coast FI, Slow FI come to mind. It&#039;s a much more wholesome journey where you get to enjoy the actual journey, not just the destination.]]></description>

Hi Dave,

Sounds like you are off to a good start! None of us can travel the world right now so we have time to save for future travels :)

All the best with your online business ventures!]]></description>

Hi Francis,

Totally agree that it&#039;s important to get the basics right first. I was very anxious about investing in the beginning and rushed into investing in the stock market. Then  I was stressed that I didn&#039;t have an adequate emergency fund.

Yep, early retirement is relative :) Being financially independent is the ultimate goal for us &#039;oldies&#039;

Good luck with your retirement plans!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There seems to be a common theme among the FIRE community that it&#039;s a &quot;race.&quot; And it&#039;s understandable, considering that a headline like &quot;I retired at 30,&quot; or &quot;I retired before conception,&quot; is quite catchy. 

No matter what you pursue, there&#039;s always going to be somebody younger and further along. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not to others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife started late on our FIRE journey - we were in our mid 30s (I&#039;m in my late 30s now). 

We&#039;ve reached the point where we are out of debt and can almost live off our investments and passive income - but that&#039;s a big &quot;almost&quot; because we&#039;d like to do more with our lives, meaning we need to come up with more passive income.

This led us to our online business endeavors that started right before the pandemic hit. We&#039;re hoping that in the next 5-8 years that we will get deeper into FIRE and be able to travel the world.]]></description>
