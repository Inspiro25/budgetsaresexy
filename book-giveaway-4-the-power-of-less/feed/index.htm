					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t sound like much, but I keep a bag on the doorknob of my bedroom door.   Every time I come across an article of clothing that doesn&#039;t fit, I throw it in. Once a month or so I take a filled bag to the local thrift stores.  I have WAY too much clothing and this helps me weed out little by little what I won&#039;t wear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The biggest thing for me was switching from perfect to good enough.&quot; - YES!  I&#039;ve learned to do that more too, sooooo helpful.

@Doctor S - I am going to try that post-it note in the back pocket trick starting tomorrow.  I think it&#039;ll look a little more professional than all those doodles on my hand ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The biggest thing for me was switching from perfect to good enough.
It applies to time (no more things done inches away from the deadline in the best standard known to mankind) as well as stuff (no more gadgety stationary when I have whole drawers full that will do the job just fine).]]></description>
