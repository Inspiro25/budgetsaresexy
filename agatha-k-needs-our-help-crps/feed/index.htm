Hi Lauren! I&#039;m just seeing this entire article that J posted and I am blown away. YES all the funds you give to Burning Limb go directly to my care. I partnered with them to give people the incentive of a tax deductible donation. Just make sure you choose Specific Recipient, Honor (at the bottom) and then type my name in the field. Here is the giving link https://burninglimb.com/giving/

Thank you to all of you and J for your donations and support. In late January, I felt so exhausted by therapy that I did not know how I would continue. Then all of a sudden I see a flood of donations and support in my fundraisers. It gave me such an incredible boost. I cannot thank you all enough! This week in therapy was more physically demanding than any other and my nervous system is able to handle it, which is wonderful news. I am doing everything I can in therapy to get to a full recovery &#060;3]]></description>

ACK!! This is such a crazy thing to experience!! Had no idea it affected so many people, this is horrible... Really really glad you found someone (you could trust!) who could help treat you for it.. The worst is not knowing what the hell is happening and people not believing you :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had this! It is unbelievable. I got it after a tendon in my foot tore and I had a reaction to the adhesive they used to close the wound. I was in a wheelchair, and they thought I would never walk again. It was an absolute miracle that I was able to find someone in time who actually knew how to treat it, because many doctors are very ignorant of it. My doctor argued that I didn&#039;t have it because only &quot;weak&quot; people got it, and I have too strong of a personality. What ....????  Anyway, I really feel for her because it is a pain that is hard to describe. I know people who have gone to Germany and had themselves put in a coma to try to cure it. It&#039;s no joke. Thank you for sharing this, and I wish her the very best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I empathise with Agatha. CRPS is a horrible illness.(I call it CRaP Syndrome) It arrives out of the blue, usually after a relatively minor injury or an operation. The pain is excruciating, and in my case after more than 13 years, I still suffer from it, although fortunately, my pain has mellowed somewhat over the years, but it is still there. There is no cure that I know of. It changes your life, and not for the better. As someone who cycled to work, ran 10k races &#038; swam loads, I count myself lucky that I can walk as far as I want and bend my knee (thank you physio), however I can no longer run and my swimming is pretty restricted. 
I don&#039;t speak about it normally, my immediate family know about it, but few others, however I felt that I should add weight to J Money&#039;s post. .]]></description>
