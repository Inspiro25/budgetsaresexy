Hahahhahahhaha... See - it was all worth it in the end! And I&#039;ll only charge you 10% for reminding you of it ;)

Very fascinating stuff to read this morning for sure though - thx for sharing it with us man. I love all this hustling/entrepreneurship stuff, even if it drives us mad at times!]]></description>

Holy crap! This little story reminded me that the book was probably still listed on the self-publishing site I used. I just logged in and I have $600 they&#039;ve been trying to send me for years, and I hadn&#039;t updated contact info since two moves ago. People are still buying the book. Free money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally identify with creating jobs for yourself. When I was in graduate school getting my PhD in Badass, I had a little side business selling a particular type of item on eBay. I was good at it, too. I could sell the same thing for more than my competitors because I had branding and great ad copy for the same Chinese made stuff. But man, this was a job. I had real work to do every single day, and as volume increased, so did the amount of work.

So ... genius idea. Cut out the retail customer, and deal with fewer folks while increasing volume. I wrote a book on how to sell this item. I marketed that with this little one page website and sold it for some ridiculous amount of money. The book did go into detail on what I did, my ad copy, etc. but it was mainly one big ad for a dropshipping company I set-up.  I was building an army to sell for me. Well ... it worked. My volume went way up, but so did the amount of time I needed to spend each day. The work didn&#039;t scale with client numbers. It scaled with volume. I created a job, and after running the numbers, I wasn&#039;t really making that much per hour. And, I hated the work I had to do. Data entry, customer service, customer complaints, supplier problems. It sucked. I couldn&#039;t outsource that stuff because then I wouldn&#039;t make any money. Lesson learned. I had to shut it down so I would have time to graduate.

Moral: it&#039;s actually really easy to make money online, but if you&#039;re not careful, you&#039;re just creating another job for yourself.]]></description>

Tricky! I think it&#039;s one of those things that you slowly figure out over time :) Though, If I had more money saved up it would certainly nix a handful of those right off the bat, haha...]]></description>

Welcome to the club! But you&#039;ve GOT THIS! And soon you&#039;ll be thinking the same about the next promotion up too, and the following and the following :) But I guess if everyone feels the same then we&#039;re all good? Haha... that&#039;s what I always tell myself now.]]></description>
