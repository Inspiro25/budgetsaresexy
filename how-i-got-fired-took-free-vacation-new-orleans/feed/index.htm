					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys! Life has been super crazy since I took this trip. I&#039;m in the middle of the interview process for a promising gig at a small creative company based in Portland, but I&#039;ll try to pop in and respond to comments as time allows. (I also just mailed off fingerprints for the Peace Corps, so I&#039;m all over the place right now.)

@Lance - Yeah! And because they didn&#039;t have much work for us to do there at the end, I got especially lucky. I had lots of time to research while I was still on the clock but they didn&#039;t have anything for me to do. If you&#039;re losing a job, make the best of it, I say.
@Jennifer - Exactly! If you have them anyway, you might as well put them toward your basic expenses on a big (or small) adventure.
@Kris - I feel that. I&#039;m constantly realizing how lucky I am that I don&#039;t have kids or a spouse, because I wouldn&#039;t feel right making them scrape on the things that I do so that I can enjoy other things. And I think lots of people expect to do &quot;touristy things&quot;, and that definitely wasn&#039;t in my budget, for the most part. (Although, I technically could have splurged on some stuff since I got everything else for practically nothing.)
@Stephanie - That sounds like a good rule of thumb for lots of things. I love watching the commentary for independent films and hearing them say &quot;We just didn&#039;t have money for X, so we had to get creative.&quot; They almost always turn out better for the creativity.
@Bridget - All it takes is time! :)
@B. Rich - Thanks! And the way I see it, most other people are just like me in all the important ways (despite what we see on the news). I&#039;m not going to murder or rob anyone, so it&#039;s a pretty safe bet that 99% of the other people in the world aren&#039;t going to do so either.  We&#039;re paranoid about our own safety in America (myself included), but the fact is, it&#039;s mostly harmless. Just don&#039;t poke bears and you should be okay. Haha.
@Jenna - Thanks! I was able to find round trip airfare to Buenos Aires for about $500 (by flying out of Florida and using budget/local airlines). But, alas, I don&#039;t have the time or means to take that trip right now. Hopefully within the next year or two, unless I end up going into the Peace Corps (which will also be a free vacation of sorts).
@Joe - Travelling locally is great! I&#039;m always finding great new things around me. But I&#039;ve lived here my whole life, and I felt like it was time to experience a new culture and a new cuisine.
@Brian - I know! It went back up to 50k almost immediately after I got mine. Such a bummer! I had to change planes in Vegas on my way back from NOLA. I had always thought Vegas would be fun, but just from flying in, I kind of changed my mind. It seemed a little high-octane for me, and I&#039;m more of a taking it slow and easy kind of guy. But hey, there&#039;s still NOLA for the rest of us. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well done finding ways to travel on a tight budget! I wish I&#039;d done more of that when I was single and before I had kids - it&#039;s harder to travel on a budget when there are five people going along!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job with your zero sum adventure in New Orleans!
That is a neat idea with the gift cards. There are some just hanging around here, tacked on the fridge, and we never seem to get around to using them. I&#039;ll have to squirrel these away for a &#039;cheaper&#039; vacation..]]></description>
