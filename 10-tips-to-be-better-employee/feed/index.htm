					<description><![CDATA[Agreed.  Any CEO/Founder that literally has their door open anytime for their employees can really make a difference.  The last two startups I worked at had this policy, and it really gave us all that feeling that we can voice any concerns/ideas/etc we have, and that they&#039;d also be listened to face-to-face.  Big fan of that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think your point about recognizing our own faults is very important when talking about work-place behavior. I think a lot of the time, people don&#039;t even realize that they are coming off as grumpy or hard to talk to, at work more than anywhere. When you&#039;re at work, you are focused on getting a job done; you are busy; you are, well, working. It&#039;s hard to remember in the middle of all of that, that you might come off across as annoyed or unapproachable. One of my favorite moments in Seinfeld is when George says in order to look like he is doing a good job at work, he just &quot;looks annoyed&quot; all the time. And it&#039;s true! So just be extra mindful while you&#039;re at work. People (like your boss) are bound to notice your attitude-- even if you don&#039;t!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for guest posting for us Dean!  Glad others enjoyed this as much as I did :)

@&lt;b&gt;David&lt;/b&gt; -  Haha, I like that - &#039;psychologically unemployable&#039;
@&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Now THAT is awesome :)  I&#039;d totally laugh at your jokes!  Esp if they&#039;re cheezy ones - those are my faves.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; -  So true!!! haha... love it.
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt; - I think that can be the case too, but usually you&#039;ll still make it a LOT farther if you go overboard and just kill it with both hustle and kindness.  I&#039;ve been at places where everyone held back, and because of it I excelled w/out even having to do much more than them cuz they all slacked! Makes the hard workers look even better ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MD&lt;/b&gt; -  Agreed!!
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - I get accused of being &quot;too happy&quot; sometimes, haha... but much better to give off that impression than the annoying downer! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with leaving your problems at home.  Years ago, I used to air out my occasional problems with my boyfriend (now husband) to some of the girls I worked with (we were all close friends) and it&#039;s just not appropriate.  I don&#039;t feel it held me back, though.  Since then, I have grown up and learned to keep my mouth shut in the office.  

I also agree with SMILE.  I am a naturally happy person.  I&#039;m pretty bubbly and perky, even first thing in the morning.  I can&#039;t stand being around people who don&#039;t smile or who are always down in the dumps.  Good moods are infectious.  I&#039;m also known to be a little silly to help lighten the mood around my office.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jessica-no doubt there are many crappy work places.  But many &quot;crappy&quot; work places are that way from one or two cynical unhappy foks poisoning the well for the rest.

If you have an evil boss or supervisor-make life plans to change things. Those who keep their head high and their sense of humor intact will get a new job faster than those who are a sullen,  woe-is-me person.

@Jen, good luck with your job search.  I&#039;m sure the right one will come along.
@MD-you are right-on. Most folks are blind to their faults-it takes a lot of maturity to ask the question-could it be me or my attitude that is part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
@Jaime-you are correct.  Your career may evolve-and you need to go in a different direction.  Nothing wrong with that.  You should have a realistic view of your future, and if there is none based on an accurate appraisal, move on.   My post was to encourage folks to make the most of their work life and gifts.  There are lotsa businesses who will make room for a excellent employee who may not normally be &quot;hiring&quot;.]]></description>
