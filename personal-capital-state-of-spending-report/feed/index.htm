Hah! How sad, but how true :) There&#039;s always people better - and worse - off than us! Good to keep things in perspective for sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand that it&#039;s not good to compare ourselves to others but reading stuff like this makes me feel so much better about myself. I worry about our finances all the time and it drives my wife nuts but when I compare myself to the average American I can&#039;t help but feel a huge stress relief. I needed this one right now.

Keep making me look good America :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love these kinds of stats!  I&#039;ve gotta admit, I spent $583 at Nordstrom last month (wince), but I certainly don&#039;t every month.  I bet they don&#039;t include Target or stores like that in these stats because you could be buying anything form groceries to small appliances to books, clothing or gifts at those stores.  So expenditures there don&#039;t fit neatly into any of these &quot;people spend X on Y&quot; metrics.  

Also TX probably leads in mortgages because our property taxes are so high - since we have no state income tax here in the Lone Star State.]]></description>

Congrats on starting to track it all :) That&#039;s usually the hardest part - facing the facts! Now time to get the little wins each month as it ticks up and over into positive territory eventually!]]></description>

I gotta say - all these theories on S. Dakota are incredibly fascinating! From oil to higher wages to now farming and budgeting. If only there was a way to find out what the answer was! Or maybe it&#039;s a combo of all sorts of variables?]]></description>

Haha... I&#039;ll have to put T K Maxx on my list of places to hit the next time I&#039;m out there :) After meeting you for a beer, of course (though drunk shopping can be a reallly bad idea! haha)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a fairly secure job. I do not necessarily think we are prepared for an economic downturn after seeing my negative net worth, which I just started tracking this month. However, I try to focus on it too much because I know I&#039;m working on some things to change that. Big things happening for our net worth before April! (It will still be in the negative but getting MUCH better)]]></description>
