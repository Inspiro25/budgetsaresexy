It&#039;s been a lot of things really, not just one thing. Ad revenue down, wife no longer working, etc. Just a phase (hopefully) :)]]></description>

Cool man, I&#039;m glad you enjoy reading about this stuff - sometimes it feels weird dishing my thoughts all the time like a diary :) It&#039;s nice to know people get something out of it.]]></description>

I love that - &quot;planning&quot; your life rather than reacting to it - that&#039;s hard to do! And looks like you are now presented with the perfect opportunity to do it :) Still can&#039;t believe all that stuff w/ MSN - that&#039;s nutso... If you ever need anything you know where to find me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats!

I couldn&#039;t imagine having two right now. Between the financial implications and overall increase in responsibilities. Our Little Warrior is 8 months now and everyday we are still learning something. 

I&#039;m looking forward to seeing how you handle the new financial bearing. I know you will do well with it, but you explaining the up&#039;s and down&#039;s is always fun, for me at least, to read and learn from.

					<description><![CDATA[After Microsoft kicked all its writers to the virtual curb, I decided not to try and replace all that income right away. Instead, I&#039;m writing one or two posts a week for Money Talks News (which will cover my basic expenses), taking some deep breaths and thinking about planning my life rather than simply reacting to it. 
As I recently posted on my own site, &quot;Time is something we can&#039;t do over.&quot;
I&#039;m pretty happy with the decision, but wavered a little yesterday after writing a HUGE freakin&#039; check to my credit card company (medical bills + FinCon + staying after the conference to visit with my daughter). Still, I think everything will be copacetic: Like you, I just need to be mindful about spending for a while.
Sorry we didn&#039;t have more time to chat at FinCon -- it was crazy for me this year.]]></description>
