					<description><![CDATA[You guys are convincing me to give it another shot now, jeez... so many of you have recovered money! That&#039;s awesome! What if I find that &quot;J. Money&quot; is owed some but can&#039;t get it cuz I can&#039;t prove it&#039;s me?? Haha.... that would be hilarious.  

Glad y&#039;all are finding your money though - Keep searching! :)

@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, that&#039;s one helluva good endorsement for these sites! So cool you guys got it back and now have a fun story to tell to people like me :) Glad it worked out, bud!
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I feela bit weird about it all too, to be honest with you, but only cuz of the whole &quot;giving out important info&quot; type of deal. Especially to sites I&#039;m not too familiar with.  But I guess if you&#039;re owed a lot of money, it&#039;s worth it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! And hopefully as you get older you become better about staying on top of things more.
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! You should totally reconnect with him that way :) Then email me and let me know how it went, haha... I guess money DOES bring people together!
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s good. I&#039;d take minutes over hours any time!
@&lt;b&gt;Katy&lt;/b&gt; - Holy crap that&#039;s fast. Wow.  Good for you!
@&lt;b&gt;Lynn&lt;/b&gt; - What? Really? That is still super cool though :) What did you end up doing with that $400?
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Damn. How are we all missing so much?? That&#039;s pretty incredible... Thanks for sending out that url to your fellow Indianians too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sean @ One Smart Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - Maybe it&#039;s time to check it again real quick just to make sure? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... Yeah, I&#039;d totally close that bad boy down and just be done with it. I hate having stuff open in my name that I never use - freaks me out a bit.
@&lt;b&gt;Alexis&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome! I think that&#039;s how I first heard of all this too actually, in Money mag. Guess it&#039;s good remind everyone every few years just to make sure we&#039;re up to speed.
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley&lt;/b&gt; - There you go! And you made almost $100 an hour off it too, well done :) 
@&lt;b&gt;Kara&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, well that sucks... I wonder how it&#039;s all accounted for on their books?  Would be so annoying to have it forever and ever and ever unclaimed! For both parties: :( I bet that&#039;s the problem for a lot of other people too - not being able to prove they&#039;re the rightful owners of it. Sucky.
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Well that was nice of you! Maybe I should do my mom and dad and siblings too then? And they can use it to buy me a nice Christmas present? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - As is many other things in our life ;)
@&lt;b&gt;G. Jones&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! Did your mom end up thanking you with some of it? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Suzanne Cramer&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo! That&#039;s awesome! And I bet you guys have someone in-house that can notarize things for you at work easily, huh? If not, hit up your local bank or credit union as many of those places do it for free for their members too.
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal @ Prairie Ecothrifter&lt;/b&gt; - There you go :) And then you&#039;d be helping all your readers too!
@&lt;b&gt;Ellie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha... I just got a damn speeding tkt too actually, always gets you when you least expect it!
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s good! Congrats!
@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I never thought of checking for my friends/family until you guys started talking about it in the comments. I&#039;m totally gonna do it now though, so thanks :) (And my friends/family might be thanking you too!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice reminder. I picked up a few hundred dollars last year from a job I quit a decade ago. Super easy to do, only took about an hour of my time. Worth it if you ask me :)]]></description>
