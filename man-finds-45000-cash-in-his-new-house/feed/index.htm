					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s certainly an opinion :) Just wondering though - if it was your money you lost, you wouldn&#039;t want anyone to return it to you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would have kept the 45k right where it was; after 30 days or so if no one claimed it, it would be mine. Feeling guilty about things is childish and stupid; one mans loss in another mans gain, thats the way the world works; ask anyone in the stock market.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, bought a house some years back and the garage &#038; shed were full of clothes and props. As I had bought the property outright, I just dumped the lot.
2 months later the previous owner came back and asked for it, TOUGH luck mate I had to clear your rubbish so you owe me £xxx, needless to say he went on his way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I found bags of cash like that in my new home&#039;s garage, I&#039;d be scared to death! I&#039;d be thinking the previous owner (deceased or not!) was related to the mob or something. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d call the police because who the heck leaves $45K lying around in garbage bags, seriously?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, he could have def. gotten away w/ keeping it if he wanted!  Unless one of the kids found out somehow down the road... maybe like having a &quot;vision&quot; ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ SheBloggs&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;d never forget it either way, too!  
@&lt;b&gt;sandra&lt;/b&gt; - Wowww!  That woulda been FUN seeing all those coins come out of the payphone!! haha... you are sweet.  Good idea on giving it to someone in need instead of keeping :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - Wow 2 years??  That&#039;s insane.  They are LUCKY you are a good guy!!  And I hear ya on the &quot;niceness&quot; of the people you&#039;re dealing with.  It&#039;s always harder to be nice to those who are dicks to you.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Sometimes I wish I didn&#039;t have that guilt factor ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger B @ Ask the IRS B*tch&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... would have to be a STRONG honest day too then, eh?  That&#039;s a ton of cash!
@&lt;b&gt;MariaN&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!!!  I love what you said too - &quot;I&#039;ll never be a victim to money again&quot; that&#039;s powerful stuff :)
@&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, splitting 50/50 like that is a good idea for sure.  Well done :)
@&lt;b&gt;myloverswife&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... not if you had died and left it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Bonnie&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooooh now that&#039;s interesting!  Yeah, why didn&#039;t he tell SOMEONE about it?  We all assumed he saved it over time like a rock star, but you&#039;re right - he *could have* very well stolen it or found it or who knows... I doubt it, but we&#039;ll probably never find out ;) Fun twist though!]]></description>
