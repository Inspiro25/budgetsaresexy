Glad to hear it Jackie!

I love net worth stuff A LOT so it&#039;s super fun to track everyone else&#039;s too :) And it&#039;s fascinating how different they all are too, even outside of the #&#039;s. We all seem to have our own thoughts on what Net Worth should include, so it&#039;s cool to see the other perspectives.]]></description>

It is motivating to finally see your net worth in writing...even if you&#039;re like me and not quite ready to publish it for the rest of the world to see.]]></description>

Kayla, I have to agree 100% with J$. Every year up until 2014 at tax time my wife and I would look at how much we made and shake our heads because we had no idea where the money had gone. This was a significant amount of money and something had to be done. By keeping track of everything you know exactly where everything goes, and if you are able to make up a bit of a budget you know exactly how much of your cash can go to spending it on fun stuff. Like J said, there will be months where it goes up and some months where it goes down (I just got out of two consecutive losses) but at least you know.

Not &quot;seeing&quot; your net worth, being positive or negative, will hurt you in the long run. You don&#039;t have to display it to the public, just keep it to yourself and keep yourself accountable for what is happening to it.]]></description>

Yeah, you&#039;re probably right on that one, but I&#039;m hardcore about indexing right now so won&#039;t switch just to get more dividends :) Perhaps in my new non-retirement account I&#039;ll be opening up soon though?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. congrats on the great year 40Gs up is awesome. As far as dividends go, you could be rocking it a little better as you have over 300K in mutual funds. On average someone with your net worth can pull in about 12K a year in dividends, obviously depends on the funds distributions per share. If you switch over some funds into a vanguard REIT or Utility fund, you may have a higher dividend with a little more risk. I ended my December with 1550 in dividends in one month. Good Luck in 2015.]]></description>

Yea, Personal Capital doesn&#039;t list one of my student loan lenders and that&#039;s where a LOT of my debt comes from so that&#039;s a no-go.

I&#039;ve heard of YNAB but don&#039;t use it. Maybe I&#039;ll look into trying out their demo. I&#039;m really looking for a more robust tool for tacking rather than budgeting. Thanks for the link!]]></description>
