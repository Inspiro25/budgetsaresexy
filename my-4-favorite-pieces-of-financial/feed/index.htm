					<description><![CDATA[Got an answer back from the USAA folks!  Hope this helps :)

-------------------

Here are the steps she will need to follow to get her credit card activity into Excel:

1. From the main “My Accounts” page, she will want to click on her credit card (the account name is a hyperlink).  This will take her to the transactions page for her account.
 
2. Once on the transactions page, she will need to click the “Export” icon which is right below the orange “Available Credit” label.

3.  The screen will refresh and give her the opportunity to select the transactions to download.  The choices are “All”, “Selected”, and “Date Range.”  Assuming she selects “Date Range”, she will need to insert the starting and ending dates.

4.  Finally, she will need to change the File Format drop down box to “Comma-Delimited (CSV)” and then click the green “Export” button.

This will export the transactions into an Excel spreadsheet which she can then manipulate or copy and paste into her own budgeting spreadsheet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been working on most of these things and you have really encouraged me to take a REAL look at what we spend each month and to make a budget.  The only problem is that I cannot figure out how to export my credit card activity from usaa.com since I don&#039;t have Quicken and was hoping to put it in an Excel spreadsheet.  Any advice short of going through and adding it myself?  I love USAA but their website can be very confusing, especially when you try to search for something!]]></description>
