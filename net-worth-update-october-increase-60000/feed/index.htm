					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, agreed!  It was other bloggers online that motivated ME to put it all out there too (specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://mymoneyblog.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;My Money Blog&lt;/a&gt;) and it&#039;s been one of my favorite parts of blogging so far over the years. It not only helps ME to stay on track and accountable, but also others as you mention.  Glad you like it! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, J. Yes, that&#039;s a great answer. I would feel much better with a house value 5% higher of course, but my net worth is much lower than yours so there&#039;s less wiggle room should I sell the house. So, I like to have a more real picture of what I would get. I&#039;m so grateful that you&#039;re willing to put yourself out there and share your calculations and totals. We&#039;re all are out here doing it on our own making it up as we go, so it&#039;s really helpful to hear other perspectives on how to budget, track net worth, keep good credit, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for stopping by Connie, a very good question indeed!  I actually do not include any fees or anything like that at all - whether it be my house or other assets/cars/etc in my Net Worth.  For me I just want a good estimate of what all my stuff is *worth* at any given time.  Whenever I unload anything, I&#039;ll work in the expenses there and adjust the numbers accordingly :)  And as far as HOW I evaluate our house value, I just go straight to the source which is our realtor - though I haven&#039;t updated it quite a while (the cons of doing it this way - I don&#039;t want to keep bothering him unless I know we&#039;re serious about selling/renting).

Does that answer your question?  I think as long as you&#039;re getting out of it what you want, you should def. keep running with it :) We all track our Net Worths for different reasons, so if it&#039;s working out nicely for ya right now all the better!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found your blog so forgive me if someone&#039;s asked this before, but I&#039;m curious about your house calculation in your net worth.  I also calculate my net worth a few times a year and always subtract realtor&#039;s fees, which lowers my house value by 5%. Can you explain your house calculation and are you just figuring that the realtor&#039;s fees is an expense that will reduce your savings at the time of sale (I guess in the same way a busted hot water heater would)?]]></description>
