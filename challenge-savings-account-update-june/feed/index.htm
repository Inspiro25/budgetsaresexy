Well, it depends on how much you use really, and *how* you use it. If you stream everything over WiFi you still have unlimited :) It just became too costly for those streaming so much off it and they had to make a change. 

My contact over there said it&#039;ll actually HELP 80% of their customers, and after running my own #&#039;s just this week it turns out we&#039;re in that 80% and will be saving an additional $18/mo on average! So I&#039;m okay with it of course, though I will miss the *feeling* of everything &quot;unlimited.&quot;

Here&#039;s what else my contact said (their PR rep):

&quot;Current customers are grandfathered into existing plans until August 1, 2016. This under the firm belief that the vast majority of customers save money under the new plans.

Republic has a reputation for putting customers first so I won&#039;t be surprised to see this get extended or amended although how isn&#039;t known yet. Jon Schniepp, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing says &quot;All we ask is you try our new plans for a few months. Try out the experience. We want you to save more, and we&#039;re pretty confident we can get you there. If you decide they are not for you, switch back to the current plans, and we&#039;ll see if we can work something out.&quot;

So might be worth a shot trying it out now and then if it sucks reaching out to them? As for other carriers, the only one I have limited knowledge on is Ting Wireless who also charges similarly to the &quot;pay what you use&quot; type plans. Unlimited ones are seeming to go away/change again due to those who just stream stuff 24/7. But check them out - maybe you&#039;ll like em too?

You can have an iPhone with Ting which was the #1 plus in my books when researching :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So republic wireless is in the process of changing from the unlimited data plans... What is up with that?? Now I have one year until I have to change to one of their new plans (or find a new provider). Any suggestions? I was loving the $25/month *unlimited* everything 3G plan.. 

This may put a damper on your money saving challenge if you use a lot of data. :-/]]></description>

I know! That&#039;s partly why I&#039;m OK keeping cable around because at $90 where we had it was only $20&#039;ish more when you consider internet. It&#039;s not like you can get to $0.00 unless you cancel everything! (Which I wouldn&#039;t mind if I didn&#039;t work online - hah. You can always surf internet/shows on the phone nowadays :))]]></description>

Ouch! Yes, you can DEF do better there for sure once you&#039;re ready to jump on it. Republic Wireless, Ting, pay-as-you-go companies - there&#039;s tons of places now that could get your bill in the $50+ range depending on what you&#039;re looking for. You&#039;ll save a ton!]]></description>
