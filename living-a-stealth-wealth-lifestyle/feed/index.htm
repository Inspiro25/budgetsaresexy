Yep - buying things just to appear wealthy often has a predictable outcome :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this! Thanks for sharing.

Seems to me that one of the best ways to NOT have wealth is conspicuous consumption.

Keeping up with the Joneses often leads you to be broke... like the Joneses]]></description>

Wooohoo! Welcome!  Actually, the original dude with Paula on the Podcast was J. Money...  He&#039;s still involved on the backend of the site but as of about 6 months ago I started writing the new posts. Cheers for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“If you were the last person left in the whole world, would you still buy and use this?”

That is a very powerful statement that really helps keeping yourself on track. 

This is the first blogpost I read on your site after finding your site through your podcast with Paula. I like your energy. Thanks for bringing Sexy (budgets) Back! ;) I&#039;m lovin&#039; it.]]></description>

That&#039;s great to have your assets and stuff spread around and diversified. Next step, a Swiss bank account that nobody knows about! :)

I agree that FIRE is still being defined and most people have no clue what it is we do. That&#039;s why we need to keep slowly spreading the word and leading by example.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true Joel! 

It&#039;s funny how some people treat you once they know how much money you have. Unfortunately, it&#039;s just part of our culture. I see it all the time. Even with friends and family. 

Being showy and flaunting money can definitely make people targets. This is one of the reasons why I continue the type of lifestyle that I have. To me, it&#039;s not about money and stuff. It&#039;s about lifestyle. Though, not everyone feels that way. 

One of my past mentors once told me, &quot;The key to being wealthy is to have no expenses and to increase your income.&quot; So true! And this is from a very wealthy person. But you wouldn&#039;t be able to tell as they too practiced stealth wealth. 

Great reminder of what&#039;s important in life. I enjoyed your story!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Only some good friends and our parents know our assets. 
As far as it goed for the rest of the world...I dont think they have a clue what we do (FIRE) or what we have (Some real estate projects). 
Dont really care about that.
Even our bank-guy doesnt really have a clue because we keep our money and our mortgages in seperate banks (thats pure coincidence btw, but I kinda like it this way now). So, when I go to our bank guy once a year to get some tax-papers, the dude always looks at me with a bit of a question mark in his eyes, because we have 3 or 4 mortgages and almost no money on that account  Oh well, as long as everything gets paid in time I guess its ok for them.]]></description>
