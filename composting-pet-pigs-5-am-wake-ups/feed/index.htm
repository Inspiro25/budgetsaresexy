Hey Kate!

Nothing much to report there, I&#039;m afraid. I am still composting, however my scraps don&#039;t seem to be turning into compost much, haha... Not sure exactly what I&#039;m missing here, but my bin is getting full and the cold winter didn&#039;t seem to help things. Hoping with Spring it heats up and helps decompose better! I might have to empty it into a hole and start from scratch!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could you write a post with an update about the composting? Wondering how that&#039;s going (if you&#039;re still doing it), what&#039;s going well, what&#039;s not, and what you&#039;d do differently. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been reading The Zero-Waste Lifestyle by Amy Korst and I have Zero Waste Home by Bea Johnson in my stack to read next. I have been thinking a lot about how to be better for the environment while saving money for a few years now. I thought it was hard until I watched a video by Bea Johnson a month ago and in it she said they were spending 40% less with this lifestyle. Sold!

We have been using a double sided a compost bin for a couple of years and the book Let It Rot by Stu Campbell. I am just realizing how much of our trash really can and should go in our compost, like tissue. We have also been using cloth napkins, white rags that we bought for a great price at Costco. We also have been using Green Earth Bags Reusable Cotton Canvas Grocery Tote Bag on and off for a few years. We have always recycled so that was never an issue. What I am trying to say is that I was doing somethings already but some of it was half way. 

Now we are trying to compost more of our trash, use Goodwill more and use our tote bags every time. We also clean with vinegar and baking soda. I really like that I can safely clean with my 10 month old underfoot.]]></description>

I didn&#039;t think about the pig making any noise INSIDE his house, huh... Isn&#039;t he supposed to be smart enough to do so outside to not bother anyone?? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friend&#039;s sister actually has a pet pig, and I have to agree with the jet engine sound. That thing is LOUD and not pleasing on the ears at all. When he&#039;s not screaming though, I do agree with how smart he is. And he&#039;s trained to use the litter box as well.

Nice idea with the micro fiber cloths to replace paper towels, never though of that. We use them for cleaning/waxing the cars and stuff outside already since they don&#039;t leave any residue or scratches.]]></description>
