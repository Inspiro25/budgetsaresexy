I think they are taking away ALL benefits. Moving me completely back to a contractor position. The change happens March 31 apparently. I&#039;ll know more soon.

I could go out and get my own HDHP. But they&#039;re still very expensive!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, I see you already thought through the one year testing period : )

Nice work, are they really taking HDHP/HSA away altogether as an option? That&#039;s a huge bummer!

Yep - just tryna put my money where my mouth is!  If I succeed, people will learn from it. If I fail, people will learn from it. Either way, it&#039;s helps others!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-report-2-one-little-duck/#comment-314097&quot;&gt;Peter Minev&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Peter!  I hear ya... There are some extremists within the FI crowd that take frugality to levels that seem really uncomfortable. It confuses me too.

But for the most part, I think it&#039;s more about sensible and economical spending. Spending less on things that don&#039;t provide value, in order to buy more of the things that do provide value.

Personally, I&#039;d be happy to increase my spending in every area of my budget... So long as I get proportionate increased value or happiness for the additional dollars. If there is no added value, or diminishing returns, I don&#039;t wanna more than I need to, regardless of my income or net worth.

Also - another quick note. Some of my friends have embraced extreme frugality recently. But they are either in heavy debt or need to make radical changes to their lifestyle. Everyone&#039;s situation is different - so sometimes I encourage stricter frugality and other times I don&#039;t understand why.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hm, one thing that I don&#039;t really get. Why so often I see FI related with strict frugality.... Since my early 20s, I had one principle - always try to earn more money, and the increase in your earnings to be higher than the increase of your spending. Period. That leads to a) you enjoy spending without any guilt and b) despite the increased spending you save and invest in passive income even more. 

Ever increasing spending is OK, as soon as your earnings increase not only match the spending increase, but also beats it. 

I know some people will say that money doesn&#039;t buy happiness. I agree that money ALONE can&#039;t buy happiness, but they can contribute a lot!]]></description>

Maybe when Christmas rolls around I&#039;ll go out to the garage and wrap up the bike in wrapping paper. That&#039;ll jog her memory. :)

Actually, in all seriousness, my wife can have whatever she wants (because she usually wants nothing!). I was glad to hear she wanted to spend money on herself for a bike - this is a rare request!]]></description>

That&#039;s awesome Adam! 125k gain aint no joke.  I keep historical records but in a slim format on a separate spreadsheet tab. It&#039;s fun to go back every now and then to look how far we&#039;ve come :)]]></description>
