					<description><![CDATA[Im not sure about lice. Is that something african defendants get?  I&#039;ve never experienced lice ever. Definitely not something you see in the hood. Lol.
If I&#039;m wrong please feel free to further educate]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I learned a ton when my kids picked up lice from daycare. It was all part of the service that came out:
https://www.thelicelifters.com/
For $150 she combed through my kids&#039; hair to check for lice (she charged $35 for a &quot;head check&quot;) and found a couple on my daughter. She did mine and found a couple on me.  Then we slathered our heads in this solution that&#039;s basically rosemary and olive oil. Did that 3 times over a 2 week period, and no lice.
The way that you can pick up lice is hair=to-hair contact. And we didn&#039;t have to trash our stuffed animals or pillowcases.  I learned a lot and it&#039;s not a gross as it was before we went through it!]]></description>

I bet they stay in business well for doing a whole package like that! Maybe you can add that to your services too, Jessica? :) And if you don&#039;t have a brick and mortar can even do a lot of these professional services even cheaper and gobble up even more business.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Teacher here. I teach second grade and only made it 7 weeks into the school year before I got an email from a parent saying their kid had lice and to warn other families to check their kids&#039; heads. Everyday I drive past a place from home to my school where they do professional lice/nit picking. I&#039;ve heard for $500, they will not only pick heads but they will also come to your home and do all the cleaning required to get rid of lice: wash sheets, vacuum furniture, etc Sounds like a great money maker which I will not be taking part in.]]></description>

That is the problem, the recurring outbreaks! Our schools here are also struggling with constant lice outbreaks and it is exhausting for teachers, parents, and students. I found the OTC treatments just slowed them down but it didn&#039;t wipe them out. After I do some official training, I am hoping to offer professional advice on how to prevent or deal with a lice infestation on your head and in your home. Thanks for your support of the idea!]]></description>

As part of being a professional, I am going to invest in a couple scrub tops with my logo that I can take off and wash without exposing my regular clothing. You also just make sure that your own hair is tied up, you don&#039;t touch your own head while working, and you wear gloves or wash your hands thoroughly after and you should be fine. But the urge to scratch while you are working with lice is SO hard to resist!]]></description>
