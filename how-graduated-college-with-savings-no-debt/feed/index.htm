Nicely done man! 

I&#039;m not sure if Will is still in the blogging game or not (it&#039;s been a few years since he posted this, and haven&#039;t heard from him in a while?), but let me shoot him a note w/ the email I have on file for him and see if he&#039;s interested in linking up. If he is, I&#039;ll have him reach out :) (and if you don&#039;t hear anything, it means he&#039;s m.i.a. haha...)

Regardless though, keep on hustling!! I had about $5.00 to my name by the time I graduated college - hah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post Will! Really impressive what you did there - I am graduating college with $50,000 and hope to be able to save at least 50% of my income (I&#039;m married with one child, so expenses are a bit more)

Love hearing your story - very inspiring. Would love to connect with you sometime, if you&#039;re up for that? Shoot me an email?]]></description>

It&#039;s a long story which I should write a post about. But this gives you a hint... latch onto your professors. Make them like you. As with anyone, they will want their friends to do well. They will help you.]]></description>

Tell her to go for it!!! I know it&#039;s cliche but anything is possible! I would encourage her to create her own streams of income asap rather than working for others. Much of my $100k came from trading hours for money. That&#039;s really not a great arrangement.

Has she read this post? I can email her if you&#039;d like. I&#039;m all about people getting started ASAP! :)]]></description>

85% sounds crazy until you put things into perspective. A percentage is meaningless in and of itself. The more money you make, the easier it is to achieve this rate. So if you want to save 85% it&#039;s really just a matter of earning so much that it&#039;s (fairly) easily attainable.

But I haven&#039;t reached that point yet but I will soon. For now it&#039;s a lot of focusing on income and living a frugal (yet enjoyable) life.

BTW, I don&#039;t plan on inflating my lifestyle once I reach FI. My income increases each year but I still live like I did in college (I&#039;m 25). That 85% number will grow.]]></description>

How did you get your professors to get you A&#039;s.
What did you exactly do to hack through college?

					<description><![CDATA[Motivating and entertaining as usual, Will.  My oldest, who will be 15 soon, just came to the realization that her dream of moving out and buying a ranch comes with a huge price tag, and that achieving this by 18 is going to take a heck of a lot of work.  As such, she&#039;s become a saving machine in the last couple of months.  I think I&#039;ll show her this post so she knows what&#039;s possible with hard work and smart savings. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[85% savings... holy hell, that&#039;s insane! I&#039;m aiming for retirement at 30 but it sounds as though you&#039;ll be retired well before then. Kudos!]]></description>

Thank you for your service.

I gained a lot of respect for the service men and women after serving on base that summer. I think there&#039;s too much mention of guns and tanks in the news and not about the amount of intelligence there is within each branch of the military. And it&#039;s PRACTICAL intelligence. Men and women are putting their intelligence to use by propelling the world forward. It&#039;s inspiring.]]></description>
