We did it all over the world as I grew up military!

But come to think about it I think one of the *first* times I learned about it was when we were stationed in California :) Had to make sure I brought it all the way to Korea after but I&#039;m pretty sure they were already doing it there too, lol...]]></description>

Excellent uses for plastic bags :)

I had to raid my parents&#039; house the other day to get more as we&#039;ve long since stopped getting them from stores but use them for our cat litter... Turned out my parents never use them anymore now that their dog has passed so it was like hitting the lottery getting 100+ extra bags! And all for FREE!! :)]]></description>

OMG I REMEMBER THAT TOO!!!

That was where it was AT back in the day! I guess that&#039;s why I subconsciously thought this was &quot;old school&quot; haha.. We literally DID it at school and now we&#039;re all OLD! (Bah dum-ching)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, the paper bag wrapper reminds me of the DIY cover we used to make for our textbooks. Did you guys do that too or was it just in Los Angeles? I wonder if kids still do that today.
We use the TJ bags for our dry trash and recycle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reduce, Reuse &#038; Recycle...it makes us feel rich when we can save!  When you start thinking of things that could save you a few pennies/bucks then you know how much you really have.  You brought me back to my school days....with covering books and then decorating them according to the subject :)     I reuse bread bags for picking up dog droppings on our walks.  I can not bring myself to buy the bags when I have a solution that is free and just as good.  I also reuse dog food bags for sloppy garbage and keep it in the garage so my garbage in the house doesn&#039;t smell and it helps to assure I have one bag a week.  I never take a plastic bag when I buy something.  If it is a small item, I carry it out.  If it is a large item I bring my cloth bags.]]></description>

Oh man, now I&#039;m having vivid flashbacks to the late 1980s and my dad teaching me how to do that. Didn&#039;t even need tape if you folded it the right way. Next time I borrow a hardcover book from the library I&#039;ll have to give that a shot just for nostalgia&#039;s sake!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Back when I was in school &#038; plastic shopping bags weren&#039;t around yet, I would use paper grocery bags to make book covers for my school books.  The paper was pretty sturdy so it held up pretty good &#038; you could write all over it &#038; not get in trouble :)  When my kids reached that age, they wanted to buy book covers from the store - thin, stretchy things that didn&#039;t last at all.

Also, I reuse plastic bread bags.  I use them for loaves of my own homemade bread, breading chicken, sending home cookies with the family, etc.  They are very handy for many things.]]></description>
