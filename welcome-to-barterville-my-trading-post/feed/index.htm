@&lt;b&gt;Scott&lt;/b&gt; - I totally want to!  I&#039;ve seen them pop up here and there over the years, but all before I was super interested in &#039;em all. I&#039;ve got my eagle eye out and ready now though, believe you me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[not really anything to barter, but the old banks.....
if you&#039;re ever driving through the middle of nevada, the recorder/assessors office in Goldfield, NV is AMAZING!  It&#039;s an old western bank, and the recorders office is in the vault - they have to turn the huge spindel lock to get in.  The  cashier is behind the old school brass cages. It&#039;s got the wooden paneling &#038; quite a few history plaques &#038; old photos and documents.  You can check out the old deeds from the 1800s in their leather bound ledgers. It&#039;s truly beautiful and worth the awful drive out there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now we&#039;re talking!!  Who&#039;s gonna be my first trade here???  We&#039;re getting closer :)

@&lt;b&gt;Meg&lt;/b&gt; - COOL!!  I don&#039;t know if there are any porches in there off-hand, but as soon as I&#039;m back from the beach I&#039;ll check and let you know ;) I DO remember though not that you mention diecast, that I have a few older cars that are about a foot long too :)  One of them a super cool silver Mercedez sportster or something with doors that raise up like wings!  It&#039;s pretty dope. I used to collect them as a kid and totally forgot about them unti now - so I bet you would like them!  Will you shoot me a reminder about this, and when I&#039;m home I&#039;ll take pictures of them all and email you back?  I bet we can work something cool out :)  Even if I don&#039;t want the foreign coins, it would be nice to know someone&#039;s enjoying the cars a lot more than I would sitting in my basement. Talk soon!
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - You know I&#039;ll be posting more about it later ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt; - Huh. Now that&#039;s something you don&#039;t see every day! Do you have a picture of it anywhere?  Or maybe you can find one by Googling or going to eBay?  I&#039;d LOVE to take a look and go from there :)  Very very interesting, that&#039;s for sure... do you want any of my stuff I&#039;ve already listed, or anything else in particular I could find for you? Or just cash? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;David Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;ll give you credit for it once it&#039;s up ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa@LittleHouseInTheValley&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, it gets kinda weird when only one side is up for bartering, haha... I&#039;m excited to see how this experiment goes though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Randall&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... okay.  How did this post remind you of him?
@&lt;b&gt;Pedro&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, it&#039;s still there baby, don&#039;t you worry about that.  Isn&#039;t one of the traits of minimalism to keep things even anyways?  1 in, 1 out?  I&#039;m not adding anything new here, but only trading to something I like better ;)  And in fact searching for all these treasures in my house has actually gotten me to GET RID OF a lot of stuff too when I come across things I don&#039;t even want anymore.  So minimalim is still going strong!]]></description>
