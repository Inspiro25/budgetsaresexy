					<description><![CDATA[Coffee: I brew it at home, and I&#039;ve cut back, so I don&#039;t need to spend as much on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water: Good ole tap water.  I&#039;m lucky because I live on one of the Great Lakes, so the tap water tastes clean enough to drink on its own :)  No well water here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I save by using coupons!  I can&#039;t give up my coffee so I just buy it on sale with coupons.  My guy likes the Starbucks, Seattle&#039;s best, etc...  but I still find coupons for those too.  I actually gave up pop because it was just too expensive and switched exclusively to coffee.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a huge chai tea latte fan, and Starbucks is one of the best.  I have found that Oregon Chai that I can buy at all the local stores for $4.50 makes 6-8 cups of tea that tastes just as good.  Since I&#039;d already cut back to 3x per week, one box lasts about 2 weeks.  This has saved me a ton over the last year.&lt;br /&gt;mrsaharper(at)hotmail(dot)com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I don&#039;t have access to my coffee pot, and I&#039;m running to class I grab tea instead. I switched from coffee to tea...and with the hot brewed tea I just ask for an additional large water with no ice. Once Ive finished the tea, I pour the cold water into the cup and microwave until hot....two for the price of one, and I feel like I get my moneys worth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My method of saving on coffee wouldn&#039;t work for everyone, but here goes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have regular business travel to Bogota, Colombia. On each trip, I pick up ten to twenty pounds of coffee and bring it back for my family and friends. I used to purchase the Juan Valdez brand for about $10.00 per pound, but have recently switched to a no-name brand that is just as good for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Colombian coffee is the best in the world.]]></description>
