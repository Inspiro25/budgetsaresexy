					<description><![CDATA[Well...since I built a big chunk of my wealth by never owning a car, that would be a tough sell for me.  If I could sell it for the same amount, immediately, I still don&#039;t think it&#039;d be worth the trade-off in productivity and/or the potential productivity that is on the horizon.  Intriguing post though.  Thanks.]]></description>

Haha, yup - always feels really strange (and freeing!) those days you lose or forget your phone somewhere :) It&#039;s very true everyone these days expects fast service 24/7 now too. I get emails all the time from people now who will apologize for &quot;taking so long&quot; in getting back to me when they emailed me back after only 2 hours from me emailing them! 2 hours!! Haha... it&#039;s wild out there.]]></description>

Even with app-apps — I still hold strong. Many of my side hustles basically require it, as does my job. Just because I don&#039;t have the app, doesn&#039;t mean other people don&#039;t. Other people will still have the expectation of instant connection, and it would make my job more difficult, make me less successful at it, and probably lose me freelance clients. Taking the car, even to sell for cash, seems like short-term thinking, even though many on here are taking a long-term approach to the short-term choice (and that&#039;s exactly what I would do if I somehow were awarded a $50,000 car; sell it and invest the money I made). And that&#039;s only projecting the current situation forward, without taking into account yet-unknown advances. 

Thanks for this thought-provoking question! It&#039;s also made me think again about my unease with my connection to my phone...]]></description>

Yeah, though I never had a large one.  I had a 110 camera!  And then I&#039;d get disposable 35mm ones on occasion.  It is just so great not to have to bother with any of that.]]></description>

Whaaaaaa? You can keep FB &quot;Pages&quot; on your phone but not the whole app?? That would actually be pretty helpful to me to update my blog stuff, hmm...

Great thought process!

1) I agree we don&#039;t know what&#039;s around the corner that could be game changing

2) And also agree that cars are typically on the lower priority list

As for what people call &quot;apps&quot; these days, you&#039;re certainly right - most people will lump it all in there just cuz it&#039;s easier to get across, and esp for marketing purposes on the behalves of the companies themselves :) I would say at least 5% of the answers we got in our polling of the 130+ bloggers in fact sent in answers that were not apps themselves! It&#039;s all melting together haha...

(As for this particular question, however - I just mean app-apps that you have to download onto your mobile phone)]]></description>
