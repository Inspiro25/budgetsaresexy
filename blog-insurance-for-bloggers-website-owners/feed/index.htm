					<description><![CDATA[Awesome question J. Money, but the other part of the expense isn&#039;t just the insurance.  You would have to have a valuation of the blog from an attorney that understands Intellectual Property, and then Actuaries would have to create a lifespan and depreciation scale for the blog.  I love the idea of building out these careers that didn&#039;t necessarily exist last week, let alone exist currently.  Congratulations on your ideas for the &#039;J. Money Stimulus plan&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

After reading this post, I thought it would be timely to reach out and let you know that blogger insurance is now available. CalSurance Associates is a professional liability insurance broker that has developed an insurance product specifically for bloggers called BloggerShield<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. http://bloggershield.com/ 

As a blogger, your content and your message are the most valuable components of your business. With increased success and blog visibility comes the vulnerability of having a claim or lawsuit brought against you, leaving both your blog and your personal assets at risk. Bloggers are subject to claims arising out of libel, slander, defamation, copyright infringement, and privacy violation. Regardless of how baseless a claim may be, bloggers, like any other professional, need insurance protection should a claim arise. BloggerShield<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> insurance covers legal fees and other costs associated with liability claims brought against you in the course of your blogging activities. You can learn more about BloggerShield<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> at http://bloggershield.com/. 

Hope this is a helpful resource for all you bloggers looking for insurance!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with you wholeheartedly - an  &quot;out of the box&quot; solution for an online publisher or blogger makes a lot of sense. Cyber Insurance is the closest thing you can get today -- it&#039;s is a group coverages for all kinds of online, computer, and network-related risks.  It&#039;s confusing, to say the least, and every company calls it something different.

Luckily, agents like @JenniferBond above, can customize the coverages you need.. We&#039;ve also also tried to demystify the topic for online publishers by providing an online checklist tool that spits out a list of cyber-related coverages you need for your business.

					<description><![CDATA[HEY! Very cool!!! You are on top of it, baby - I like that :) Appreciate you taking the time to send all this over as it really does help put things into better perspective here - esp since I know close to jack bout how this could even work.  

Currently I have all &quot;extra&quot; things paused for the start of the new year, but I&#039;m gonna save your email and number here (I got emailed this comment so it&#039;s in a safe spot!), and will ping you the second I&#039;m ready to go down this path again. I find it all kinds of fascinating, and if it helps out a ton without costing a ton, I think it would be a great fit.

Thanks again! Good luck on your blogger meetup this week! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m new to finding you - I just searched &quot;blog insurance&quot; and there you were. I&#039;m presenting to a network of bloggers next week about this very topic, specifically, a 360-degree review of what is needed vs what is available for the small business-blogger. I&#039;m a professional insurance nerd who specializes in helping small and start-up businesses including nonprofits. After putting in a few hours to dig last year, I found some options that are pretty smart. I wanted to add my experience to the thread since this is my &quot;bread &#038; butter.&quot;

Obviously the media conglomerates have enough money to self-insure or buy gigantic policies because they most likely have large offices and have a lot of exposure to protect. You are one person, or you&#039;re a small group of people, working from home or coffee shops or shared office centers, and you kick ass at what you do AND you&#039;re running a viable business. Why can&#039;t there be an insurance company that specializes in this? It&#039;s true - it&#039;s a new concept to them. There haven&#039;t been enough relatable court cases to show insurers how costly claims can be, and they haven&#039;t quite grasped how to compare you to similar business categories they already understand. Plus, not enough bloggers have sought it out because society doesn&#039;t yet see them as viable businesses TO insure.

There are Media Liability options out there, with Errors &#038; Omissions (aka Professional Liability), Advertising Injury Liability, Cyber Liability. I have professional bloggers as clients with these types of coverages. In non-insurance-nerd-speak, that all includes coverage to protect you in court for the risk of being an expert in something, saying something another party feels is false or slanderous, data breach, and copyright infringement.

Business Interruption (aka Business Income) coverage is available - it&#039;s a type of Property Insurance. The easiest way I&#039;ve found that you can get this is to first purchase a General Liability policy and then add on the Property - you can also include your laptop, office furniture, other machines &#038; materials that you use in the business.

Though I can&#039;t speak to the retail or wholesale market value of a website, I can tell you that my insurers valued the business risk by comparing the number of viewers to the revenue generated by ad sales to the content, and essentially created their own &quot;rate&quot; to charge. Viewership not only included the blogs, but all social media venues where they exist. Anywhere you exist, you have risk.

I have no hesitation telling you that I would LOVE to work on this for you &#038; anyone else, though I&#039;d even be happy to just keep the discussion going. I work from an office in Fort Collins, Colorado but I have the ability to help people in all states. 800-685-4519, local 970-372-6013. You rock.
