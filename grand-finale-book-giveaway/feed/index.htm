					<description><![CDATA[We would want Book Bundle #2: the Adulting package.

My fiancé and I are in our early thirties, and we already own two of Book Bundle #1. :-) We are engaged and looking to be married this year, and we really like the title &quot;Get a Financial Life&quot;. It just sounds sassy and fun to read. We haven&#039;t read a Suze Orman book yet, though we&#039;ve been looking at her &quot;The Money Class&quot; book. We read financial books together while we&#039;re driving. That&#039;s how we did &quot;Total Money Makeover&quot; and &quot;Automatic Millionaire&quot;. The descriptions on Amazon make it sound like these would be great for reading while driving.

Edit: He says I need to clarify: he drives, and I read out loud -- he doesn&#039;t read and drive at the same time, though now he thinks he has a good idea of how I get through so many books each year. LOL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You talk money and collect it too?  I started my coin collection long ago and glued them to poster board to display as art on my wall.  I have grown from a single 36&quot; x 28&quot; sized frame to multiple frames and continue to collect.  I even spent a coupe paychecks to own a piece of the Saddle Ridge Hoard, that is safely tucked away and not glued to anything.  It might be my retirement plan.  

Thanks for the education into the money spectrum.  I can&#039;t wait to dig through cointhrill.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bundle 3!!!  I have been saving change for AGES and would love to be able to go through my mountains with the education to know if I should just put the coin in the rolls and deposit it at the bank, or keep saving it because it&#039;s worth more than face value. 
I have two kids who will sort with me and get a good education at knowing the value of your assets.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bundle # 2 please. My 19 year old grandson, his girlfriend, and their (surprise!) 7 month old daughter are starting out with help from family. He has already enrolled at the local university (withdrawing from Embrey-Riddle with a significant scholarship was his choice), is working fulltime and learning to be a Dad! He and his girlfriend were thrown into &quot;adulting&quot; before either anticipated, but are making good decisions, The finance for young folks books would help them see things from a perspective other than &quot;geezer&quot; grandparents, although they have been asking appropriate money questions and seem to be taking solicited (!) advice to heart. Thanks for your consideration...Grandma/GG]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though I am young , fabulous and somewhat broke (i would love that book) I think I would benefit most from bundle number one. -the classics. To do all of that debt free and on only $25,000 each for a yearly salary? I need that kind of advice. Also there is a suze orman book thrown in for good measure so how can you go wrong?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would chose #1 cause it seems the most relevant for me, but I have to say that the Suze Orman Young Fabulous and Broke book really changed my life when I read it about 14 years ago.  It put me on the road to being financially responsible! Great book.]]></description>
