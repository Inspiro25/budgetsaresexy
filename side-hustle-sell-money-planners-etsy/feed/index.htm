					<description><![CDATA[Love your ideas, I am trying to start my own blog right now, and have an Etsy shop of my own, but am not quite &quot;there&quot; yet.  It is so nice to see someone who is making some extra income from home without interrupting their normal family life!  Thank you very much for the encouragement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a cool side hustle. I have so many goals I&#039;m planning for, I could definitely use one of your planners. I&#039;m old school so I would probably buy one of those printed ones you have. Great job!]]></description>

Yup! I actually just watched this documentary called American Winter, where all these families lost their jobs and are literally having electricity cut off, don&#039;t have money for food, getting evicted,etc... And half of them were &quot;regular&quot; middle-class people too who would have never thought they&#039;d be gong to food banks. Scary stuff... We gotta do our best to save and prepare now to be okay in the future!

Here&#039;s a link to the trailer for it if interested:

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really unique side hustle. It&#039;s cool to see others find hustles that fit their lifestyles and are outside of the &quot;norm&quot; as far as side hustles go. Plus it&#039;s nice that you are able to work when everyone else is in bed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s pretty awesome, Kim.  $200/month is a little more than pocket money in my book!  That&#039;s like a decent vacation with the whole family.  And it sounds like automation makes it take very little time day to day.  

I&#039;ve been doing the automation a little with my blog using IFTTT and Buffer (mostly for Twitter but also facebook).]]></description>
