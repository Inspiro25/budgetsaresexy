Hey Jared! Selecting a CPA is a good topic!  Admittedly, I stumbled across mine from a friend referral. I interviewed a few different firms in the LA area before choosing to go with my current team, but looking back I would have done things a little different.  Great topic, I&#039;ll have a think about a post :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joel, this is great!

I&#039;m planning on filing on my own this year with Turbotax or another, but having started my own business in 2020 with nominal earnings now + future real estate investments, would be great to learn &quot;how to select a CPA&quot;.]]></description>

Awesome to hear you&#039;re still hustling after FI!  Scannable is an awesome app for turning docs into PDFs! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Things were generally simple for us when we both worked.  But now that we are early retired, I feel that tax organization is going to be more complicated.  I&#039;ve got 1099s now for contract work and have to keep track of all my expenses for the work.  And we&#039;re just getting ready to jump into bank account bonuses, so I know those 1099-INT forms are going to multiply quickly.  We&#039;ve usually made sure to print everything out and keep in a folder in our office, but haven&#039;t done a good job of keeping everything online in a standard place.  So thanks for the encouragement to put all documents in the cloud!

Happy New Year!]]></description>

Cheers Wil! One year I waited until September to file all my taxes. I spent 9 months of the year feeling bad and annoyed about taxes (Jan-Sep), then only 3 months feeling good that it was over (Oct-Dec). How silly of me.  Now I do the opposite. The latest I try and file is March if I have delayed documents. Then I spend the rest of the year relaxing and enjoying not thinking about it. :)]]></description>

Awesome! Yeah the attitude step is always my biggest #1 when doing unpleasant tasks. Finding ways to make it fun, interesting, and seeing the good side always helps me speed up the process :)

Cheers Simone, happy new year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year, Joel!

I thought “check yo’ attitude” was step number one. Lol. I’ve been working in reverse order because I went from super organized to scrambling the past couple years. 

Like that tax doc tracker. I will be implementing that to hopefully get me back on track. 

Thanks, Joel!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joel, Taxes a subject no one can avoid. 
Thanks for a helpful post, lightening the job of dealing with this delicate subject.
I love what you say about “attitude towards taxes”. This whole paragraph lays it all out, right there: The more positive you think, the less painful it will be. The earlier you get your file submitted, the more free time you have to enjoy the year! The better you follow your tax organizer system, the easier it gets every single year going forward.

Great job, Joel.]]></description>
