I found out on a day I was sick a couple of weeks ago in which I worked from home instead, that my set up at home has fewer distractions built in. I had slack on my phone but as I mentioned had my phone turned silent, and no work emails dinging as they come in. Also, no one in real life to distract me. I only worked about 5 1/2 hours because I was sick but got done an amount of work that would have taken me 8-9 hours at the office. I mentioned this to my boss and how it worked out that way at a past employer too, when out office flooded, hoping to plant a seed of the idea. Instead, she instantly said &quot;oh yeah, if you want to carve out a morning sometimes where you work from home instead of the office, go for it.&quot; Woohoo! But it also made me look at how I can keep my office environment a little more distraction free. 

I would say you are getting famous, J! I also like that you take the time to respond to people on here - it&#039;s kept me a loyal reader for sure. But it&#039;s a really good idea to keep that stuff bunched up in blocks. I try to do the same.]]></description>

Good plan :) Walking also slows down time a lot more and allows you to think/reflect on things! Like life and goals and happiness!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Going to have to give myself between D and F on all.  A lot of room for improvement.  In mid-Aug had started a 100 day challenge that required at least one 30 minute walk each day.  Got up to day 56 before I got off track (travelled and got to destination late and just forgot about it).  Might be easier for me to start back with that - just really need to get it done early.  I drink water, coffee, tea, milk and occasionally soda - definitely need to cut some of that out.  So maybe tomorrow I&#039;ll start back to taking at least one walk a day and eliminate at least the soda and tea (sweet tea that it).]]></description>

YES!!! TRY IT!!! Or if it&#039;s too hard, just get into bed *earlier* so by the time your obsession is over it&#039;s still pretty early, haha... (Although I find it&#039;ll still keep you up longer as screens mess with your brain, so maybe try picking up physical books or something else entertaining that can help fill the void before you go to bed? :))]]></description>

ICE CUBES???? 

Haha... No - can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever tried that before (it&#039;s already pretty cold being in the fridge for so long?) but let me give it a shot today and report back ;)]]></description>
