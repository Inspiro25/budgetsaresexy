					<description><![CDATA[I also faced the same situation this thanksgiving day. I went for shopping and when I came home i saw there are two hand mixer in the bag. I bought one, from where did the second one came? Then I realized that the cashier must have put it by mistake as it was a very busy day.  After few days I went to the shop and returned the item, which I have not paid for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I suppose a nice thing to do is give it to charity maybe? I often go Wombling at ASDA (Wallmart) to cash in on their price promise guarantee and I take the shopping I get from the vouchers to a local food bank and homeless charity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The only time I remember this happening to me was at a big-box store, where we had bought a new lamp and lampshade. The lamp base was about $10, the shade was about $15, but because we had put them together in the cart, the cashier only scanned the $10 lamp base and failed to notice there was also a barcode to scan on the lampshade. We didn&#039;t really notice at checkout (we bought a good amount of stuff for our new home that day), so it was only as we were putting the lamp in the trunk of our car that it occurred to us that the total due was a little lower than it maybe should have been.

We took it as the store&#039;s cost of doing business for not training their employees well on scanning lamps, since they have a lot of lamps for sale. But again, that&#039;s also basically the *only* time I can think of that happening to myself or my husband, so we don&#039;t really have a standard philosophy for what to do in that situation. We did talk briefly about what to do at that time, once we figured it out.]]></description>

I&#039;m with you. This has never really happened to me, yet it sounds like it happens all the time at the BudgetsAreSexy household. I&#039;m not sure what kind of stores this keeps happening at, but it seems like the customer or the cashiers need to be more attentive.

The one similar experience I&#039;ve had actually just happened. We bought twelve cans of sardines at Trader Joes, which are about $1.50 each, but when we got to the car we realized we were charged for twelve bananas instead, which are $0.19 each. This was clearly the cashier&#039;s fault, so I drove home guilt-free.]]></description>

Oddly enough we literally just got a guitar tuner in the mail all the way from china (via Amazon) that we didn&#039;t order in the slightest... We don&#039;t even own a guitar! I&#039;m gonna see what the wife is going to do about it as it was all in her name ;)]]></description>

Was not expecting that last part there! Haha... 

But yes - you def.drive home a good point. And I actually agree with you and only wish I could be that perfect :) I will say that the &quot;kids lesson&quot; idea is such a great one that we&#039;ll be implementing it the next time it happens to us as well. I mentioned it in a previous comment above, but now that our kids are old enough it&#039;s a great lesson to share with them and actually turns the annoying experience into a good one! So thanks for chiming in!]]></description>
