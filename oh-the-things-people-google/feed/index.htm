					<description><![CDATA[My blog is a DIY/Craft blog and actually (at least for now) most of my search traffic is searching things sort of related. But there are still a few gems out there!

1. &quot;leave a reply&quot; “spa kit” -&quot;comments closed&quot; -&quot;you must be logged in&quot; -&quot;sign in
2. microwave for 2 minutes
3. define goddessery
4. helens decor
5. 1 shoe

And my absolute favorite:
there was a crooked house placemat clutch (wth! I don&#039;t even know what that means!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love it when you do these posts - they are so funny!  I wish I had some great ones like you do!  The best I could find was &quot;how to tell a woman you want a divorce&quot;.  Maybe I need to start a relationship blog!  

I do get some better ones on my heart health site:

&quot;hard to breath while sleeping stopping alchol&quot;
&quot;i made it to day 30 with no contact&quot;
&quot;is a liter of wine a day too much to drink&quot;

PS:  I can&#039;t wait for the post that you have a new baby!  Hope your wife is feeling great!]]></description>
