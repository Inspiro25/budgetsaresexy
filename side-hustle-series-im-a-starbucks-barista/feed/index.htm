Lora, I think it is awesome that you were so realistic with your situation.  I have recently came across so many people that think they are better than a second job for extra cash!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again &lt;b&gt;Lora&lt;/b&gt; for this insider&#039;s look!  You may have just awakened a few more baristas in this bunch ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Modest Money&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah for sure - a lot of people complain about not having money, but they&#039;re not motivated enough to get out there and DO SOMETHING about it.  You can cut out as much debt and expenses as possible too, but even then you usually need an increased revenue stream to push forward with your goals...  
@&lt;b&gt;Stan&lt;/b&gt; - That is awesome!  BOTH of those side hustles actually.  I bet it&#039;s really nice in the Spring/Fall too when it&#039;s not incredibly hot out and what not (though not sure where you live, of course).  If you ever want to write up a post about either of those and share them with us, shoot me an email okay?  Might be fun reads :) j (at) budgetsaresexy (dot) com
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Oh that sucks!  There are like 15 in a 10 mile radius from me, haha... not to rub it in ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Hermoine&lt;/b&gt; - What&#039;s a &quot;Standardized patient?&quot;  They test things on you? Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Young Professional Finances&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ve always wanted to try being a waiter too :)  There&#039;s something exciting about it I think.  Plus, you get to meet so many new people, ya know?  Is that what you like about it too?  Or you just wanna try something new?
@&lt;b&gt;Squeezer&lt;/b&gt; - Oh I bet that was the opposite of fun, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Marianne&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I know the feeling ;)  It would be nice to be forced into a small schedule again, but only if I can decide to not go in at the last minute if I didn&#039;t want to, haha... so I&#039;m pretty sure it woulnd&#039;t be a good fit for me.
@&lt;b&gt;BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;I think the starbucks atmosphere is what we’d all like to provide our blog readers&quot; YES! Exactly!  Wow... that was excellently said my friend, I&#039;m so tweeting that right now ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - I think you just like trying something new all the time. You have A.D.D. but w/ jobs, haha... but I&#039;m right there in the boat with ya! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone for the great comments!  It sounds like everyone either has great side hustles already or is thinking about it :)

@retirebyforty - I left thanks to a great new job opportunity that doesn&#039;t give me time.  The benefits were great, but I still have them at my new job!
@Andrew and LB - it is true, Starbucks partners enjoy a free pound every week. I had more than I knew what to do with and gave them to friends, so really, you just need to make friends with a barista :)
@Aloysa - the benefits were pretty good, especially since it only required 20 hours a week to be eligible. That was important when I was worried about losing my day job (and benefits).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First Congrats on paying down your debt and earning so much more with a side-hustle.  Now about that free coffee lol.  I saw someones comment asking if there was a pound of free coffee involved, so made me think that maybe I need a new side hustle? hmmm.

I have had so many side hustles/part time jobs, every time I tell someone about one of my jobs it sounds like I had about 1000 since I started working.  It sounds really bad, but oh well, at least I can say I am debt free :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not much of a coffee drinker but the atmosphere at Starbucks is unique.  People seem to love spending hours there as such they become hooked on the environment.  Add in some caffiene to boot and you&#039;ve got a sticky customer base.  I think the starbucks atmosphere is what we&#039;d all like to provide our blog readers.  A place where they want to come and hang out for hours on end.  Great side hustle.]]></description>
