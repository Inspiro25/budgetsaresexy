					<description><![CDATA[Ah yes, the classic mortgage versus investing debate.  I&#039;ve personally taken a hatred towards debt, but that is probably  because we are trying to knock out the remaining balance of my wife&#039;s 401(k) while I just purchased a home.  So I saw my balance sheet get turned upside down compared to my very liquid, investing heavy balance sheet.  That being said, I&#039;m aggressively paying of the high interest rate student debt so that only have a mortgage loan and car loans left. 

That being said, once I only have a mortgage remaining, my decision to invest or pay-down my debt will change drastically. I have a fixed 3.89% mortgage.  As you show, that will become very low in a rising interest rate environment.  Sure I&#039;ll make some extra payments here or there, but I want to play offense and increase my portfolio at that point just as much as I am going to want to play defense and see my debt load decrease.   I hear the peace of mind argument that you suggested in your post, but I will also have peace of mind from a very large portfolio with a fixed rate mortgage that is well below the current interest rate environment.

I&#039;m not clear on what you mean, so are your recommending paying ahead on the mortgage or maxing out tax advantaged space?]]></description>

Yes- I think I just want to get the math cleared out, since everyone talked about how much more money they will earn if they invest instead of pay off the mortgage early, but no one mentioned about if they pay off the house first and put the mortgage money into investment. And I&#039;m glad that you answered! Thanks JMoney. 

PS. We only save $2000 on normal months, although it is always a battle between should we save or should we travel every year---never seem to have enough money, new car, fix the lawn, new carpet...the joy of parenthood and ownership!]]></description>

Yup, owning a home is no joke! I was one of &quot;those&quot; people who only factored in the mortgage when buying our first - and only - house years ago... Home ownership is quite the commitment! :)]]></description>

Haha... I&#039;m glad you&#039;re enjoying it here, man :) And the other blogs too - they&#039;re all great!

I&#039;ll let others chime in with your dilemma up above, but I will say you&#039;re doing a fantastic job to have $2,000 left over every month - that&#039;s great! And any of those options will help grow your net worth so I&#039;m a fan of whichever one excites you the most. That&#039;s the option I always go down when I&#039;m torn between routes - I pick the one that&#039;s most fun for me at the time :) It&#039;s not like you can&#039;t always change routes later too, right?]]></description>

Yup, if you&#039;re not going to be paying off your mortgage you better be using that extra money smartly in other areas! Can&#039;t skip that second part or else you really get yourself into trouble :)]]></description>

Maybe you should try out the loan so you can see both sides of it since you already have one paid off, and then see how you feel? If you love it you&#039;re good, and if you hate it you can just pay it all off in one swoop :)]]></description>

Fascinating to see the contrasts here! Good for you for making moves when you realized a different route would have been better - that&#039;s hard to do!]]></description>
