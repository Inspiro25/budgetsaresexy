					<description><![CDATA[J, I think you aren&#039;t driving the Caddy much.  You might want to look into a battery disconnect switch (about $8-9 on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/Post-Battery-Master-Disconnect-Switch/dp/B001N729FS.)  It takes about 5 minutes to install, longer if you have to find the tool that has gone missing from the tool bag or you battery cables are corroded.

We have a car that we rarely use, and the battery would discharge when sitting.  Now, we pop open the engine and turn the little dial 1/4 of the way to cut the power to the battery when we park it, then do the opposite before starting.  No more dead batteries.

My friends say it is a pain that they wouldn&#039;t deal with.  I say it is a paid off car in good shape and I&#039;m not buying a new one, and if spending any extra 60 seconds is going to push my day over the edge, taking on a huge car payment isn&#039;t going to make my life any better.]]></description>

Yup! All you can do. And if you&#039;re in it for the long haul it&#039;s even BETTER when it goes down now so you can scoop &#039;em all up on the cheap! Though hopefully when we&#039;re all sitting on extra cash to be able to snag them :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugh, our accounts went down around $40,000.  I guess that means we are doing well on the investment/savings side of things but it still can be painful to watch.  I remember the 2008 drop and from the top to the bottom of the market our investment lost about 50% of the value.  We kept course, continued to save, even bought shares around the bottom of the market.  The markets are always a roller coaster but we will once again just keep course and continue to save and invest and maybe even benefit from the market swings.]]></description>
