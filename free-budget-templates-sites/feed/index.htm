					<description><![CDATA[Hey J Money,

Thanks for sharing all these great resources. I&#039;ve been using Personal Capital for months and love their Net Worth Tracker. Before I manually put all this info on a spreadsheet and had to log onto each online account to mark my balance. It updates real time now thanks to the tech. 

I too, have a free budget template and it&#039;d be awesome if you could show it some love on your post. It&#039;s at:  http://www.simplemoneyman.com/free-excel-budget-template/ 

It&#039;s simple to use and flexible to add more columns for months and years and can easily be charted!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a huge YNAB fan!  I&#039;m sad that they no longer offer the $5 monthly option, after the free 34 day trial---only the $50/year option after the free trial.  I&#039;m sorry they no longer offer it, not for myself, but when people are struggling to get control of their finances (like I was when I found YNAB), $50 at one pop can be too much.  It took me a couple months to get through the learning curve and a couple of &#039;trial and error&#039; budgets to get things fine tuned, but I LOVE my YNAB budget.  Anyway, just wanted to make you aware that the &quot;pay as you go&quot; $5/month option is no longer available.]]></description>

weird! not sure what happened there, sorry... will take off the post for now until I can find it. It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve used this exact one so maybe i accidentally deleted during a cleanup? Hope it doesn&#039;t prevent you from starting your own though! should be fairly straightforward in plugging way your own #&#039;s :)]]></description>

Not a problem at all - thanks for passing on the good word!

It&#039;s hard to turn anyone down who has &quot;naked&quot; and &quot;budget&quot; in their blog name anyways ;) Well played, on that!]]></description>
