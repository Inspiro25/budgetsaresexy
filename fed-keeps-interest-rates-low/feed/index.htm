					<description><![CDATA[I cannot believe I missed this post! :(  Anyhow, I&#039;m probably one of the biggest losers in this department because everyone knows I depend on savings accounts.  I do believe I have one of the best savings accounts out there, Costco&#039;s Capital One InterestPlus Online Savings.  I also took advantage of Chase&#039;s two offers of $125 and $150 to open a checking and savings account with them :)

On the other note, I&#039;m kinda looking for a new home and would benefit from low interest rate mortgage...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you and me both ;)  You&#039;ll be saving a butt ton w/ that adjustable though for a bit!!  That&#039;s gotta feel good!
@&lt;b&gt;jesse.anne.o&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, we all have our own &quot;blocks&quot; like that - it&#039;s all good :)  Better to have them than none! That&#039;s when people can get in trouble, haha... I think the bets thing we can do is follow our hearts and brains when it comes to money stuff, as well as others.  If we can stay true to that, we&#039;ll feel pretty good in our lives - even if it&#039;s different than what the others say.  It&#039;s YOUR life, you rock it yo!
@&lt;b&gt;Earn Save Live&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s no joke!! I wonder if we (in America) can invest savings over there??  You think tha&#039;s allowed or something would block that?
@&lt;b&gt;Laura Vanderkam&lt;/b&gt; - Yep - pros and cons to both sides.  At least you lowered that mortgage though, that&#039;s a biggie! I&#039;d love to be able to do it again myself soon, but we&#039;ll see.
@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, you get the short end of that stick I&#039;m afraid, sorry! :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We refinanced our mortgage -- not too long after buying the house, actually -- because interest rates had dropped so low. So that freed up some cash. Of course, the ridiculously low rates of return in many investment vehicles take some of the wind out of my sails on that. I had a CD I got years ago that I keep rolling over and they keep knocking down the interest rate each time. Earning 12% in about 6 years is nothing to write home about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As an American living in Australia, it&#039;s a mixed bag right now.  Our investment properties in the US carry a 5% (fixed) mortgage, a 3% (variable) mortgage, and a 6.8% HELOC; we&#039;re not able to refinance since we don&#039;t have enough equity.

In Australia, our savings account has a 6% return.  (Yes, you read that right!  It&#039;s the UBank account, if you want to check it out).  We&#039;re renting here now, but mortgage rates are several percentage points higher than in the States.  The Aussie dollar is strong though, so we&#039;re snowballing all debt this year and we&#039;ll re-assess where we&#039;re at with everything at the end of 2012.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not so crazy about it.  I have no debt and I&#039;m not in a position to buy real estate right now.

I have no use for the low interest fees and most of my assets are liquid right now so it&#039;s not doing me any favors.

I still haven&#039;t quite figured out how much I would like to keep liquid and how much should be invested.  I have two emergency funds (mine, the cats&#039;) and then a down payment account that won&#039;t get touched any time soon.  That&#039;s probably what should be invested...but I don&#039;t feel comfortable doing that until it&#039;s at a $10k mark (and investing anything above and beyond that $10k).  I don&#039;t know why.  It&#039;s a pretty weird mental block.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We moved to our current location a couple years ago and have an adjustable mortgage, so I&#039;m diggin&#039; it, dude! BUT as soon as I lock in, I want rates to skyrocket so I get some good interest on my savings.

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww 8.35%??  That must have been real nice! And 3.4% ain&#039;t too bad either in comparison to here in the States ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MikeTheRed&lt;/b&gt; - I know, it&#039;s a pretty stupid situation to be in.  I hear people saying all the time that they need to spend money to help the economy but that&#039;s what got us in the trouble to begin with :(  While I ofcourse wish for things to get better overall as a whole, I&#039;ll always be promoting saving as much as you can and making sure YOU are as OK as possible.  If you don&#039;t look out for yourself, who will?
@&lt;b&gt;Elle&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!  A 3% refi would be incredible!  Could you send some positive thoughts this way too? So I can get rid of our 5.5%? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Christopher&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  It&#039;s a perfect time to take advantage of it all while we can!  It&#039;s certainly not gonna remain low forever :)
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s really sucky to hear, I&#039;m sorry :(  I do believe we&#039;re always going through phases in life though, and once this one gets better it&#039;ll be a nice phase for a while until it gets bad again ;)  It was a nasty economy when I left college as well, but after a while it got better and you just adjust as best you can throughout it all.  In theory you&#039;re making the least amount of money you ever will for the rest of your life, so think about that to make you feel better! Haha... you should always be going up from here :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Well, that&#039;s one opinion of it all for sure ;)  I don&#039;t know enough to argue with you one way or the other, but I will agree that it is hurting those about to retire for sure.  And those in retirement as well :(  That&#039;s the really shitty part about it all (besides those unemployed, etc).  There are tons of problems with the economy right now, but also tons of opportunity as well for others.  I&#039;m sure not too far off in the future we&#039;ll be blogging about how crazy high the interest rate is and all that&#039;s bad because of it too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re playing the game to your advantage, it&#039;s smart!
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, that&#039;s pretty significant!
@&lt;b&gt;Jerret&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that&#039;s pretty cool ;)  And I agree on the interest, mine never used to accumulate much either ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Money Infant&lt;/b&gt; - Sucky!!  I didn&#039;t even think of that, man, good info to bring up.  I hope things get better for you over there! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it&#039;s never good 100% one way or the other ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - Wow 50% is no joke!  Sorry to hear :(  Def. smart on the CD route though, I should probably do that with my bulk savings as well, as it&#039;s not getting anything NEAR that... I hope you get that refi in too!!  That would help out :)
@&lt;b&gt;BE @ BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh there you go!  It&#039;s always good to be ready to jump on opportunities as they come up, I like it :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - I hope so too :)
@&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I take all kinds of money so I&#039;d be nice and happy with more dividends too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - I hope you two find your dream home brother!  Keep me updated, okay?
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!!  Pay it off baby, you&#039;ll be sooooo much better off in the future - woo!
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff&lt;/b&gt; - Or into good mutual funds/stocks ;)  Though obviously still risky.
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - I don&#039;t think it&#039;s selfish because there&#039;s nothing you can do about it anyways ;)  You&#039;d have plenty of other things to take advantage of too even with the rates going up!  So I think as long as you&#039;re always doing that - making the best of any situation - you&#039;re on the right path.  There&#039;s nothing wrong making sure #1 is being taken care of - you have to have your own back! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  That&#039;s a def. pro to the current situation - gives lots of people a different kind of opportunity.
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ SimpleIslandLiving&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhh $600K?? Man.  I knew it was expensive but jeez... 
@&lt;b&gt;Ten Bob Millionaire&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, amen to that!  USAA is totally taking care of us right now ;)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Yep!  Take advantage of what you can, and do your best to limit all of the cons.
@&lt;b&gt;Kristin&lt;/b&gt; - Geeeez, isn&#039;t that something? I remember checking my kids&#039; book too to see how much more money I had accumulated growing up - was so much fun!! :) And honestly, still is! Haha.. just now w/ the internet ;)]]></description>
