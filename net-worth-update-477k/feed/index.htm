yeah, I just throw it all in my savings account with USAA where all my other accounts are. It&#039;s probably not the highest interest, but I&#039;m not one to yield chase just to earn a few more pennies. I&#039;m totally cool leaving the $$ as is and ready to be accessed anytime I need it. Which is the point of these types of funds, really. Once I decided I was okay with it I just started focusing more on where all my *other* money is to make sure those are growing nice and sexily since they&#039;ll be there for the long haul. 

I think a better question to ask yourself is *how much*  you need/want put aside like that to make you comfortable. Some are good with $1,000 and others need $100,000. But once you find that #, regardless of what it is, just cap it off and divert all the rest into the wealth game. Sure you could make a few more bucks if more of your cash is invested, but focus on the goals for each of the accounts. Cash on the side for emergencies/rainy day/etc shouldn&#039;t be handled the same way as the other departments.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What do you do with your cash savings? Do you just put it into a high yield savings? 

For the first time I have $40k cash, which I want to hang on to in a fluid state. I hate the idea of a 1% return but equally don&#039;t like the idea of investing it at potentially &quot;peak market&quot;. I have $125k in 401k and an investment property. Kind of rambling, but anyway, was just curious.]]></description>

yes indeed, J. Nizzle - very smart for sure. unfortunately the last two times I tried we were told we&#039;d have to bring $90k to the table to do so cuz we were underwater (not anymore, but still not much equity) so it wasn&#039;t worth it. And we&#039;ve already gone through one of the gov&#039;t programs a few years back which disqualifies us for another. We used to have a 6.875% interest-only loan! So we did improve, but nowhere near your sexy 3.625 :) Congrats on that!]]></description>

Yup - they def. do. I don&#039;t worry much about the diversification cuz most companies ARE global too and doing business, but perhaps I&#039;m missing something?]]></description>

Great job. We&#039;ve been tracking our net worth for the past 4 years and understand what you mean when you say that you don&#039;t even pay attention when it goes up or down anymore. We feel the same, the upward long term trend is what&#039;s important.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad to see your numbers are continuing to grow as usual. Also glad to see you&#039;re still happy with your &quot;one fund to rule them all&quot; investment strategy. I&#039;m shifting towards a similar lazy-man approach by using Wealthsimple to do all the work for me (the Canadian version of things like Betterment). Fees are a bit higher up here in the great white north (.35%-.5%), but I suspect that&#039;s partly to do with the fact that most of the investments are in the US/Foreign markets. Still a relatively small price to pay, especially compared to mutual funds and such. The best part is it covers all my transaction fees, and there&#039;s no contribution minimums, so I can continuously dump money into it whenever I can, which I love since I hate having idle cash just sitting there... staring at me wishing it had a greater purpose in life besides earning me 1% interest. haha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J Money.

With mortgage rates where they are, have you recently thought of refinancing again?  At 5.5% I know you can save big.  We are in the process of moving and we are looking at 3.625% on our loan. 

Just a thought to help your hustle.]]></description>
