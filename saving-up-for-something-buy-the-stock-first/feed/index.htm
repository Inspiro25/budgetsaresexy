					<description><![CDATA[My dad did this for us back in the 70s.....and no, none of us got rich off of it.  While it was neat to open the newspaper and read the stock prices, none of us kids really appreciated what he had done for us at the time.  None of us wanted to fork over our hard-earned babysitting $$ for this either - there were records to buy!  Ha! 
I received one share each of:
 - Standard Brands Paint - belly-up, now long gone
 - American Airlines - split to 2 shares, and then the company cancelled my stock (bought out by....?)
 - Abbott Labs - Now about 25 shares, courtesy of dividend reinvestment.  I still own it.  Since they&#039;re a drug co, I guess this could be considered a &quot;deferred purchase&quot;? I&#039;m not there yet! Ha!  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do something similar. I’d love a Tesla but instead I bought stock and I’m bidding my time till I can buy one of their cars second hand. Can’t see myself spending 30-100k on a car.

Yeah, the idea is that once you&#039;ve &quot;saved&quot; enough you&#039;d then change your mind and hold onto the stocks in a perfect world, but even if you only did that half the time you&#039;d still come away with extra assets in the end... regardless of how they performed (though you would have to deal with reporting it all on taxes at the end of the year which would be annoying...)]]></description>

True true, but not everyone is as obsessed with index funds as we are OR even investing ;) If this gets them more excited about it then I&#039;m all for it... Especially since it&#039;s already money allocated to be *spent!*]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is....stupid. This would double the cost of whatever item you want. Unless you are advocating buying the stock and holding it short term, then selling it to get your item. But then, stocks are incredibly volatile over the short term, so odds are good you&#039;d lose money.]]></description>
