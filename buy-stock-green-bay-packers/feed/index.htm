					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The Packers intend initially to offer up to 250,000 shares of Common Stock in the Offering, but the Packers have the authority to offer up to 880,000 shares of Common Stock and reserve the right to increase the size of the Offering at any time without further notice.&quot;

You know, there are going to be a quarter million shares, or a million, or infinity. Whichever&#039;s more. ;)

I think I&#039;m going to print off a bunch of certificates that allow people to own a part of me. But this shouldn&#039;t be construed as &quot;owning&quot; me in the common sense of the term. It should only be construed as owning me in the sense of buying a piece of paper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up in Green Bay and my dad owns stock from when they sold some in the 90&#039;s (he also has some Frozen Tundra from the old stadium in his freezer - gotta keep it cold!). It&#039;s not about making money; it&#039;s about contributing to the team and the town. As a stockholder, you do get invited to a shareholders meeting and you get updates in the mail. Plus, last year when they won the Super Bowl, shareholders had the option to buy a Super Bowl ring since they own a part of the team. My dad was a bit miffed the ring said &quot;shareholder&quot; instead of &quot;owner,&quot; but still - what other team and what other fans have the option to have their very own Super Bowl ring?

When the Packers win, people come to Green Bay and spend money, which gets recirculated into the city through the people who own and work for hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, and yes, the Packers as an organization (everybody knows somebody who works there). And if that&#039;s not enough reason to be a fan, then I don&#039;t know what is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since I grew up near Green Bay and am a die hard Packer fan, I do think it would be cool to own a share. If anyone ever asks what I do, I could just say I&#039;m a partial owner of an NFL team :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally may buy a piece of stock in the Packers.  I think it is great that they raise money this way rather than increasing the price of concessions or parking or many of the other things that privately owned teams do.  

Yeah, it isn&#039;t stock in the sense that you will gain any money on it, but if it&#039;ll help this team add more seats to their stadium (which I had the pleasure of visiting last year) I just may do it.  Green Bay as a town doesn&#039;t have much to offer (it&#039;s a ghost town on non game days) but when the Pack is in town, you can just feel the pride that the City of Green Bay has in the THEIR team.

Which is what may set me over the edge to spend the money.  Even if the only thing I may get out of it is a piece of paper, and like Rachael said, maybe it&#039;ll bring me that much closer to season tickets. (But probably not because people will those things down generations and generations and families hardly ever give them up!)]]></description>
