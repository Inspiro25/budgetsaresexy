					<description><![CDATA[Aww, I&#039;m so sorry.  That&#039;s always tough.  One of the most draining parts of my job is seeing grieving owners (I&#039;m a veterinary technician).  We get so attached to our pets and it is so hard to say goodbye.  Many people have their pets cremated, sometimes with a collar, blanket, bed, and/or toy.  Other times, they just want the blanket/toy kept with the pet until the cremation occurs.

@Aloysa - If the owner does not want the ashes returned, multiple pets can be cremated together.  If an owner would like their pet&#039;s ashes returned, that pet has to be cremated separately, which then takes a different amount of time, hence the extra cost.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup! We *just* got our little guy back too, and it feels sooooooooo much better seeing him back at home again!  I thought it would be creepy, but it&#039;s totally not - more soothing than anything if you can believe that.  And the box is beautiful and even came with his paw print on part of it :)  So glad we went this route!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry for your loss.  I have two senior dogs, and I get sad just thinking about when their time comes.  I definitely believe in pet heaven, too!

I think you&#039;re right about the price difference between options #2 and #3.  For shelter (i.e., unowned) animals, they are all cremated together.  Option #3 would require that they cremate your pet separately.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So sorry about this loss. :( Totally get where you&#039;re coming from. I had a dog who was really dear to me die five years ago and my family and I decided to go with the third option, too. We even cremated him with his favorite toy. I tell myself he&#039;s in a better place chasing cats and eating greenies. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all of this, everyone. It means a lot from each and every one of you - I&#039;m lucky to be surrounded by so many awesome people.  Thank you so so much.

@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Kathy :) I&#039;m sorry to hear about your loss too with your precious one - I&#039;m glad we were all blessed though!
@&lt;b&gt;Kelli&lt;/b&gt; - Aww, thanks.  Bob is hanging out with your dog as we speak! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m glad she&#039;s still rockin&#039; and rollin&#039; over there! Soak up every day you have with her :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kerry&lt;/b&gt; - That is such an awesome poem!!! Thank you for sharing it with me, I had never read it before :)  Going right now to email it to my wife! She&#039;ll love it!! (and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll make her tear a little bit too :()
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, I love horses :(  I rode one for the first time last year - such beautiful animals!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks LB.  That&#039;s actually one of the next areas I&#039;d like to try living one day - in the country.  So you have more free reign over stuff, and it&#039;s totally peaceful. May both our cats be alive and well in the heavens! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bryan at Pinch that Penny!&lt;/b&gt; - Amen brotha.  The circle of life...
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww well that&#039;s good!!!  Keep telling her and showering her - you know she loves every minute of it too :)
@&lt;b&gt;DC&lt;/b&gt; - WOW, 19?  That&#039;s incredible man.  I hope he/she keeps on going and your wife appreciates her every day! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, no - had nothing to do with our pet sitter ;) They were both just really really old and became just a bad coincidence there... although I will say our pet sitter didn&#039;t do a great job of breaking the news to us. It was her first time dealing with something like this, and it came out pretty bad :(
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - That sounds beautiful :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ornella&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Ornella, hope to see you soon :)
@&lt;b&gt;Shane C&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m glad :)  And I hope he has a ton of years left in this world with you too!
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, good!  I like that idea of putting him in a few different places, that&#039;s kinda cool :)  Ours was an indoor cat, but there are a ton of sunny areas we could place him throughout our community... that was his favorite thing to do - lie in the sun and soak it all up.
@&lt;b&gt;Chet&lt;/b&gt; - Oh no!  Sorry to hear, man :(  They&#039;re both on the heavenly adventure together - I bet they become friends :) (Did your dog like cats?? Hehe...)
@&lt;b&gt;Andi B.&lt;/b&gt; - That is nice :)  We ended up saying bye to our boy at the vet too (which was really REALLY freaky - he kept looking like he was still breathing!) but we still wanted to take him home after too... we&#039;ll see how we feel once it&#039;s more &quot;real&quot; when we go to pick up his ashes :(
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - I hope Miss Doxie hangs in there for you guys!  Beautiful name! :)
@&lt;b&gt;David Hunter&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I wonder if that&#039;s an option? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, amen sista.  I think I might print it and frame that poem too if the Mrs tells me she likes it (I&#039;d never heard of it until you guys started posting about it here).  And we&#039;re right up there with birth control and pro-gay marriage too ;) So I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll see you in the same place above too! Hehe...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aww, I am so sorry for your loss :-(  

We went with option #3 when we had to put our family dog down, nearly 10 years ago.  For the longest time we had a &quot;Rosie shrine&quot; in the spare bedroom: the box with her ashes, and next to it was her favorite teddy bear (yes, my dog had a favorite teddy bear), which had her collar around its neck.  Eventually my mom moved the box to a drawer inside the dresser, but she never buried it or scattered the ashes or anything.

My current dog, Elvis, is still relatively young (six years old) and healthy, and I don&#039;t even want to think about how awful it will be to say goodbye to him.  I have a hard enough time saying goodbye to my little rats, and they typically only live 2-3 years!  Even as an animal lover, I used to be totally snarky about that &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; poem (it just seemed so CHEESY!), but when I had to take my first rat to be put down nearly 4 years ago, the room had a framed copy of that poem and I just completely lost it and started sobbing.  I don&#039;t care if it makes me a bad Catholic (hell, I already am a bad Catholic, what with being in favor of using birth control and being pro-gay marriage!), but I totally believe that if there&#039;s an afterlife, I&#039;ll be greeted by a stampede of all the wonderful pets I&#039;ve had over the years, and I bet Bob&#039;s up there hanging out with them now, too. :-)]]></description>
