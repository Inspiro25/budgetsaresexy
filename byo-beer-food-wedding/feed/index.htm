					<description><![CDATA[Our wedding was $2500 for everything from church to reception and gifts.  We were blessed to have the reception at a relative&#039;s home, the food and cake came from an upscale grocery store and the soda and booze was delivered by a liquor store.  No fuss, lots of fun.  The partyers went to the hotel we were staying at because they had a wonderful disco bar.  No cost for music or space.  There were two other bridal parties there already.  Lots of fun.  No debt.   Hubby was in college, and I was supporting him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Number 5 made me laugh. i&#039;ve been to a Halloween wedding. No costumes, but the bride wore a really pretty black Victorian gown, and there were pumpkins on all the tables, etc. my own wedding was a masquerade ball, (masks not costumes, just to be clear). It was pretty fantastic. We entered the reception to phantom of the opera. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well that&#039;s neat!  I don&#039;t know many other countries who DO celebrate Halloween, but if you were ever in the States on your anniversary you can celebrate in style with all of  us! Haha... thanks for stopping by :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I did get married on Halloween but here in Australia we don&#039;t really celebrate Halloween so we didn&#039;t even realise when we booked it. We did have one of DH&#039;s cousins read a poem they had written called Ode to the Halloween Wedding, it was hilarious. 

1. Not a problem. I am all for relaxed weddings.
2. I have given up the grog so not a problem. I rarely drank before I gave it up anyway.
3. I understand if it is some random but would be a bit miffed if I couldn&#039;t bring Hubby. 
4. No talking! Impossible.
5. Any themed wedding would be cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dream wedding would be either a) to elope or b) a Halloween themed wedding. I&#039;d bake a carrot cake and decorate it all halloween-y and there would be black and orange everywhere with candy party-favours. I would be dressed as a witch and my guests would need to be in costume.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pretty coincidental that you bring up a Halloween themed wedding! Just last night I watched a show on Netflix called Bridezillas, a reality series, and the first episode was about a Halloween wedding. Twilight zone!]]></description>
