					<description><![CDATA[Right now I see the value of any lessons learned and personal growth to be far more valuable than making a penny from the blog.  If by chance it winds up generating any sort of revenue, well, that&#039;s just delicious butter icing on the cake. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know it! Go and start one up - at the very least you&#039;ll start keeping yourself accountable and probably learn a $hit ton in the process :) I wrote this post over SIX YEARS ago and now I do it full-time for a living - so you never know what types of opportunities may come too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After reading Budgets Are Sexy (and other PF blogs) off and on over the past year I realized I never did check out your beginnings.  I plan to start my own blog of some sort so to keep motivated I&#039;m taking a peek at the childhood of one of my most frequently visited blogs.

As this article says, I&#039;m in need of a plan.  Not just a plan for my finances, but for life in general.  Keeping my thoughts bouncing around in my head leads nowhere. Time for me to open the word processor and mash away at the keyboard.  I say, what better way to get on the path I want than putting up the truth from where I can&#039;t hide?

Anyways, your style here is awesome.  It definitely inspires me to put my self out there.]]></description>
