Hah - that&#039;s just cheating right there! ;)

Reminds me though of when you could by up $1 coins from the mint using credit cards to rack up the rewards, and then bringing them straight to the bank to deposit. It was all the rage in the blogging world back then, but shortly there after it was cut off.

Anyways, glad you had better luck than I did with rolls!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J,

i did the coin box thing back in 2009 with 4 banks and 4 boxes per bank.

i just cut a vertical slice in the roll with a razor to look at the cross section of the roll and pulled out any silver half dollars and replaced with a normal half. took about 14 min a box all up. it was good pickings for about a year until my banks wouldnt let me return them back to them anymore and i did notice the silver coins were less and less.   i think maybe they started culling out the silver before rolling( just a guess).  Anyway it seemed like a good game back then. Glad to see someone else figured it out as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah....Chase bank has been eyeballin me over asking for rolls of halves or any Ike dollars they might have. 
I think its a completely JOKE that the mint makes these damned Presidential dollars and then you have to pay some outrageous premium from them if you plan on collecting them.
Why?
Because Chase and other banks make it impossible to just go in and casually buy $100 worth of dollar rolls to go thru. 
They act like its more work...it isnt. They fill out the same damned slip for the withdrawal but give me my money in rolls of coins instead of a few bills.....boo-@#$%in-hoo...its not like they have to shut down the @#$in bank for an hour while they count out my money.

Now when i call ANY Chase branch if I ask for half dollars or BIG dollar rolls they immediately say the &#039;dont have any&#039; without even LOOKING....damn man...at least PRETEND to go to the back and look for MY sake.....K?

So I figure I give up on that and just try to get some Susan B&#039;s for some emergency coinage instead...just for amusement since theyve ruined the silver hunting for me.
But theyre catching on that Im buying rolls of dollar coins, removing the Susan B&#039;s and bringing back the others....as if THAT is ruining their business day or something.

Not even the coin shops around here know where a good source of even Susan B&#039;s would be. Thats pretty damned telling.]]></description>

Hah - yeah, much harder to find pre 1947 for sure :) I&#039;ve actually found two dimes in the past year w/ silver in it here in the States, but still pretty rare to come across. They&#039;re def. still out there though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to look for the pre 1947 silver in UK coinage and never found any, the time to look was probably before they announced they were stopping and the time to give up was probably the same year. Now fifty years later - no chance and I never believed the unsorted roll tag, maybe not sorted by the seller?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Omgosh, you are so right about the daycare double dipping! I work child care and have for the past 14 years. But I realized that I was getting paid by the hour no benefits, , so when I was sick, no pay…but if kids were sick, they still paid…so my paycheck was still being made! I hope to change that one day, somehow!]]></description>

DC area! I thought that cost was expensive? I did get fees waved going through AAA, but aren&#039;t batteries usually like $40 or something? I just don&#039;t know much about installing and all that so I&#039;m always happy to pay to have it done properly.]]></description>
