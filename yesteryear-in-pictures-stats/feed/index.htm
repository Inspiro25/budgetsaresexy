Yeah, I have no idea to be honest with you. I often wonder what would happen if I scaled back to 3 posts a week, and I don&#039;t think it would crash and burn or anything, haha... I&#039;m just afraid that I&#039;ll start getting lazy and then dwindle down to two a week, then one, then trail off... I say if you&#039;re happy at 3 then stick with it. Especially if you&#039;re using that extra time to market/promote your site. If you go to 4 posts will you still be able to do that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J - Nice job on he 350 posts! I think I was around 180.

Thoughts on me writing more to boost traffic? Or conversely you writing less?

I&#039;m at a cross roads whether to increase output from 3 a week to 4 a week. I like the two day air-time of a post, but I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am new to your site... and so far I am intriguid! I love how you put pictures up instead of just saying what the post was ,very clever. The diary form of blogging is something that frankly I never thought about and I am interested! Going to go to check out the rest of your blog now.
ps- your baby is adorable]]></description>

LOL. A stage manager... working with the dead would&#039;ve been a way easier career path, I think. 

Although I also thought being a grave digger would be awesome too for a good stretch in elementary school. Too many Goosebumps books for this kid.]]></description>
