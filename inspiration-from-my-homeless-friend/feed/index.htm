					<description><![CDATA[Woah, really?  You know him??? That is awesome.  He IS so inspiring - I really miss him.  It&#039;s been about a year since I last saw him, and when we spoke it turned out he had HIV I wanna say :( Poor guy.... was going back and forth visiting his parents, and then winter hit and he disappears.  I&#039;m hoping he&#039;s still doing his thing with the painting though!  he is good :)  I&#039;m sure he&#039;s still out there now w/ the decent weather, I just no longer work downtown anymore so I don&#039;t know.

Thx for reminding me of this post - made me happy :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friends and I met Carlton last August (2010) in Dupont Circle, and he inspired all of us with his talent and his amazingly positive attitude. I have not seen him since, and I would love to talk to him again. Do you know of any way in which we could contact him?

Thanks,
Sophia]]></description>
