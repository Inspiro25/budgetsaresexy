					<description><![CDATA[I think my one is eating my meals and not leaving even one rice grain or eating chicken so that there is no meat left only the bone.  The idea being that we should not waste abdundance given to us.  It makes me think twice when I buy stuff will I actually use it or will it end up as something lying around the house.  It has made me become a person who hates any type of wastage e.g. like squeeze the last bit of toothpaste or not letting the water run while brushing your teeth.]]></description>

Haha!!! This is probably my husband&#039;s #1 motivation for continuing to close the toilet lid, too.  His mother never let her sons leave the seat up due to the potential for the next person to fall in.  But toilets can also spray urine and fecal matter up to 20ft away, so I can&#039;t even stand the lid up!  The few times in our 20yrs together that I have caught the toilet lid open he has legit watched me rip the towels off the rack and go on about how gross that is and that I&#039;m not wiping my face or hands on feces covered towels.  It&#039;s one of my biggest pet peeves, and fortunately he is really good about the lid.  I try to return the favor when he has a pet peeve.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a chemical engineer I didn’t understand a single sentence in this post, in fact it all made my head hurt.  I close the lid on the toilet because I’m afraid of my wife, period.  Yesterday I noticed that my wife had hung up some pictures of places in the world we have vacationed on the wall right beside the recliner I often read in, they’ve been there about a year, I had never noticed them.  I’m going to go look for a post with spreadsheets in it now.]]></description>

Haha yup... Whatever it takes sometimes :) And most feng shui stuff doesn&#039;t really cost money, does it? Putting things in certain order and keeping areas free of messes/stuff? in fact, probably saves you more over time!]]></description>

SO COOL!!!

Look for the coins pre 1960s as a lot of them were made of silver and worth some decent money - even international ones.]]></description>
