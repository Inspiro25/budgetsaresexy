					<description><![CDATA[I keep the bare minimum and it’s usually down to less than 100 right before I get paid. I try to figure out my budget to the penny ahead of time and I’ve gotten good at it. I take 50% of my income, invest it right away, and pretend it doesn’t exist. Treat each day like I’m starting over at $0 and challenge myself to hit 1k]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have $2,000 in our checking account in order to get the account free. Otherwise, every dime that comes in immediately goes to online savings account (for short-term) or to Vanguard. I probably over-optimize but, hey, everyone has their vices :)]]></description>

Rural Iowa. We love when local banks compete. They do a lot for the community...hosting tailgates for high school, handing out ice cream at Little League games. It&#039;s a great place to live and earn interest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As for the main checking account...a few hundred bucks. Certainly by design. In my financial system, I use a total of 7 accounts (combo of checking and savings). The main checking is used for day to day expenses, such as gas and food (and maybe a few PF books :-)  ). No need to keep a bunch of money in there. I used to freak out when I had $100 of less in my checking account, but with the system I now use, having less than $100 right before payday is a good thing...it means funds were allocated appropriately :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually keep up to $10K in my checking amount and since we have our paychecks deposited into there I usually transfer money to my savings account or one of my investment accounts if it goes over $10K.  Don&#039;t want to have too much in there because like you said your getting that I&#039;m not getting much of return. 
And the money in the checking account goes in and out.  Along with the paychecks, we use it to pay our bills and rent.  So it&#039;s pretty much standard use for a checking account.]]></description>
