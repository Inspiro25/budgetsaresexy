True! And if I invest all these cents in a Roth IRA... Then I could possibly avoid $2-3 in capital gains tax!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joel! Thank you for the article on being content with what we have, and being appreciative of the small things in life. I especially liked the comments on being just as happy with your older Prius as you would be with a Tesla! My wife really wants a new vehicle, but since we have 2 kids and another on the way, we need something bigger. We already have a 2012 GMC Acadia that seats 7 and is plenty big. We have had to make some repairs, but its paid off fully. A new van or SUV can be $40K+ easily.

A few months ago, we ended up needing to rent a van. We got a 2021 Pacifica Liimited, with an MSRP of $45k! At first, it felt really good to drive that brand new van, but after a few days that feeling wore off. I was just as sick of that van as I would be any other vehicle.

I think I am now actually HAPPIER driving the used Acadia because I know that every month it only takes me an hour or two of work to keep it operational, while a new car would represent a derailment on my journey to FIRE!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well you know, with that initial 3 cent investment, and if you can find an additional three cents each month, compounded annually at a conservative 7%--you&#039;ll have more than $20 in just 24 years!

Yes, if you find $20 on the ground, just put it back... and then text me the exact location and I&#039;ll take care of it from there :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never saw it like that.. It&#039;s smart to look for opportunities where your input is 1 but your output is 20. You don&#039;t want your input to be 10 while your output is 11! This post is inspiring me to look for avenues on inefficiencies. Hmm..

So the moral of the story is.... Finding 3 cents on the ground feels better than finding $20 on the ground from an efficiency standpoint ;) If I see a $20 on the ground next time, I should put it back on the ground just because of how inefficient it is! Just kidding!]]></description>

I get what you mean about having fun at breweries!  I really like the games nights -- trivia and bingo are always fun :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[3¢ is still money and if it makes you happy, more power to you! As for craft beer, I get little enjoyment out of it in my backyard. For me it is about the rarity of enjoying it - maybe once a month - and the excitement of what the rotating list now features. Plus, I exclusively meet friends at the brewery, adding fondness to the memories. As for cars, my decade old Honda Fit is more than exhilarating enough for me as I am not a car person and could never wrap my head around spending a years salary on a fancy vehicle.]]></description>
