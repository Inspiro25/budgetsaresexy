Yup, and if your stomach can&#039;t handle the turmoil then it&#039;s perfectly fine to invest *elsewhere* too! Either temporarily or long term depending on how easy it is for you to sleep at night...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What occurred to me was that the market has been rising for most of the time since the March &#039;09 bottom. And that those who entered the market  since, have only seen the market go up. (Not true, 2018 S&#038;P was down 4.41%, but that&#039;s nothing after a 22% up year. 

Hopefully, it won&#039;t scare them out of the market long term. 

My end of Feb spreadsheet shows down 7% YTD, which includes the 2 month&#039;s spending. FIRE or any flavor of R, had better include the right mix to get you through the ups and downs. 
We are in interesting times right now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too was surprised with how much my accounts went down, it wasn&#039;t nearly as bad as I thought!

I selfishly didn&#039;t mind the market drop as it coincided with the week I deposited $6k into my Roth IRA for 2019 after finishing my taxes (I&#039;m always a year behind in contributions because I&#039;m nearing/in that phase out AGI range so I don&#039;t want to risk anything. I need to figure out a backdoor IRA but it makes my head hurt so this is my compromise for now until I fully phase out haha) so I was able to buy things on sale! Woo woo!

But then again, I&#039;m 30 and have many years ahead of me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I keep seeing &quot;should you panic / is it time to panic&quot; type of headlines and I&#039;m puzzled because is it ever time to panic? No, panic never helped anyone! 

I have put myself on a weekly investing schedule this year since last year&#039;s experiment with lump sum investing told me that I decided that I&#039;m terrible at it, and I&#039;m sticking to it! Whatever the market does.]]></description>

It was somewhat happenstance how it occurred that way. I had started doing my NW updates back in 2013 after reading your blog for a little while. The very first one I did was on May 18th of that year. I got a pretty substantial backpay check a few days afterwards, and did my NW update again. That was on the 23rd of the month. I decided to keep going with it then, since that&#039;s my birthday in Dec. :D]]></description>
