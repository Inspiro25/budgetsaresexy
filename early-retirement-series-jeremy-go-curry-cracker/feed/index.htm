					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeremy...  Congrats!  Amazing story!  If you&#039;re willing to say....  when you retired at ages 38 and 33 how much total did you have put away at that point?  You mentioned you were expecting $3MM in income over the next 30 years, so I&#039;m guessing you had socked away about $1.5MM?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know, US tax law is very kind to retirees, especially ones that retire young. There are several ways to get funds out of the 401k penalty free, and for many people dividends and capital gains are taxed at 0%. I’m formulating a plan to have $3 million in income over the next 30 years, and pay absolutely ZERO dollars in tax.

It’s almost like Uncle Sam wants us to retire really young.

Can you explain this part? I thought you had to retire at 59 1/2 or 10% penalty.
Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Go for it. I retired at 56, some years ago, and knowing what I now know, (isn&#039;t hindsight wonderful?), I could easily have gone at 46, but definitely not in my 30&#039;&#039;s. So, well done you! Based in the UK, as retirees, my partner and I spend 1 or 2 months in a different European city each year, along with 1 or 2 long hauls to Caribbean, US, Asia, Australia, NZ each year. Even given a series of very poor years, it will take us at least 20 years to munch through our investments, excluding our house. So I can just say, living within your means, investing, and taking one or two &#039;opportunities&#039;, is the recipe for a successful post-work life! By the time I run out of money I will be about 95 at earliest, so probably not a huge worry!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is sweet! Way to go out and live your dream! My wife and I are both 26, and we now live in Granada, Spain. You can live in Western Europe without paying an arm and a leg. (Just stay away from Paris!) We live so much cheaper here than we did in the US. Our phone plan are 10€ a month each. We pay 400€/month for a 2 bedroom apartment. We eat healthier because fruits and vegetables are so much cheaper. Just bought 15 kiwis for 1.50€. I live so much more relaxed just being part of the culture. It&#039;s not out of reach!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good info. I am 38 and we are on track for me to quit working a regular job this year, but I will continue with some extras I enjoy like fixing up furniture and reselling it. My husband is 32 and he will be able to retire at 40, the year our younger daughter graduates high school. We plan on buying an RV and travelling after that.

I laughed a little at your comment that you went to the hospital for a chest x ray and ekg and it cost you $50. I did the same thing here a couple months ago, I have great health insurance, and my portion was $879. That was after my health insurance paid 80%.]]></description>
