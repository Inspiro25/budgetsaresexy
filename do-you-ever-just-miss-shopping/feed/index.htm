					<description><![CDATA[Exactly!  Which is why for the most part I never buy anything brand new (with the exception of electronics).  I can look around the room I&#039;m in right now and point to at least a dozen of items here that haven&#039;t been touched since picking them up - it&#039;s crazy :)  Just like you, I&#039;m glad I&#039;m starting to realize all of this..getting into more minimalism ideas have been helping me out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Selling our stuff that we still value for bargain prices as we are set to live lightly overseas is teaching me a lot about future purchasing... with many things, if you buy it in mint condition for half the original price at a moving sale, take good care of it, you can probably sell it for the same price you paid. Not so with buying new. (though sometimes it feels like one has more money to spend than time to hunt, and I do believe in investing in something you love rather than something that is &quot;ok&quot; depending on the circumstance).
I&#039;m also starting to think like the eco-tip I recently read which said to ask yourself what you will do with the item you are buying once you are &quot;done&quot; with it. 
I&#039;m also realizing that I am not using the cool things I ALREADY own to their full potential, so I need to re-enjoy my previous purchases.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...is that the only reason?
&lt;b&gt;Jeff @DeliverAwayDebt&lt;/b&gt; - I tried AGAIN to go into stores this weekend and really after 30 mins my excitedness was gone. Everywhere I looked I saw &quot;stuff&quot; &quot;stuff&quot; and more &quot;stuff&quot;...maybe I&#039;m just getting old? Like you? ;)
&lt;b&gt;Brandi&lt;/b&gt; - I like this problem better for you ;)  And actually, I always think money spent on clothes is well worth it because we USE them so much, ya know?  Especially if you are updating and getting rid of the old stuff as to not increase clutter.  And also if the old stuff is really old and not like just last year&#039;s style ;)
&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly!  Ignorance is bliss sometimes.
&lt;b&gt;Impulse Magazine&lt;/b&gt; - Well that def. sucks :)
&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Woot!  Been months, if not years, since I last bought something there too.  Woot is still exciting to me though since you never know what&#039;ll be up that day :)
&lt;b&gt;Kira&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh, well said!  And excellent work on that tootpaste too, I suck at finding deals there (I always go for the shiny looking boxes - a marketer&#039;s dream!)
&lt;b&gt;Ciawy @ runworkandsave.blogspot.com&lt;/b&gt; - 	Goals are really important to have!  I sometimes forget that, but if you can keep that in your mind the whole way through it makes the journey much easier. Keep it up!
&lt;b&gt;Ace @ aceofwealth.com&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, indeed my good sir.
&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Yes you can my dear!  It&#039;s a splurge that gives back ten fold ;)  And makes you happy on a daily basis.  It&#039;s not the same as blowing money on something you&#039;ll use once or just for show. Do it! Do it! DO IT!
&lt;b&gt;Young Mogul&lt;/b&gt; - Nope, not convinced yet ;)
&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Frugal materialism huh?  I will def. check out your post on that one...not like I don&#039;t read your blog anyways ;)  If you could stop being so smart and witty I&#039;d gain a lot of my hours back, thx.
&lt;b&gt;Early Retirement Extreme&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like that. I will admit that they&#039;re food courts are getting better though.  So that&#039;s a nice treat.
&lt;b&gt;Donna&lt;/b&gt; - Def. impressive!  I&#039;m a guy and I can&#039;t get my wife to flea markets ;)
&lt;b&gt;Megan&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, try it and thet let me know the secrets you find out :)  I need some more tricks.
&lt;b&gt;finallygettingtoeven.com&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!  I started 2 years ago too but I can&#039;t seem to hush the urge like you do.  Keep it up!
&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Did you just comment twice? haha...you are too much.  It seems you&#039;re not alone in the grocery side of things either!  I actually can&#039;t stand grocery shopping - I always go hungry and want to buy EVERYTHING!
&lt;b&gt;MyFinancialObjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Haha...so, basically you&#039;re a typical guy? :)
&lt;b&gt;WolfBridge Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, thanks for stopping by :)  Glad you enjoyed it. And glad you figured out the whole shopping thing early on too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always been addicted to shopping. My friends always had the best clothes and I felt that in High School I was always keeping up with the Jones&#039;. However, after getting a job, and realizing that several hours of my hard earned money were going to waste, I started rethinking my decision. When you&#039;re in high school and it takes you a week just to buy that new handbag or pair of shoes, it makes you seem a little uneasy.

Then when I entered college, I was so busy all the time, I didn&#039;t have time to shop. Now when I go to the mall or other stores, I find it completely annoying. I want to get in and get out as fast as possible.

Now I just wish more people felt that way! 

I enjoyed reading your post. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess I miss shopping.... EXCEPT for clothes... I CANNOT SHOP FOR CLOTHES!!! I get frustrated in literally 10 min and leave.  I have to do it with my gf there, otherwise I end up with nothing....

I don&#039;t really have a problem with shopping really.  I usually only buy stuff when I need something.  Other than that, I&#039;m not in a mall/target/Best Buy too often!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One kind of shopping never gets old for me, though: Grocery shopping. I remember being a broke single mom who sometimes had to raid the baby&#039;s piggy bank to buy milk before payday. Being able to walk into a store filled with food and knowing I could choose WHATEVER I WANT makes me happy.
Mind you, I&#039;m a pretty careful shopper and yes, I do use coupons. But knowing that I *could*  buy first-of-the-season grapes or cherries is very satisfying.
I also like doing Walgreens and Rite Aid deals for toiletries, because with coupons and rebates (some of them instant) I wind up getting all these items for free. It&#039;s like a game. The extras get donated to emergency pantries and shelters.
Clothes or shoes, though? Not so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I gave up shopping about 2 years ago when i got really serious about paying off my bills and getting rid of all the clutter around me.  Quite honestly once i got it out of my system i don&#039;t miss it, and i don&#039;t care.  When i have to go to the stores now (any store, groceries included) i am filled with dread and just want to get in and out as much as possible.  Having this mindset has also helped in keeping our expenses down because i am finding ways to make other things &#039;do&#039; to keep from having to hit the stores.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I miss window shopping, too! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve done it in a while. I try to avoid stores. Even in the past I would usually only buy what I needed and leave, but I barely even do that now! 

Minimalism is definitely appealing. I have so much JUNK! I certainly might give that a try :)]]></description>
