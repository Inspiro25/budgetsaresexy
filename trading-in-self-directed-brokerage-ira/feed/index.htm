Ha. That&#039;s right. There are truly very few limits as to what can qualify as assets in a retirement account :)

Maybe I need to do a post about this...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2 shares of Twitter=my best laugh of the day.  I live here north of fabled Silicon Valley and some days the stocks change so much I don&#039;t even want to hear the news!  For those of you already investing I say cheers to you!  I am nowhere near being interested right now.  Perhaps in 2014, once I see my new salary (*promotion on the horizon*  so happy flipping excited!).  I&#039;m edging more toward maxing my 403b, &#039;cause there&#039;s going to be some kind of match and I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s 3%, as it&#039;s been, it&#039;s free cash!  (Actually, I wish it were dollar-for-dollar but that&#039;s never gonna happen!!!).
I do know a good investment dude though.  May be time to pay him a visit and ask his very valuable and valued advice!
Great post J$$$.  Got me thinking AGAIN.]]></description>
