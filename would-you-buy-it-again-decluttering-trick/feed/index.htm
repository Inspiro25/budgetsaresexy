You can try storing it in your car&#039;s trunk :) That way it&#039;s out of site (and your house), and then if you still can&#039;t decide what to do with it just drive it on over to be donated!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea, J! I&#039;m constantly in decluttering mode (which begs the question...why do I still have clutter?!) and I plan to start asking myself this question. My challenge is not just donating everything and selecting a few items to actually sell. I&#039;m impatient and when I want it gone, I want it OUT and often overlook the money-making opportunities.]]></description>

That&#039;s a good mindset to be in. If only you can convince the other 95% of the country to be the same :)]]></description>

I hear ya :) I mean, if you REALLY want to be lazy you can just take it all to a Pawn Shop and get some money for them. It wouldn&#039;t be top dollar but you&#039;d succeed in getting rid of stuff and emptying your house... Or better yet, putting an ad on CL for someone to put all your stuff on CL for a profit :) Would take more time on your behalf, but the money would also be bigger... Just gotta figure out how much you care about money vs laziness! Haha...]]></description>

HAH! Better than most people who will fill it up just because! That&#039;s the part most people forget when upsizing - you spend more to just furnish the dang place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m amazed at how much of my money is spent on absolute crap!  Being an eBay fiend doesn&#039;t really help either.

I&#039;m finding now though that I get more enjoyment in &quot;spending&quot; money on investments rather than junk. I have so much passion for making $10m, that buying trinkets and gadgets isn&#039;t that exciting anymore.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rock solid test. But I need a rock solid method for actually getting rid of things that are actually worth something!

I&#039;m good at throwing things out that I wouldn&#039;t need or donating certain items, but sometimes I have stuff that is worth selling but I&#039;m just too lazy to do it. I know if I took the time I could get $80-$100 for that old fish tank sitting there empty. Or probably over $500 for my turntables that I don&#039;t use any more. and the records... the stacks and stacks of records. That&#039;s usually what gets me, I know I would get little to nothing back for the records.

I really need one of those &quot;we sell it for you on ebay&quot; stores near my house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a habit of always looking over a room and spotting items I don&#039;t really need. Haha the funny thing is that since I have a lot more space now in my house there&#039;s a ton of empty space! I&#039;ve kept some things round just to &quot;fill&quot; areas until I get something else I would actually want to keep.]]></description>
