					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Woah! You&#039;re gonna have loads of fun! haha... my wife thinks I&#039;ll end up being best friends with my boy, and will never want to do work again ;)  That would certainly be an interesting thing if it happened, but we&#039;ll see!  All I know is I&#039;m ready for him to finally make an entrance into this world - it&#039;s taking forever!
@&lt;b&gt;DebtsnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s awesome you have so much help over there to keep costs down - good thinking for sure :)  I hope we both stay away from more things breaking!
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - We have not checked witn insurance yet, but I know our duductible is around $400-$500 if I recall correctly, and if the repairs will be around the same anyways, figured better to not even mess with it so it stays away from insurance raising later too - ya know?  I hate thinking like that, but it&#039;s sad when you do cuz you&#039;re afraid of then needing to pay mor down the road... oh well, such is life I guess.
@&lt;b&gt;Craig @Daddysbroke&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m trying to!  Haven&#039;t given up yet! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mac&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks my friend - always gotta do our best to stay positive even though this $hit sucks sometimes ;)  We&#039;re gonna have a lot of ups and downs in these lives!
@&lt;b&gt;Shannon-ReadyForZero&lt;/b&gt; - I hope so!  The timing of it all is the only thing that makes me smile here, so thank goodness for that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Christa!!  I&#039;m doing my best to keep my wife calm and collected, that&#039;s for sure :)  Really glad we got our nursury all set up too before most of this started happening - whew!
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks so much :)  I love your virtual hugs! hehe... and appreciate the honest feedback too w/ this blog and everything... the old me starting out would just gush out whatever it is that was in my head - the good, the bad, and the ugly - but nowadays I try to stick w/ the positive cuz there&#039;s so much junk out there in the world right now... so when I get in these types of moods it&#039;s always hard for me to put it out there on the site :(  But as you said, I do like letting people know that we ALL go through tough spots no matter what our backgrounds or budgets are at/etc.  We really are all in this thing together, ya know? So thanks again for putting me at ease :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance@MoneyLife&amp;More&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s def. nice :)  I remember once I needed a new muffler system for my car, and then someone rearended me and ended up paying for the whole back side - including muffler - to get it all back to normal. That was perfect! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Serena@ThriftDiving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... you&#039;re funny ;)  And I agree with you actually - just not sure if you can pick one up after you&#039;ve lived in a home for so long?  I can def. check on that - we used to have one and I loved it! - but I alaways assumed it was for when you first moved into a home only?  Def. a good idea though, thx for the reminder :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may have mentioned this before but WHY OH WHY do you not have a home warranty?!?!?!? Seriously, I know some people think they are wastes of money, but how can you debate the relief you feel to know that something&#039;s gone awry in your home and all you have to do is call the home warranty company and pay a $60 copy for someone to come fix it?? It&#039;s a no brainier to me, honestly, because things WILL break.... They WILL leak.... And it makes sense to pay a yearly cost of about $450 to cover ANY of those repairs: plumbing, electrical, stove, dish washer, disposal, AC, heater... Need I go on? We&#039;ve had our butts covered on more than one occasion from something that&#039;s broken and we just call them to replace or fix it. Bottom line: piece of mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good news is you can&#039;t have too many more bathrooms to fix up. Hopefully the basement one is fine. Home ownership definitely comes with a lot of problems that renting didn&#039;t. Luckily mine were mostly things I wanted to change not things I had to change so far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh no! It sounds financially AND emotionally draining, what with the dear pet reminder and everything. Those are the worst, it just all piles on top of one another in a (momentarily) unbearable heap. But I guess that is what EFs and virtual hugs are for?

I wouldn&#039;t worry about putting the negative stuff out there if it is very sporadic like this, plus it&#039;s YOUR blog. And honestly, it is sometimes good to hear that even the seemingly most together and popular PF bloggers can relate to other peoples&#039; woes. I&#039;m glad you were honest about the house troubles AND your state of mind.

Congrats on the dwindling countdown...5 weeks, holy smokes, where did the time go?! I&#039;m very excited to see the posts afterward, although I&#039;m sure none of us would fault you if you took some time off. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How terrible! I don&#039;t know how I&#039;d react if in my very-pregnant-can&#039;t wait-to-deliver state I had 2 bathroom reno projects going on. Just gettin the nursery ready was stressful enought for me. Good luck with the renos and with your baby boy!!]]></description>
