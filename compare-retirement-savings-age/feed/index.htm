Beth,
I have a military pension and I use the 4% rule to give it a value.  What amount of cash at 4% interest would equal my monthly pension.  $500/mo would be valued at (500*12)/.04=$150,000.00.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question:

How do you estimate where you are when you have a pension?  I have a 403b too, but will also have a very decent pension that I am fully vested in and can start taking at age 55  (though, I get a larger sum the longer I wait to start taking payments).  So, while my 403B is decently funded, it is not has high as others I know that have no pension to draw from as well...]]></description>

@w8jcd -

I like that site for a few reasons. One is that the chart will let you hover and see each percentile. So for Age 60-64, I can see that $1M is the 84th (or top 16) percentile. It would take $1.64M to get to top 10%, and top 5%, $3.69M. (And of course, the good recent few years will have pushed these numbers up a bit). 

This really brings me back to the Suze tirade over the FIRE movement. I suppose it&#039;s easy for celebs to forget what living on a budget was like, and that one doesn&#039;t actually need $10M to just start to feel comfortable. 

Above, DF/RVA cites people that insist on a rule of thumb. A rule based on averages. Who aspires to be average? When my wife and I had our child, I recall looking at the numbers. From gross income, 20% (between Fed/FICA/State) went to taxes. 20% to the Mortgage. 20% to the Nanny, 5% to college fund, and 20% to retirement savings. At that moment, I recall thinking that we were literally living on 15% of our gross income, and all else being equal,  our retirement &quot;number&quot; would be nowhere near that 70-80%. 

I blinked, the kid is now a junior in college, I retired at 50 (7 yrs ago) and the actual budget is about 60% of that number from 20 years ago. As the 2 decades passed, the future budget got more clear, and the only thing I wasn&#039;t thinking about early on was health insurance. For those trying to FIRE, it&#039;s a big hurdle. For the 3 of us, the annual cost, even on a company retiree plan, is $20K/yr.  FWIW, the 4% rule? I&#039;m ok with spending just above that. My wife&#039;s social security will kick in 6 yrs from now, and is about 1/4 our current spending. At the same time, both our medical will be Medicare and a good portion of that $20K will be saved. Last, the mortgage will be done. Better to enjoy it now, there&#039;s no taking it with you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just turned 38 and we are solidly in the &quot;$500,000 to $999,000 saved&quot; bucket. 

And sadly I have way too many peers that have taken money out of their 401k for vacations!]]></description>
