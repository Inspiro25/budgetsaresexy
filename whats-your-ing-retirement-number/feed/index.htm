					<description><![CDATA[Love the way you think,  man!  It&#039;s true - I totally want to &quot;retire&quot; only in the sense that I can contribute back to society and make it a win-win-win situation!  Haven&#039;t heard it put that way before, thanks :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like stuff like this only  if it inspires me challenge the assumptions that the programmers are making here. This one is pretty good in that respect.

The main assumption is the &#039;how much do you need per annum?&quot; question. Entirely subjective and based on perhaps a hundred variables.

Hopefully this will make people think about what the delta between their needs and wants really is. Will you own a home? Will you travel much? RV around the USA?  

btw- I recently turned 40 and could technically &#039;retire&#039; now if I wanted to (albeit after liquidating a few assets). I never plan on retiring though. Retirement is a myth. The goal should not be to retire from work but to become financially independent to the degree that you can contribute to your community(whatever you choose that to be) for the rest of your life. Sometimes this contribution is compensated, sometimes it is purely volunteer. You want to set it up so that you get to choose what is right for you. Choice is better than no choice.


After all, contribution, charity and helping others is what it is all about.

-WR

J. Money, You are well on your way to the $1,000,000 mark. It&#039;s the excellent habits you have put in play, not the amounts, that matter most in wealth building.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, these kinds of calculators doesn&#039;t account for everything of course, but I think it&#039;s still interesting to see what we might need one day to reach our goals.  It&#039;s definitely a slap in the face of reality!

The only sucky part I see here is that these large a$$ numbers can def. scare you off.  Who wants to start saving when they know they have $4.23 million to go? ;)

Highest # so far: &lt;b&gt;Donkee&lt;/b&gt; w/ $9,771,000! Haha...
Lowest # so far:  &lt;b&gt;Rob&lt;/b&gt; w/ $1,543,201
 
@&lt;b&gt;Que&lt;/b&gt; - Well I figure if I&#039;m blogging full-time then I don&#039;t need to retire anymore ;)  It&#039;ll already be a perfect situation!

@&lt;b&gt;Rachel211&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s true - we make almost double the $60k retirement salary that I plugged in when calculating this for myself.  We can honestly live off of much less if we really tried hard.  Right now we like our luxuries in life though, but I feel like when retirement time comes we woudln&#039;t need all of that stuff, right?   I could be totally wrong though.... I didn&#039;t calculate any #&#039;s to get at $60k, kinda just plucked it from my head ;)]]></description>
