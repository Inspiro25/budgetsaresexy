					<description><![CDATA[Empowering vs. Defeatist attitudes. 

I have been in the reality where I just couldn&#039;t afford things. I have been in the situation where I could afford things that I weren&#039;t my priority. I have been able to afford things that I refused to spend that much money on. 

Sitting back and saying &quot;poor pitiful me&quot; isn&#039;t going to change the situation. 

Oh - and I went to college without incurring student loan debt while being a single mother to 2 children (4 and 7 when I started) and obtained my degree in 3 1/2 years- working 6 nights a week to keep the necessities and yes, I do understand how much babysitters cost. I guess it just really depends on how badly you want something determines how it becomes your goal and what you are willing to give up to make it happen. 

For me, doing something that could improve our overall financial quality of life was imperitive. Yes, I lost a lot of sleep. Yes, there were plays that were missed. Those were the trade-offs for making it happen. 

Just remember, just because you &quot;can&#039;t afford it&quot; today doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t work to afford it &quot;tomorrow&quot;. 

Don&#039;t stand in your own way because you feel defeated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, seems like some people don’t understand what it&#039;s like at the bottom of the food chain. I tell my kids we can&#039;t afford because we can&#039;t. We can&#039;t afford new clothes, we can&#039;t afford toys. We can&#039;t afford for everyone in the house to eat. Of course the children do, but Hey I&#039;ve lost tons of weight. This is our reality. Not because none of us are willing to work, my husband works two jobs. Why don&#039;t i work you ask. You would be surprised at how much a babysitter costs. Break it down for you a extra paycheck and a babysitter equals negative $40.00. Not about budgeting. Though we are never late on bills. Next comment someone would say , why didn&#039;t you go to college. Oh wait we did , what&#039;s college, but $40,000 you will be paying off forever,. I&#039;m being mean lol, today has been hard, daughter&#039;s b-day coming up, She&#039;s turning 2, and she&#039;ll get nothing, that&#039;s sad been saving for months and my husband worked overtime, but if you budget remember this any money you save will find an Extra bill it can be used for such as a car breaking down that&#039;s life. Sorry, folks, some of us can&#039;t afford that either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I KNEW some of you would click that ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@J. Lynne - you are right, it is true that not everyone can afford whatever they want.  I blog from my own perspective and what I know and am used to, and for me most people I know and interact with CAN afford a lot more than they give themselves credit for. Not all of my posts are going to sit well with everyone, and that&#039;s okay :)  I blog about what&#039;s on my mind and how I see it - sometimes people agree, and others not.  Regardless though, I def. enjoy reading everyone&#039;s comments and their own point of views - so thanks!  It adds even more to the community and gets us to think in other ways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to disagree.  Some people really cannot afford some things.  It isn&#039;t a matter of deciding to spend money on one thing or the other.  I remember being so broke one month years ago when I was really, really underpaid and living paycheck to paycheck and that month I was not going to be able to pay all of the basics -- rent and utilities.  I believe I lived on the $5 that was in my purse and the canned food that was in my pantry at the beginning of the month.  One day lunch would be beets and the next day it would be green beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this post is sort of glib like all of those &#034;just eat less and move more&#034; recommendations to overweight people.  It offers something overly simple and obvious but obnoxiously doesn&#039;t actually give real advice to get from A to B.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A part of me agrees and a part of me does not.  I partly agree because I know someone who &#034;can&#039;t afford&#034; anything ever, yet smokes like a chimney and eats out about 4 times a week, ummm.  On the other hand, there are things I really can&#039;t afford right now (like a minivan or a vacation), however, if I take the time to save then eventually I could afford them.]]></description>
