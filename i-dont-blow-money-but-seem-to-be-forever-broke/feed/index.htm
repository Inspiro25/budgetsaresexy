					<description><![CDATA[I think if you&#039;re not blowing money but it leads to feeling broke all the time then you have to think about ways to make more money.  Higher income is your insurance for saving more if you can still manage to live well below what you make.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just did my budget for the next 6 months.  I literally do it very... simply.  I take a sticky note and I write down my exact net income per each paycheck with the date per sticky note. (thats 12 of them because I get 2 a month for 6 months).  I hang these stickys up or keep them in my planner.

Under each net amount I start subtracting things that are due, and then I see how much it goes down.  I recently added a new field for &quot;emergency savings&quot; and I try and keep my remaining amount under 200 dollars so I can&#039;t ever spend more than that.  If i have a remaining amount of under 200 dollars after all my bills are paid, I add the amount to my &quot;emergency savings&quot; for that time and then it evens out.

ex: 11/15/12 $1000.
-200 student loan pyment
= 800
-500 car payment
=300
-150 emergency savings
= 150 (spending money for two weeks!)

Then when I actually get paid, my automated emergency savings deducts, and so does my automated student loan and car payments.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know, taxes are the hardest to set aside! We have to do it every quarter since I&#039;m self-employed, and it comes to like $8,000 if I recall correctly. Not fun! I liked it more when it was all taken out automatically, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If she&#039;s got a computer, I&#039;d highly recommend a good piece of budgetting software similar to No Thirst Software&#039;s &quot;Moneywell&quot; product (for mac) or similar software for the PC.. These sorts of products excel at building a budget with all expenses right in front of you and using envelope budgeting to divert money for required needs or upcoming expenses,etc.. I frequently feel the same way -- I make a fair amount of $$ and still wonder where it goes.. It always seems like we&#039;re scraping for money here and there which makes it difficult at tax season or when property taxes are due (now!) and we don&#039;t have an extra $5k handy for the tax guy.. Ugg!  It&#039;s a work in progress!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Was the 64 a typo? No? Ok. If she doesn&#039;t have one already, I&#039;d also recommend getting life insurance so he child is covered in the event anything happens.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Got a message back from Martha via email just now:

&quot;I feel almost famous!  I especially felt comfortable when you said as long as I prioritize and keep paying down debt I am OK.  In the past I always felt like I wasn’t doing my budget or my plan perfectly and would give up.&quot;

Thanks again everyone! :)]]></description>
