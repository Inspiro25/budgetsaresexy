					<description><![CDATA[Just read your post, and I gotta say, it&#039;s a total mood lifter!  I love how you just went with the flow and started writing whatever came to mind. It&#039;s amazing what can happen when we let our brains take the wheel, right?  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always thought I was quirky to be addressing strangers reading my blog as friends. Until I stumbled upon your blog!

I love your rambling writing style, and based on that, I feel your creative energy will make your volunteering stint a super hit.

Looking forward to reading more about your life!]]></description>

Yes, I&#039;d definitely donate, count me in!  BTW, thanks for the mention on my swim challenge, so far so good, gotta log 8.3 miles a month.  I have to tip my cap to you,  b/c it all stems from your push up challenge!  You inspired me Bro!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/#comment-431651&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt;.

YES!! We actually had a fund like that years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovedrop.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;LoveDrop.org&lt;/a&gt;) and it was amazing... 

I&#039;ll have to sit down and really think about how to amplify this even more as the dust settles here, but would love to tie it back into the online world more to expand the goodness where it makes sense. Thanks for the note!

And will 100% take you up on that donation offer if you’re serious about it? :) We can always do it in a makeshift way on the side for now - like maybe $20/mo which I pull together with my own $ and continue doing The Good?

I def. miss bigger projects like this - it would be cool to revamp one from over 10 years ago but tweaked for more modern times...

(And love your 100 mile swimming challenge btw - that&#039;s a good one! And fun to think about with the cities like that!)]]></description>

That&#039;s very much true too. It&#039;s possible my brain has been telling me this for ages and only recently got smart enough to listen to it &#128513;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Universe is a funny thing.   You were inspired and took a step toward your goal.  I&#039;m betting you found something/someone to help.

					<description><![CDATA[J, that&#039;s a fabulous idea about helping those in need out for an hour.  You could then create a whole youtube channel out of it, with a go fund me account where people could donate to your cause and then you get to distribute the funds to whoever you think is in the most need.  I&#039;d tune in and donate!]]></description>
