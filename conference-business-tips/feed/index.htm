Awesome! Really??? My cousin would love you :) I was asking him a billion and one questions and a number of times he had to cut me off and say how funny it was that I was asking them since I&#039;m the finance blogger!! Haha... but &quot;personal&quot; finance and &quot;brain smarts&quot; finance are two completely different things ;)

If you end up going to FINCON next year, do let me know so I can come say hi.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a good time!  I had never heard of Fincon until reading your blog a while ago.  I may have to see about going some year!

P.S. I had to laugh a bit about the part that you visited the Federal Reserve in STL, because I work at the one up in MN.  Oh, the things that the common public don&#039;t understand!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was seriously great to met you in person. It was crazy-fest trying to keep up with everything going on, but I made some great connections and learned a ton. I brain dumped once I got home, still have a to-do list a mile long. Thanks for bringing your awesomeness out to St Louis, and I still owe you that beer!]]></description>

Haha oh yeah! That&#039;s the best part - leaving with all that inspiration :) But then if you don&#039;t follow through you feel like a jackal! Haha...

Congrats on getting your CPA license - that&#039;s huge :)]]></description>
