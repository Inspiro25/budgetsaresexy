					<description><![CDATA[Wow. I remember when you were at $500k a very short time ago and now you&#039;re already on your way to be a millionaire in like the next 2 years, 3 years tops. 

Congratulations, man! It just shows how a little bit of hard work and some time can really put the gasoline on the fire. My net worth dipped by a disgusting amount on November :( but onwards and upwards!]]></description>

Ooooh I just blew 40k to fly to NYC!!  I think the best value is exchanging for travel, it&#039;s about 1c per point.  I actually have 150k total, so must have accrued a bunch of bonus points from spending too.  So, $1,500 total (and the card cost me $700 for the annual fee). I&#039;ve used a bunch of other perks though too.]]></description>

Yep, $65! No BS... Found it on Craigslist.  And, the guy even delivered it to my house because he lived in Long Beach and was headed my way for work.  The board is pretty beat up and old, but watertight nonetheless. Came with fins. No leash.

You want it? If you live in SoCal I&#039;ll sell it to you for $65 plus a 4-pack of craft beer. Email me :)]]></description>
