Ugh, yeah - that&#039;s def. lame... 

And I actually agree there&#039;s a lot of nonsense rules/signs out there, I just find that most times people really *don&#039;t* pay attention to them and then like to complain about it... Lord knows I&#039;ve gotten tickets over the years that were 100% my fault.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is why I bike in DC; it&#039;s almost impossible to know what the parking rules are because of nonsense signs.

Case in point: I drive to my daughter&#039;s college early in the morning and there is a sign on the side in the grass that says No Parking 5-10pm. So I park since I&#039;ll be gone by 4pm. Evidently sometime during the morning they put out &quot;No Parking from 12-5pm&quot; signs at the entrance of the lot and then give me a ticket at 2pm even though they never move the original sign, which is right next to my car.

I appeal and they tell me it&#039;s my fault for not reading the signs. *This* is why people think it&#039;s unfair.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s be honest; these meter parkings are unfair. When you see a block of restaurants and all the parking within the block lets you park for an hr, if you don&#039;t hurry up with your food better remember to put In another quarter. Also most muni meters don&#039;t want to accept your credit card if your are only paying a quarter since the transaction is costly for just 25cents so if you are running around looking for some change, there&#039;s a ticket! If you&#039;re a door to door salesman and your client is taking just a minute longer than your expiration time, there&#039;s a ticket. Why is there no grace period for when your ticket expires? Just one minute has to pass from your expiration time to get fined $35. 

Importantly, Is there really no such thing as public parking near restaurants, shops and busy areas anymore? We just HAVE to pay to go to our local grocery store? I don&#039;t understand the idea of having to pay for parking. Anybody can afford a quarter if you have a car and the time limit doesn&#039;t keep a car from moving so you are not increasing parking space, why do we need to pay to park? Not only does this help the city collect money through quarters but through parking tickets and it doesn&#039;t really help us at the end with safety, parking increase or anything... Does the city desperately need our money?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I go to work a bit late that is why I find it hard to find a good parking place. So I have to go around the vicinity. Most likely, I tend to get the farthest one from my office. It is really a hassle but I don&#039;t mind it so much because I get a little exercise out of it.]]></description>

haha.... I got a citation the other year for not buying a train ticket in san francisco. Only they didn&#039;t believe me that I haven&#039;t visited in like 6 years :) took about 4 phone calls and 3 letters in the mail for collections to finally clear it up - what a mess.]]></description>

Really?? What&#039;s the point in having the rules then? I&#039;d still follow them regardless to not have to worry about paying/being stressed out. But again I&#039;m a goody goody :)]]></description>
