					<description><![CDATA[J : We are thinking alike right now!  The quote I started my day with : &quot;A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone.&quot; ~H.D. Thoreau, 1817-1862 

It is really true, and the more we can reinforce this mindset over time, the richer we will become.  Have a great weekend!]]></description>

He also reputedly died falling in a ditch - he was looking at the stars and didn&#039;t see it. Certainly someone I&#039;d like to have a drink with :).]]></description>

Woohoo! We came *this* close to moving to the Raleigh/Durham area - great place! I think she&#039;ll really like it there, esp coming from NYC. Not that they&#039;re super a like or anything, but they def. have the &quot;this place is the best place ever&quot; type of mentality there, haha... and for good reasons :)]]></description>

Hah! I actually had the exact same thought when we were getting married :) My fiance at the time and I had everything we needed so I wanted to scrap the registry and just do money/items towards our honeymoon and other adventures. The wife thought it would be good to have more &quot;us&quot; things though (so we can start our new lives together with newer stuff rather than random stuff we&#039;ve collected over the years on each side) so we compromised and did both. One registry and then one honeymoon fund - which if I recall correctly got almost completely paid for :)

So maybe you guys can do a little of each? Some people LOVED the honeymoon route (which you can substitute for house savings) cuz they liked going towards an experience and something you REALLY wanted, but others liked the more &quot;normal&quot; way to go cuz they aren&#039;t comfortable giving money. But at the end of the day it&#039;s really what you two want from it all. Everyone will survive no matter which way you go :)

Soak up this time in your lives!]]></description>
