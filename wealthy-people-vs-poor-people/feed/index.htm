For sure - there are always exceptions to the rule. I&#039;m not aware of the % of those who inherit vs those who earn it on their own accord, but I&#039;d guess way more earn it than the opposite. But the point really here is that your mindset can make a big difference when it comes to earning and keeping money (at least if you then take action). I feel like this stuff helps people more than it hurts them, but that&#039;s just me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This list is ridiculously stupid and simplistic. It&#039;s another list praising the wealthy for their superior way of thinking and living when it couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. Do you have any idea how many wealthy people inherit their wealth and simply maintain and grow their money with their inherited leverage. Entrepreneurs are the exception to the rule. Billions of poor people can apply these traits and die in the dirt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, that&#039;s kind of a generalization, but yeah - I&#039;m sure to some degree that&#039;s true.  I know a lot of rich people that give back to the poor and are beautiful-hearted people too ;)  You can still be a good overall person and rich at the same time.]]></description>
