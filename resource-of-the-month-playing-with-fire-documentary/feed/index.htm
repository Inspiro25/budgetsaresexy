					<description><![CDATA[I’m sooo excited for this documentary and to have my husband watch with me! 
A free and happy life looks like spending half the year somewhere in Europe and half here (this is my dream “retirement” goal. It means visiting family when I want to. It means doing work I love but when I want to, maybe that’s only a couple hours a week (and not feeling guilty about not working enough!) it means my husband can pursue something he loves to do like tech instead of just having “a job”.]]></description>
