It costs workers money to take your order over the phone? I always thought the owners or managers were the ones taking the orders while the servers were the ones serving. That&#039;s pretty jacked up if servers have to &quot;tip out&quot; by taking orders on the phone. Or the internet for that matter as now tons of places allow that. I&#039;m sure it varies depending on the establishment?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Reading some of these comments is infuriating. These people have clearly never worked in the service industry. I understand the concept of pick up and the distaste of feeling obligated to tip as you have indeed not been served, however the thing people don&#039;t realize is that when you call in that order the server rings it in and has to tip out on it from their total sales. So yes, I understand that they didn&#039;t kiss your ass and bring you things for an hour of dining experience but they are paying out of their own pocket every time someone doesn&#039;t tip. It COSTS them money to serve you. Regardless of what you leave the fact of the matter is at most establishments the server is tipping out 5% on their total sales. Not tips. Their actual sales. If someone comes in and orders $60 worth of takeout and doesn&#039;t tip it&#039;s the server who takes the hit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[YES!!!

&quot;Do a good job because its your job and it is what you were hired to do, not because of what that line says on the CC slip.&quot;  - AGREE.  The best workers are the best because they do as damn good of a job as possible, every single time.  Whether they&#039;re upset/sad/sick/whatev.  If you&#039;re a great worker, you do it cuz you&#039;re proud of your work. You don&#039;t give $hitty service for bad tips/etc. (not that we &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/forget-about-tipping-after-service/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tip before&lt;/a&gt; anyways, which I&#039;ve blogged about too actually :))

Also -- totally agree with this too: &quot;I do not think that because I ordered an expensive bottle of wine vs. a cheap bottle, that the server deserves more&quot;  -- it&#039;s very true -- SAME WORK for $1Mill dollar bottle vs $5.00 bottle, though the clientele would def. be different ;)

Either way, really enjoyed reading this. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My two cents (or four, based on the length of this) for what its worth.  I always tip my expected 20% and usually tip 10% or more on take out.  98% of the time, this is begrudgingly.
For the life of me, I cannot seem to figure out why the food industry holds us hostage for supplementing the salary of it&#039;s workforce.  In the past, &quot;tips&quot; (i.e., they are called &quot;tips&quot; for a reason), were not an EXPECTED part of one&#039;s salary.  They were a little something extra to say &quot;thanks for the hard work and going the extra mile&quot;. 
Now it is demanded and even regulated to a certain extent (an AUTOMATIC 18% on parties of 6 or more??).  You can certainly expect jeers and dirty looks if you don&#039;t tip appropriately, and you&#039;d better be prepared not to come back to that restaurant.
I hate the argument &quot;Well, you&#039;d get bad service otherwise&quot;.  Really?  I&#039;ve worked minimum wage jobs for years with no tip EVER, lived in a crappy apartment while charging a cheap pair of retreaded tires for my car because that&#039;s all I could afford after my meals of Top Ramen and Kool-Aid and I NEVER, gave poor service because I didn&#039;t get a tip.  During this time, I had friends that were servers that averaged more than double my hourly wage with their tips.  The self riteousness of it all kills me.  Do a good job because its your job and it is what you were hired to do, not because of what that line says on the CC slip.  
Now, I know about the whole &quot;servers wage thing&quot; and I understand.  But really, I would rather servers be paid more, the restaurant could charge me more for my food and then I could forgo the uncomfortable feeling at the end of the meal of &quot;how much do we tip?&quot;.  After all, I do not think that because I ordered an expensive bottle of wine vs. a cheap bottle, that the server deserves more...why?  Because they still only opened one bottle, and only had to pour the wine for two people.  The workload didn&#039;t change because I spent more money per item!
I am kind to my server, respectful of their work and appreciate how busy they are.  I say please and thank you, try not to bother them uneccesarily or make complicated demands.  NOW, if I (or my party), are particularly &quot;needy&quot; and the server is kind and overly accomodating than absolutely, they went above and beyond their &quot;usual&quot; duties and I tip with a smile and usually WELL above the &quot;20%&quot;. 
But 98% of the time I get the service I expect, no better, no worse and it angers me that I am expected to tip on top of the bill because someone said so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do takeout in a restaurant that is primarily dine in.  I think what a lot of people fail to realize is that your takeout person is paying taxes on their sales assuming that people are tipping them off of their order.  I pay taxes on money I don&#039;t always make- and no you may not tip a store clerk but that clerk&#039;s hourly wage is not decided assuming that a person will tip them.  Is a 20% tip needed on takeout? No.  If your order is ready when it&#039;s supposed to be and your service is good- some token of appreciation is nice (although laying down a quarter is probably worse than no tip unless you are putting it in a jar).  I know all my regular&#039;s names whether they tip or not (probably 100 people) but the ones who get highest priority in a rush?  The ones who help pay my bills. I always give good service but the people who get great service are the ones that act appreciative for the amount of work that actually goes in to preparing their order.  I don&#039;t expect a tip but I do appreciate it, and even if you don&#039;t tip- be respectful, I have to be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heather
&quot;Other take out places, chinese restaurants etc, I would be willing to tip 10%, because they still did make my food, place my order, and so on. And a lot of restaurant servers don’t make the standard min wage.&quot;

WHY should it matter to the CUSTOMER what they make per hour for the SAME EXACT JOB BEING DONE? 

If I am getting my order taken, my food put in a container, then in a bag, then rung up, then give me change and I am picking it up INSIDE MYSELF, it&#039;s the SAME OR LESS service you can get at a Wendy&#039;s.  The cashiers sometimes actually put together your food. I know, I have had it happen before. If I can&#039;t tip them for doing the same or less work, I won&#039;t be unfair like you to tip for the same service anywhere else.  

WHY aren&#039;t you a &quot;FAIR&quot; tipper, huh?

WHY should you care what their EMPLOYER pays per hour if you can&#039;t tip the Wendy&#039;s cashier for example? The employer is the one being unfair in their pay. The CUSTOMER, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE FAIR WHEN THEY PAY PEOPLE!! You can control how FAIR you are tipping or not. By tipping for a to-go order you pick up inside, you are tipping UNFAIRLY, because Wendy&#039;s cashiers deserve tips too NO MATTER HOW MUCH they get paid per hour, they want tips too, but aren&#039;t allowed to take them. Just because a place allows tipping doesn&#039;t mean those workers DESERVE a tip MORE than a Wendy&#039;s cashier did to put together my burger, fill a cup with mayo, filled a cup with mustard, and filled my cup with ice as well as drink.

You should be tipping on an EQUAL level.  WHY do you want to PAY people UNFAIRLY? You are just as bad as the non-fast food restaurant employer that pays their workers less than minimum wage for to-go orders.  The employers are being unfair, why you want to be unfair as well by tipping them, but the ones that sometimes even do MORE WORK don&#039;t get a tip just because they aren&#039;t allowed to accept tips, huh? They took the job KNOWING what their pay was per hour.  If they don&#039;t like it, they can work at WENDY&#039;S, get what I am saying or what?

&quot;Counter tipping: I used to work as a barista at a drive-up coffee hut, and anyone that’s ever worked and made espresso knows that it’s not as easy as just pouring a cup of coffee.&quot;

Now-a-days though they have McDonald&#039;s iced coffee drinks and frappuccinos for no tip.  So doing the same work should receive the same pay.  Do you realize in 2004, my sister-in-law worked at Starbucks already starting at $6.50/hr? They are getting their wage already just as the rest of the counter service you receive at the fast food restaurants. I am mentioning this, because you seem to care about what people make per hour.

&quot;Regardless, I remember what it’s like working those places, and I remember that even a little bit of a tip can make someone’s day.&quot;

That&#039;s why BE FAIR when you tip. Don&#039;t tip for to-go orders you pick up inside. Don&#039;t tip the coffee barrister at Starbucks.  BE FAIR!! Just because the employer of a non-fast food restaurant wants to pay a low wage doesn&#039;t mean YOU have tip unfairly. Think about that....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From my experience (working at Wendy&#039;s for 2 years) cashiers and staff at those chains ARE NOT ALLOWED to accept tips, and if it&#039;s seen by a manager, it can cause you to lose your job. Those places pay at least min wage, and usually more. 

Other take out places, chinese restaurants etc, I would be willing to tip 10%, because they still did make my food, place my order, and so on. And a lot of restaurant servers don&#039;t make the standard min wage. 

Counter tipping: I used to work as a barista at a drive-up coffee hut, and anyone that&#039;s ever worked and made espresso knows that it&#039;s not as easy as just pouring a cup of coffee. 

Regardless, I remember what it&#039;s like working those places, and I remember that even a little bit of a tip can make someone&#039;s day. I&#039;m probably more generous than my budget says I ought to be, but I consider the good to outweigh the bad.]]></description>
