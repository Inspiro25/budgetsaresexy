David Ginsberg, this is the exact same thing I was wondering.  Also, does/did he live at home?  Did he have financial support from someone else?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is your monthly salary? I read these blogs all the time and while I&#039;m sure you had a good budget and a goal, you more than likely make more than the average salary for a college graduate. I saw a blog boasting about paying 140k in 4 years, but they said nothing about their salary. The average staring salary for a college grad is about 40k. Take into consideration the cost of food, taxes, transportation, housing, etc, you most likely arent left with enough to pay 40k in 2 years. If you bloggers want me to be impressed, state your salary. My wife had about 20k in student loans. Her and I both made 10 dollars an hour. We paid off the loan in about 5 years, and by then she made about 13 an hour and I made about 15. We used a draconian budget and went without any luxuries for a long time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this post! I thought I was the only one that used the thermometer drawing as a visual gauge! Its Great. Love the excel - looks very similar to mine as well. I just completed my payoff plan for the $43k debt I have. Crunching the numbers is crucial to the process. For my first blog post I was planning on walking thru my 5 year plan and I am glad to see that there are so many people that also think budgets are sexy. Keep up the great work and congratulations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many reasons , psychologically it’s stressful to know you aren’t free because you have the weight of a student loan over your head . It stresses me out to have a debt hanging over my head.  Want to take a sabbatical ? you can’t . even with no other bills you have to pay that student loan . 

You can choose to stop investing for a while , no problem . stop paying student loans and the debt collectors will start calling and eventually garnish wages .

Financial - Student loans interest rates can be high, mine are 9% , plus for investments you have to factor in inflation and possible taxes for tax deferred investments like 401k’s. 

Finally, I think of debt like a leaky gas tank where I’m losing fuel every time I give away money and get nothing in return . you can also think of it as running the financial race while wearing ankle weights because the loan payments are slowing you down . 

Take these weights off and run towards your goals faster!

Good job killing so much of it already! You&#039;ll have to let us know if the visual route works later, and which one you tried :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#1 is the hardest step! I don&#039;t have student loan debt, but I do have other debts. Adding up your debt is overwhelming and then convincing yourself that it isn&#039;t ok just because most people have debt is EVEN harder. I have never tired using a visual aid before, so I think I might try that for this last bit of debt I&#039;m working on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ridiculous.

Also, &#039;ashamed&#039; to have debt you are nearly forced to accumulate to receive anywhere near a decent education in the US is itself something to be ashamed of.  University leaders who have million dollar incomes should be ashamed.]]></description>
