I feel like you&#039;d be a perfect candidate for DMM :)

I&#039;m not sure of the ins and outs of the association, but I&#039;m sure some poking around their website would get you what you need: http://www.aadmm.com/

Here&#039;s the link for searching for them: http://www.aadmm.com/findDMM.php

And here&#039;s a note from it: &quot;AADMM does not endorse nor guarantee the services of any member listed in the &quot;Find a DMM&quot; section. However, all current AADMM members listed below have signed a Code of Ethics.  We always encourage consumers to interview and ask for client or personal references before commencing services from a DMM. Be sure to review our list of questions to ask before hiring a DMM.&quot;

While I haven&#039;t worked with any w/ my own money, these two DMMs here I&#039;ve personally spoken with on the phone and were super helpful and seemed to really care and know what they&#039;re doing. Maybe start your search with them and see how it goes?

Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I came across both your topics on this subject by doing the exact same Google search you did.  I&#039;m a bit overwhelmed by all my monthly income, bills, stock holdings, rental properties, etc..  I also work long hours and travel a lot for work so keeping track of all my bills becomes a serious chore and often times falls to the bottom of my priorities.  I find myself being late paying my bills and even fell way behind a couple of times.  Now I understand money management strategies, budgets, etc, but I simply don&#039;t have the time to deal with it and I&#039;d rather be out making more.  My problem is never having enough money to pay my bills, I simply lose track of everything.  I&#039;d absolutely love to find someone to do this for me.  I&#039;m not sure that I have enough to justify a full blown accountant and I have a money manager that handles my long term investment strategy with accounting included.   I just need someone to handle my monthly cash flow.  My only concern is that opening up all my accounts to someone is terrifying.  Does the Association kinda vet it&#039;s members and verify their legitimacy?  Do they maintain a list of &quot;trusted DMMs&quot;?]]></description>

Oh man, well, it was a LOT of fun actually helping people - especially once they got that &quot;a-ha&quot; moment!, but it ended up taking up a lot more time (and energy) than I realized, and I started slacking on my more important projects. Like this blog and Rockstar Finance. I still coach some of my older clients here and there, but outside of that I stick to helping out online right now. 

Def. worth trying out if it&#039;s something you&#039;re interested in though! You learn a TON about how people think (it&#039;s more of a psychology session than a money one, really), and it&#039;s cool to watch them progress as the months go on. It was a fun experience :)]]></description>

J. Money,

I read your posts from several years ago when you were very excited to be a money manager.  Your goals seemed to change and then you did coaching.  Now it seems as though you don&#039;t do that anymore.  Why did you change your mind on the managing and coaching.  Please share your experience on why you no longer want to do either.  Thanks!]]></description>

Haha...

Haven&#039;t watched any of the Mindy Projects yet actually now that you mention it (I&#039;ve heard of it of course just never seem to come across it?) but will try and remember to find it and check it out :) It&#039;ll make for a great first impression I&#039;m sure! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you seen this week&#039;s Mindy Project on Hulu? It&#039;s all about this very topic! It was funny so check it out if you have time.

A friend of mine is a lawyer (as is her husband) and she keeps saying that she wishes she could hire someone to take care of her money for her. I always reply that she could do that but runs the risk of getting ripped off :) I&#039;d tell her about this but I&#039;m too worried she&#039;d actually do it!]]></description>

The best of both worlds :) And then if you REALLY do your job well, they won&#039;t need to rely on you at all! That&#039;s what I always told all my clients when coaching... &quot;Hopefully you won&#039;t need me this time next year&quot; haha...]]></description>
