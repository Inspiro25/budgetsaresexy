@&lt;b&gt;Cesar&lt;/b&gt; - I know!!!  It&#039;s cRaZy over here!!  Although the timeline is a bit off ;)  Just figured I&#039;m spilling everything else, might as well spill this too!

					<description><![CDATA[I think you took a sound risk. It&#039;s a great thing that you&#039;re able to help and I also like the key points you told us about her making sure your wife was okay with everything as well. She sounds very respectful, and $5k is a good amount of money to be able to give someone. :-)]]></description>
