					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s my dream job too (not dream job as in salary wise, but dream perks job)

I have a friend who&#039;s a flight attendant and she gets to fly everywhere for dirt cheap!

I guess you would want to work for an airline company that was large enough with multiple international destinations.

I also know someone else who works &quot;casual&quot; as an accountant (like maybe once a month) and he gets SWEETASS deals to go to vegas. Like $25 return.

So jealous.

That would be ideal. Just work once a month and bam- you get the perks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I hate to say it but nowadays with the rise of the &quot;regional&quot; airline, it ain&#039;t really so.  Most flights (and jobs) are on regionals.  Most regionals not only pay minimum wage, but with the entire travel industry pretty much still in the toilet, flights are also more full (meaning we get bumped) and if you have more people than just YOU to fly with, it sometimes gets hard.  That being said, if I was single, totally unattached and was into travel, it might be a good way to get around while making no bucks at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, tell us more about the pilots hooking up with all the attendants!  Was it really that common?

Do you suggest we work for the airlines as a retirement job, to help us see the world?

Any tips on HITTING on flight attendants as a passenger?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I would have had I been at the airlines longer! I was trying to hit a lot of the places closer to home first before venturing WAY out there (and since it didn&#039;t take much finagling of work days off) but then our group got laid off.  Which was actually pretty good timing because I wanted to move back to the DC area anyways by that point, but it also put a stop to my adventures.  I used to live in Korea though so I&#039;ve def. experienced the Asian culture :)  Love it too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow that&#039;s awesome J!  Thanks for telling us your story.  I was going to ask what you did when you worked for them.  I&#039;d say a ticket agent is probably one of the more preferred jobs.  I don&#039;t know how much I&#039;d like dealing with customers on a plane, especially on long trips with lots of babies...

That awesome though man.  I&#039;m surprised you never made it to some of Asian countries, those tickets are stupidly expensive!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woah! Never heard of that one.  She was def. taking advantage of all the perks though!  Good for her.  There are hundreds of different jobs you can do with the airlines though so I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find one that works better for you when it&#039;s time :)  PERFECT for retired people too - plus, passengers tend to like older people more I find.  I was always treated as a &quot;kid&quot; and not really taken that seriously - except for the time I had to help 60+ people at 2 a.m. once and a stampede almost ensued.  My manager at the time literally ran into her office and said it was &quot;too unsafe&quot; out there and called security.  I ended up standing on top of the desk of computers and taking control of the situation, of course knowing security would soon back me up ;)  It didn&#039;t get too out of control, but at least I was respected for a few hours.  And everyone got helped!]]></description>
