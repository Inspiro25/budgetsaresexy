					<description><![CDATA[Haha yeah I hear ya on that.  I&#039;m pretty good at avoiding everything on my way to the clearance racks, but every now and then I see that glittery &quot;look at me! look at me!&quot; sign and I get suckered in.  It&#039;s a good thing I&#039;m great at returning items later once I&#039;ve realized what I&#039;ve done ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m much more susceptible to in-store deals than advertising. Maybe it&#039;s because no matter how good a deal something on TV is, I still have to get up, put the kid in the car, drive over, find the room in the budget etc. My laziness is bigger than my gullibility.

But in-store stuff gets me all the time, there was a T-shirt I wanted at a shop the other day and it was $20 alone, but it was two for $35. I picked up a second shirt I wanted, but had no intentions of buying, by the time I came down from that bargain high and realized I didn&#039;t save $5 but instead spent $15 it was too late.

My discipline for groupon or living social and the like is to only spring for something if it replaces something more expensive. Tickets to a museum we want to visit that are $20 cheaper then the plans I already had for the day? Sure. A better restaurant deal to use on a date night? awesome. Win-win. It&#039;s when it becomes an extra added-on something that it starts getting dangerous for me, and it&#039;s just been a discipline of cooling down from the one-day-only frenzy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a commercial on TV about foreclosure homes (I notice it because it&#039;s what I do, otherwise I wouldn&#039;t pay a bit of attention), anyway, in the commercial the announcer states &quot;Anyone that doesn&#039;t already own a home may call today, all others may call tomorrow&quot;.

Oh come on, do they really think we listen to that?  They are trying to make &#039;non-homeowners&#039; feel like they are something special when we all know that anyone can call anytime and they will talk to us all the same.  Once again, the &#039;fear factor&#039;...call us first before the rest of the world comes running at full speed and you miss out...ugh!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree wholeheartedly.  I have become very skeptical about anything that could even possibly be construed as &quot;trying to sell&quot; something to me.  It can affect the credibility of the person involved, for example, a conference or seminar.  I will walk out of one if I feel a speaker is shamelessly self-promoting.  I understand advertising is a necessary evil and try to use it as a &quot;teachable moment&quot; for my grandkids to help in their critical thinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree with you on the whole &quot;spend your $ and save!!!&quot; approach! It is easy to get sucked in to paying for something we don&#039;t need in order to get imaginary savings. 

It&#039;s great if you already planned to buy the product, but many times it gets us when we weren&#039;t even looking to shop! 

I know what you mean about Woot. I would actually stay up until 1:00 am (I&#039;m on the east coast), refreshing my browser to see what the new deal would be. I was afraid of waking to an amazing deal that was sold out - especially a bag of crap! But I haven&#039;t been to the site in ages - for the same reason as you (ok, ok, I just looked while typing this comment)!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love Groupon but only because I&#039;m savvy enough to not snap everything up. It only recently launched in Aberdeen so there have been quite limited offers but I can also buy vouchers for London and do cheap stuff on my next visit!

I actually think that there should be some education about how advertising works in school. I don&#039;t know how many times I&#039;ve heard people talk about &quot;bargains&quot; that they only bought because there was a saving. It&#039;s pretty insane thinking but I get it because I used to be insane!]]></description>
