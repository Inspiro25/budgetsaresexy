					<description><![CDATA[FYI: That Sapphire card deal ends this Tuesday, April 3rd! So if you&#039;re planning on getting it, make sure to do so before then!

@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  Look at you workin&#039; it like that.  Man, Abu Dhabi would be awesome to check out.  If you need someone to carry your bags, let me know ;)  All I need is an excuse to go out there!
@&lt;b&gt;ImpulseSave&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool!  I love it when you can use your cards&#039; points for Amazon - makes it soooo easy!  Esp. sinc most of use hit it up so frequently these days... only thing I hate about Discover is it&#039;s not accepted everywhere :(  But I guess it&#039;s the same thing w/ my Amex. Pros and cons, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;Ernest S.&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s bad ass too.  Total ease of mind!  I&#039;ll have to research that one more and add it to the list.  Someone else the other day brought that one up too, thx for the heads up.
@&lt;b&gt;Squeezer @Personal Finance Success&lt;/b&gt; - Sallie Mae has a card? Hah!  I bet there&#039;s a ton of cards out there we haven&#039;t even heard of before.  Really interesting just peering in your all&#039;s wallets :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - You know yourself well sir, that&#039;s great :)  People tend to get in trouble when they start signing up to a new card every week for the perks and then end up with way too many to keep track of - so good job.  Big fan of Navy Federal too - though they are 2nd to my beloved USAA ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Marianne&lt;/b&gt; - And that&#039;s the beauty of it all!  It IS Free money if used smoothly like that!  I&#039;ll go and check out your post after adding this up - thanks, friend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwwwww see that!  People are making their companies look bad when they don&#039;t even mean to - crazy... but just goes to show you gotta be a respectable human at all levels to not dick people/companies over! And it sucks for Amex too cuz they really are a bad ass company.  At least in my experience so far.
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa @ Little House in the Valley&lt;/b&gt; - Woot Woot!  Not a bad plan at all either, I hope you rock it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;TJ&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, for sure.  It really does depend on WHAT you&#039;re going for, and what offers are available for you at the time.  For example my business Amex card rarely gets used, so I just picked one that had no fee every year and had *some* sort of perk built in.  But I knew I wouldn&#039;t get much out of it anyways, so for ME - had their been some $200 cash back or something awesome - I totally would have jumped at it cuz it would pretty much be the only thing I&#039;d get out of it, haha... but yeah - for the most part it&#039;s better to go for a card you can get rewarded for on a continual basis than just a 1-time up front bonus.  Good reminder.
@&lt;b&gt;Wayne @ Young Family Finance&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  And it makes things even harder when there&#039;s about a billion other credit cards out there to choose from too - sometimes that analysis paralysis comes in and just gets you to freeze up... so once you make up your minds on which way you guys wanna go, def. good to just jump on something you&#039;re 80% sure is good and be happy with it.  It&#039;s rare you get that card that&#039;s 100% perfect no matter which way you go.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah - I always forget you need a card for rentals, etc.  And using a debit one SUCKS for that cuz they pull that $200-$300 deposit right out of your account unlike a credit card where you don&#039;t notice the $$ :(  Another great perk of using credit cards!
@&lt;b&gt;Stephen Harris&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww that&#039;s awesome!  I didn&#039;t know they did that!  I&#039;ll most def. check it out, thanks man :)  Though unfort. I only use my Amex for biz. expenses which usually doesn&#039;t include &quot;everyday&quot; stuff (unless you count Go Daddy &quot;normal&quot; haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! &quot;credit card tango&quot; - I like that :)  And you&#039;re totally right about that Preferred card too - I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s totally awesome (and different) than all other cards out there! Kinda like that &quot;black card&quot; I bet - makes you all super fancy pants when you whip it out, haha... nice job on getting those free trips back home though using your tango - that&#039;s pretty sweet.
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Haha - double whammy! If you do though, you only have 1 more day left cuz I heard that deal goes away on this up and coming Tuesday, April 3rd!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The credit card tango can be very rewarding. :) I fly home every year for free (NZ to east coast) using sign up bonuses. The only card from my bunch that I am sorely tempted to keep (and pay the $95 annual fee) is the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. Aside from the deals you get, they make it out of some weird material that feels AWESOME and is heavier than the other cards. Everyone comments on it and checks it out when I pull it out--it makes me feel special. But that&#039;s how they get you, right?!! $95 is a lot of money to pay just for a stranger&#039;s second glance...

Other than that, I love my Capital One Rewards card. No foreign transaction fees, and $0 annual fee, plus 1% cash back. It&#039;s my stable, steady, FREE credit-building card. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We use a combination do 3 credit cards:
1) bank of America cash rewards but we got it when all purchases get 2% back and there is a 25% if you don&#039;t cash out until you hit $300.  That really means its a 2.25% cash back card on everything and no yearly fee
2) American Express Cash Preferred which as has been noted is 6% back on anything you buy in a grocery store, 3% on gas/department stores. This does have annual fees but the money back on groceries alone covers that.
3) Chase Freedom is last but not least.  The rotating categories of 5% are nice but the limit of only $75 back per quarter is a little sad.  At least no annual fees.

PS Check out the American Express Twitter page.  If you link your card, you can get some nice little cash back options.  So far got back $5 on a $5 purchase at McDonald&#039;s and $10 back on a $10 purchase at Best Buy.  Going today for the $20 back on a $75 Whole Foods purchase ( and we get the 6% cash back to boot)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been eye balling the Chase Freedom card for sometime, but simply haven&#039;t pulled the trigger. Mostly because my wife and I haven&#039;t been able to come to a decision on whether we&#039;d like to go with that card or a store discount card. It&#039;s a lesson on how indecision can cost you money. You post is a good reminder to come back to the conversation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally don&#039;t recommend either of the cards that are listed here, because beyond the sign up bonus, they&#039;re not really all that exciting. There are better things from Chase - last year I got the $50k Southwest points after one purchase which turned itno like $700 worth of southwest airfare or $500 worth of amazon gift cards. I canceled the card before the 2nd annual fee hit.

It really depends what categories people spend the most in - for me as a single dude who eats out alot as well as amazon, that means Citi Forward gets a lot of usage (I can barely read the numbers anymore - they are so faded) - 

I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a &quot;best&quot; card that can be targeted at everyone unless some credit card company goes bonkers in offering a huge % off every purchase indefinitely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes choosing a card is not about bonus points or interest rates but it can be about other things, like being valued as a customer and a person.
I used to do tech support for teleworkers.  One night a customer screamed at me like a lunatic for 15 minutes because I was unable to provide him with an ethernet cable longer than 6 feet and unfortunately he would have to buy his own cable. He repeatedly represented himself as an employee of Amex yet it never occurred to me that the person he was screaming at was an Amex customer or potential customer. Never will I do business with that company.]]></description>
