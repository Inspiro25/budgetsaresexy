					<description><![CDATA[You can also add something. I&#039;m doing a 40-day yoga challenge right now-- yoga and meditation every single day. Then I&#039;m going to do a 40-day &#039;walk&#039; challenge, a half hour walk every single day. I find positive initiatives are more motivating than giving up something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;MoneySmartGuides&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly - and the more excited you are, the more your chances of accomplishing them!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Not if you only give it up for one month! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;jefferson&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you&#039;d be a stronger man than I!  Though MY &quot;coffee shop&quot; = my kitchen, haha... so not as bad for me ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Wowww, good for you!  I&#039;m addicted that stuff!  I gave up sodas a few years ago for a while, and ever since I&#039;ve cut back to only a few a week (instead of 1-2 every day).  I&#039;ve never lasted as long as you have though, so that&#039;s a mighty fine accomplishment - well done :)
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - Noooooooooooooooo!!!  Maybe you&#039;ll have to buy enough to cover mine, so at least someone worthy wins &#039;em? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is how I refocused my energies for the year. Each month is a specific area of life I&#039;m wanting to improve or change, or just reinforce, and then I don&#039;t have to be pulled in a million other ways. I began Diet Coke detox early, on Jan 1, though it was part of my Feb plans. I&#039;m proud to say it&#039;s stuck, no DC since Jan 1. Thankfully I&#039;ve always been a water drinker, so that helps, and I&#039;m learning how it feels to cope in the tempting situations, and get past that and stick with my plans. So far, so good, no slippage! I believe my teeth will thank me later...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;MikeTheRed&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, now the beer one would be hard!  Although right now beer is the last thing on my mind after our bachelor party this weekend, haha... you can do it though!  This month&#039;s will be a nice test since it&#039;s already shortened ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Frugal Fries&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, exactly.  Not all habits are *bad* too, so if you can start doing more good habits over and over I can only assume your life will be a lot better :)
@&lt;b&gt;Yardwork&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  Go for it!  And then when you figure out how to do away w/ coffee, let me know please, ok? I&#039;m ADDICTED.  But I just love the way it makes me feel!! :)  (And freaky link btw, that&#039;s scary!! I can&#039;t drink it w/out sugar either.)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - I know, so much harder right?
@&lt;b&gt;Kristin&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, and also you&#039;re always giving up *some* amount of money no matter what you choose too, even if you switch back later.  I think it mainly gets rid of the unnecessary stuff in the grand scheme of things.
@&lt;b&gt;marilyn&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!  Like the Girl Scout cookies I just ate an hour ago :)  40 days without sweets and now I get to indulge! Haha... though I&#039;ll admit they didn&#039;t taste as good as I thought they would in my head... maybe I&#039;ll eat less going forward?
@&lt;b&gt;lora kathleen&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  Love that book - it&#039;s been by my bedside for a good 2 years now :)  It&#039;s the only one I&#039;ve ever re-read!
@&lt;b&gt;Modest Money&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, for sure.  And I&#039;ve also noticed that when you *stop buying sweets* it&#039;s a lot harder to eat too, haha... it sounds like a &quot;d&#039;uh&quot; thing to realize, but it&#039;s still just as true!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - There is cuz you stop spending money on *someting* each month, even if you go back to it the next - so it&#039;s temporary non-spending.  And odds are you&#039;ll start doing whatever habit you&#039;re into less too after a while, which also makes you spend less ;)  Though it def. depends on what, exactly, you&#039;re giving up.  I plan on going back to no cursing soon, which does nothing for my finances like you&#039;re saying.
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! I&#039;ve actually used it I think, if it&#039;s the same one that&#039;s in my head?  I gave up after a while just cuz it was another thing to pay attention to, but I def. like it in theory :)  And I&#039;m sure others would get a lot more out of it that&#039;s not tied to the internet so much like I am.
@&lt;b&gt;Meg&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, I like it!  Maybe I&#039;ll add in running for 15 mins since I can never get myself to do it ;)  Though I do walk a lot, which I love... if I knew it was only for a few weeks though, I&#039;d totally be more inclined to run with it(bah dum-ching!). Good call!
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; -  HAH! In that case, you need to start with a &quot;no spend&quot; month where you can only buy necessities ;)  That&#039;s what changed MY entire spending patterns! It&#039;s been like 4 years now and I go shopping like 1/10th of what I used to - it&#039;s awesome.  Though my wardrobe def. needs some new stuff in there, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;This Aggie Saves&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly!  I&#039;m thinking this is gonna be the start to something great :)
@&lt;b&gt;Matthew Doyle&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! I just learned the world doesn&#039;t end if I stop eating cookies or ice cream this month! Haha... and now that I can eat it again, I&#039;m gonna see how MUCH I end up doing... something tells me I&#039;ll only go back to eating a fraction of what I used to - I&#039;ve been feeling good lately!
@&lt;b&gt;MyMoneyDesign&lt;/b&gt; - I plan on it!  Now you have to join us ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh good one!  Very hard, but very worth it - let me know how it goes if you end up doing it. I bet you end up just drinking at your house on the cheap instead ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! I almost slipped already this afternoon, haha... but then I remembered! What are YOU gonna give up? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kurt @ Money Counselor&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah dude!  Your idea is brilliant - I love it :) Will most def. keep people in the loop as I swap them out each time, thanks for the thoughtful comment last month! Hope all is well :)]]></description>
