					<description><![CDATA[J - Yes it does.  I was just curious about how you maintained it at 10k even for so long.  Thanks for the explanation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great questions :)  Yes, it earns a little in its account, but not much (and it&#039;s also mixed with a bunch of my other money too - not separated out like I used to have it).  Currently we have the E. Fund in a Money Market Account... which is usually a tad higher than normal savings accounts, but still not much in the economy.  I know others like to put this money somewhere else to make more, but I like keeping it pretty liquid so I can pull from it at any point w/out worries. Hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J Money,

Besides this month your Emergency Savings was at a stable 10k.  Do you earn interest on it?  Where does that go?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;SB @ One Cent At A Time&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!  And to think that 5.5% was the rate we DID refinance at last year! Haha... unfortunately our house is too underwater to do much better right now though, so we&#039;re stuck with it until I can pay off more of those mortgages in order to get back on a level playing field.  My goal is to actually pay off the 2nd one completely and THEN refinance and get to cracking on knocking off the 1st one... just gonna take a handful of years :(  
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iHeartBudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Yikes, sorry to you too!  Your pictures look almost exactly what ours did too, haha... well done on swapping it out MUCH cheaper though than I did ;)  Let&#039;s hope we got a loooooong time until we have to do it again! Thanks for stopping by, bro - love the site name.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bummer on having to replace the water heater. It must be water heater death week. We had the same thing happen last weekend! I was actually a little bit excited to use the EF since it just sits there :)  I posted about it here: http://wp.me/p2p0FF-1b.

Great work on your net worth! You&#039;ll be at a million in no time! I can only hope I get in the positive sometime soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup, I actually think that&#039;s a great idea too :)  Which is why I max out my retirement account every year too, and THEN do mortgage on top of it.  Only I don&#039;t have a 401(k) anymore now that I&#039;m solo so I don&#039;t get those free matches (boooooo), but at least I can still put away a lot.  I think everyone&#039;s different in what they prefer though, and some would rather have a paid off house w/ less money in the bank than the opposite.  But either way it&#039;s a smart move!

Thanks for sharing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J have you thought about this idea in regards to paying your house off early. From an article I read on Oprah website.

Paying off your house early sounds like a financially smart move. And it&#039;s hard to put a price on peace of mind. But a study by two University of Texas professors and a Federal Reserve banker found that diverting that money instead to a 401(k) was a better move. It&#039;s a long academic study, but the key is this: You pay off your mortgage with after-tax dollars, which means that for every $1 you make, only 70 cents or so goes to the bank. 

Solution: Contribute pre-tax dollars to your 401(k), so the full buck goes in. Make that $1.50 if you get a company match. As that money compounds over the years, you come out far ahead. 

Just a thought...Best Regards]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All great comments guys, thanks for stopping by! :)

@&lt;b&gt;C The Writer&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s not fun :(  Why is that though?  You don&#039;t think tracking it and tweaking would help it go up over time? Or at least level out?
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - I now! I totally want to!  I&#039;ve started it but just havne&#039;t gone back and spent the time playing with it... on my list though! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kacie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, for sure - got a post coming out soon on it too ;)  I&#039;ve heard great things about that Honda minivan as well, but still not sold!
@&lt;b&gt;DebtsnTaxes&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!!!  But unfort. I&#039;m in the DC area :(  But I do visit Wisconsin a lot to meet up w/ my biz partner, so ya never know! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Devan&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s the main part I&#039;m afraid of right now - day care.  BUT, since I work from home and the Mrs. is out of Grad School now and at home, I&#039;m thinking we&#039;ll be good for at least 3-6 months until we need to get back to work life again and all that. And then we&#039;ll prob. do day care like 2-3 times a week or something, but not sure yet.  Haven&#039;t put *too* much time into it thus far... the 529 is more interesting to me at the moment ;)  Congrats on your soon to show up baby!!
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man, it is what it is, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;FB&lt;/b&gt; - Well, it&#039;s more of a psychological thing than anything.  You&#039;re right in that we have a huge &quot;e fund&quot; if we combine all savings accounts/etc, but we like to keep it divided up for stuff when things happen. So when major unexpected things come up like the water heater, we use our real, separated out, E fund for this.  Anything else in life hits the cash fund.  Not sure if it&#039;s the total best way to do things, but it works for us at the moment :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen2&lt;/b&gt; - Huh. That&#039;s not a bad idea actually... if you EXPECT to pay for unexpected stuff,  you don&#039;t get pissed off as much! Haha... I kinda like that :)  I think it&#039;ll still upset me, but you&#039;re right - setting $ aside for it particularly would probably make things a lot easier to handle.  Good thinkin&#039;!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Haha really??? I haven&#039;t even seen that yet.  Not sure I want to either, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Kris&lt;/b&gt; - Awww good!  I&#039;m glad you like them :)  Sometimes I wonder if I should continue doing them (don&#039;t want them to come off all &quot;Look at me! look at me! I have money!!!&quot;) so it&#039;s nice to hear they still inspire :)  that&#039;s my goal!!
@&lt;b&gt;fifi&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow! Cool!!!  Looking forward to learning about it :)  AND knowing you&#039;re &quot;real&quot; name and all, haha... that&#039;s def. scary indeed.  Good for you on just going for it though :)  I still can&#039;t talk about mine, but hopefully one day I&#039;ll be able to.  I don&#039;t think anyone really goes to it anyways, so it&#039;s not all that exciting ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah, but we&#039;re all in different situations so you&#039;re always allowed to complain! Even if just to yourself ;)  Congrats on the positive bump this round.
@&lt;b&gt;Long&lt;/b&gt; - Heck yeah I did ;)  And can you believe I was one of the only ones taking advantage of it?? Crazyyyyy... no one else thought it was that important, but I&#039;m freakin&#039; glad I did!
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Good!! Glad to hear that :)  Just trying to let poeple know it&#039;s *possible!*
@&lt;b&gt;BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - Haha no doubt my friend.  I don&#039;t mind negative cash flow every now and then - esp when I&#039;m buying up projects or investing back into them (which will allow for a LOT more cash flow later) - but yeah, for the most part I agree with you.  And I need to make sure I don&#039;t have too many down months either unless the up ones are killer ones ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeremy&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool!! Unfortunately neither link works for me though :(  Says I need permission?  Maybe you can edit settings to allow it to be public?  Excited to see :)
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, roger that.  Excited to watch it move into positive territory!]]></description>
