Hah - really?

You can def. connect all kinds of 3rd parties with them :) You usually have to go through like 3 security measures when you first hook them up which can get a bit much, but it definitely connects okay. I haven&#039;t done anything special at all to get it to work. Maybe they just state that in places for legal reasons? Have you tried connecting to any yet?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J,
So I noticed that although you use USAA,but you also use YNAB, Acorns and Digit.   USAA told me they don&#039;t connect with any third party apps due to security concerns. My question is...how&#039;d you pull that off? 
Thanks!]]></description>

Lots of good questions in here!

1) Keeping credit lines open even if you&#039;re not using is usually smartest since it helps with your debt-to-credit ratio (ie it shows you have tons of credit open but not using it all which means &quot;more responsible&quot; to banks. Even though it&#039;s the exact same thing if you were to just close them)

2) The investing vs Debt battle is always a hot one in personal finance. There&#039;s really no answer except for the one that makes the most sense to YOU and fits with your overall goals.

Some people base their decisions on emotions and what excites them more (like me) so I always pick that route, whereas others go w/ the numbers and what makes more sense factually - another fine way of doing it. And then of course there&#039;s the penalties/taxes on pulling money from one account to the other and whether that make sense or not.

So I can&#039;t help you there, but if you want to pose the question in our new $$ forums, i&#039;m sure the 350+ people there would love to discuss it :)

Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So here is a question that I hope can be answered.

I have around $3900 of credit card debt, spread over two credit cards -($3074.60) Bank of America Platinum Plus Mastercard and ($875.27) American Express Delta Gold Card.

However, I currently have 6 credit card accounts open. Any harm in leaving them open, or should I close all but 1-2?

I have around $20,000 in an investment account (wittled down from $65,000 unfortunately, to pay off student debt and other debt). Should I keep that $20K as a safety net, or drain to payy of more debt?]]></description>

Yeah, sorry about that... I&#039;ve mentioned it in the past but since I blog about them almost every month (hah) I don&#039;t always bring it up.

If you&#039;re still looking for an awesome bank though, check out Simple. Haven&#039;t tried myself but a ton of people rave about them. Here&#039;s a review my friend Will did for us who uses them:

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, new to this.  Thanks for what you do.  I was bummed to check out USAA bank only to find out I can&#039;t join because I, nor my family, was or is in the military.  If you mentioned that I missed it.  That&#039;s an important piece of the puzzle.

Thanks, Mark]]></description>
