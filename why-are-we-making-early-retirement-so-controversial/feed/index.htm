Thanks David! 

I have friends and relatives talking about working 40+ years. I figured if you work hard enough to save and invest, you can have the freedom to do whatever you like. 

Living that dream life or even that retired life seems like a fantasy to some, but to others, it can be a reality. We have to make a decision to pursue our dreams.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this teaching and think it’s real too. There are so many choices to started. But early retirement can be a good thing and also can be bad thing. Sometimes it becomes scary because still there is many things are pending due to less timing.]]></description>

Hey GG! I guess it depends on the way you tell people. Since the word &quot;retired&quot; has different meanings to everyone, you might want to explain your position in other words. Personally, I wouldn&#039;t hide the truth or mislead people into thinking you are working when you&#039;re not... Whenever I hear people say they&#039;re a &quot;consultant&quot; and give a very vague description of what they do, it prods more questions than answers. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent article! I really do think your ideas about being less judgmental and realizing that FIRE may be nearly impossible for some people is very important. I am 41 and 5-8 years away from FI. I am still undecided on what I will do when I reach FI. I really like my job and enjoy the social interactions at work. For me, right now, its more about the choice.

My experience with ingrained assumptions about a career mainly comes from comments from the Boomer generation. In particular, recently I heard someone (early 60&#039;s) say something along the lines that family head &quot;doesn&#039;t have a choice and just has to work until they get Social Security.&quot; I think culturally that is just what is expected as the norm, as you mention in your article.

I guess for me, I think if I do retire from working in a traditional job in my mid-late 40&#039;s I probably will keep that to myself mainly. I will probably tell people I am a consultant working from home, etc. which would be true because I plan to keep working on multiple income streams in retirement anyway. Is it wrong that I feel like I might hesitate to tell people I&#039;m retired (if I get there?)]]></description>

I can definitely see how it seems this way!  But... have you ever been to a Camp FI or any ChooseFI meetup groups? They are filled with a bunch of early retirees and FIRE peeps who are *not* bloggers. In fact they are a really weird/fun bunch of overachievers with interesting hobbies, different backgrounds and various aspirations. Many are trying to figure out what&#039;s &quot;next&quot; in life.

Totally agree about MMM spending his time elsewhere from the blog. But I also understand it truly brings him joy which is why he comes back to it now and then :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not ascribe to any of the following, yet I ask the questions:

- Is there a concern of early retirees not adding to Social Security or Medicare through traditional means?

- Are the  human emotions of jealousy or contempt rearing?

- Is something not understood when collectively looking at a group versus an individual?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s weird about FIRE to me is that it&#039;s overrepresented by people who seem to just retire....in order to write blogs about retiring. That makes it hard to take seriously their financial advice and their insistence that they no longer need to make money. It also makes the devotees seem dull. My husband calls the FIRE blogs I read &quot;the dreary people&quot; and it&#039;s not because he&#039;s a spendthrift - it&#039;s because no one ever seems interested in writing novels or learning another language or joining the peace corps or learning judo with their spare time. I guess it&#039;s possible that the really interesting early retirees are too busy to bother with blogs, but it makes FIRE blogs about net worths and savings rates a real slog. I mean, if you have enough money to meet your needs it&#039;s not that complicated to save more of it.

I actually like that MMM never posts and hangs out building houses all day. That&#039;s what you would do if you had outside interests and had gotten your feelings about money off your chest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good to see you on here, Steve!

I remember one of my friends in college tried to tell me, &quot;yeah.. make sure to enjoy college as much as possible and don&#039;t stress, you&#039;re gonna be working 40+ years after college&quot;. 

I IMMEDIATELY quipped &quot;I&#039;M not gonna be working for 40+ years&quot;. He didn&#039;t know what to say. Early retirement will be awesome!]]></description>

Yeah, the 800 year old FIRE stuff is pretty cool. Reminds me of The Richest Man in Babylon. Slowly growing wealth, climbing out of debts, earning your own freedoms etc. The principles have been there forever :)]]></description>
