					<description><![CDATA[I had to throw it all in before the tax year ended for 2010 ;)  This year I&#039;m gonna throw some in over time and hopefully get it maxed as far as I&#039;m allowed... but we&#039;ll see.  Still only been 3 months since being on my own so gotta make sure I&#039;m playing it safe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting, really?  Never heard that but I wouldn&#039;t doubt it.  Although, if the car seekers and sellers are both using KBB to buy &amp; sell, then it doesn&#039;t really matter in that regard :)  That&#039;s the only tool I&#039;ve ever used but it&#039;s def. good to keep in mind. Thx for the insight my man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a quick note... KBB is known in the auto industry for inflating resell prices of an Auto of about 3-5%.  Not to put a damper on your finances, but just something to be aware of.  Regardless, great job this month :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Gotta happen sometime!
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  Are you investing too?
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, running the numbers is like the highlight :) Good job getting that e-fund set up.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Yayyyyyyy! Congrats!  that&#039;s def. something :)  I never checked out how Mint&#039;s net worth stuff goes, but yeah - once you find a method that WORKS for you, as simple or complicated it is, you just gotta roll with it and start tracking that progress.  It&#039;s fun!  Esp when it goes up ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great idea - I need to calculate our net worth on a simple list like this. I use Mint, but I don&#039;t always trust their net worth number. 

That said, I felt like commenting so I could toot my own horn - I just paid off my first student loan today! It didn&#039;t really affect my net worth (I pulled $300 out of savings to pay it off), but it was an awesome psychological victory :) Now I just have another $100k or so left to go...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of the month is always the best (other than having to pay for rent). I love doing up the numbers and checking out my net worth. 

It&#039;s nice to finally have an emergency fund set up and making me money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking good there for an unemployed guy. ;)
Last month was pretty flat for us. Our portfolio had a good chunk of international and emerging market funds so that took a beating from all the unrest around the globe. Hopefully, things will quite down and everyone get on with the business of making money soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Rachel&lt;/b&gt; - Well, technically its &quot;Assets&quot; minus &quot;liabilities&quot; but everyone tends to calculate their worth depending on their own situation.  Which I like :)  Cuz the whole purpose (in my opinion) is to give you a good overall sense of your own finances.  And then use it to track your progress over the months.

Some people don&#039;t like to put their cars and homes in it, but I do since there&#039;s usually a &quot;debt&quot; that comes along with it too.  It wouldn&#039;t make sense for me to not put in my home&#039;s est value, when I owe $350k on it ya know?  Unless I take out both sides of the equation (which some also do).  Same goes with cars and anything else you want to put in there.  IN fact, some people don&#039;t even put their investments in there because they say it&#039;s not &quot;real&quot; - so really it comes down to personal preference.

I just add up all my accounts and major property, as you can see in that graphic up there, and then deduct all my debts.  To me, that&#039;s exactly what I want to focus on every month.  This help? :)

@&lt;b&gt;Too Funny&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I think you&#039;re actually right on that one.  Only thing that I pause on is if I need to pull it back out for whatever reason... I know you CAN do that (at least the parts you put in), but I try my best to never touch any of those accounts once the money&#039;s in there.  I don&#039;t like tempting myself, so if it goes in, it&#039;s in there forever ;)  This is why I keep it more liquid in a savings or money market acccount -- it&#039;s my &quot;everyday&quot; money if needed.

@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - GREAT question!  I *should* put it toward the highest % rate every month until that one dies, and then switch over to the lesser rate, but that just doesn&#039;t motivate me for whatever reason.  I like to knock out the lowest amount first cuz it feels easier (and faster!) so instead I just round up BOTH payments to the 1st and 2nd mortgages and do them at the same time.  Financially smart?  No.  Emotionally smart? Yes.  To me at least ;) There&#039;s no point in me doing what&#039;s technically right if I end up quitting due to lack of motivation.

@&lt;b&gt;Austin&lt;/b&gt; - Holla holla!  Congrats to you too, sir.  I think our monies shall keep on trending up! :)

@&lt;b&gt;Jon the Saver&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh la la!  Going for the big commitment, eh?  Congrats dude - don&#039;t forget to invite me to the wedding!  I&#039;m good at drinking beer and dancing like a white boy ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... so you&#039;re just gonna call YOURSELF then? :)  Oh wait, you&#039;re in another department.... just walk over there!

@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Balls!  Sorry to here Jenna :(  I hope it fixes whatevers broken for good!  Car troubles are the worst.]]></description>
