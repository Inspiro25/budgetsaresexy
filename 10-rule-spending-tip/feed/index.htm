					<description><![CDATA[I sometimes think in terms of how many hours my son would have to work in order to pay for the pile of clothes I&#039;m buying for him, or how much the driving school costs.  He earns $10 an hour, so it&#039;s easy to see how many hours he would need to work in order to pay for items.  Sometimes I point it out.  My kids are pretty frugal, at least with their own money.

God willing, there will come a time when my kids can pay for all their own expenses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just talking about this with an attorney today. My husband was ran over by a car last week while stopped at an intersection on his bike.  {Driver was texting} He will be out of work for 6-9 months.  Not only will he have lost wages, but what about the money he is not putting into his retirement accounts? Missing that 10% contribution is going to cost us much more than the actual contribution amount. 

PS: husband is okay. The driver had no assets and minimal coverage. We are in for a bumpy ride.]]></description>

maybe start multiplying at 5? haha... I always advise people to just stop and track all money in and out for 3 months which will REALLY be eye opening to them. And consequently (hopefully) will get them to change their habits more... Or at least KNOW what they&#039;re spending/saving now rather than guessing in their heads - that was one thing I learned super fast when paying attention to my money... I was losing like $300 a month when I thought I was SAVING $300-$500 a mo! Pretty dumb of me.]]></description>

Haha, I believe you may be referring to Ramit from IWillTeachYouToBeRich :) Which I actually love - the whole &quot;spend your money on whatever it is that excites you.&quot; You just need to prioritize and then cut out costs in areas you don&#039;t care about at all.... So for people like me who don&#039;t mind spending $4 on a cup of coffee every single day (or 10!), as long as we&#039;re not doing that in all areas across the board we&#039;re fine. I remember he mentioned a guy who spent thousands of dollars on mountain bikes cuz he loved to race a lot, and in return he lived in a tiny ass place cuz his home wasn&#039;t as important. So to many he was &quot;stupid&quot; for spending so much on bikes like that, but the reality was he was consciously spending wisely based on his priorities. I&#039;ve always liked that example.]]></description>

Agreed!! If this were called the &quot;8 Rule&quot; it would already be too confusing to really care about trying, haha...]]></description>
