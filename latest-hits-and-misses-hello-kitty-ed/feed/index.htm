					<description><![CDATA[I would like to amend my comment. Friday afternoon resulted in another financial hit: My husband got offered a full-time writing/editing gig that will increase our yearly income by nearly 20%.  We can now extra-afford the two car payments, build our savings back up even faster, AND pay down off our student loans sooner, AND have a little extra spending money on top of it!  Can you tell I&#039;m doing a happy dance over here?? ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well I lucked out! No Hello Kitty microwave for us ;) We ended up just replacing the same one we had, but the updated version - mainly because we loved the color (red) and The Mrs corrected me in saying we had it for FOUR years, and not ONE, haha... oops. I&#039;d be okay if this one broke after 4 years too :)

Here&#039;s the one we got if you wanna see: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014E65YQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0014E65YQ&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Emerson MW8999RD 900 Watt Microwave Oven&lt;/a&gt;

On Amazon it goes for $100+, but at Target right now it&#039;s only $65 (down from $75 originally). So it still feels like we got a good deal here. And now life resumes as normal!

@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - They&#039;ve got some killer social media watching going on - good for them! (Turns out our microwave was Emerson, not GE)
@&lt;b&gt;Manette @ Barbara Friedberg Personal Finance&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah, that would have been a good idea had I not used it to fill our savings back up from our latest 529 dump for Baby Money ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Dee Dee&lt;/b&gt; - NICE!!! Way to go!! You&#039;re so right, though in a way they WERE the ones who told you there was $1k was waiting for you, so I don&#039;t fault them at all for asking for a finders fee - it would have been well worth it either way :) But of course putting in the time and effort to do the research pays off too, so in the end you def. win! Congrats!

Here&#039;s a post I did on that &quot;missing money&quot; stuff too, if it helps anyone out there:

					<description><![CDATA[I got a suspicious piece of snail mail from mymoneyfinder.com claiming that my deceased mother had $1000 in unclaimed property.  For the fee of 15% they were willing to help me claim this amount as the rightful heir.

&quot;Hmmmm&quot;, I thought, &quot;if there is really unclaimed property out there it should show up on my state treasury&#039;s webpage.&quot;  So I checked, and sure enough....there it was.  I filed the necessary paperwork with the state treasurer and will soon have a $1000 check in my pocket without paying a ridiculous finders fee.  I urge all readers to search for unclaimed property.  

In Wisconsin where I live, I do it here:  https://statetreasury.wisconsin.gov/UCPWeb/ucpsearch.aspx
You can also search nationwide by going to www.missingmoney.com

You shouldn&#039;t have to PAY to get money back that is yours!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Hello Kitty microwave looks cute. But just the same, I will not suggest getting it. If you want to save some cash, you can scour Craigslist or eBay auction for used microwave. On the other hand, you can use part of the reimbursement check from your health insurance to get a new microwave.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wrote a tweet that said I Hate GE. My grandpa was right to never buy a GE product because they always break. I didn&#039;t even @ them and they found it, tweeted me, and set me up with their good quick customer service department. It was amazing and they gave me a $90 good will certificate toward a new ge microwave... I just hope this one doesn&#039;t die.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Enjoy the weekend everyone!

@&lt;b&gt;Renee S&lt;/b&gt; - Oh that&#039;s true. I&#039;m pretty shocked that never entered my brain yet! Thanks :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mandy @MoneyMasterMom&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo! Meet you there? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance@MoneyLife&amp;More&lt;/b&gt; - What? Really? That is awesome!! I&#039;m pretty sure mine is GE too and that it&#039;s also been around a year! What if it&#039;s exactly 1 month after like yours?? Hmmm.... totally researching this.
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Astonishly we&#039;ve lasted almost 3 whole days so far, I&#039;m pretty impressed with ourselves! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, but fresh paint on a house??? Make it look soooooo much better and newer! Totally worth the investment for sure, good job :) Also that it was your money and not mine, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jon @ PayMyStudentLoans.com&lt;/b&gt; - For sure, and I&#039;m ready to be done with it.
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s a much better outcome than I was initially thinking! But still sucks you have to shell out all that money around the same time :( Here&#039;s to being smart with it all though!
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats! That&#039;s excellent news :) If/when you ever have kids you&#039;ll have to pass it on down for all generations to come!
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, in most circumstances it would be much better to do it yourself and save the money with that kinda stuff (powerwashing), but the time and effort involved would kill my work for a week and just not worth it in our case. Plus, I&#039;m starting to realize it&#039;s okay to pay for things you don&#039;t want to do as long as you make up for it in other areas :) And have the money budgeted aside, of course. I&#039;ve long sinced known I&#039;m not Superman, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - No hits or misses at all? Wow... you&#039;re much smoother than I.
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.... I remember you talking about him before :) I love your family so much.
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa@LittleHouseintheValley&lt;/b&gt; - We&#039;ll see how serious she is when we go to get a new one this weekend ;)]]></description>
