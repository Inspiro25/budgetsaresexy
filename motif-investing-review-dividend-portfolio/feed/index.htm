I started with $500 and only tried it for a year - way too early to be able to tell if it was successful or not really, I just eventually wanted to streamline all my accounts into one spot and main strategy so I pulled the money out and added it to my index fund elsewhere. I didn&#039;t even look at the monthly or yearly ROI but I feel like it was still around $500 by the end? I remember it hadn&#039;t moved drastically one way or the other.

(Keep in mind though that it&#039;s all dependent on the stocks you invest in - not the vehicle you use all the way (ie motif or elsewhere). If you pick crap stocks they&#039;re going to be crap no matter where you invest, haha.... Which again is why I went back to index investing - I like having my money across the entire field of stocks and I&#039;m fine with average market gains :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello J. Money-

I&#039;ve been thinking investing in motif platform. However, since you had experience with motif. I just have a couple of questions.

Q1: What is your starting investment?
Q2: How long you had it with Motif?
Q3: What is the Monthly, Yearly ROI?

Thank you in advance. 

Have a Magnificent day of living.

Good to know - will update, thanks!

(I&#039;ve since pulled my money from them and went back to indexing full-time, so not &quot;in the know&quot; anymore... though it was a fun experiment for a while :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FYI, starting on May 15th, 2017, Motif will begin charging $10 semi-annually on inactive accounts with a balance of less than $10,000.

You&#039;ll probably want to update your article to reflect this.]]></description>

I think if you like researching and buying stocks it&#039;s a great platform. Especially the more creative you are. If you&#039;re a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; type of person, I&#039;d recommend going elsewhere and a different investing strategy altogether. 

So hard to give it a rating out of 1-10 just cuz it depends on what you&#039;re looking to do :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thinking about opening an account with Motif and in doing my research I can across your blog.  What would you rate this experience on a scale of 1-10 and is it good for long term investment?]]></description>

I think I landed around the 13th place of the group. So not that well :) Then again, it&#039;s all a long term thing than short, so wasn&#039;t really planning on outperforming many much. I just xferred out my money last week so I can apply it back to the #1 post - my Vanguard index fund :) Was a fun one to try out though!]]></description>

So hard to answer without knowing you, your goals, your risk levels, age, etc, etc. But do know this - investing in something is better than investing $0.00 in nothing! :) You&#039;ll learn and figure it out if you keep googling and reading blogs. Check out some of the links in my blogroll as many of these bloggers talk about investing and such:

https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/blogroll

I&#039;d also consider looking into index funds and similar (even target date funds) so you can invest and be less active in it if you&#039;re worried about what you&#039;re doing. Whatever you do just don&#039;t chase the &quot;hot&quot; stocks! You&#039;re in it for the long haul and won&#039;t be touching the $$ for years and years and years (hopefully).

Good luck, and keep researching!]]></description>
