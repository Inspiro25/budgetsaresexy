					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever had a dream like this before (you must be more frugal than me: ha ha). But I can tell you, it is important to live each day to the fullest because we are not guaranteed how long it will last.

When my kids were growing up I made it a point to be at every event. Every ballgame, school event, and practice. And when I was with them, I was not on the phone or ignoring them in anyway, I wanted to be present. Now that they are in college, I am so glad I approached it that way.

All the best.]]></description>

Nope - my dreams have been so vivid lately (literally every single night for the past two months since waking up at 5!) that they stick with me for the better half of a day. And some - like this one - for many days!]]></description>

Yes! I&#039;ve seen it and actually blogged about it before! Brilliant movie indeed. And I guarantee if it were for real we&#039;d all chose to do things differently in our lives!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Time is really important. That&#039;s why I am making sure that every second is spent productively that I couldn&#039;t afford to waste time with trivial things. When it&#039;s time of working, I work. When it&#039;s of having fun, I enjoy. That is how I spend my time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a bizarre dream!  I think I am most impressed that you remembered it.  I usually forget mine as soon as I wake up!  
No way I&#039;d ever trade $100k for a year.  I&#039;d miss too much of my young daughters life!  That&#039;s actually the same reason why I had to quit working for my terrible employer when she was born.  Just couldn&#039;t see myself continuing to be miserable working there while trying to be a mom.  There would have been lots of &quot;lost&quot; time that way as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t sure if this was real or not at first.  Way to get me thinking about life insurance .  Often times investing and reading about finances is fun, but getting things in order for the unexpected is something I always seem to put off until tomorrow.  One day that tomorrow won&#039;t be there.. It&#039;s pretty awesome that you got the idea to write this from a dream. Do you keep a pen and paper next to you while you sleep?]]></description>
