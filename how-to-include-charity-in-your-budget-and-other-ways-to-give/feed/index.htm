					<description><![CDATA[I like how you said that giving to charity should be fun and we shouldn&#039;t feel any shame about what we are or aren&#039;t able to give. My husband and I have talked about using some of our holiday budget to donate to a local charity to help disadvantaged kids in our area. Thanks for teaching me about his mindset we can have to keep a positive outlook and continue to donate to charity.]]></description>

So good to hear this Emma! Just knowing that I have a budget for charity makes it easier to give incrementally throughout the month. I agree that giving small amounts directly (tips, donations to friends, etc) makes me feel better than large amounts.  Thanks for your feedback and great work over in India! I&#039;d love to take a trip like that one day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article, it is a very inspiring one! 
Having worked a few months as a full-time volunteer in India, I totally agree with the following statement that you made: “sometimes I feel my time is more valuable than money” and I observed the truth of this statement during my volunteer time. Charities, of course, need money, but once they have this money, it is worth nothing if they don’t have people that do something with it. Sometimes gathering motivated and talented volunteers is harder than raising funds! Moreover coming up with a great project idea can, at the end, raise more money than once could have donated.
To add to your point “pay it forward”, I often also find it easier to pay people small amounts on the spot and to see directly who I am giving my money to, rather than donating one big amount every month. Also, as I feel we should value good work, I often like to pay a little bit more than what I was asked for when good work was done. For instance, I am always going to the same tailor when my clothes/bags are broken, and he is doing a fantastic job. So, I am almost always tipping him.
I hope that your article will encourage people to donate more. In my case, it does!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some great ideas there, the write a prisoner one is not one I&#039;ve come accross before reminds me of the &quot;Social Return on Investment&quot; that the Crisis homeless charity discuss. One approach I&#039;ve taken is creating a specific brokerage account where any dividends from the shares are donated. So in a nutshell it involves putting money regularly into the account and any dividends are automatically paid back into a bank account where the funds are then transferred to a charity through a bank transfer. I&#039;ve gone into more detail here:

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed your ideas about how you can donate to charity. When you think about donations, you think money. There are other things that can be donated or if you don&#039;t have money, maybe you could donate you time. I also feel warm and good inside when I donate to a charity, church, or someone in need. I know that the world is going through some tough times, so now is the perfect time to think about how you could add charity into you budget and life.]]></description>

Cheers Jacq! I just learned about Audubon - my aunt and uncle are hard core bird watchers. What a cool cause. Having money already budgeted always makes it easier to say yes to those spur of the moment donations when someone asks.
Thanks for all you do, and have a great weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As things this year weren&#039;t &#039;normal&#039; I donated to the Audubon in support of a bird of Mom&#039;s choice for Mother&#039;s day. She doesnt need another knickknack, or plant/ flowers to care for and we both can feel good about the gift.
I&#039;ve gotten unexpected money and as it was not planned for I decided to give to charities with the abundance. 
I usually budget $x per month for charity with some months designated for association with a person, but some months &#039;free&#039; so when a request comes in to sponsor a charity race etc, I have some flexibility. 
Your comment about yoga, I am a yoga teacher and sometimes teach for a good cause as a way to give back. (Before the pandemic). Sometimes donating my time is also just easier to not have to worry about taxes for the income too.
Thanks for a fun creative post!]]></description>
