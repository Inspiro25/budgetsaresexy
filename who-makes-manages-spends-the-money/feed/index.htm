					<description><![CDATA[This has changed in our household over the years.  I started out as the primary &quot;maker&quot; and &quot;spender&quot; and my wife was the manager.  We sucked at finances so she basically gave up.  She was good at managing, but I was terrible...at everything...relating to money.  That&#039;s when I started managing the money even though I didn&#039;t know what I was doing.  Well, since then I have read over 100 books on finances and even started my own finance blog.  I did a complete 360 and now I actually know where are money is going and we invest regularly.  It&#039;s nice to have a clue as to what we are doing!  We are headed in the right direction now for sure.  Thanks for the article!]]></description>

Aww, well I&#039;m sure he&#039;s just happy to be out with you and spending quality time :) Maybe on the next one you can surprise him and pay! And if you plan it early and find the right coupons/etc it won&#039;t cost you as much? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. 60/40 in my favour. Could be more even but I&#039;m happy with that. B+
2. 70/30 in my favour. I do all the more technical stuff and some bills. But Mrs TFS also helps out with some of it. A
3. About 50/50 if I&#039;m really honest. There was a bit of a time last when I tried to stop spending money on crap and it took a while for Mrs TFS to see the light and join me. But we&#039;re both pretty good these days. A!

Great way to reflect on finances even if you think you are doing well in each category. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. It&#039;s about 60/40 right now with me being the 40. 
2. We manage our own money because we haven&#039;t combined finances, but we do run by each other on bigger purchases, who is going to put money towards what this month. Well, sometimes...
3. We both do, but he tends to spend more because I earn less and it makes me feel a bit guilty when he buys dinner out almost every time.]]></description>

Hah! An interesting combo indeed. But REALLY good you have a grasp on how each other works so you can formulate those plans like you&#039;re doing. I&#039;d be all about getting rid of that 2nd mortgage too - that&#039;s the best feeling in the world!! (At least I imagine it is - still aways to go for us :()... Hopefully you&#039;ll be able to sell that fancy pants camera of his and recoup a chunk of that money later ;) To be applied to the 2nd mortgage, of course.]]></description>
