					<description><![CDATA[Welcome Yesenia!  Thanks so much for stopping by, I&#039;m glad you like the site :)  Money was the last thing on my mind at 21 (well, besides WANTING a lot of it, haha...) so good for you on taking control early on.  You don&#039;t have to be perfect with it all or anything, but as long as you&#039;re 80% there you&#039;ll be fine ;)  Keep on staying motivated!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome! I am 21 and have been following your blog for some time now. I don&#039;t feel so alone!

I have been reading up to get a head start of my finances. I have been managing my finances pretty well. Not great, though. I definitely know that some of the cash that I spent could have been used differently, but this is minor purchases.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Meghan Fife&lt;/b&gt; - You guys should have some sort of convention ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ken&lt;/b&gt;- Yup!  Gotta leak some good stuff into those brains of theirs before they&#039;re old and stubborn.
@&lt;b&gt;LeanLifeCoach&lt;/b&gt; - I think most people earn at least a million over their lifetime, pretty crazy if you think about it.
@&lt;b&gt;CoffeeCents&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks for stopping by Popick!  We&#039;re all supporting you with this endeavor ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; - The others are coming soon from what I hear. Should be good stuff.
@&lt;b&gt;kt&lt;/b&gt; -  Oh yeah!  Living in the &quot;real world&quot; can go much farther sometimes...although learning in the classroom is smart too, just different kinds of learning going on ya know?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i started thinking about making money and getting into investing when i turned twenty and for the past few years, i have been aggressively trying to built a portfolio of businesses and increase my financial education. some of them have not gone so well(gross understatement considering the disastrous failures that some business ventures have ended as). but i am learning and i am so sure that i will be very very extremely rich at a relatively young age(so that i retire in a nice place and get a jet). strange that you learn more in a single venture than most of the college lectures i have ever attended]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the awesomely awesome comments folks.  I&#039;ve been doing this on and off for a few years and finally am getting around to formalizing the approach.  I&#039;m thrilled to say that CoffeeCents will be expanding to multiple DC campuses in fall 2010.  I&#039;m right now working on a much better website and finishing the downloadable content.

Please distribute the PPT as much as anyone would like.  

And Keith, yes, I do have plans on scaling up.  I&#039;m planning on a 501c3 filing over the summer to ramp it up and provide some structure.  If anyone out there would like to participate through leading sessions based on the CC&#039;s core strategy (aka the PPTs), please let me know.  I&#039;ve been doing this because I&#039;m passionate about PF education and its a useful way for PF bloggers to stop talking to each other and start talking to the folks who don&#039;t read our blogs!  (Hopefully afterwards they do!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. - Great job on getting out there and making a difference. No doubt, it is never too late to start but starting young is so much easier! 

I actually went back and calculated where I would be had I started young. If you could conjure up the tone and accent of Marlon Brando &quot;I coulda been a millionaire!&quot; 

It will still happen, just later (a lot later) than it could have.]]></description>
