					<description><![CDATA[Very informative publish, love the way in which you write and I think that the data helps in a way. I do not normally say this, however I think this can be a great job done. In the event you prefer to exchange links, I might be very happy to offer a link again to your site. Hope to listen to from you soon. Cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still battling my property taxes! We bought our house for $225K in November 2010. They assessed our house at $395K in March 2011, and taxed us accordingly!! We filed an appeal, and last week, they sent a letter telling us they denied the appeal, so now we have to show up in person for a &quot;hearing.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d put the extra $1400 straight to my student loans.  I&#039;m graduating the first week of May and an extra $1400 would enable me to pay it off 2 weeks before graduation instead of on graduation.  Congrats on the refund.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - The haters are gonna hate, right? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Burk&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks :)  I hope not too!  I think it&#039;s stabilized over the past 1-2 years, so fingers crossed it stays that way... unless it wants to go up, of course ;) Have a good weekend.]]></description>

The case he got is pretty awesome. It&#039;s got a window in it so you can see the insides of the computer :)
(P.S. Love your response to Bill... I need to do better at responding nicely to people who insult me/others.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, a couple fun adventures in the works - that&#039;s cool :)  I don&#039;t know how they don&#039;t find out about the baby&#039;s sex too!  I feel like somewhere between all the office visits that someone would blurt it out, or they&#039;d see it on paperwork, or something by accident, ya know?  Cool if they can pull it off, but def. tricky I feel.  I kinda wanted to wait for our new one too, but the Mrs. was pretty adamant about knowing (so we can plan/etc) so we&#039;ll find out here in the next cple months - woohoo!
@&lt;b&gt;Bill&lt;/b&gt; - They do in this case, and as you can see in 75% of the others here leaving comments too.  Friend.
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  I admire people who are smart enough to put computers together like that, it sounds fund :)  One of my old co-workers used to do that as a hobby, and would get all kinds of awesome looking cases and lights/fans/etc.  He made this one black one w/ neon blue emanating from the entire thing, haha... it was dope.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We received a VERY generous check from my grandmother for Christmas. We took 10% for electronics--my husband had asked for parts to build a new computer for Christmas, and he was able to buy the rest of the parts and have my brother, the computer engineer, help him build it while he was still in town for the holidays. I also got a piece of that to buy an external hard drive--I&#039;ve scanned the majority of what was in our filing cabinet so it&#039;s not taking up physical space, but it was taking up lots of space on my laptop! Then the other 90% went toward paying off my husband&#039;s student loan debt--we cut the remaining balance almost in half and should have it paid off by the end of 2012!]]></description>
