					<description><![CDATA[One thing you/ your attorney might want to investigate, depending on the laws where you live, is do a UCC search with the Secretary of State and find out what financing statements are on file - if they company has a loan secured by business assets such as machinery &#038; equipment, accounts, general intangibles, chattel paper or government payments it would be recorded there.    As your Judgment is for past wages, that would be a priority debt and depending on what assets the company has left versus what they still owe the their creditors, the creditor might consider paying the Judgment to keep a priority position on the assets.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way to go J$! On the collection side though, you can totally do this! When companies go out of business, everyone gets in line who is owed money from them. The good news is that former employees who are owed back wages move to the front of the line. Thus, you will get paid before they have to payback their line of credit from the bank, you just need to get in line.
But the other thing you can do is pull their credit report/DnB. It costs around $30, but it will tell you where all their active banks are. And if they have a line of credit somewhere and you serve the bank with your judgement - BAM! They can take it out of their line of credit. 
Anyway, my point is that you can get the money and it&#039;s not that hard. We did this succesfully with a back wages thing earlier this year. The guy didn&#039;t pay, so we used their credit report to find the $$$. And we sure found it too! And got paid back everything!]]></description>
