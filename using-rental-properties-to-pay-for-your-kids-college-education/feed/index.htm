529s are great :) One of the first things I set up as soon as a baby is born!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I am super into rental properties...and I bought a house for my first kid.
I stopped for two reasons. 
1 - Its more work and paperwork complex than just dumping money into an index fund in an education account.
2 - You miss out on tax benefits of 529 accounts!

Houses are the ideal way to invest money that can&#039;t go into tax-sheltered accounts but if you don&#039;t hide your money from the taxman using your kid&#039;s investments you are really missing a once in a lifetime opportunity.]]></description>

More control over it maybe? Since you pick the properties/tenants/game plan?]]></description>

$60K to a million in 34 years (assume they bought in 1985) is 8.74% annually. Assuming it was leveraged and they spend 5 hours a week of stress and elbow grease to make it work they made about $56 bucks an hour (if my math is right) - and this was tax deductible instead of taxed. Seems pretty good.]]></description>

Haha..

5 cents that can be worth a helluva lot more down the road for some if they don&#039;t take everything into consideration!

Thanks for dropping this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the concept, but don&#039;t think I would want to force my kid to be a property manager. I used to own multiple duplexes, triplexes, and quads, but I stay away from them now. Heres why:

1.) Higher turnover

2.) Disputes between tenants and I have to get involved in the drama

3.) I have to cut or pay to cut the grass and do the landscaping

4.) I have to pay water and/or common area electric or gas

5.) I like the ability to move into the property for two years before I sell, in this case, the kid(s), could move into if you deed it over to them, and avoid capital gains tax, which would be pro-rated for a multi-unit property.

That&#039;s five cents! Have a great day!]]></description>

I&#039;m all for being prepared but in this situation I&#039;d be putting the cart before the horse 100%. I have at least 20 years before my hypothetical child would even go to college. It&#039;s booked marked as an idea to visit if I do have kids!]]></description>
