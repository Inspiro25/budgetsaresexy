Oh, believe me, I am all for taking legitimate deductions, but the manner in which Buffet does it seems like he&#039;s getting a charitable deduction for giving money to himself. And the avoidance of estate taxes for himself while preaching higher ones for everyone else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There will be a moment to the people who read your blog as well as other blogs. At least they are interested in what you and other financial bloggers write about. That&#039;s a great start. I was just like that. I read some articles from a financial blog then I started tracking my net worth, actively involved in investing and addicted to frugal living. About a year later, I am about to double my previously net worth. The time will come to the people.

Thanks for sharing as always!

I do keep hearing that millennials are better with savings and owning less &quot;stuff&quot;/ etc. No idea if it&#039;s accurate but I&#039;m going to believe it and remain happy :)]]></description>

I can&#039;t speak for the controlling of money/farm part, but I don&#039;t personally think there&#039;s anything wrong with getting a tax write off when you donate. I have to believe it&#039;s helped raise a LOT more money (and done a lot more good!) w/ that perk in place than without. Regardless of the true intentions of doing so...

Not trying to convince you to like Buffett or anything, just wanted to jump in on the deduction part real quick :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awe if I&#039;d know that line was your favorite I would have written it more eloquently. lol! I&#039;m so happy you created a forum where people can openly be proud and declare their achievements! Because you&#039;re right if we had national money suck day, we could easily find a reason why we suck because we are negative bias. We do need to celebrate each accomplishment, no matter how big or small. So thanks!]]></description>
