I&#039;ve been reading comments here with interest. My daughter was a BA, although she called it promotional modeling, in the Metro Detroit area. She started with an agency, but that didn&#039;t get her too far, she did much better with her own networking. You must be an approachable, outgoing person that loves to talk, besides being nice on the eyes. And young. By the time she was 30 she knew she&#039;d lost any competitive advantage, even though she was still beautiful, strong, athletic and very personable. So yes, you probably would do better if you are younger, preferably early 20&#039;s. But, it can lead to great things. My daughter got in to the alcohol brands, and that lead to a job as a Brand Ambassador (real title, it&#039;s really a managerial position) for a major specialty vodka company with her client base covering all of Michigan and Ohio. Great money, great benefits! With her great networking and just wonderful working relationships she was recruited by another alcohol company that has a portfolio of hundreds of brands, with a specialty in bourbon. (And no, she hasn&#039;t been replaced even tho it&#039;s been 3 months since she left).  Now she is learning a different aspect of that industry. So, if you want to try becoming a BA, it can certainly be something rewarding, if you stick with it, are good at it and network, network, network! Oh, and the worst job she ever had being a BA was working for The History Channel at the Michigan International Speedway, wearing a shirt that had a tv on her belly (and she&#039;d rooked her sister in to working with her that day!). It was great money but she said it really wasn&#039;t worth it! But it made for a funny story, that day...]]></description>
