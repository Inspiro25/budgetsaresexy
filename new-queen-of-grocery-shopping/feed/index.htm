Hey - nice to meet you! Welcome to the community! Hell yeah I find stuff!! :) Pocket change and (rarely) jewelry when at the beach, and then whenever I go near civil war battlefield sites I tend to get lucky too... Of course, the ratio to time spent vs finding treasures is usually laughable, but it def. makes for a fun hobby in either case. Half the fun is just digging stuff up and playing &quot;what if&quot; :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good on you for getting your medical stuff sorted, I’ve recently FIRE’d and with a lot more time on my hands have actually been properly adulting in this regard too, seeing an ongoing physio has been super helpful for my back condition (I have spondylitis which is similar to your condition). 

Also… I am curious about the metal detector. Does it really work and have you actually found anything cool yet?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the Tats, J!  Great update, hate to hear about Lizzy, unfortunately there is a growing population of Lizzy&#039;s out there, sad to see.  You&#039;re doing a great job, maybe your impact will eventually click with her and she will get herself on the right path.  Here&#039;s to hoping!
I&#039;m on a mission to swim 100 miles in 2023, and so far I&#039;ve logged 24 miles.  Other than that I&#039;m laying around eating Oreos!  Need the carbs man!  
Keep up the great work sir, you&#039;re a sheer inspiration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m the family shopper and have been for decades.  I worked for a grocery store in high school and college and I know the ins and outs pretty well.  I&#039;m also fiscally efficient and know the best places to shop for specific items.  I actually enjoy grocery shopping, which is strange, because I don&#039;t like shopping in general.]]></description>
