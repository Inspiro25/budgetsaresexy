					<description><![CDATA[Yay to this! We don&#039;t have much filmed here in IceTown, but I have had small roles in my friend Jarrod&#039;s films, and it&#039;s a lot of fun. He&#039;s made four feature length films, as well as a ton of shorts, and his last film had a cameo by Jerry Springer. I play Thug No. 3 in this short, which featured a pro wrestler and a couple of SAG actors living in California. (Only time I had to sign a SAG contract before). I&#039;ll share it below if that&#039;s OK J Money (I&#039;m in the green shirt): 

https://youtu.be/s7kI0TnMco4

There was a ton of waiting around for my scenes to come up, but it was super fun to be part of. Jarrod does this professionally as well, making commercials and instructional videos for companies, and his videography skills are top notch. 

If I lived in a place where a lot of filming was done, I would love to do this. It&#039;s fun, and way more involved than I imagined.]]></description>

I know :( That&#039;s the major downfall if you&#039;re a parent -  you can&#039;t *not* know when you&#039;ll be home!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just an encouragement that even if you aren&#039;t in a big city or an area where films are shot, there could be some local opportunities. I work for a restaurant chain and we are shooting ads almost every month. We&#039;ve exhausted our &quot;friends and family&quot; we can convince to be extras and I&#039;ve taken to just using facebook to see who is interested and available. If you&#039;re interested, I&#039;d find some local talent agents (you&#039;ll get paid more if you go through an agent) or you could just post on some local sites that you&#039;re interested in doing that kind of work/contact some local advertising agencies. A few good headshots with different looks really sets you apart! We are especially always looking for people who are available during the week day (families who home school or those with flexible work schedules) and people of diverse ethnic backgrounds (we live in a very non-diverse area but want our ads to better reflect the makeup of our country, not just the town where we live).  My kids were just extras in an ad this week and got paid in restaurant gift cards but they thought it was fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s really cool. I&#039;d love to be an extra, but my time isn&#039;t flexible enough right now. Once my son is older, I&#039;ll try it. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
