					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m back!  And almost in one piece ;) I&#039;ll have to blog about it soon, but let&#039;s just say I could have stayed down in Charleston for a good year or so, haha... beautiful place!  And people are INCREDIBLY nice too, my word.  Makes DC people look terrible.  Hope you all had a good Easter weekend!  Some comments:

@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - That IS awesome! I love it!  The wife and I did a co-bachelor/ette party together too, it was great :) I can hang out with my boys by myself anytime anyways, does&#039;t matter if I&#039;m single or not.  
@&lt;b&gt;Modest Money&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... funny enough when I declined the strip clubs, others chimed in too and there ended up being none of it ;)  Hanging out together as a crew became a bigger priority than naked girls apparently, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;John @ Married (with Debt)&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  That def. sounds fun actually, maybe you can hit up some distilleries while there?
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  Sounds like a great time - I&#039;m already jealous even though I just got back from one! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Him&lt;/b&gt; - It seems it got replaced by PBR this weekend ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessi&lt;/b&gt; - You totally should!!  I&#039;d move there in a heart beat - wonderful city! (And if we&#039;re both there at the same time ever, then I&#039;ll have to get those bachelorette stories out of you, haha...)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  And I agree!  Def. money well spent :)
@&lt;b&gt;Well Heeled Blog&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right?  No way in hell I want naked guys around my girl so why would I do the same? Even IF I didn&#039;t also think it was nasty ;)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - He&#039;s one of the last ones to go!  I think we have maybe one or two left, if that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;John&lt;/b&gt; - I def. saw all of that except for the crime one - but I&#039;m sure the areas we were staying were drastically different than the rest, since it seemed everyone was super rich downtown :)  Def. loved it there.
@&lt;b&gt;ImpulseSave&lt;/b&gt; - We ate out a LOT this weekend, and they were def. at nicer places than fast-food joints, that&#039;s for sure.  Though I was impressed with how normal the prices were considering how they looked - I thought I&#039;d need a tux and top hat for some! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Tino&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well, if you ever get a chance I HIGHLY recommend spending some good time there - by far my fave place in the world I&#039;ve been.  And I&#039;ve been around! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - No strippers were had! I was a good little boy ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - I remember that!  JB had a blast there, sounded like fun!
@&lt;b&gt;This Aggie Saves&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! Sure did :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ryan&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you sir - it was a much needed break, that&#039;s for sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah dude, as the years get longer the fun trips start dwindling :(  Do as many as you guys can!
@&lt;b&gt;SC&lt;/b&gt; - I wish we had enough time to do so!  We didn&#039;t even have a car - just stayed downtown and walked everywhere the whole time. Was a lot of fun, but I could have used another week too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!  Jersey Shore house??? I didn&#039;t even know you could rent that out?  That is awesome!  Wow... my wife would be jealous, she loves that show :)
@&lt;b&gt;femmefrugality&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!  Traveling is the one thing I&#039;ll never stop spending money on -- it opens your eyes (and mind) to so much stuff!  Love it.  Thanks for stopping by :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate BPs, but then, I am a woman in a committed relationship.  So that makes a little sense :)

I love to splurge with the travel.  I try to travel frugally just so I can go places that I wouldn&#039;t otherwise be able to go.  But I also try to save so that I can get the most out of those experiences.  I&#039;m frugal all the time.  Vacation is the time to just let go and have fun.]]></description>
