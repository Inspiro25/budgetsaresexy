I actually schedule my estimated taxes due using https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/, almost 1 year in advance. That way I cannot &quot;forget&quot; about it.

Of course, if your income trajectory is up, it is okay if you pay the same amount as your tax should have been for the prior year. However next April 15 you would have to pay the difference, especially if you made a lot more. But you won&#039;t owe any penalties]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. Money - So sorry to hear about your cousin. :(   I can definitely see how this would slip your mind since you *just* paid your quarterly tax. My taxes were really confusing this year because I had my freelance income, and I had my foreign income since I live in the Caribbean right now. But, I went home to visit family over the summer so I had not spent enough *days* in the Caribbean to claim it as a tax home. Still not sure if my taxes were 100% correct, but I did as much research as possible and even wrote them a note explaining the whole crazy thing. I&#039;m sure my friends at the IRS will let me know if there was any confusion. :)]]></description>

(See my response to Sharleen above - I think y&#039;all are seeing the amounts listed *per year* instead of *per quarter* - a big difference! :)]]></description>

$8,600 a quarter is cheap? I mean, I do get a ton of write offs with our business and what not, but that&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve heard my payments are cheap, haha...

Maybe you thought it was per *year*? I just updated the post to add that just in case others think the same. Cuz THAT would be cheap AND awesome :)]]></description>
