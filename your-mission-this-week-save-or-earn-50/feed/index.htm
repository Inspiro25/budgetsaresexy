					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Amy Lou&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!!! Thanks so much for the kind words too, if you&#039;re trying to make me blush it&#039;s working ;)  That&#039;s incredible you win so many tickets and contests too, dang girl.  You should write up an article on how you pull it all off!  Maybe get others to do the same :)

					<description><![CDATA[Boom! I worked a couple more hours on Friday ($20) and tutored a girl this morning for an hour and a half ($30). I also listed some stuff on eBay yesterday, so hopefully I&#039;ll get some bites by the end of this week. Thanks for the motivational kick in the pants!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just came across your website - got it from Aspiring Millionaire&#039;s site - and LOVE it! I won free tickets to an event and just posted them on Craigslist for sale. I&#039;m volunteering at the event as a way to get in for free, so I don&#039;t need them. Between volunteering and winning contests, I&#039;m going to three events in as many weeks for free. When I get home tonight, I&#039;m going to go through my house and see what else I can sell. Last week, I took advantage of work functions and volunteer dinners for free lunches and dinners. There was even leftovers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm, this is a good reminder that I have some dresses I&#039;ve been meaning to post on eBay!  Won&#039;t earn that $50 this week, but I&#039;ll at least try to get that plan in motion for the near future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Aspiring Millionaire&lt;/b&gt; - Damn!!!  Yeah that&#039;s good, let me know how long you end up going for!  Would make for an excellent blog post too ;) hint hint...
@&lt;b&gt;Maggie@SquarePennies&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, YES!  But I always recommend people spending their bday or xmas money on something they normally wouldn&#039;t buy themselves :)  Can&#039;t be a hardcore saver all the time!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Woop!]]></description>
