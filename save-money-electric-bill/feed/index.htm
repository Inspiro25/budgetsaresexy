					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - I don&#039;t think anyone could fault you for that :) I haven&#039;t taken a bath in like, 15 years though, haha... I always forget that&#039;s an option!
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... 
@&lt;b&gt;Jace76&lt;/b&gt; - I love fans! Esp when it&#039;s rainy out side - so cozy.
@&lt;b&gt;Long&lt;/b&gt; - Oh, cool. Glad your costs have gone down!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Ack!  Then you need another &quot;leg shower&quot; to afterwards, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never heard about most of these before, glad you shared. Some of them I&#039;m already doing, so it&#039;s nice to know I&#039;m on track. 

As to the showers, I think it really depends on how long of a shower you take. Like last week, the shower drain was clogged and none of the water was going down---at all. By the time I was done, the water was almost up to the rim of the tub even though I kinda hurried to get out of the soapy lagoon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always thought LCD TV&#039;s were more efficient than rear projections. Weird.

A year ago, my electric company switched out the old style meter to the new digital/wireless meter. Ever since then, I noticed my bill went down. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s reading more accurately or what, but I&#039;m glad it&#039;s doing whatever it&#039;s doing.

I guess there has been some controversy on the accuracy on the new do-dads, but I think that if your utility company wants to install them, you should. If you&#039;re really paranoid, you have the option of opting out, but they will charge you a steep fee to keep the old rotating meter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do pretty well on this list except the shower/bath thing. I like baths once in a while. I think I&#039;ll just have to suck it up and pay a little extra in the water and electric bill each month!]]></description>
