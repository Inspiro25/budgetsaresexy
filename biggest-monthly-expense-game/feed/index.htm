Ouch! Hurts in the teeth and the wallet, sorry to hear friend :( Pretty incredible that you can stash away $1,200/mo though towards it! That&#039;s bad ass!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When Tim&#039;s teeth are done! We just got the estimate on his dental implants: $14,200. Then there&#039;s the cost of the new dentures. We&#039;ll find out how much that is on the 12th, when we have a consultation. All I know is that they&#039;re more expensive than normal dentures, which run $1,000 - 3,000 for a set.

So we&#039;re on a plan to sock away $1,200ish a month until October, which (added to our total savings) should leave us with enough money to pay everything in cash. 

We&#039;ll relax a little once that&#039;s done. Then we can save for double pane windows and put a *lot* more into the IRA/have me open a SEP.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our biggest expense is my husband&#039;s student loan payment at $1205/mo.  We could go on a NICE vacation every.single.month. if it was gone (not that we will, but, hey, we could!).  His loan is really 16 smaller loans combined, so we started picking off the highest interest ones and paying them off as we can.  Having the monthly payment go down 30-50 dollars when we pay on off is really motivating!  Our goal is to pay off all non-mortgage debt (2000 left on our car loan and still 100k in student loans) in 5 years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Biggest Expense is $458 per month for my Roth IRA and $684 per paycheck for my Roth 401(k).  

While I like contributing the maximum to these plans I should start saving for a down payment soon.  Currently pay $750 a month for rent, all-in.]]></description>
