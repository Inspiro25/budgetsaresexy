					<description><![CDATA[My mom was a teacher in the Anaheim Union High School District for almost 30 years and just retired. Some of her kids would come and go intermittently, sometimes because the parents had to shuffle them between motels or family members&#039; homes. Some of the kids&#039; parents are drug addicts, in jail, not in their lives, or abusive/neglecting. 

But there are also others whose parents just can&#039;t afford a better living situation for them. I totally agree that low income parents who live in compacted areas like Anaheim do struggle to put food on the table so their kids can go to good schools and be where opportunity is. My mom has bought her kids shoes before, and about every 1-2 months I give my mom bags and bags of clothes for her kids, either clothes that I&#039;m giving away, or clothes I collect from friends and co-workers. It&#039;s a sad situation, but it would be so much worse if these parents moved their families out to Barstow or Riverside where there is also a chance they would be in the same predicament but probably worse off since there is less chance for them to make money and lower quality schools.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Did anyone here watch it?!  I wasn&#039;t able to and I really REALLY wanna check it out!  I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be on repeat here shortly (I haven&#039;t had a chance to check out their web page yet to see), but if anyone sees it let us know :)

Thanks for all the insight you all are sharing too!  I know I can try and envision what it would be like and ask the same types of questions myself (WHY not move?,etc) but even armed w/ all the knowledge I&#039;d still be totally out of line thinking I understand.  Homelessness is no joke man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To those asking &quot;Why stay?&quot;  Also remember that moving is very expensive.  If you&#039;re living hand-to-mouth, how are you going to save up a security deposit and first/last months&#039; rent?  Maybe you&#039;ve got all your earthly possessions in a storage facility, so you&#039;re paying for that too.  Maybe your job pays very little, but it&#039;s stable and you&#039;re not sure if you can find one in a less expensive area.  Even without kids and schools to worry about, there are lots of reasons why a person may become stuck in a rut like this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For those asking WHY STAY? What other city or county has a school that provides breakfast and lunch, clothing and anything you need for free. I went to Project Hope. I stayed because they helped me OUT.. I felt like i belonged where another school  I basically wasnt. What other city or county offers school for homeless where they are not teased or insulted all day everyday. You tell me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To those of you asking &quot;why stay?&quot;, I had a discussion about this over the weekend (nothing to do with the show, have never heard of it before).  All of my friends here grew up in the #4 highest income county (by median household income) in the country.  Most of their family&#039;s can well afford to live there but some cannot. When a friend described her living situation growing up, I asked why her parents did not move to an area they could afford more comfortably. She replied, &quot;To give us kids more opportunities.&quot;

The local high school&#039;s teachers knew that 95% of students were going onto college and prepared them for that. College recruiters would often come to the school.  There were more resources than a lower income area and the school could offer more extracurricular activities, specific classes and better teachers (in the family&#039;s opinion).  These types of opportunities to enrich and improve their children&#039;s lives was worth the sacrifices they made to stay in the area.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right, that looks like an awesome program.  I don&#039;t get HBO either, but I must agree with Evan.  Why stay?  I have often wondered that about people who I hear about in tough positions.  

A good way I remember to do stuff, multiple alarms on my cell phone.  Just set one for 8:50PM tonight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG, this is so sad!  I mean, better than being homeless, but sheesh, my family barely survived living in one hotel room together for 3 days when we visited disneyland!  i can&#039;t handle sad things like this--hardworking people who can&#039;t seem to get a break.  My heart just shatters.  I&#039;m sure I would cry if I watched it, and I hate feeling like a sap.  I&#039;m sticking with the Housewives of OC and letting you tell me about it via a post later.  :)]]></description>
