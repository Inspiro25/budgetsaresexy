You sound like a fun girl to hang out with! Haha...

(Except for the Pats part - unless they&#039;re playing (and losing to) the Redskins :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just stumbling across this post after you linked to it today, but I think it&#039;s a fun idea, so here we go:

1) picked up two bottles of wine last night, which we didn&#039;t even end up drinking... something to look forward to :) $21
2) registered for a spring marathon!! Boston, so it&#039;s $$$$, but hopefully worth it - $185
3) picked up some odds and ends for a quick dinner the other night (proud of myself for not ordering out!) - $8
4) cash, which I used mainly for dinner and drinks with my book club - $40
5) a couple beer while watching the Pats game last week! - $10]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. groceries $167.24 ($180 in budget for the week, so yay)
2. haircut $18.67 (includes 10% discount coupon)
3. house alarm monitoring monthly fee $33.84 (monitoring qualifies us for $100/yr discount on house insurance, so partially offset).
4. Dentist checkup/cleaning/xrays for 2, $330 ($316.35 reimbursement deposited electronically next day by health plan), actual cost of $16.65 will be claimed for partial refund next year on 2013 income taxes.
5. gas $42 ($45 in budget for the week, so again yay)

All payments made with a credit card which earns flight mileage with Air Canada - total earned on these 5 purchases, 708 miles.

The budget only includes the bare essentials, so haircuts are not included. A haircut would ordinarily would come out of the unallocated income for the week, but coming in under budget on the groceries and gas almost covered it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way go to, that&#039;s awesome! And even more so on the dog not being eaten by coyotes! Haha... haven&#039;t thought of that stuff since my days living in California. They&#039;re no joke!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Netflix, $16.68  We still get a dvd in the mail, some of what we want isn&#039;t available for streaming.  The last movie we got is Argo, which my hubby and son really enjoyed.

Grocery store this morning- generic mucinex, cough drops, $1.25 pop for the friend who was watching my class- my allergies are killing me, superscratchy throat.  At least I bought the store brands!

iTunes- DragonBox app- $7.54 it&#039;s supposed to teach kids algebra stealth-style, so they don&#039;t even realize they are learning it! Thought it would be worth trying and seeing if I can recommend it to my teachers.  Also, having had a terrible math teacher throughout h.s. and also having no motivation, I really didn&#039;t learn much so maybe I can teach myself algebra!

Dog grooming- $52.00 This is our thirdchild who was dumped near our farm last winter.  She is a miniature schnauzer and the mats etc. got away from us. *ok we thought she&#039;d been dumped but now it turns out she was our neighbor&#039;s dog and they thought she&#039;d run off and been eaten by coyotes.  To make a long story short, they are thrilled she&#039;s alive and we get to keep her!* Anyway we try to do a good job with the grooming, and I really prefer that she have Andy Rooney eyebrows and a luxurious &#039;stache, but sometimes a professional is needed.

Gas and groceries- $77.56  We had a belated Cinco de Mayo fiesta last night, tried a spice packet of tacos al pastor seasoning with chicken- hubby didn&#039;t like it but I thought it was good. 

A few purchases back we get to $28.30 of library fines for late books, boo!  It&#039;s still much cheaper than buying books but I need to do a better job of keeping track of due dates.  I spend money on Amazon each month, probably more than I need to, but it&#039;s the kind of small indulgence that keeps me from spending more on dumb stuff.  I probably spend $10 a month on Kindle books??

We just knocked off the $400 monthly payments I&#039;d been making due to having to have major electrical work done on our house (circa 1948) and a new furnace and heat pump installed.  We&#039;re also saving about a hundred dollars a month from switching to the new furnace and heat pump from the old electric, plug in baseboard heaters.  Woohoo!]]></description>
