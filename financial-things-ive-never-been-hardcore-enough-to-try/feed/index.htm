That is pretty beautiful :) I would have loved to have a ring/diamond that was passed down from my history to give to my wife! Would def. never want to hawk that regardless of how much it was worth or not... But maybe we start the tradition and pass this one down to our kids later? Never considered that one before (again - pending okay with my wife, haha... since it is *her* ring :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I was in extremely dire straits (as in, the only valuable thing I have is the engagement ring), then maybe I would be open to selling it. Otherwise, it&#039;s out of the question. If the only purpose of selling the ring is to pad the retirement savings, or any kind of savings, a little more...no. Why not work or do something else to do that? I am pretty sentimental, especially about jewellery. It really is something that can be passed down to the next generation. On my wedding day, my mom gave me a necklace that my grandma had bought for me. My grandma had passed away 13 years prior. But that necklace will always remind me of her, and that even when I was a kid she thought that one day that I would grow up, and get married, and all that.]]></description>

YES YES YES to all!! Thinking about dying is great as it really puts *everything* into perspective more. And the last thing your loved ones will want to do is figure out what to do with all your stuff amidst the grieving..

So keep on going, baby!! You&#039;re on a roll!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently sold all of my gold jewellery that had been sitting in a safety deposit box for the last 20 years...untouched...and looking to stay there untouched for another 20 years.  Received most of it as wedding gifts and never had any desire to wear much of it...too gaudy for my liking.  There were a couple of sentimental pieces I thought I might want to keep, but the gold buyer offered more than I expected...sold!!  
My husband was surprised I sold it all but came to his senses when I asked him, &quot;When was the last time you remember seeing me wear any of it?&quot;  My only regret was not selling when gold prices were in the US$1,900/oz range about six years ago...could have cashed in for approximately 50% more.
My engagement ring sits in the safety deposit box almost all year long and it will be next to be sold...will do it when I can get my husband on side with the idea (that will take a bit of work! hahaha!).
I&#039;m going through a phase now thinking about what will happen to my stuff if I pass away suddenly...morbid yes, but a real possibility.  Trying to minimize so that my executor will have less hassles to deal with.]]></description>

Haha yup - another one that would NOT be making it on my to-do list anytime soon ;) 

Awesome about only having 1 car for 3 years! Great quality time with the wife too!]]></description>

Sounds like it&#039;s definitely working out! Are you planning on making it a permanent thing for now, or just testing it out and seeing how it goes?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/financial-things-ive-never-been-hardcore-enough-to-try/#comment-269633&quot;&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ll chime in with my experience here. I&#039;m fully in the diaper trenches (4yo, 2yo and baby #3 due in 9 weeks) and cloth diapering has been a huge perk to our budget for very little effort. 

There are several sites that have done more extensive breakdowns of the costs (http://www.iheartbudgets.net/2012/09/cloth-diapers-vs-disposables-cost-comparison/ for example) and, even factoring in the extra laundry resources, cloth wins hands down. The combo of that and knowing other families with full time working parents who did it convinced me to give it a go when I was pregnant with our first. 

Other moms I know spend $50-75/month on disposable diapers and wipes per kid. Our family spent ~$300 up front on higher end cloth diapers, inserts, liners, wet bags and wipes. At the end of our diaper years, we will likely be able to sell them for about $150. I&#039;ve spent maybe $50 on replacement supplies and disposables for a few cross-country flights, etc. They fit each kid from about 1 month through potty training and we are about to use them for our third. They also tend to encourage earlier potty training and can be bought for cheaper than what we elected to do. So, at a minimum, $3600 for 6 years of diapers vs $200 plus minimal laundry expenses. Those dollars were significant in our budget.

As far as the time commitment, it has worked out for me to be about 3 extra loads of laundry a week. The ~15 minutes/load it takes me in total to start the washer, switch over to the dryer and toss in a basket works out to be ~45 minutes of work a week. At this point, it is so second nature I don&#039;t even think about it. 

All that said, I would never encourage a new parent to tackle the learning curve straight home from the hospital. Meconium poop, umbilical stumps and super tiny bums have convinced me disposable is the way to go for those first few weeks until you get your feet under you and that&#039;s what we&#039;ve done with all of our kiddos!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. I used to be cash only, but you&#039;re really leaving easy money in the table if you do that. It hinders wealth building. I would never go back. 

2. I spent a lot of time selling the idea that the money for an expensive engagement ring would be better spent elsewhere. I told her whatever price she thought it should be worth, that I&#039;d put into a special personal space for her in our home. It worked and I was able to get a ring we both agreed on.

3. We moved across country and only had one car for almost 3 years. She&#039;d drop me off at work, then go to work at a later time. Fortunately we lived less than 2 miles from both our jobs. I didn&#039;t have to deal with the hassle of parking and paying to park and we saved on the full 2nd car expense.

4. Pass on that idea.

5. Leaving an expensive state for more opportunities in a lower cost area was one of the best decisions we ever made. We&#039;ve since moved again, but look forward to going back to that way of life.

6. I did a major purge years ago. It was both good and bad. I was never too wasteful with my spending, so when I got rid of an item I later wanted to use, it was a bit of a bummer. I&#039;ve also lived out of suitcases for work, so that&#039;s also like having nothing. It&#039;s doable, but not a way I want to live.

7. I used to cut my own hair in college and when I was broke. I still hate paying for haircuts, but at this point I prefer to look more professional than what I could do on my own.

I remember watching this special on TV years ago about a woman that would get food out of the dumpster. She even had a dinner party and surved it to her friends. Now THAT is something I&#039;m too nervous to try. I&#039;m thinking food poisoning may not be worth the savings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love these money hacks.  As a family of 5 we just recently downsized to our 1 Buick Enclave.  We did have an 05 legacy that needed too much work to fix so we sold it to carmax and invested the 1500 in my husbands IRA.  I have used Uber a few times to get to work, but my husband works from home so it hasn’t been terrible.  Usually, if he needs the car, we pack up the three year old and now that our eldest is 12 (laws of kids left alone are starting to work in our favor) we can leave the 5 and 1/2 year old with him while my husband drives me (round trip is 24 minutes).  There are times when it’s hot and we have to walk to the pool, etc bc the other adult has the car, but it’s worked pretty well.  It’s about a 15 min walk to preschool, elementary school, Cvs, a town center, etc.  If we lived far out I think we might look into another car, but we’re holding out, for now.]]></description>
