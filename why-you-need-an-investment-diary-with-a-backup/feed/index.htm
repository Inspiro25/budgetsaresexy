Awesome, Ashley! Remember it doesn&#039;t have to be overly complicated or fancy. My &quot;diary&quot; is actually just a collection of scribbles and notes. Sometimes i write on a whiteboard, then take a photo of it and file it on Google Drive. :)]]></description>

I&#039;ve read some of your Missy series, good stuff!  Putting info out publicly is a great way to force better research :)   Also, sharing your notes/journal/blog etc gives others a chance to comment and provide input on things you may have missed.  Public ridicule sucks, but some people out there can be extremely helpful.  Cheers Freddy, keep up the good work!]]></description>

I like that you include the research that led to the investment. That&#039;s awesome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i can definitely say writing about stock investing moves and strategy on my blog has helped me make better decisions.  i write a little malevolent missy series where she buys one stock per month and i really had to think that through to have a beginner&#039;s perspective.  if you&#039;re gonna put that out there with potential for potential public ridicule it&#039;s good to be clear and to be successful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea.  

I keep an journal of my stock investments.  I write down why I made the purchase, the research that led me to the decision and the probabilities I forecasted for investment growth.  It helps me keep focus if something bad happens or maybe the story changed and the reason for my investment is no longer valid.]]></description>

When I look back at sometimes I remember the wins and highlights more than the losses and pain points.  Like selling xyz stock for a big profit, or making a good deal buying a house. I find that writing down the hard lessons keeps my ego in check :)    Cheers Fred, have a great weekend buddy!]]></description>

Nice! Some of my notes I will probably never read again, but just the act of writing them down burned the lesson into my brain :)  Glad your book is helping you along too!]]></description>
