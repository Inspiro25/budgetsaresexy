					<description><![CDATA[What a story Jeremy, and thanks J$ for bringing this out.  Your story reminds me of a Buddhist saying (which is often mis-quoted) that &quot;Love of money is the root cause of all suffering&quot;.  It is often wrongly quoted as &quot;Money is the root cause of all suffering&quot;.  If you love money more than the people who love you, then it ain&#039;t a grand life.  It&#039;s amazing you grew up in such impressive wealth but yet managed to develop such healthy attitudes on life.]]></description>

You think so? I feel like it&#039;s getting worse with how advertising has ballooned over the decades :( I think we&#039;re just so obsessed with personal finance online that our own worlds are full of more conscious people, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is something most of us can relate to I think! I think there was much more social pressure on his generation to aquire wealth and status symbols though. As time goes on I think possessions are becoming less of a *thing* as people are realising this is not the key to happiness, and the internet is helping to spread that word quicker than ever]]></description>

Not sure if it being &quot;uncommon&quot; is a reason to not disown, haha (tons of people do stupid $hit in this world and we don&#039;t copy them!), but true that a lot is left out of this post... It was literally just an email meant for me and not a &quot;life story&quot; type deal, but unfortunately because of it we don&#039;t get the full picture :(]]></description>

Dang, that sucks having that perspective as kids :( I&#039;m sure I did too growing up anytime I couldn&#039;t get a pair of Nike Air Jordans or whatever my friends were rockin&#039;. If only we could get it through our skulls earlier in life :)]]></description>

That&#039;s what our nurse said to me with our first baby!! Well, at least the &quot;just love him - that&#039;s all you need to do&quot; part when I asked how the heck we were supposed to raise him without any sort of manual, haha... But anytime I struggle now either with him or his younger 2 year old brother, i just hear those words in my head and go straight back to loving again :)]]></description>
