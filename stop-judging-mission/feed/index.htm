					<description><![CDATA[Whenever I see something kind of funky, I remind myself that everything is rational. If someone is out of shape, there&#039;s no need to judge because they are living their lives just the way they are because if they wanted to get fitter they&#039;d eat better and work out more.  If someone owns a $50,000 or greater luxury car then they rationally must have the money to afford it, otherwise they wouldn&#039;t be able to buy it. 

 Once everything becomes rational In your mind nothing really bothers you anymore. Even the person who is complaining about something, it is just rational to complain to do anything about the situation!

					<description><![CDATA[*Barney voice*

Challenge accepted!

Seriously though, I&#039;m sure we all pass judgement in one way or another. I know I&#039;m guilty of it but in recent years I&#039;ve been quick to remind myself that I don&#039;t know that other person&#039;s position in life. I often pull up in a nice BMW, but I&#039;m borrowing my wife&#039;s father&#039;s car :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is funny because I am overly curious about people in general. When I see someone who could be assumed as maybe not having much money I always think he&#039;s probably the frugal one who has his finances in check. Where as when I see someone who looks like they are wealthy I tend to wonder if they are over spenders who don&#039;t have nearly as much saved as they probably could have.

I just want to ask people; What&#039;s your income? What&#039;s you debt? What&#039;s your savings look like? And I don&#039;t want to know to judge them - I just want to know for curiosity purposes. I&#039;m always wondering these things every where I go... 

I have this Michael Kors watch that was a gift to me. I would never buy myself a Michael Kors watch (because I&#039;m a cheapo). However, it was a gift and I like it so I wear it. LOL There has been a handful of people who have made a comment about my watch and the cost of it. So I&#039;m pretty sure people have judged or wondered about me as well.]]></description>
