					<description><![CDATA[This is true! But unfortunately I&#039;m too addicted to my one fave bank (USAA) so I can have everything under one roof :)  I literally have like 15 accounts with them and it&#039;s made my life incredibly easier (though I don&#039;t make much off my cash savings). Guess it&#039;s a trade off I&#039;m willing to accept at this point, but I appreciate those links you sent over! Will still go and check them out to learn more :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. Money - Where are you keeping your big wad of cash?  If you aren&#039;t already, I would recommend checking out a rewards checking account.  You can earn a better than average rate of interest just by meeting some easy requirements like 10 debit card purchases a month and accepting online statements.  Check out https://www.kasasa.com/ or http://www.depositaccounts.com/checking/reward-checking-accounts.html and plug in the info for your area.  The accounts are FDIC insured so your money is safe.  If you felt like spreading the money out, you could earn close to an extra $2k a year without lifting a finger.  That&#039;s an extra mortgage payment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a lot of variables that determine our decision here, but mainly it&#039;s cuz I HATE MY MORTGAGE and just want it gone as fast as possible :) So I can live an entirely debt-free life and then not have to bring home as much money every month if I didn&#039;t want... 

That being said, yeah I&#039;m always working on a plan to refinance or find some other way to speed up the process here, but so far nothing&#039;s come to light all the way except for just paying it off as much as possible every month. Since we invest or save all the rest of the &quot;extra&quot; money we make each year, it doesn&#039;t hurt as bad paying off debt like this. If we weren&#039;t doing any investing of the sort, then our plan here would be different. Know what I&#039;m saying?

All this is subject to change though... I go wherever the flow takes me at any given point in time :)]]></description>

Everyone I talk to pretty much thinks it&#039;s a good idea to convert it too - it&#039;s just the big hit you get up front that usually persuades people not to :( I&#039;ve thought about it myself, but the benefits don&#039;t outweigh the cons at this given point in time... Maybe consider converting small chunks at a time and see how that feels? There&#039;s really no right or wrong with it in my opinion, just a matter of what you&#039;re comfortable with and what you believe will be best in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AWESOME MONTH (MUCH MUCH better than mine)! 

Question that I am SURE you have answered in the past.  Why throw that much cash at the mortgage each month? Why not hoard it and try to do a cash in refinance down the line?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see you probably can&#039;t convert your old IRA into a Roth due to contribution limits. But would you recommend this generally? I am early thirties and I have a nice chunck rolled over into a managed IRA. Should I convert some or all of it into a Roth? I don&#039;t have any free cash to pay the tax liability so I&#039;d have to withhold from the conversion. But all the calculators seem to say you can save a lot of tax money by converting. On the other hand, it looks like the realy payoff doesn&#039;t come till years after retirement, based on the conversion graphs I&#039;ve seen. Any recommendations here?]]></description>

Oh cool! Thanks for stopping by - I didn&#039;t realize that was out now? 

As for refinancing, yes - it&#039;s a constant battle with me right now ;) Long story short, we&#039;re too underwater to refinance unless we pony up $100,000 to get under 80-20% loan-to-value. Which I&#039;m currently scheming a plan for...

					<description><![CDATA[New here. Listened to your podcast on YNAB which was great. 

Great progress in a month. I&#039;m curious though on why your mortgage rate seems so high with today&#039;s rate in the 3&#039;s. Are in the process of doing a refi?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t include the coins and I don&#039;t include our cars in our net worth, but I know some people who do and as long as you&#039;re consistent in how you track your net worth from month to month it doesn&#039;t matter. Congrats on a great month.]]></description>
