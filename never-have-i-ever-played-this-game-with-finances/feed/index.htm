What about bringing your own beer to the movies?  Most of the theaters around me have started selling beer, so it&#039;s the same, right?  A can of beer doesn&#039;t take up much more space than an assorted snack, and is certainly more fun.

Come to find out, when they hear *pop fzzzz*, most folk aren&#039;t put out.]]></description>

Or maybe you&#039;re just REALLY good at what you do and everyone wants your skills put to work? :) &quot;Just doing&quot; is a great strategy for new projects - never know where they&#039;ll lead you or if you&#039;ll enjoy it, etc.. I didn&#039;t know blogging would go on to completely change my life and finances - every side idea prior to it lasted maybe 3 months tops! So if it&#039;s something you think you&#039;d like (*and* you have the time, of course), I&#039;d go for it. But not to make money as that&#039;s just a nice side effect if you happen to get lucky with it. You really have to enjoy blogging for it to pay off like that - it&#039;s a grind.]]></description>

Appreciate it.  I&#039;ve thought about it in the past, but can never get beyond the point of figuring out my niche.  IDK, maybe that stuff just develops over time and its more important to just do something.  I would like to have more than one stream of income, IT consulting is a very high risk of downtime field...  I&#039;ve had a good 10 years   I think I&#039;ve only sat at home for a week during that span and that was just waiting for a contract to start but whose to say that my luck wont run out at some point.]]></description>
