					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/sharing-my-retirement-plans-with-my-dad/#comment-251064&quot;&gt;Tracyl5&lt;/a&gt;.

Great question. It is a little awkward isn&#039;t it! I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be in that situation. Well definitely not with my parents, by we may be pretty close with my wife&#039;s parents. They aren&#039;t quite ready to retire, they&#039;ve been saving and investing but they&#039;re not there yet. So that may be a tough conversation to broach, mentioning our planned retirement, etc.

I think they&#039;ll have lots of questions, but ultimately at the end I&#039;d expect them to be happy and excited for us too, like J$ said. One of the things I&#039;m excited about in early retirement is spending more time with them. We only visit them a couple times a year because of how far away we live, and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll love us being around more.

So while it may be a little awkward, it is hopefully a win / win for everyone and hopefully they see it that way.

Thanks for the great comment and question, Tracy!]]></description>

Hi Becky, thanks for the great comment!

I&#039;m from the upper midwest myself (have lived in Charlotte now for 5 years though) and know plenty of farmers like your Dad and Uncle (some of my extended family actually!). Good for them!

Retiring in your fifties is quite impressive, a great goal to shoot for! Side hustles can be a great boost. Keep up the good work!]]></description>

Sounds like a good plan, Jacq! That worked out well for your parents and great you&#039;ll be in a good position to do something similar as well. 

Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

That&#039;s awesome! Mine followed in stages too, kind of mentioning the idea in passing and slowly making him aware of my intentions. Sounds like your &quot;main&quot; conversation will be happening eventually. He&#039;ll have time to formulate his thoughts and you&#039;ll both be well prepared for a constructive conversation. That&#039;s awfully exciting. I&#039;d love for you to share the details eventually! :)

Thanks for sharing, FYG!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/sharing-my-retirement-plans-with-my-dad/#comment-250858&quot;&gt;Fiscally Free&lt;/a&gt;.

Right on, Fiscally Free. Too many people are like that and I completely understand the risk of finally hanging it up and then falling into depression not knowing what to do with one-self. What a shame!

With an inside look into my Dad&#039;s life, I&#039;m pretty certain he will be just fine. He&#039;s got plenty to live for.

Thanks for the comment!]]></description>

You&#039;re probably right...  Where I live now, I only get to see them once a year or so.  If I could spend more time with them, I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be happy about that!  I still feel guilty though!  At least they&#039;ll turn 70 only a few years after we plan to retire.  Then maybe we can have some fun together!]]></description>

Man, great great question... Maybe someone will stop by here and drop some insight because I have no idea! Other than making sure to spend more quality time with them and helping out wherever you can, whether financial-teaching or otherwise. Parents love hanging out with their kids (usually, haha...) so I feel like they&#039;d get a huge win just having you around more :) And you know they&#039;d be so proud of you too!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My mom is very open about her and her husband&#039;s finances, but the more I look at them, the more I realize they&#039;re probably going to have to work to 70.  When I tried to ask about my dad&#039;s finances, he just said &quot;I&#039;m going to have to work til I&#039;m dead!&quot;  Yikes.

My husband and I are socking away money as much as we can and investing mostly in Vanguard index funds.  We&#039;re hoping to retire in about 5 years, when my husband will be in his mid-50&#039;s and me in my late 40&#039;s.  And that would be before either of my parents would be able to retire!  I&#039;m having a tough time with that...  In a way I want to help them, if I can, and if they&#039;ll let me.  But on the other hand, I don&#039;t like my job or where I live, so I&#039;d love to get out as soon as possible!  We&#039;ve got great jobs right now, and being so close to FI, don&#039;t really want to change anything.  How do you handle retiring before your parents?]]></description>
