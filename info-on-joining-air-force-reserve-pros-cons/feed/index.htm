					<description><![CDATA[Hi Erin,

I just wanted to say thank you for this blog post as it gave me more insight &#038; confidence about looking into AFR. Thank you for your service!

I’m not sure if you will see this since the blog is from 2018, but I would like to ask you if it would be possible to do reserves part time even if my civilian job no way relates to the jobs in the military. I’m 22 years old, based in LA &#038; I’m going to a private school specializing in Beauty Product Development &#038; Marketing. Basically a business program that is focused on the fashion/beauty industry. Even though my degree is the total opposite the military has always been a thought of mine, but I don’t want to leave my career path. 

I am thinking of joining and after training to go get my bachelors degree at this private school. Although, my school is far from military education &#038; jobs is it still possible to take credits towards my schooling through the military or would it be a better choice to get my BS first? 

I’ve been hesitant to join due to possibly losing time to gain experience with my civilian career since I’m just now starting out. Is it pretty easy to balance both? 

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I commend you for joining the military but please don&#039;t enlist if you have a degree... I feel like this was a recruiter trying to meet his quota for the month. That and most recruiters don&#039;t understand the process to become an officer. You lose not only lots of money by enlisting but access to jobs only an officer can obtain. Thanks again for serving but if you have a degree... Go to OTS and become an officer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! Im currently in process of enlisting with the AFR and have gone through my MEPS (physical and ASVAB), job selection and just had some questions about the pay and bebefits while in BMT and tech school. I am recently divorced and as of OCT 1st my judgement will take effect but also have a 6 year old son who I have 50/50 joint legal and physical custody of with his mom. Would I qualify for BAH and separation pay under my circumstances? And as for BAH, I currently rent with a roomate and have a lease agreement on the home we rent so would that help with qualifying for BAH during BMT and tech school? Thank you so much for your time. I was also wondering how likely it would be to acquire an ART position after tech school as I cannot go active duty due to my age and also not wanting to be away from my son with regards to active duty. I really would like to make the AF a full-time career and advance my skills into a career as time goes on but don&#039;t want to be just a TR.

Thank you again!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your insight.
I was looking into joining air force as a Reservist. I have 40 hours college credit, and perusing a degree in health science. I will be graduating at the end of this year, and planning on going back to school for RN program. My first question : should I wait to get my first associate before going or join as I complete my degree program? Do Air force reserve help with an existing students loan? How smooth is the transition from reserve to active? I want more information that if I have to make a career out of the military. Thanks for your help.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, 
Thank for for your information and service. I want to join the Airforce reserves once I finish my bachelor&#039;s degree in Feb. But I just got a really good work at home position and I&#039;m worried that I will lose my job if I am away for too long. I know the law protects against that, but I&#039;ve also heard from other people that companies will come up with excuses to fire you. I want to keep my civilian job. Do you have any advice for me? I was also told I could join the delayed entry program. Can you tell me about that? I want to deploy to other countries voluntarily but I was told deployment is between 3 and 6 months. I&#039;m just really concerned about losing my civilian job.

Thanks for any help you can give me.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Erin,

Thank you for your service. I currently just got enlisted in the Air Force Reserves. While I&#039;m excited to be joining I am also very nervous about BMT. What should I be expecting? And how soon do we start our jobs at our base when coming back from BMT? Will there be someone we need to report to? Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your post! 

I was looking into joining the Air Force, but didn&#039;t know if I would fit into any of the job positions listed on the site--as well as whether or not I wanted to leave my current English teaching career. I have a bachelors in high schools language arts education, and a masters in English literature--have been teaching at both the high school and college level for 2 years. It seems as if there aren&#039;t any teaching careers : /

Do you think the reserves is a viable option if I&#039;m just looking to diversify my career skills? And does it make a difference if the career choice is &quot;officer&quot; or &quot;enlisted&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/info-on-joining-air-force-reserve-pros-cons/#comment-233309&quot;&gt;Erin @ Aim High Erin&lt;/a&gt;.

Sounds great! Hopefully I can join in late December of this year. I just want to get my two Associates degrees before I sign up. Thank you for telling me about the flying clubs, I will definitely look for some at Travis AFB when the time comes. I love being around airplanes and I feel the AF Reserves is right for me. As for the Tuition Assistance hopefully that helps with some of my flying or to finish getting my Bachelor&#039;s. 

As for the 2 weeks of training per year, does one train at your local base? or can you ask to train at a different base? Maybe even overseas? 

Oh, and what rank would I be after BMT? with my Associates degree? I looked and it seems I would be an E-3 Airman First Class, but I&#039;m not in the military so I think it is best to ask you. 

All the best!]]></description>

First off, congrats on your enlistment! Yes, you&#039;ll be paid as an E-3 the entire time, which is nice. Some folks have payment issues. Hopefully you have a good recruiter who can get you into the system and get all of your info going before you leave. Reservists tend to have fewer issues with this in comparison to other components, because we do much of our own legwork prior to leaving, and you&#039;ll have a CAC card before you leave. Good luck to you!]]></description>

Adolfo, thank you. You sound like a great candidate for the AF Reserve, and Travis is a great/busy location. Lots of action for you there! Fortunately, there typically aren&#039;t short notice taskings (deployments) in the AFR, so that helps. I know my base has a flying club, so there are opportunities for you to get flight hours and training in at a discounted rate as a military member - seems ideal for you. As a boom operator, you will definitely have contact with flight crews and good interactions with the flight crew. You would be an aircrew member, so you&#039;ll work hand in hand with them. Who knows, OTS is still possible for you, and you&#039;d be able to use Tuition Assistance to help pay for some of your schooling!]]></description>
