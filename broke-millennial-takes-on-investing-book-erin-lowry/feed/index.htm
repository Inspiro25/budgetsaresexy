					<description><![CDATA[My biggest failure in investing so far has been jumping into the cryptocurrency hype when that space was blowing up. I actually made two mistakes, investing without truly understanding and then not pulling out when the crypto world was at its height! Now my investments are in the negative but I’m still holding on, bc my stubborn self thinks it will make a comeback ;) we shall see. All my subsequent investments have been in more stable vehicles, 401k, Roth, and 529 plan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My biggest fail was investing in Bitcoins when they were at top price $19000. My friend kept telling me that he is reading a lot of blogs that say that it will continue to grow to $72000, so I got greedy and decided to invest in it. I didn&#039;t learn from my mistake and invested some more when prices when down on Lite coin. Now my investment is work 25% of the actual amount that I invested. So I decided to leave that money there and see what&#039;s going to happen over months/years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My biggest money fail is not being aggressive about paying off debt. I always assumed it was just part of life. Once I started the debt snowball and focused I knocked it out fast. Wish I hadn’t waited so long to send extra payments. Ya live amd ya learn.]]></description>
