Well I was going to include a 12th question in the quiz about &quot;hyperinflation on the German economy pre-WW2 and it’s role in the rise of authoritarian politics&quot;, but removed it right before publishing... It sounds like would have got that one correct, too!? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[100%! Yes!  All that studying for the BEC portion of the CPA exam paid off!  lol  That was fun.  Inflation can get a bad rap, but you do want a modicum amount of inflation. Sustained deflation can  be worse than inflation, and hyperinflation is an economy killer (ex: see the effects of hyperinflation on the German economy pre-WW2 and it&#039;s role in the rise of authoritarian politics culminating in Hitler&#039;s rise to power).  The role of the Federal Reserve is to manage the money supply to keep inflation on a stable trajectory over the longer-term.  If the constraints in supply along with high demand for that limited supply remain for longer than just a few quarters, you could expect the Fed to have to begin raising the central bank rate.  Some price increases related to supply constraints are temporary.  The question will be when they raise rates, how long they will do it for, and at what pace they raise rates.  These adjustments can be necessary for a healthy, long-term economy, but they can also inadvertently trigger recessions.  I would expect advance notice of a rate increase and a steady rise to avoid spooking everyone too badly.]]></description>

Awesome!  I actually learned a ton researching some of this stuff. There&#039;s a bunch of FUD news out there right now so it was good to dig deeper into what we should be worried about vs. what we shouldn&#039;t with inflation.]]></description>
