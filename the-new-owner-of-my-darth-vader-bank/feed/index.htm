					<description><![CDATA[Ack! You guys are right! Nice catch - I could have sworn I ran the numbers but I must have missed it so late at night :( I&#039;ll have to reach out to Jennifer and give her the heads up - thx! AverageJoe was kind enough to offer it all to charity, so I actually haven&#039;t shipped it yet :)

And I call myself a finance blogger...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t the other person be closer? The guess of 1 cent is $8.98 cents away from the actual value. The person who guessed $15.32 would have been only $6.33 away from the actual value. Could the guess not go over? It didnt say it couldn&#039;t go over from what I had read? Just curious as I was looking at the numbers!]]></description>
