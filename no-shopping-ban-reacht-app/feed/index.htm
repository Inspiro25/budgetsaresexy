The allowances are great for normal life where the bans are good for hitting pause and really reflecting :) I&#039;m not finding it nearly as hard to pull off either unlike the first time I did it 7+ years ago. Even though I have slipped up already accidentally!

Sign up with them and give it a shot with your readers - I&#039;m sure they&#039;d love to see that! :)

(and happy to intro you to my contact there if you&#039;d like. not sure if you can build one from scratch without them doing something or not?)]]></description>

Hah! YES! Do it!!!!!

And then tell us how much you&#039;ve saved (and then of course invested as you do) so we can see all the good it&#039;s done in the end. Besides improving your health :)

Just don&#039;t watch my twitter updates in the evenings - I almost always reference my yummy beer I&#039;m downing, mmmmm.... mmmmm..

Mmmmm....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We enacted a 1st quarter essentials only shopping ban, essentially is consumables only. Now, we do have allowances, so if we buy something that isn&#039;t consumable, one of us ahs to choose who is getting that tab, which goes back to, &quot;Do we NEED this or just WANT this?&quot; 
It&#039;s going well so far. But, our allowances already cover most shopping like clothes, meals out, etc... It works great for us, but yeah I like the No shopping idea. We usually do it once or twice a year for 1-2 months or a quarter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seems like a cool app idea. The interactive thing is something I&#039;ve been looking to add to my site. The idea being it could help start some good conversations and help me learn more about my readers. I&#039;m going to check it out. Thanks!]]></description>

Something &#039;good&#039; to blog about? As opposed to what I generally blog about which isn&#039;t &#039;good&#039;?? Ha!

Well now that you&#039;ve made it a dare I just have to do it don&#039;t I! What about from the end of Feb through to 27th March (my birthday!), no alcohol whatsoever, and no sweets on weekdays? (I&#039;m compromising on the shorter time period with the added bonus of no sweets on weekdays - which I&#039;m pretty sure is going to be impossible for me...)]]></description>
