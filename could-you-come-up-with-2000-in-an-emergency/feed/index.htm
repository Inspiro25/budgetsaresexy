					<description><![CDATA[I have nearly $50000 available for emergencies via credit cards as a last ditch solution. I know if I needed to grab a plane ticket immediately, I could. Definitely working on building up an actual emergency fund, but the security from knowing I have a solution, even if it is a bad one, is very comforting.

My girlfriend definitely knows my financial situation and I know hers. She even let me check out her TSP accounts when the paperwork came in. I appreciate that she is making great money choices. I absolutely appreciate that she loves me even as I am working off my student loans. I&#039;m on the right trajectory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I totally love this post! I&#039;m glad my lady is doing okay with finances and is totally fine with me overtaking the most of the financial planning.

I&#039;m still studying but I was lucky to get a huge amount of unexpected money. I&#039;ve put all of it into an emergency fund, so now I have enough in it for 4-6 months. 

But one last question. Am I just a freaking money nerd or why am I shocked by the number of people who don&#039;t check the finances before marriage? I&#039;ve talked to my girl about finances after 2 months of our relationship. :O]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being without an emergency fund and needing dental surgery (stat! as they say in all medical TV series :D) was enough of a scare to start saving money on a regular basis! We haven&#039;t had an emergency in years (at least not a big one), but it&#039;s always nice to know you&#039;re not a statistic :)]]></description>

ACK!!! I&#039;m glad you told us the happy ending at the end!!! Was it the same dog as your blog icon??? He looks nice and happy there! ;) Really glad to hear of his recovery... and a great reminder too that having a pet is a responsibility not to be taken lightly! So many of us get them on whims and then don&#039;t properly care for them.. I used to be that way and cringe every time I think about it :(]]></description>
