					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;UltimateSmartMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you got that right.  I literally JUST told someone that too (the whole &quot;you can&#039;t win when you don&#039;t play&quot; thing).  We were like that in paying off our mortgages - always wanting them done but not DOING anything about them ;)  Glad we &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/mortgage-payoff-plan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;changed that&lt;/a&gt;!
@&lt;b&gt;kcli&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha.. I LOVE your father-in-law!  He/you are much luckier than I was when I tried doing that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/results-of-100-scratch-off-lottery/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;$100&lt;/a&gt; two years ago ;)  We came away with $38 of winnings, but luckily we were playing for charity and a handful of other people jumped in and we ended up raising $200+.  So at least it wasn&#039;t a TOTAL fail, haha... lemme know what happens on his next birthday ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Justin Wright&lt;/b&gt; - True that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Might want to tell the winners that you&#039;ll have to deduct the price of the stamp in order to forward their huge lottery winnings-ha!  

A bit unrelated... for my father-in-law&#039;s 80th b-day we bought him $80 lottery tickets (@$1 each).  He won $83 and wanted to &quot;re-invest&quot; so we bought $83 more tickets and he won $52.  We then re-invested that into 52 tickets and he was down to about $30 in winnings. I really wanted to see how long the initial $80 would play out but he decided to cash out while he was ahead (and I was out $80).  This might be a fun experiement for next year&#039;s anniversary.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually do not play lotto but I heard my brother won $2.  I thought it was kind of funny for winning $2 but he seemed little excited about it.  I&#039;m sure inside, he was disappointed.  I think lotto is waste of your money but then again, if you don&#039;t play you have 0% chance of winning.]]></description>
