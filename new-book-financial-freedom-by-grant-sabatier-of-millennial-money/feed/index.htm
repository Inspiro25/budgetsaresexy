					<description><![CDATA[One of my employees won a copy of the book on the Money Millhouse Facebook page (thanks Eliie and Bethany) and you would have thought she won the lottery. She was sooo excited. I just ordered my own copy because Gran is so compelling in his podcast interviews. Why aren&#039;t we teaching our children this stuff in school?]]></description>

I envy you. I have tried, if only to be able to get to work earlier, but so far it hasn&#039;t worked out... It seems like whenever I get up, I leave home around 8:30, because I take longer to have breakfast long or start doing things around the apartment, so ... meh.
Being a full-time writer without worrying about the money I need to make off any of it... wow. That would be FIRE to me.]]></description>
