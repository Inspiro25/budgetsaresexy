I&#039;m not sure how *outlet* places work, but more than likely you can as long as you have the receipts still AND its within the return time frame (does it show on the receipt?). I&#039;d just give them a quick call and you&#039;ll find out within seconds :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The tip about keeping stuff in your car is a great one. I do this if I need to return something, if I have mail to send, or with anything else that I need to remember to bring somewhere else (but do stay away from keeping perishable items in the car... especially over the summer. Yuck.) Also, writing notes to yourself in large, alarming capital letters generally does the trick if you&#039;re forgetful or a procrastinator. Waking up to &quot;RETURN SWEATER TODAY!!!!&quot; will probably get the message across. If you, like me, went through the trouble of getting a receipt, only to accidentally throw it away as soon as you got home, try returning the item anyway. Some stores (thinking Pier 1 for example) will let you at least exchange the item or get store credit without a receipt, if it hasn&#039;t been used. Many happy returns, all!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[lol. I actually started saving my receipts in an effort to see how I was spending my money and the practice stuck. I live in Barbados and I must say that I&#039;m not too au fait with the return policies because I find that it&#039;s too expensive to shop here ( too many imports plus high import duties plus greedy retailers). But friends have told me that stores do not take back items unless you have a receipt and sometimes they can be difficult even if you do. And then others would prefer to give you store credit rather than give you back cash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some pretty good tips from y&#039;all!  Keep on sharing them! :)

@&lt;b&gt;Get Out of Debt Girl&lt;/b&gt; - YES! Awesome!  Work it, girl! :)
@&lt;b&gt;ShoeGal&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, that&#039;s a good idea too.
@&lt;b&gt;Jackie&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww, seriously?  That&#039;s pretty incredible.  I bet they have some good stories on the craziest returns people send in too ;)  I bet yours is on the list! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Ful?  Nah, never heard of.  Will google it though as I still haven&#039;t found any replacements that fit my fancy (I&#039;m pretty picky in that I have to really LIKE looking at it or it won&#039;t excite me enough to use, haha... and of course, it has to work well too ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Maybe you can lure him into doing it more by promising him a &quot;treat&quot; afterward? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Christine&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that blows.  Do you think cuz it was a game though and that&#039;s why?  Or just in general no receipt = no money back?  I bet they get scammed alllllll the time.  It usually takes other assholes to ruin it for everyone else, so I&#039;m sure that keeps happening and they have to keep adjusting.  Sometimes if you wait until right after Xmas though, they&#039;re more lenient ;)  At least other stores are.
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Well that sucks, sorry to hear that :(  I didn&#039;t even know Easy Spirit still existed?  Through probably cuz they don&#039;t make men&#039;s shoes, right?
@&lt;b&gt;kody @ financial money tips&lt;/b&gt; - YES! Exactly.  Believe me, I wasn&#039;t this good or prepared either until doing that myself ;)  Been going on 9 years strong now and so far so helpful!
@&lt;b&gt;Elle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Amen!  People always forget or push aside those lifetime warranties but that&#039;s what they&#039;re there for!  And the companies can&#039;t get in a huff cuz they know damn well it a) helped their items fly off the shelf more, and b) that 9 times out of 10 no one will ever use it.  Can&#039;t hate on that.  (and I do believe that you keep all receipts cuz that&#039;s smart!!! :) I do too, but only credit card/debit ones... cash I throw away unless it&#039;s something other than food - which is usually where all my cash goes, and you can never return what you just ate anyways, haha... (well, you could, but that&#039;s kinda gross))
@&lt;b&gt;Sense&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s so interesting!!  I never even wondered about outher countries and their views on returning, man - freakin&#039; love blogging! haha... good addition to the discussion my friend ;) And welcome back to the US!  You gonna hit MD/DC/VA by chance?  You better holler if you do :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carrie Starr&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, thata girl.  I&#039;m just as picky too ;)  Esp with clothes.  Sometimes it takes a while to decide if it was a worthy expense or not.
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle In Htown&lt;/b&gt; - That works too!  I think as long as you have *some* sort of system going on, you&#039;re 99% of the time guaranteed to be safe.  Thanks for sharing what works for you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t carry a traditional wallet, instead I use a small zip bag (like a makeup bag) and have a credit card case I put inside for my debit card and license. This way, I can stuff every receipt I get in the case and zip that puppy up. Once a week or so, I grab all the receipts and stash them in a desk drawer. Why? If I discover something I bought needs to be returned, I guaran-dang-tee you I have the receipt in that drawer. Not having the receipt is the No. 1 reason people don&#039;t return things. Me? I never lose one. Well, almost never.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am an expert returner of things.  I always save the receipt, keep tags on and save the original packaging just in case I need to return it.  Once I returned a phone a whole year after buying it.  You just never know!  Last week I bought a new pair of boots.  I&#039;m pretty cheap so I can&#039;t decide if the 35 bucks I paid for them is worth it.  I wore them yesterday with the tag tucked into the book to take them for a test run.  I&#039;ve decided I like them and took off the tag.  I&quot;m still saving the box and the receipt- just in case!]]></description>
