Thanks!!

Yeah, from the scripting to the camera setting up to the location figuring out and props and lighting and re-shoots every 5 mins when I&#039;d mess up, it adds up fast :) And those 10 hours didn&#039;t even include the *video editing* that I didn&#039;t have to do myself! Lol.... so maybe they took 13-14 hours/piece or so?! 

Fun learning experience either way... And of course the more raw Q&amp;A stuff was much easier/faster to put together and perhaps much more to the point ;)]]></description>

Pretty much, haha...

One time was enough for me too - I can&#039;t even re-watch it myself it&#039;s so bad!]]></description>

Thanks man!

We never really marketed them well at All-Star so they never took off (or they just weren&#039;t good enough - hah!), but I was pretty proud of them for it being my first go at it so I&#039;m glad they allowed me to re-upload them all onto my own Youtube channel and share so they&#039;re archived forever... Would suck losing all that work and sillyness! :) 

Though I did learn a ton in the process so I suppose that alone is a win... and now I know I can do them if anyone ever wants to hire me again! :)]]></description>

Agreed!!

And glad you liked the video! That was one of my favorites to make - and not just because I got to stroll through my beloved cemetery while doing it, haha... 

Interestingly enough I just came back from a &quot;celebration of life&quot; for a friend who recently passed, and it was so cool hearing all the stories about him that I had no idea about even after being friends for a decade or so...

So those obituaries are great to get started on!! I want to see yours whenever you&#039;re done with it, please! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How have I never seen Cash in a box before????!? It may have been slightly before I started following this site. I feel like that video is the equivalent of a B-horror movie, it&#039;s the zombeavers of personal finance you tube clips... You know its bad but you can&#039;t avert your eyes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great body of work you&#039;ve built up over your entire internet career, but really cool you were able to go in this (video) direction for a bit - and to have everything that was even cut eventually. Super entertaining!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just watched the obituary video and that is good advice, even if you don’t do it for the sake of pinning down future goals! I attended a funeral this year of a friend’s wife, who had written her own obit years before at a retreat. I didn’t know her, but it gave me a better idea of who she was and what shaped her life. I know that by the time your obit is posted, you don’t care what’s in it, but it does seem nice to have the accomplishments that are important to you memorialized. Bereaved family may not remember or know the highlights of your life when they have to cobble something in the moment. Great videos!]]></description>
