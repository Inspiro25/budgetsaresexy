					<description><![CDATA[Glad that you find the topic of homelessness interesting. I&#039;m glad that you find comfort in your own rather uninformed opinions. Are not you over-confident in this deceptive, unstable world economy? Are there any commenters out there, who are absolutely certain, that they will never be homeless?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to imagine how scary it would be to be homeless. But it&#039;s true that if you face up to the worst that could happen in any given scenario it can help you weigh up whether you&#039;re prepared to take a risk or not.
We have just decided to take the plunge and buy a house depite the fact that house prices here in the UK are continuing to fall. We considered what the worst thing would be that could happen and living back with my parents is really not that scary compared to those who face homelessness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One can&#039;t experiment with being homeless and learn much, as it is ordinarily not a real choice.  For most people in that position, it is not a game, but a reality.

I can&#039;t imagine experimenting with or being in a homeless position now, as I have built a life.  I was homeless at 18, but everything I owned that I could take with me fit in a small tote/suitcase.  I&#039;d lived on saved money prior to that, renting a room, but the money ran out and I couldn&#039;t keep work.  Because I had a boyfriend who knew how to live with nothing, it was not so bad, also because we were in a pretty nice town - and I&#039;m still in the same town.  So is the boyfriend, but he is more of a transient.  It just happens that right now his best situation is right in this town.  Our homelessness lasted around 4 months.  Nowadays, I see the homeless here and it is clear that things are different.  It is much worse.  There are two or three homeless camps on different sides of town, and on occasion they have crime within their community.  Back in the day, we did not feel at all in danger.  But there were many fewer homeless here at the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Karmella&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, $2 is no joke man...I&#039;d think you could find more scouring the casino floors, eh?
&lt;b&gt;Andrew Kinnear&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting, yeah I&#039;m not qualified to say whether that&#039;s a fact or not, but it does sound like it would make sense.  Even if for just a handful of them over the majority.
&lt;b&gt;gn&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ll put it on the list :)
&lt;b&gt;philip&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s def. true - 24 hours won&#039;t give you the overall picture (or even close, really) but it&#039;s still damn impressive.  I think 24 hours seems a lot longer once you&#039;re going through it late at night and you&#039;re starving ;)
&lt;b&gt;Walter&lt;/b&gt; - Yessir.
&lt;b&gt;Keith @ LifeTuner&lt;/b&gt; - If you ever gave it a shot, I want to capture the whole experience here on Budgets Are Sexy!  Perhaps we&#039;ll set you up with a streaming web cam or something - haha...but then we&#039;d all hear you complaining ;)
&lt;b&gt;femmeknitzi&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m sure he will :)  He&#039;s already affected me and some others just from writing that post!
&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - That would also do the trick!  Or even in DC...but Vegas is high up on that list too from what I&#039;ve heard.
&lt;b&gt;Coffeecents&lt;/b&gt; - Dude, what DON&#039;T you do? ;)  You&#039;ve got your hands into everything brotha, I love it.
&lt;b&gt;Falling Into Favor&lt;/b&gt; - I know, as much as I&#039;d like to try it too I know I wouldn&#039;t have the guts.  He is one brave soul.
&lt;b&gt;RainyDaySaver&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, but damn if it&#039;s not interesting!
&lt;b&gt;Abigail&lt;/b&gt; - A week would have been better for sure, but I&#039;m still impressed with 24 hours considering most of us would never try it :)
&lt;b&gt;ctreit&lt;/b&gt; - WOW.  I bet you heard all kinds of sad stories :(  Very very unfortunate...
&lt;b&gt;Simple in France&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! Glad you liked it.
&lt;b&gt;Kate&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, even scarier as a woman.  I mean $hit, I&#039;d be scared as a guy too!
&lt;b&gt;MyFinancialObjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you enjoyed it!
&lt;b&gt;Shelley&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I&#039;m sure a lot of us would fail on that too....I&#039;d be gone real quick ;)
&lt;b&gt;Ciawy&lt;/b&gt; - Ya never know I guess, eh?
&lt;b&gt;Lillie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that blows.  Great you had insurance though!  That coulda been even uglier.
&lt;b&gt;Grace&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re funny :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to PSU and one of my friends worked for the paper.  She once did an article about being able to afford food at the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines.  I like to call them the FPIGS..   :-P   She did the expirament for 2 days.. and was not a happy camper.   I&#039;ve often wondered if I could manage if I hit these same rough patches... but as the old addage goes, when life gives you lemonades you make lemonade...    so if life takes me down the path of being homeless... and without food, I&#039;ll make due.   :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nope, I wouldn&#039;t do it. That&#039;s a Fear Factor challenge I think I&#039;ll fail. On another note, I always see a lot of homeless people when I go to work, and I always wonder why they are in that situation. I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s just poverty per se. I always think they&#039;re something deeper why they don&#039;t want to lift themselves up- e.g. they don&#039;t want to pay taxes and/or they lost hope.]]></description>
