					<description><![CDATA[I am sorry the antennas didn&#039;t work for you. I have 3 throughout my house and they work great. I get about 40 channels. You do have to work on placing them but it still may not help some people. Thankfully, it works for us. We only use the antenna, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Amazon Fire TV. I really don&#039;t miss cable anymore.]]></description>

nice! I wish the antennas worked for us, but we ended up fully cutting the cord a few months ago regardless... I do miss it a little, but Netflix and Amazon Prime entertain me just fine :) now if only I didn&#039;t need the internet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My mother complete cut her cable TV bill (over $100/month or $1,200/year savings) and replaced with digital antennas. She gets about 6 stations and the main shows she likes. 

A no brainer. Cable TV is a racket.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I need to start hounding my cable company as well.  I only have internet through them, but they pretty much have a monopoly on the area.  Another thing to consider is you can have one friend get a Netflix subscription, another get Hulu, another get HBOGo, or whatever other service and you can exchange log-in info.  Those companies might frown upon it, but it&#039;s a way to save.]]></description>

Hah - truth.

I&#039;m getting closer and closer to cutting it (esp now that they raised the rates again cuz my discounts expired (!!!)) but it&#039;s the football part I&#039;m really going to miss too :( We&#039;ll see how it plays out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dropped cable 5 years ago this December. I DO miss some shows, I especially miss FOOTBALL! but with a huge life-changeover in the last few months that have made life/finances even more implausible, it&#039;s something I&#039;m glad I did waaaay back then. My children are used to Netflix-only shows and aren&#039;t accustomed to the onslaught of TV ads for everything under the sun, just a couple of pluses, and when I think about it, I REALLY can wait a few months for Olivia Pope to make her way to Netflix for the latest season without dying from the urgency.]]></description>

Cat@BB,

      Who are you getting your Internet from? We are about to lose Clear Wireless in November which has been $49.99/month. My husband is not keen on paying that, even, which I have always thought was a steal, but $39.99? Seriously, a steal. Do you like it? Are you always able to get on it? I  mean no slow downs even around 2 am?]]></description>
