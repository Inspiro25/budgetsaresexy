Cheers! Yep, this one should be a 7% return, as well as extra proceeds at time of sale. But, I should probably note that I heavily research and thoroughly vet the deals and partnerships before investing. Good deals are definitely out there - but not every deal is a slam dunk :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy Anniversary! I never heard of Real Estate Syndication until you introduced me to it - 7% return and the money is returned once the complex is sold. That&#039;s ideal! Cheers to an ever-growing net worth!]]></description>

Yellowstone was great. Smokey, but great. It was pretty packed too, I think most national parks and camping spots are this year because everyone has the same idea :)

Cheers to a more frugal rest of the year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got hit hard by the same categories last month--eating and drinking! Lots of restaurants and lots of boozy outings. Taking advantage of the outside world while I can (hopefully no more shutdowns looming). 

Looks like an awesome month! Yellowstone has been on my list for a while.]]></description>

Hey DG!  I&#039;ve been researching both TD and E*Trade for the Solo 401k. And honestly I think E*Trade is the winner at this point! Given my low income level (and our low-ish saving rate), I think personal contributions is all we can do this year. So I won&#039;t be doing &quot;employer&quot; matching I don&#039;t think.

Curious, did you do Roth 401k contributions or just regular 401k?   Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, 5,900 miles last month...very impressive.  Thank goodness for the Prius!

I set up a Solo 401(k) with TD Ameritrade last year.  There was a lot of paperwork and I had to actually wire in my initial contribution as they didn&#039;t accept ACH.  Wires?  What year is this?!  But otherwise it has been easy to deal with.  I like with the Solo 401(k) how you can have an employer and and an employee piece (although the employer piece cannot be Roth).]]></description>

Hey Zach, happy Friday!  Yep, it&#039;s fun to see where everyone puts their money and learn about various investment vehicles. I also like watching how things change over time as people&#039;s priorities shift in life :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love net worth reports from people. It helps me find new things to try out, like Real Estate Syndications (specially not as an accredited investor).

Thanks for this!]]></description>
