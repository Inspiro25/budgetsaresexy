					<description><![CDATA[@J. Money
I was trying to make some really good chicken wings for my wife, her favorite, but we are on this all natural thing with no preservatives and we are staying away from a lot of those processed oils.  Lard is normally unprocessed and really good for deep frying wings, but the stuff I got had all kinds of additives in it.  So being the health nuts we are we had to return that brand of lard for another(I know that sounds so weird).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What was the last thing you purchased? -- I guess debt payments dont really count as purchases.. I recently subscribed to the Sunday edition of the local paper. We can get coupons for $1.25 each week instead of $2.00. Its like a coupon for coupons.

How about the last thing you returned? -- My wife returned several overpriced items to &quot;The Limited&quot; when we started our current journey out of debt.

How much is in your wallet/purse right now? Not a cent.. Only a debit card. We&#039;re going &quot;cash free&quot; these days.
 
What would you do with an extra $100 in cash? - Straight to the credit cards.. Nothing fun for now. There will be plenty of cash for that later.

What’s your favorite album right now? - Great question.. I love talking about music. Mumford has been a favorite for 2 years now.. Im glad you found them. They have blown up so much that they might be playing stadiums the next time they come through town. If you like Mumford.. I would recommend two bands who seem to occupy a regular spot in my 6-disc changer: The Dodos and Frightened Rabbit.

Who was the last person you kissed? - Probably my 7 month year old baby. She giggles when we kiss her. So.. well.. we kiss her alot :)]]></description>

@&lt;b&gt;Hal&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! I can&#039;t wait for sports stuff once our pre-born baby comes out and grows up ;) We find out next week whether it&#039;s a boy or girl - woohoo!
@&lt;b&gt;KC @ PsychoMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Lard???  LARD??? Now that I was not expecting, haha... the sheep, totally understandable. But LARD?? :)

@&lt;b&gt;Andrew from FabulousSavings&lt;/b&gt; - Really?  The only thing I know about her is that I saw her performance on SNL the other week - and it was horrible.

@&lt;b&gt;jacqueline&lt;/b&gt; - Tedashii and Ashmont Hill - roger that, gonna check out!

@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  My wife adores Jack’s Mannequin - I think she met &#039;em beore?  I&#039;ll have to add it back on my list to listen to again though, it&#039;s been a while.  Glad you had fun at the concert!
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - 5 pumps of vanilla?? Haha... and I thought I was bad.
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice.  I&#039;d actually probably like that album good sir, you should send me some free tunes :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome album!! I love it too - something so gritty about it. We have to start thinking about car stuff too, but I refuse to get the minivan the wife wants.... I keep telling her there&#039;s no shame in our baby rollin&#039; in an Escalade! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ms. S&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice.  Have fun at that bachelorette party!  I just bought my tickets to Charleston SC for our friend&#039;s b-party ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - Second person to mention the Black Keys -- gonna have to listen to again, I only know that one famous song of theirs and it&#039;s pretty dope.
@&lt;b&gt;marilyn&lt;/b&gt; - Sugar cane plant? Haha... that is awesome. You should totally give it a shot!
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you enjoyed this one - thanks for participating!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, sorry!  At least you got to see your friend ;) (And you&#039;re stronger than me w/ those kinds of tickets - I&#039;d totally have bought them!  I love festivals!)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thank you!  I&#039;m so glad you appreciate that as it takes me an extra hour or two every day, haha... but I just got nothing but love for y&#039;all! :)  And very impressed you listen to Flogging Molly too - totally forgot about them! And they&#039;re one of my faves!! You all have a blessed weekend yourselves.  Give a pat on the ass to Mr. Money Mustache for me, okay?
@&lt;b&gt;Deb&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh Garden State soundtrack, that&#039;s a good one :) Very chill.
@&lt;b&gt;Kyle&lt;/b&gt; - Nice work on that money winning!  Are you a huge fan of football or did you just guess well? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Man, we suck at returning food when it&#039;s bad -- we&#039;re always so impatient to go drive back there that we end up just throwing away and getting frustrated :(  Good for you on getting your money back!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Awwwww, your man is a lucky one!!  That&#039;s a great feeling to have after a whole year so far, good for you two :)  And totally googling Volbeat’s A Warrior’s Call right now.
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, it&#039;ll be interesting to see how much that Facebook stock will end up going for :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey @ Zero to One Million Challenge&lt;/b&gt; - My wife loves Bare Minerals :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - So your wife plays scratchers huh??  You can tell her I&#039;m a big fan of her then :)
@&lt;b&gt;Amelia&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re gonna get married at a castle?? I want to go!!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah Seoul!!  Miss that place :(

@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, I can&#039;t wait to kiss my little nugget too!  5 more months to go, jeesh.
@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; - Ewww! Haha... frozen chicken??
@&lt;b&gt;BrokeElizabeth&lt;/b&gt; - You can&#039;t do that! I need to know who you kissed!!! haha... I&#039;ll give you one of my 6 moleskins I have sitting here collecting dust? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Christopher&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh I like that name - Hollywood Undead - adding it to my list, thanks!
@&lt;b&gt;Leslie&lt;/b&gt; - Love me some Simon and Garfunkle - we play their albums all the time here ;)  So relaxing! (And I&#039;ll assume &quot;blow money&quot; is not the kind that&#039;s white and gets snorted? ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Money Infant&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Going now to check out - that&#039;s fun :)]]></description>
