					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much :) It&#039;s been a helluva journey so far since deciding this (tons of ups AND downs!) but so far still happy with the decision! I would still like to earn that million dollars though, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely incredible post. We actually got directed here to something M$M posted. Glad we took the time to read this. 

It&#039;s pretty showing what kind of individual you are for not selling your sites after an offer like that. I love the motivation you have! 

We have loved reading your blog posts for almost a year now and glad you are going to continue to do so. 

Looking forward to continuing to see your journey as your blogs continue to grow.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you&#039;re enjoying the blog - definitely sticking around for many years to come :) Very good y&#039;all are still debt-free too despite all the changes! It always saddens me to hear how little teachers get paid when their job is SOO important. Good for your husband for making such a difference in those kids&#039; lives though. I hope things get better for y&#039;all, and you at least keep up the motivation with our blog community here! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found you a few days ago, and had been reading older posts, when I clicked this morning to see what the new stuff was. I admit, my heart fell into my stomach when I thought you had sold your blog. Nothing wrong if you do, it&#039;s yours, you worked so hard to make it, I just felt sad for a minute because several times now I have fallen in love with a blog, and felt like it was modivation and each time they sell, the whole look chages and the articles become recycled fluff, short and uninspiring. One I used to love, a few months after hisdeal, he divorced his wife, and guest posts turned more into which organic chocolate was the best to buy or why cage free eggs are better even if they cost more. Total disappointment. 

I&#039;ll be enjoying reading your archives for a while! I always need inspiration.  My husband is a teacher, and hasn&#039;t had a raise for 4 years, but insurance has jumped up each year 20 percent or more, we have 2 kids, and while no debt, our cars are older, 11 and 13 years,  I&#039;ve started working about 10 hours a week til the youngest is in kindergarten and our take home is about $2400 a month. It&#039;s kind of hard sometimes, because we can&#039;t save as much as we want, or do as much, and there&#039;s no forsee able increase for teachers, but we are managing to stay out of debt at least.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that had to be a really tough choice! As much as I&#039;d have loved the bid, I&#039;d have either just sold it outright and moved on or did what you did and decided I was going to go all in and keep the blogs. The last thing I&#039;d have wanted to do was be an exclusive writer for someone else on &quot;my site&quot;, which it still would have been. At least for what they were offering you; remember some years back when this kid sold his blog for $15 million and agreed to write for a couple more years? Now there&#039;s a deal I&#039;d have taken! :-)

I wish you great success and I hope you&#039;re enjoying your time off.]]></description>
