					<description><![CDATA[I recall reading of an experiment, conducted by some psychologists, that concluded people feel more pain from the loss of $100 than the joy they feel from a gain of $100. I think that is right too.

Besides, it seems obsessive to check finances every day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never heard of a negativity bias,...that&#039;s really interesting food for thought! I&#039;ve stopped checking my investments every day because I have ZERO control over the stock market, and check my checking every few days to make sure it lines up with my budget.]]></description>

Yes! I agree James! With a well diversified portfolio you don&#039;t need to worry about it daily. If someone feels the urge to &quot;tinker&quot; with their investments daily then they&#039;re doing it wrong. Long term investors don&#039;t need to watch the market daily.]]></description>

Once a month is good. From my perspective checking the market is ok, as long as you&#039;re not seeing a net worth number or investment total.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I&#039;m still in the learning phase, I find checking things to be useful to me. So I see what fluctuations are like on a small-scale. I&#039;m hoping this is training me to be prepared for fluctuations when I have a lot. If I develop the non-chalance muscle, it should be easier to stay the course.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t check everyday, but do check once every couple of weeks or even monthly - just to make sure things are flowing in and out the way they should be. Fortunately (or unfortunately depends how you think I guess), my money, investments, and portfolios do not go through huge swings so I am comfortable that things won&#039;t change too significantly for me to worry about it daily.]]></description>
