					<description><![CDATA[Haha nice.  It&#039;s a shame all the other comments got knocked away when I converted this blog over to WordPress cuz there was quite an interesting mixture!  I think what I like the most about money clips though, is that it forces you to keep just the necessities in there :)  Perfect if you&#039;re trying to be more minimalist!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use this exact approach. I like using a money clip because it fits snug in my pocket, and forces you to only carry things you use often and things that are important.

Here&#039;s my money clip (Canada):

Amex (SPG)
Travel Rewards Elite Mastercard (MBNA) - Since American express isn&#039;t accepted everywhere (tim hortons) and this also shows me temp transactions which is nice
PC Financial Debit
Drivers License
Subway Card
$5 bucks]]></description>
