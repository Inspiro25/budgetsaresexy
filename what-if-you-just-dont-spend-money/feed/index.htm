Woww never owned one before - that&#039;s pretty impressive! I&#039;m not sure I can give mine up, but I wouldn&#039;t mind a more dumbed-down one since I only use 10% of its features... Fortunately at only $30/mo though I can deal :) (If you ever do pick one up, check out Republic Wireless)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[one thing i&#039;ve noticed over the years about myself is the development of a type of physical repulsion to the mass marketing and advertising for crap i don&#039;t want.  the 2 best examples are bottled water and a cell phone.  for one, as a homeowner, i already &quot;buy&quot; clean delicious potable water every quarter.  and as a never-had-a-cellphone person, it amuses and angers me a little to see a bombardment of ads where somebody is trying to get my approximately one hundred hard earned bucks a month for data so i can bury my face in one of these anti-social devices?  you&#039;re right, $, what if i just don&#039;t?]]></description>

I like the sound of that!

A *productive* distraction is always better than an unproductive one :)

I did the same thing with the shopping emails too back in the day... And then eventually stopped reading/consuming/signing up to anything relating to the *news* as well - it&#039;s always so depressing and full of noise!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I sat back most months before I started budgeting and saving wondering how I spent so much money and what did I even spend it on.  Then it came to me.  My email inbox was filled every day and even sometimes hourly by sites wanting to either offer me a discount or show me the best new thing or even worse convince me that a crowdfunding idea was worth paying the money for and then in one case still never getting anything but a promise they are still working on it over a year later. The advertising emails I guess you could say were working as they wanted but really taking a drain on my cash flow.

So what did I do??   I simply unsubscribed from all the noise and distraction of the advertising emails and found that my temptations went down to almost zero.  I did exactly what J Money talked about which was just stop doing it, and getting rid of the temptation.   It was the best thing ever, actually life changing.  Now I prioritize my money and put them towards real goals and not the latest flashy item coming across my inbox.

One funny thing though is that I think how I got through the withdraw symptoms of online shopping and coming home each day to a package in the mailbox was start to read sites like Budgets are Sexy and a few others.  Seems like a much better use of my time and money.    Thanks J. Money!]]></description>
