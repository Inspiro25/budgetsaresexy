					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve actually wondered whether i should tell people I actually like reading and writing for personal finance blogs. I&#039;m still debating if I should own up to my inner dork! For now I&#039;ll just keep telling people I run a website with personal finance content. lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J money,

I keep the whole blogging thing from my friends as most wouldn&#039;t understand or even care.  Perhaps the age group has something to do with it, but I don&#039;t want people to think I&#039;m getting all gospel and preaching to them either.  It is nice when you find someone that shares your passion and while the internet is great for meeting like minded people and sharing ideas, it is pretty hard to beat f2f.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweet blast from the past J. Money!  Yah, I&#039;m definitely not anonymous haha.  I even have my picture on my &quot;about&quot; page.  Sometimes I wish I was though.  I would be able to share my ubber personal information like my net worth for example.  I decided to go a different route and show my face instead.  I get weird looks when i talk about it too because I&#039;m a bodybuilder.  They usually go &quot;wait, you&#039;re a bodybuilder, love talking personal finance, and run your own blog?&quot;  I&#039;ve had some pretty funny conversations with people.

I totally get you on feeling dorky about it.  I could talk all day about personal finances, but I end up seeing eyes getting glazed over haha.  That&#039;s when I hand them a biz card and tell them to visit my blog.  The best part of not being anonymous though is having someone me that my articles have helped them make better decisions with their finances.

Anyhooo, great article brotha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s never nerdy to talk about reading and writing blogs! :) I love discussing personal finance, regular finance, and economic stuff with people - i think i can blame being an adjunct professor on the topics for that. It&#039;s great that you vent with people outside our blogsphere because it helps to add some perspective. I liked the &quot;secrets&quot; you gave too - that was some really solid foundational advice that could work for every one. Whether your neighbor gets aggressive with it or not is up to him..maybe you can keep him motivated :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Lauryn&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Great great group of bloggers you mentioned up there, welcome to the family :)
@&lt;b&gt;KH&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you got that right.  I&#039;ve been caught a few times over the past few years, but now a days I&#039;m not *as* worried now that I&#039;m 100% self-employed.  It&#039;s really kinda fun at this point ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Grace L.&lt;/b&gt; - Woww, THANK YOU Grace!  Way to make my day :)  I&#039;m so glad you get a lot out the blog and newsletter (which I&#039;ve been kinda slacking on lately, oops).  I think that&#039;s wonderful you&#039;re teaching smart budgeting on the side, and I wish you nothing but success!  Thanks for leaving this comment, you made smile :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it can get pretty weird at times for sure. The cool thing about being more anonymous is that you can hide as much, or as little, as you want.  Then just whip it out per specific situation or person.
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah budgeting!!  I can go on and on about it too w/ people, but I try and hold back unless they bring it up ;)  Which isn&#039;t too often probablly because I go on and on about it! haha...  we&#039;re very like-minded, you and me.
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Really??  that&#039;s too funny :)  I&#039;m so curious to see what % of my readers now were from back in the day, so thanks for letting me know.]]></description>
