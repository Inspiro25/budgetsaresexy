					<description><![CDATA[Glad you went the lawyer route, J.  Sometimes a &quot;friendly&quot; little letter from a law office is all it takes.  I hope that&#039;s the case and that will be the end and you can get what&#039;s rightfully yours.  :)

P.S. - My favorite insult in this edition of &quot;The Chronicles of the Crappy Ex-employer&quot; is &quot;turd bucket.&quot;  By far the best insult to date!  LOL!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks guys -- feelin&#039; the love :)

@&lt;b&gt;Lauryn&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... you could have done that :)  But now that you are getting your answers, are you gonna leave me?
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - I reserve that phrase for special occasions ;)  And yeah, we&#039;re probably both naive like that - but it&#039;s all good!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - According to our attorney, there are a LOT of things we can go after... penalties, legal fees, etc etc.  In a perfect world it would be cool to get double my money owed (which I hear could be a possibility depending on what path it goes down), but I&#039;d be just as happy getting what&#039;s rightfully owed to me.  $3k can go a lot farther now that it could 3 months ago, I&#039;m getting frugal&#039;er, baby!
@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, or at least a damn apology.
@&lt;b&gt;Diana, Clare, Brandi, michelle, Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!
@&lt;b&gt;Diane&lt;/b&gt; - I know, you are 100% right.  I just had to let it out as it&#039;s such a big part of my financial life right now ;)  I&#039;d never relase names/companies/details/etc etc.... but I&#039;ll probably wait to post the results once it&#039;s all said and done with.  Thx for staying on me!
@&lt;b&gt;Beth&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  It is nuts.  We&#039;ll see if this scares them, or if they just brush it off like they have been the past 3 months.
@&lt;b&gt;Jon the Saver&lt;/b&gt; - hahaha... he&#039;d never expect that came from me, either!  that&#039;s what makes me the most upset about everything.  I was soooooooo respectible and understanding and just 100% NICE and on my boss&#039;s side the entire time people were giving him $hit. I stood up for him throughout it all, and then he goes out and attacks my credibility like that.  F&#039;ing not right man... and the funny part is he goes around calling himself a &quot;Christian man&quot;... I&#039;m not a saint myself, but he&#039;s gotta learn how to mix that part of his life w/ his company cuz he&#039;s just off his chain man.
@&lt;b&gt;Anon&lt;/b&gt; - No worries at all, that&#039;s a valid question :) I just divided by 24 (the amount of paychecks a year roughly) and rounded up.  I think the actual amount is $2,800-something, but didn&#039;t bother going to look up.
@&lt;b&gt;IPA&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, you&#039;d think :)  It might be bad business practice, but in LIFE people should come first.  Sad sad world we live in sometimes...
@&lt;b&gt;Shawanda&lt;/b&gt; - haha, now THAT would be something!  Imagine coming out with $15,000?  Shooooooot... keep your fingers crossed for me ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - I know :(  I&#039;ll probably keep mum for a while now... and it&#039;s 100% sad, esp since I helped start the original company many many years ago.
@&lt;b&gt;Misha&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Misha!  It&#039;s nice to &quot;meet&quot; you :)  I was just out in Milwaukee and was hearing chit chat allll weekend about that whole Scott Walker thing.  I&#039;m not versed in politics at the least, but I do hope everyone finds as much of a win-win situation as possible!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J Money,

I love reading your posts but haven&#039;t commented before. This one especially resonated with me since I&#039;ve been following the developments in Madison, WI. It&#039;s dark times for workers since corporations and government officials like Gov. Walker don&#039;t give a whit about union rights or the rights of individuals to protect themselves from unethical treatment by employers. You&#039;re right to take issue with these jackals for not paying you for hours worked. Legal battles can be exhausting to the wallet and the soul, but don&#039;t give up!

					<description><![CDATA[This is so sad. It seems once you leave a job they no longer care about you. I have to agree with the others and say even though you&#039;re &quot;anonymous&quot; you should just keep things to yourself for now. Or ask your attorney if you can talk about it but its best to keep things low, employers especially bad ones have a way of finding things out and making things really ugly.

I&#039;m on your side dude though, and I wish you the best. You are owed your paycheck and I hope you get it. Its kind of sad its come to this you know? Why couldn&#039;t your company work things out diplomatically.]]></description>
