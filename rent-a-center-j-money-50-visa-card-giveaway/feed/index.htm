					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;*GIVEAWAY OVER*&lt;/strong&gt;

Congrats goes out to..... drum roll please.... &lt;strong&gt;Beckey &amp; Jeff&lt;/strong&gt;!  Congrats!  Look for an email out soon to claim your $50 card :)  And thanks to everyone who participated! We&#039;ll have to do another one soon, but not for a bit.... these wear me out! haha...

And I&#039;ll have to do better about screening my giveaways too - It didn&#039;t occur to me until after that places who rent things out aren&#039;t the best for our finances.  So thanks to everyone who pointed that out.  I was too excited to do the giveaway that I forgot to give it some thought!  Although some of thee places may be good for temporary situations, all depending on what you need exactly and what&#039;s going on.   In either case though, just make sure to do your homework! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was pretty harsh on RAC in an earlier post so if I win I will donate the giftcard to charity...

So, let me take a stab at this:

Which room of your house needs a makeover, and WHY?

I would have to choose our kitchen. We bought a bank owned foreclosure with &#039;most&#039; of the things we wanted: sprawling acreage, a nice neighborhood and great schools. The incredible deal we were able to get was aided in no small part by the horrendous black and white ceramic tile floor, the repulsive 1970&#039;s cabinets (painted black by an apparently  non-sighted, extremely nervous painter) and the do-it-yourself light kit that must have been on sale somewhere nearby those many years ago. It turns out that the floor job was the 3rd layer of a great &quot;floor sandwich&quot; that permanently traps the kitchen appliances under the countertops. Said countertops are covered in what appears to be bathroom tile from an abandoned elementary school. Since we have a few priority projects that need to get wrapped up before we tackle the kitchen, I fear we have somehow allowed ourselves to slip into a mild state of &quot;Stockhom Syndrome&quot;. It is growing on us (a little). We are beginning to sympathize with the perpetrator of this kitchen disaster and I would not be too surprised if some of the &#039;design elements&#039; remain. Maybe the &quot;country accents&quot; ceiling fan with the tulip bulbs, who knows?
