					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure to be honest with you.  I know people have mentioned in our earlier post on extreme couponing that there ARE, indeed, coupons and deals for healthier stuff like that, but not sure any example or resources were ever listed.  kinda curious about that too :)  although I eat all that unhealthy stuff anyways, so I&#039;d still be happy getting it for super cheap and/or free, haha...

Here&#039;s the link w/ much more discussion:

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Maria. Where are the coupons for fresh veggies and fruits? Eating processed foods means you are taking a hit to your health, which in turn means more expenses towards health issues. 

There needs to be a balance. People really don&#039;t need 60 jars of mustard! And, building shelters to keep all the food and toiletries they&#039;ve amassed? That&#039;s just insane.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I watched some of it. Shocked by the fallout shelters they need to buid to store all their purchases. I really think people are nicked-in-the-head by coupons, and forget that they are consumer marketing promotions...designed to make you consume more, not save.]]></description>
