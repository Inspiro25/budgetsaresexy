					<description><![CDATA[OH yeah - avoiding lifestyle inflation is KEY!!!  As soon as you can learn to live on the same amount no matter how many bonuses/raises/etc you get, you&#039;re nest egg will grow crazy fast.  You can still treat yourself to some good stuff here and there, but the trick is to not keep raising your expenses every year :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rid yourself of credit card debt is my best advice. I talk to a lot of 23-25 year olds who still carry thousands on their credit cards and act like it&#039;s nothing. These people have no idea how much they&#039;re losing every month by paying interest.

Your money is more valuable sitting in a savings account than funding a credit card. Fix this early and never look back, grads!

					<description><![CDATA[I think the most important thing you listed was to start saving NOW!  I am a huge proponent of compounding interest and what it can do to your savings!  The sooner you get to the point in your life where the total amount of money you made in a year is greater from compounding interest as opposed to your salary, the better!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful tips.  I wish I had known even half of them when I graduated.  In addition to these tips I would like to add a couple of my own. 

12. Avoid lifestyle inflation - Now that getting some good hard earned cash, don&#039;t waste it!  It&#039;s too easy to let lifestyle inflation creep into your life and start eating away at your potential savings.  Biting off more than you can chew now may end up hurting you severely for years to come.

13. Pay down that debt!  LearnVest, you mentioned that 80% of graduates have credit card debt before they even start their job.  Now that you&#039;re earning money, use it to get rid of your debt before it grows on you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The best thing I ever did was start contributing ten percent of salary to my 401k with my very first paycheck.  Then I never missed the money, and I am so happy 19 years later!]]></description>
