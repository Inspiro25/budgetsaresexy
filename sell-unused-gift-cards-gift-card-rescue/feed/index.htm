I like the mom &amp; pop shops more too :) though probably harder to get gift cards for since not mainstream? and they don&#039;t all offer them?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, new to your site, but have been obsessively reading every article of yours and stalking the Internet using every possible search term (FI, early retirement, how i paid down x in x years, etc, etc) to find other finance freaks like yourself. Anyways, just want to say thanks for the info, it has totally turned my (finance) world upside down. I thought I was doing pretty good with $1,000 in my emergency fund until I started reading all of this. Now, I&#039;m doing freakish things like diverting my down payment fund to demolishing my student loan. Reading your blog is giving me fresh energy to keep pressing on! 

Anyways, this gift card rescue thing seems like a great idea. I signed up for their newsletter, and I would definitely buy a Whole Foods gift card. Anything to try and wrangle my food budget. 

Thanks, keep up the great work SON!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just signed up for the newsletter - serena.a.heath@gmail.com. Excited to see what this brings - I&#039;m browsing their catalog now. 

I&#039;m probably in the minority here, but I&#039;d be more likely to sell off my big-box store cards in favor of more specialized stores. For instance, if you&#039;d give me a Sears card, I&#039;d have no idea what to buy and would probably have it for a year before either regifting or using it on something random. But if you give me a Bath and Body Works card, I&#039;d be super-excited - Love my body lotions. Same would go for restaurants or candy shops - you get the idea.]]></description>
