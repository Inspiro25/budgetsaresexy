Wishing you lots of luck! It&#039;s hard to let go of things you&#039;ve put a lot of time and effort into (and even money) but better to move forward now and work towards the next thing before you get sucked in even more. I have to do this like 3 times a year when I shut down sites I&#039;ve started that didn&#039;t do too well (or at least as well as I wanted them to). So shut &#039;er down and move to the next! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the way a beach rejuvenates you. It was a deal breaker for us to move to the beach when we left Northern territory.You share the beach with crocodiles up there so i definitely wanted to be able to use the beach again and enjoy it without thinking my dog was going to get eaten any second (NOT terribly relaxing)( google images monster crocs NT) Please don&#039;t typo that either you might get some ahem &quot;interesting&quot; search results! These beach babes with reptilian skin are not photoshopped I have seen the boat picture one in the flesh myself.  Needless to say i almost needed new underwear (sorry for the overshare!) If you ever make it over to AUS I will have a huge list of everywhere to go... should have been a tour guide.. side hustle????

The weather is not all that flash today so the beach is out but this article may have just done the trick for me to get back into planning mode! Congratulations on trying for number 2! We are thinking about that for us at the end of the year at the latest. Our little one is just dying for a playmate hes now 14 months so feeling the pressure! ha ha.

I have already begun to &quot;cut the crap&quot; Avon was making me minimal money and I was investing a lot of time travel and stress for little reward so have made the choice to cut it. Of course the upline has tried her best to talk me out of it. Get this though, she has 105 (approx) in her downline, makes over $200,000 in sales a year and gets about $65000 as her annual income from it!!! I reckon that&#039;s crazy! I think if she nutted it out to the hours vs income it would.... suck. I am not betting on that to be my  financial plan! So now it is back to blogging, flipping, and some other things I have in the works for a few months time... wish me luck!]]></description>

That line between work and life is a hard one to find and stick to for sure. If you can figure it out I&#039;d love to hear how :)]]></description>
