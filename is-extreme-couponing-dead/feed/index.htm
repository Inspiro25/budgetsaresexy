					<description><![CDATA[Great post J Money!

I&#039;m finding this article in 2022.  I can say extreme couponing is officially dead.  Plus everything is digital now so no more clipping newspaper coupons.

I still find the new apps like Ibotta addictive so maybe that is the new trend.  It has the same effect by making me stress out over a 25c savings lol.

					<description><![CDATA[LOL... Glad to have less competition on this...
-It&#039;s not about having 100+ bottles of Shampoo/Conditioner in a stock-pile, it&#039;s about overages.  We give away all the extras.  The genius in this is like this...  Sale = buy 5 bottles of Shampoo @ $1.99 and get $5.00 off instantly (Making them $0.99 each) 
Use 5x coupons @ $2 off per 1 bottle of (x) Shampoo coupons and you get a free $5.00 overage for other purchases ($5.05 actually) #ThanksShampooYouJustPaidForMilk]]></description>

This.  I was never a super crazy couponer, but I liked to stock up on things we actually used.  The stores have definitely put limits on extreme couponing where I live.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the craze hit, our local markets did several things: 1) stopped doubling coupons 2) stopped allowing more than one coupon per item, even if it was a manufacturer and store coupon for an item. It&#039;s either one or the other. 3) put quantity limits on items 4) added transaction limits. 

That pretty much put the brakes on it all.

As for me, I rarely use coupons. I buy a lot of produce, dairy and meats and there aren&#039;t many coupons for those. I only buy what I need. And I pretty much ignore the sales flyers so I&#039;m not tempted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I stopped using coupons when I once read  something that made sense to me...Someone once wrote that it amazed him how people spend so much time clipping coupons and driving from store to store to save .25 on an item but will overpay thousands of dollars on cars, homes, appliances etc.  That&#039;s when i decided to stop with the cent coupons and pay attention to my big purchases.]]></description>
