I already know what you mean! My partner in crime has been researching and emailing me stuff for us to do/look into and it makes me want to quit before we even get started, haha... Just trying to get over the hump of info overload and *do our first one* and then I think it&#039;ll get smoother... at least I hope so :)

And speaking of your podcast, just BCC&#039;d you on an email I got from someone who signed up to my site after hearing me on yours. So hooray!]]></description>

oh wow - that&#039;s a big #!

I think mine has gone from $100 to $200 to now $350 over time... But I&#039;ve given them 10x amount of work as the years have gone by too, haha...

So I think YOU need to do a side by side comparison for your site! :)]]></description>

That&#039;s something we go back and forth on, yes. However, we started our family in the middle of my wife getting her Masters and PHD and we wanted to make sure she graduated and reach those milestones which are highly important to her (as is starting a career).  We tried taking turns for a while, then her staying home with our 1st for a while, but as you know being a stay at home mom does not leave much time to work on such things :) So we spend a lot of time with them in the mornings (we don&#039;t drop them off until 10:30 every day!) and then every evenings from 5:30 and on as well as the weekends. It&#039;s been a great balance for us and allowed my wife to finish up and hopefully get her PHD in two weeks. At which point we&#039;ll be plucking them out of daycare and bringing them home until she finds he first job or decides to remain at home with them. Lots of pros and cons either way you go, but as long as you weigh them and then make decisions off those I think it&#039;s good :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats to your wife!!! That is SO huge and such a major accomplishment!!! I am not sure what I would be more excited about, her working full-time again or not paying daycare bills, those are painful. So excited to hear you are thinking about a podcast!!! I think it would be awesome, but as a podcaster, I have to say that they are WAY more work than you expect them to be but a cool side bonus of doing one is that you access an entirely new community of people. I get more feedback and emails from my podcast listeners than my blog readers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That prepaid card mobile deposits can take up to 10 days. Yikes. I&#039;m always looking for a better bank, but I simply haven&#039;t found one better than EverBank (I even like them more than USAA!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of &quot;tax prep&quot;...How about touching base on the pro&#039;s and cons of doing your own taxes and what it cost to have them done professionally. I have had an accountant do mine for quite a few years but I just got invoiced just this side of $1K for the privilege this year....Sooo thinking it may be time to put batteries in the calculator and do it myself next year...This is crazy!!!]]></description>
