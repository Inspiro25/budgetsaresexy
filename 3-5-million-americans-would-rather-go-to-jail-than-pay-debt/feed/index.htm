					<description><![CDATA[Would you go to jail for a week for half a million dollars? Uh, yeah, why wouldn&#039;t you trade a week of your life for years of your efforts? 

Hell, at a week I might do it for free just to find out what it&#039;s like.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m also going with no to these.   Guess in the grand scheme of life I’ve never had so much debt I couldn’t handle it and get myself out of it.  As a result, I’ve never felt desperate to do anything to get out of it.  While I would love to not have a mortgage payment anymore, I’m willing to bust my butt at a job and pay it off.  I have an issue with people who live off the system/government, but I won’t start that debate here!  :)  I just don’t feel my loss of freedom and the impact it would have on family Sitting in jail is worth it.  (Although if it was for one night in a posh jail...)]]></description>

Haha... I&#039;ll consider anything for a hot second, but my answer would be another big NOPE on this one too. I can barely go a weekend without seeing my kids, but a whole year?? Wouldn&#039;t matter how much they paid me anyways - my wife would kill me when I get back :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two things: How long is the sentence, and is it county jail, or state/federal prison? Big difference. Neither would be pleasant but far worse would be a state/fed prison, which are for offenders sentenced to longer than one year sentences (ie higher level crimes, repeat offenders, etc); county jail is typically for pre-trial and shorter sentences (there are exceptions of course but this is generally how it works). 

What about this question: Would you spend a year in jail if afterward you were FI? In other words, you come out, hand in your orange uniform and walk away with your pre-jail spending taken care of for life. I&#039;d had to think about it at least...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would not prefer or choose jail time for anything, including getting out of debt.  Of the other options, I already changed political parties to be less appealing for jury duty (I think they don&#039;t like Libertarians aware of jury nullification).  I don&#039;t believe it matters at all what one is registered as, otherwise, so I might do such a thing if I had debt and it mattered to me.  But there are other ways to get out of debt most of the time, so even something as insignificant as political label would not be desirable to me as an out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No thank you to jail time to get out of debt :P 

I actually had a crazy dream that I went to jail last night so how fitting is this article haha (I remember it had something to do with cookies...) 

I wouldn&#039;t pick any of those things to erase my 160k house mortgage. It&#039;s not worth it in my book to sell yourself short.]]></description>

Really just speaking from experience.  Whenever I hold debt I just make myself miserable, its literally all I can think about, I sit there scheming about how get get myself out of it, usually to no avail.  The older I get the worse it is, Its gotten to the point I reflect on how I am going to even enjoy my life until my mortgage is paid off.]]></description>
