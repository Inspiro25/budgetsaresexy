This bothers me, too. Not every obstacle can be overcome. I do agree with the sentiment that your success is your own and something that has to be worked for, which is probably what people really mean.]]></description>

I think we&#039;ll always be searching for it to some degree, but once you have that epiphany it speeds you along the track :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seriously J, you rock.  Appreciate the inclusion. 

As for my favorite, it&#039;s definitely #8.  People often use the excuse &quot;life is short&quot; to rationalize spending, but I use it to argue for financial independence and early retirement.  Life is too short, so why spend more than half of it working a full time job?  

It&#039;s crazy!  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post and nice shout outs to other blogs to read!

I love #2. We as a society get used to spending mindlessly. We go to malls and Target with no idea of what we actually want to buy. I think if we just take a step back and think if our purchases actually line up with our values we&#039;ll definitely be better off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff!  My favorite is the one about learning what happiness actually is!  That one took me a long time to figure out- and some days I guess I&#039;m still figuring it out- but know I&#039;m better at it because I don&#039;t feel the urge to spend so much since we set our sights on happiness as a goal.  We now have a much better understanding that money cannot buy happiness.  But you sure can be miserable if you don&#039;t have any :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome.  Just awesome.  I just wrote an article about decluttering and getting rid of stuff, and this is along the same lines.  As Americans, we waste so much!  I know I do it, but I try to be aware of it.]]></description>
