Interesting! Had no idea some of those celebs had it too. Just goes to show we&#039;re all people at the end of the day :) And that everyone has something they&#039;re working on no matter their status/stage in life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have ADHD but im a good problem solver, i have the ability to obtain things i want quicklier, or for a test i study the night before and keep the book in my mind till the test come, and also if i want something i prepare in my mind what to say to people in a way that i sound sexy and get what i want, its ADDictive, and  when i get bored i just go to a cub with friends to play tennis. The only thing is that u need to learn to be organised, then just live free. 
I also discovred that a lot of my favourite singers and actors have/had (some are dead) ADHD, like Kurt Cobain, John Lennon (that explains his creatiity), Britney Spears (she is mad crazy), Elvis Presely, Paris Hilton, Tom Cruise, Jim Carrey (he is very adhd), Adam Levine (he Apple about that), Justin Timberlake (he also has ocd), Emma Watson (she admitted, and she is very inteligent), Robin Williams (the actor), and much more. That shows that wen we are inspirared in something we triumph.]]></description>

Exactly!!! A lot easier to do in theory than in practice, but you&#039;re totally right - walking away at 80% decent can have almost the same effects as spending double the time to get it to 90 or even 99%. Cuz we all know there&#039;s no such thing as 100% perfect, haha... at least with OCD.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve definitely got some OCD in me. Sometimes I let it take over and I find myself doing one thing for hours at a time until absolutely perfect.

Awwww, I hear ya girl. Big time wasters but very very hard to break unfortunately for people like us :( My new ritual involves scanning my finished articles up and down at least 5 times before it feeling &quot;good&quot; in my head and ready to go. Adding another minute or so on top of all the other stuff needing to finish a post (sometimes I go way over 5 and I just pray it&#039;ll stop and I can move to a *different* ritual, haha.. I find I tend to latch on to one or two and then drop &#039;em and go to others - which is a LOT better than having them build up! So I try and not complain too much - even though I know it sucks :))

Appreciate you sharing your stuff with us here - you&#039;re def. not alone! You&#039;ve probably seen this before, but if not you&#039;ll enjoy it :) Talks about your door locking too!

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I don&#039;t think I am ADD or ADHD, I just sometimes feel like it with all the back and forth with technology and social media. Constantly moving and checking. I am legit more OCD though. I try to keep it low key, but my rituals include checking over my purse and saying things in a specific order to ascertain they are there. Testing that the door is locked 5x. My rituals happen in odd numbers....it&#039;s not too bad, but still annoying. Luckily my rituals are fairly productive like making sure my purse has everything or the house is locked. I first realized signs of OCD when I was 13 and I used to make sure my uniform shirt was clean, by touching the right sleeve, to middle, to left sleeve, saying &quot;CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN&quot;. LOL! OCD is very odd to others and I wish I could explain it. My only guess is that it gives me a false sense of control, when I know deep down there is so much that I can&#039;t control and I have to just let be. If I were better, I&#039;d love to write a post about OCD people and time management! Rituals are such a time waster.]]></description>

I can usually hold off on scanning unless it starts getting into a long monologue.  Then my eyes start to glaze over and I start glossing through looking for a main point.  This is pretty rare since most blog articles tend to be relatively short.]]></description>

I&#039;m guilty of scanning most of them myself. That&#039;s why I&#039;m so big into bolding key areas and chunking them up with headlines and pictures, etc. It helps keep people like us reading and at least scanning to the info we really care about so we don&#039;t take one look and then dash off ;)]]></description>
