					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on creating something so wonderful for yourself and the community you&#039;ve created! It&#039;s amazing to see all the offshoots you&#039;ve attempted and retreated from. Here&#039;s to 10 more years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats, J! 10 years, WOW! I&#039;m SO glad you started this blog and have changed so many lives. And holy crap, you were a MACHINE in 2011. I could&#039;ve never survived with THAT many projects. Good to know you have a more manageable schedule now.

Sometimes I want to clone myself because you&#039;re so right about: &quot;the more time you spend doing stuff you LOVE, the more opportunities that come your way.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on 10 years, that&#039;s amazing! I like the job list too, it shows a pretty widespread distribution among various industries. I think mine would look similar if I put one together. Good job figuring out what your passion is and finding a way to balance that with family, and other &quot;non-work&quot; passions. It can be tricky balancing that stuff effectively.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[35 jobs!!! I love this post. I think I&#039;ve had around... 10 jobs so far? But it is reassuring to know that there are many more out there, and there is hope that everyone can find a good fit one day.

Hopefully I will find a good fit within my next 25 jobs!]]></description>
