					<description><![CDATA[1. If you’re married, how much did YOUR wedding cost?

Only $2.5k! - We went to the Valley of Fire in Nevada and had an outdoor wedding in the canyons....it was GORGEOUS! (ifidosaysomyself)

   2. Did you get frugal, or did you allow yourself to splurge?

It was frugal, but not really...the ceremony/photographer/videographer/limo/pics was 900, the venue was free, our clothes was 600, I made my bouquet for $15, makeup/hair was $50, and the dinner was almost $1k

   3. If you’ve ever BEEN to a wedding, how much do you usually give as a gift?

Depends on the venue.  If it&#039;s a ritzy place I&#039;ll give $200 for us to cover our meals.  If it&#039;s not a ritzy place, I&#039;ll give a gift from their registry.

   4. Do you change it if you have to pay for flights/hotel/etc?

Absolutely not.  If I am CHOOSING to travel to go to this wedding, that&#039;s on me.  I wouldn&#039;t skimp out on someone for that.

   5. What’s the funniest thing you’ve ever seen at a wedding? ;)

					<description><![CDATA[Haha... I bet!  I used to LOOOOOOVE soda machines as a kid too - cool idea! :)  I probably don&#039;t have the patience for it now (not that I know what it all entails, exactly), but I bet others would really enjoy it.  Way to be unique!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. If you’re married, how much did YOUR wedding cost? We got lucky to get married in Utah with low costs and low reception expectations (no full dinner, ceremony, or bar).  So everything- photography, cake, catering, hall rental, dress, etc. ran 4k.  I count the ring and honeymoon separately as groom covered that- 3.5k for my dream ring (we saved with a moissanite and are upgrading to a diamond at our 5 year anniversary) and 2k for the honeymoon- 8 nights at all-inclusive resort in Cancun, including airfare and day trips.  It was an awesome deal!
2. Did you get frugal, or did you allow yourself to splurge? Combination.  We were super frugal in some areas so we could splurge where important to us- a nice location, dream ring and honeymoon, etc.  I only wish that we had put more money into photography.
3. If you’ve ever BEEN to a wedding, how much do you usually give as a gift? We typically get a gift for around $50.  Recently our go-to has been the Sodastream Home Soda maker because it is something people don&#039;t think to register for, but we use ours every day and it is fun.
4. Do you change it if you have to pay for flights/hotel/etc? -Nope.
5. What’s the funniest thing you’ve ever seen at a wedding? The bride was from Haiti, so her mother-in-law told her that she would do a Caribbean themed reception.  The funniest thing then was seeing the brides face when she walked into a Hawaiian luau wedding reception.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. If you’re married, how much did YOUR wedding cost? -We both wanted to elope, but knew our parents would disown us if we did.  So it cost about $2000 and included just siblings, grandparents, and parents at the town hall grounds in their colonial  house/museum.
   2. Did you get frugal, or did you allow yourself to splurge? -Frugal.  My dress was even &quot;just&quot; a bridesmaids dress that I got made in white.  It looked awesome though.
   3. If you’ve ever BEEN to a wedding, how much do you usually give as a gift? -We give $100 flat as well.  Unless it&#039;s close family, then sometimes $200.
   4. Do you change it if you have to pay for flights/hotel/etc? -Nope.
   5. What’s the funniest thing you’ve ever seen at a wedding? The bride, groom, and parents all coming in to the reception with cowboy hats and drinking beer from cans with the men wearing bow-tie t-shirts.  My family can be a bit redneck, lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Cora&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhh I LOVE Cotton Eye Joe! That is brilliant!!! :)
@&lt;b&gt;serena&lt;/b&gt; - Those divorce rates are pretty nasty :(  But the money and parties and all are for memories and good times - I don&#039;t consider them a waste.  I&#039;ts not many times where your entire family meets in one spot to celebrate :)  At least mine...
@&lt;b&gt;mints&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That&#039;s awesome.  Even more so it was in Cancun :)]]></description>

If you’ve ever BEEN to a wedding, how much do you usually give as a gift?
Do you change it if you have to pay for flights/hotel/etc?
What’s the funniest thing you’ve ever seen at a wedding? ;)

- we paid 6K although it costed about 10K. The honey moon was paid by my mother-in-law so we spent only 400 on souvenirs and dinners our of the all-included resort. My brother-in-law gave us as a gift the wedding rings and my mom paid for the food 
- got very frugal and still got out of the budget by 1K
- about 50, if it&#039;s family then it&#039;d be around 100, it it&#039;s close family (siblings) we buy something for their wedding (as my b-in-law did) so it depends on what we&#039;re buying ;)
- nope
- at a wedding in cancun, the best man undressed the groom and threw him to the sea...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, hubby and I went to the courthouse. Must have cost about $50, I think? I seriously have never understood the wastefulness of weddings that cost in the upwards of thousands of dollars, especially when people owe debt......do not own homes, etc. 

Our gifts for weddings we attend are under $100, as well.

And while we have never seen anything funny at weddings, I do have to say its funny, as in odd and sad, that people waste so much money for a wedding when 60% of them end up divorcing. Ouch!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our wedding cost about € 2200,-, but this number doesn&#039;t include the honeymoon, his suit and shoes(since we bought something he can wear quite often) of my dress (a gift from my parents). Including these numbers would put the total amount spent on the wedding at €4500,- (my dress being the most expensive item, ugh)

We had a budget, but weren&#039;t really frugal. We were able to do what we wanted (get married, have a reception for approx. 60 guests, have dinner with our families, stay at a hotel). It helps that we didn&#039;t had a big party (since almost all our guests had to travel, we didn&#039;t want to burden them with hotel costs, so no party). 

We usually give around €50,- (we often give money or something from the registry at that amount, and something personal -a little gift-)
We haven&#039;t been to weddings that required flights/hotel. I do think I would change the amount though. I once didn&#039;t attend one day of a two-day bachelorette party, because it was way too expensive. So I&#039;m cheap :)

Funniest thing: a very cool dance by the bride and groom (starting very classic, ending in a &#039;cotton eye joe&#039;)]]></description>
