I didn&#039;t at first when we only had one kid, but over time some people have recommended it to me too :) I think you&#039;re right that many states will allow you to use it for multiple people, but for some reason I kinda like having it all separated out like this... Depending on how much you contribute every year and if you&#039;re getting tax benefits that would affect it too. (I.e. if you max out the tax benefits every year you&#039;d want separate accounts to reap the most benefits vs just one account where you&#039;d hit the cap faster)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question for you - Did you ever consider only having one 529 for Penny, Nickel and Dime to save on the fees?  Someone suggested that to me for my children awhile ago.  At least in my state you can use the account for whichever child needs it.]]></description>

YAAAASSSS good job!!! $1,300 in itself is huge - and even more empowering since it was fully in your control - well done :) You&#039;re gonna have a great time watching you wealth grow and that debt go down over time!! Keep going!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I&#039;m at the very, very beginning of the journey myself with loads of debt so this was my second month tracking my net worth and it went up almost $6,000!!!

This will not be repeated every month because I &quot;found&quot; a small 401k I contributed at a former employer that I was just letting hang out in no man&#039;s land. I grabbed it and pulled it over to a traditional IRA resulting in the giant increase.

So I did about $1300 on my own which is not bad with all the debt&#039;s interest working against me. Just wanted to report in because I&#039;m super stoked at the change!]]></description>

Haha yeah, I actually did include it all for the first handful of months, but then it felt weird and figured if any of the $$$ came back to me over the years then it would just be a nice addition to the net worth :) Vs the opposite of taking hits whenever it gets distributed later!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see millionaire status if this bull run continues into 2019. I think you should add the baby funds into your Net worth, until they turn 18 and it is out of your hands. Until then you manage it and it can be counted as a total family fund. Just a thought.]]></description>
