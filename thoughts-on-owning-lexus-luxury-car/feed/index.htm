Hey! Yeah man - still very much loving it! Stings more when you get scratches/dings in it, but other than that it&#039;s still treating us very well :) Put about 25,000 miles on it since owning it and outside of a flat tire and regular maintenance (oil/etc), haven&#039;t had to drop anything else into it (knock on wood). Surprisingly fits THREE car seats in the back too - or else we would have been in trouble when we found out we were expecting a third kid! Though we did have to swap out one car seat for a thinner one to squeeze them all in...

I&#039;ve owned Hondas and Toyotas most of my life too, and this Lexus def feels as robust - just more luxurious inside :) My mechanic says he loves them too and shouldn&#039;t have any problems riding it out for years to come - so hopefully that&#039;s true!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you feel about your Lexus a year later? Right now I’m planning to buy a car within the next week. The Lexus RX has piqued my interest. Specifically, a 2016 model straight of the lease with 25,600 miles on it. It’s the sport package. Some of my interest in which ever car I purchase is likely in line with yours and I have additional interests too. I obviously want the height of safety and reliability. This is the family car and it will be filled with cars seats and my giant dog. It will be driven regularly in some of the most unsafe city roadways and highways in the country, where high accident ratios are common per capita. Also, I intend to ditch the Lexus tires early on, because they don’t give great traction for handling on icy roads, which will be a 4 month plus annual event in Boston. I don’t want an endless money pit and am prone to driving my car into the ground. Sure you can keep any car running as long as you for a price. I expect out of a car to get 200k without it turning into a money pit before hand. Otherwise, I feel I made a poor purchase regarding quality. Volvo May have great safety and realibilty reputations, but that reputation is ancient history. Nothing has been more unsafe than the Volvo’s we have owned built 2004to the present. They are also astornomical to maintain much like Audi and Mercedes. Junk! The Lexus piques my interest based off of previously owned Honda’s and Toyota’s. Granted, the cost of ownership and reliability has the possibility of being buried in the past too, because cars over all seem to all have corners cut these days on important factors and the money spent on technology. I’m hoping you can share the mileage you’ve placed on your Lexus and the cost of ownership during that time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a bit of a car guy and have always had odd car projects.  They generally haven&#039;t been frugal experiences by the end.  A good friend and fellow retired colleague can no longer drive.  He leased a Lexus RX350 last year.  He went to give it back and just couldn&#039;t bring himself to take the loss of his &quot;down payment&quot; and his monthly payments.  He asked me to take his lease over and since we&#039;ve always helped each other out I did.  Now I have my pickup and our old Prius...both of which my wife and I enjoy.  Now this Lexus sits there all shiny and wanting to stretch it&#039;s legs.  I don&#039;t know.  I wish it was the hybrid model, I wish this happened after the Prius died (it never will I&#039;m thinking).  I wish he could drive again and I could give it back.  But the only thing I can think of doing is Road Trip!]]></description>

Interesting... don&#039;t know much about those, other than they look sexy as hell from the outside ;) As well as Wranglers for that matter! Just a different kind of sexy, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I purchased a 2016 Lexus RC 200t at the end of 2k17. Had a little over 2k miles. Ff 3/18...I now have over 17k miles on it and have had many issues, the biggest being the ac/heat. I love it, but hate it too. It&#039;s scary sitting in the back, as there isn&#039;t really much of an ass end. I bought a 2k17 Wrangler, as there were too many days I did not feel comfortable driving it. Rainy days, no thanks. It hydroplanes like nothing I&#039;ve seen. I now prefer functional over swagger...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bought a used 2003 Accord with 34,000 miles on it in 2006.  Put 165,000 miles on the car, at the end it was burning a quart ever 1500 miles.  I drive a lot of miles for work and such (25,000 a year), so I bought a 2011 Accord with 32,000 miles on it.  Ran it up to 135,000 miles, and this year it went to my son because he is far away.  Got a super deal on a 2014 Hyundai Azera, off-lease, 26,000 miles, loaded.  Plan on paying it off in a year and then driving it until the wheels fall off.  Wife has a 2006 Honda Odyssey EX-L with 135,000 miles, still rolling along and been paid off for years......:)]]></description>

Yes! Exactly Lars! Lars said pretty much everything I wanted to.

I&#039;m not a car person but I have a strange draw to the Audi TT coupe (red. It must be red.) Aesthetically speaking...it&#039;s like a sexy supermodel. *drools*]]></description>
