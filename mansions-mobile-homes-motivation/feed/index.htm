Interesting!! And totally makes sense too - the more space I have the more I tend to fill it up too :( it&#039;s a good thing we&#039;re figuring this out now though so we can live a better future life! Just gotta pull that trigger!]]></description>

Right??? Great way to think of it!

Usually all up to us. We just got to remember to stop and MARINATE on this rather than going through life as if &quot;it&#039;s the way it&#039;s supposed to be.&quot;]]></description>

Depends on where I&#039;m guessing? 

I want to live in one of those resort-type RV/Mobile home parks vs the ones that first come to mind :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We lived in a mobile home for about 10 years when we were first married.  We kept it clean and organized.  We had a utility building for our outdoor equipment and bikes.  Know we have a 2200 square foot two-story house and it is very seldom really clean, it&#039;s disorganized, and too big for the two of us.  We have a utility building that is crammed full of junk.  I have been looking at downsizing and thinking about going back to a mobile home or living in our RV.  I&#039;ve looked at realtor.com for Myrtle Beach and there are some very nice manufactured homes listed at a very affordable price.  It&#039;s surprising how your priorities change as you get older!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every time my husband asks me when we can retire, I tell him that depends on whether he wants to live in a $50K, $500K, or $5M home.  We watch that tiny house nation show and I admit I get tempted! We could retire today if we wanted to downsize to the &quot;extreme!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s more to the decision than just home size vs. expenses, especially the neighborhood.
Perhaps it&#039;s because all I know about mobile homes I learned from Trailer Park Boys, but in my mind mobile homes equal drug abuse, crime and just an awfully dysfunctional neighborhood. I wouldn&#039;t want to live like than even with ER.

Am I completely off?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s free to dream! I love the concept of mobile homes as this is very exciting yet challenging to do once in a while. Aside from it it cheaper, I think it offers adventure and more enjoyment, which I know my kids would love to have.]]></description>
