					<description><![CDATA[Wow Gene, this is amazing. I love the level of detail, thank you for sharing it with all of us. I love how you also got to 1 million so much earlier than expected! Fingers crossed it’ll happen to me, too. It’s all about discipline!]]></description>

You&#039;re probably right.  I know that once I solidly meet my &quot;number&quot;, my tolerance for the day-to-day hassles of the corporate world will become much easier to walk away from.  :)]]></description>

You&#039;re more than welcome to &quot;appropriate&quot; any portions that you think might help you.

Be careful if you set the retirement date prior to 55 years old though, there&#039;s a circular reference I haven&#039;t fixed yet for the 72t rule in the drawdown sheet. 

I may not fix it since I don&#039;t think I will have enough to retire comfortably much before I&#039;m 55 anyway.]]></description>

Damn Gene, you nerd.  I love it.  Great job on the spreadsheet.  That is impressive.  Very similar to my retirement.  Hope you don&#039;t mind if I use and plug some of my numbers in and see how I am tracking?

thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kind of wish I had tracked my net worth all those early years.  I’m slightly early retired and in awesome shape now but I never tracked it until Personal Capital came out a few years ago. I wasn’t interested in retiring super early so it didn’t really matter.  I knew we were saving much more aggressively than most but I also planned on working until I was 70, like most of the older guys at my corporation who also enjoyed their jobs.  In my fifties, the first time I checked my net worth and found out we were millionaires it was a shock, a good one but still a surprise because we had about eight different accounts and except for the 401K none of them was impressively large.  I have to admit my tolerance for the negative aspects of work went way down once I realized I didn’t need to be there for financial reasons.  Maybe it is good I didn’t know?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started tracking my Roth IRA contributions initially just so I knew what I could take out without penalty in case I needed my &quot;emergency fund&quot;. 
Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on how you look at it),  I wasn&#039;t as far along in my savings as you when I started tracking my NW and could figure out my contributions.
I track all my contributions now just to get a read on my total savings rate.]]></description>
