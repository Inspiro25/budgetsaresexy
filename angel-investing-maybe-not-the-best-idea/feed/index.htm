					<description><![CDATA[I think in Calacanis&#039;s book about Angel Investing, how he does it is he builds up a full pipeline to invest in companies and makes it his full time job to do angel investing.

But at like $25K a pop, and to invest in 200-300 companies before I bump into a great company/unicorn...I&#039;m not quite there yet with my net worth to absorb that risk lol.

But in reading his book, it does sound very fun to be able to talk about new ideas that can change the world to founders and to be able to take part in a movement that can possibly disrupt how we do things.

Hope it works out!]]></description>

I love your hands-on approach AR! That&#039;s how you crushed it and got to FI in the first place -- by building a kick-ass business and investing in yourself!  Are you taking on any angel investors for your new site? ;). Kidding. well, kind of... :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As an entrepreneur, I always wanted to do some angel investing later in my career. Besides helping out startups get off the ground, it feels like a fun way to make money!

But as I’ve gotten older and gotten to the FI, my risk tolerance is not there. I’d much  rather sit back and relax with a majority of my assets in index funds. 

And any risky bets will be on myself right now. That’s why I recently bought a website, I’d rather be in direct control of the risk in ny portfolio.

Maybe in the future I’ll be in such good financial shape that I can give more and angel invest for fun. But not yet!]]></description>
