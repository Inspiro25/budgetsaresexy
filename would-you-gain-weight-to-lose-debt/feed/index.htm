					<description><![CDATA[I really can&#039;t believe people would answer that question that way, guess it goes to show you how vain America can be (along with how debt is no big deal).

It&#039;d be easier for me to lose that 25lbs than to pay off debt so of course I would go with the gain the weight over the debt.  I can work out an hour a day for a few months and get rid of it...I would have to make thousands of dollars an hour to be able to pay the debt off in the same amount of time.]]></description>

First of all, congrats on your weight loss!  That is wonderful, and definitely admirable!!  I lost 20 lbs a couple years ago and the cost was significant - but from a psychological standpoint, buying smaller clothes is great motivation.  Something tells me that shopping to clothe a 25+ lb body would be not quite as fun.  I&#039;m not at all surprised that your shoe size changed - it just furthers my assertion that gaining 25 lbs would be expensive!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would take the debt. It would be harder to lose the 25 lbs.Plus, if I gained 25 lbs on my small frame, I would start having health issues. Not to mention without plastic surgery it&#039;s hard to lose the extra skin!]]></description>
