					<description><![CDATA[A couple of years ago I went to Home Depot on Black Friday for deals.  It wasn&#039;t very busy and I got some killer deals on household stuff. I was planning on shingling my roof and painting.  I ended up saving a lot of money and I didn&#039;t have to get up at 3am.  

This year I ended up in a smaller town that had lots of snow around Thanksgiving.  I ended up at Wal-mart around noon on Black Friday and most of the deals were still around, because of all the snow.  I didn&#039;t need anything, but it was so much fun heading out once the snow had ended, and watching every vehicle driving around had new Televisions in the trunk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - Don&#039;t tell my wife! She&#039;ll buy everything Potter!!
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Oh hell yeah it is, no joke!
@&lt;b&gt;GJ&lt;/b&gt; - WOW I am jealous of those Pradas!!!  I really want a pair myself (a very manly one, if that&#039;s possible?).  And I&#039;d totally venture out if I had a fun group of people doing that :)  Sounds like fun for sure... the opposite of going by yourself.
@&lt;b&gt;Sandy @yesiamcheap&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah yeah ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to swear I&#039;d never participate in Black Friday. That is, until I got married. The ladies in my husband&#039;s family make this an annual tradition. And (I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying this) it is actually a lot of fun. 

We grab coffee and go to the closest mall together. No one has an agenda (i.e. shopping list) so we avoid the big, chaotic stores and snag some killer deals at the smaller, less busy ones. After a few hours, we head home and have breakfast while the guys go shopping for a few hours. We are all usually home, eating thanksgiving leftovers and leisurely setting up Christmas decorations and listening to Bing Crosby by noon. 

Deals this year: 

- 3 wool sweaters and 3 tank tops from Gap (original retail $190, paid $21)
- Prada sunglasses from Macys (original retail $245, paid $49)
- BluRay movies from Best Buy for $7.99 each]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m renovating my kitchen and have been monitoring prices on the microwave and fridge I needed to buy since June.  I picked up the fridge at Sears on Labor day for $600 off the regular price and scored an $80 gift card with the transaction.  Fast forward to Black Friday and my microwave was $100 off, bringing the price down to $119.  My total transaction ended up being $41.73 for a $220 microwave.  It was worth getting up at 3AM for.]]></description>
