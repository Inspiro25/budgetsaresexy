YUP - exactly.

The less you need to live, the less you need to work later. Such an easy concept, yet we always make things so complicated :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha, I have a similar thought when I notice people spending gobs of money (including myself).  I always wonder how many more years they will have to work in order to enjoy that particular luxury.  How many more years will it take to maintain and finance and replace $80,000 cars for 30 years versus $30,000 cars?  How many more years to pay for that extra 3,000 SF of living space (and heat and cool and furnish and clean it)?  It applies to small expenses too.  An extra $100 a month on anything not only reduces your saving/investing ability by $1200 a year but also means you need to save an extra $30,000 or so in order to generate enough income pay for that expense in retirement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, you got me, J$!  I saw your tweet today, &quot;Comment on this article of mine,&quot; and I thought you were inviting me to comment on a new post about marketing (not to re-visit a prior one that I had already read). 

But now that I&#039;m here I&#039;ll comment. Your tweet might be interpreted as an ad for this post, and that it was your intent to mislead me into thinking I was going to read something new. (Though I rather doubt that.) Most likely it&#039;s just a grammatical misunderstanding, with an implied descriptive modifier--&quot;Here is one reader&#039;s&quot;--prefacing the noun, &quot;comment,&quot; which I mistook for an imperative verb.

You may recall that I tend to over-analyze, and I am super-sensitive to the issue of intent because it has such a pivotal role in my guest post here of April 4, 2014. To me, that&#039;s still a hot-button issue, worth revisiting too because it might save us taxpayers a ton of money.

Now aren&#039;t you glad you got me here?;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great mantra.  It&#039;s so easy nowadays to go in a dealership and drive off with a brand new luxury car that day without giving up any money.  Maybe that&#039;s what that person in front of you did.  Or maybe they bought it with cash.  In either case, it doesn&#039;t matter because anyone can buy that and you decided not to.  

Marketers would hate to see this post because making other people jealous enough to buy their product is a big part of their strategy.  Great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/anyone-can-buy-that/#comment-150048&quot;&gt;Jenni Davidson&lt;/a&gt;.

I drive an 8 year old truck where the wheels wells are starting to rust out and there is a slight rattle in the lifters until it warms up.

My family (parents/siblings) tease me about it once in a while, &quot;When are you going to replace that thing?&quot; or &quot;Why are you still driving that rust bucket?&quot;

I always simply reply, &quot;When it&#039;s no longer running.&quot; to the first question and, &quot;Because it&#039;s paid off.&quot; to the second question.

My wife and I never have and never will buy a new vehicle, but my wife once asked me, &quot;If we won the lottery what kind of car would you buy?&quot; to which I replied, &quot;Another used Ford just as it soon as the one I have now isn&#039;t worth fixing anymore.&quot;]]></description>
