That&#039;s crazy... it&#039;s too bad all the other comments got wiped away on this post too (I did a blog conversion) cuz there was a lot of good input in here from back in the day.

					<description><![CDATA[I had gallbladder surgery on Dec 5 after being in the hospital 3 days.  I just got my bill and I have to pay almost $4000!!  And thats with insurance!! WTF??  Girl you have some GOOD insurance!  My deductible is $1000 and the my plan pays 80% of the bill and I pay 20% up until I meet my $3000 OOP max!  Man I&#039;m pissed..because my surgury was at the end of the year..If i would have had the surgery earlier I would have gotten my tonsils out (because they need to come out) too!  Hell it would have been free since I met my ded and OOP max!]]></description>
