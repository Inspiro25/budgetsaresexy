					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see why your philosophy on stimulating and/or motivating performance thrue punishment is to be called innovative... People and employees are naturally being punished (fired) if they  don&#039;t meet meet their targets. Rewarding people is à sign of respect for their extraordinairy performance and is rewarded, not before but, after showing their extra performance.  Claiming motivation thrue punishment is something that will never work on the long run.. Fear is no motivater! As history has shown...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Buck Rogers&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s funny how that works, huh?  I&#039;d love to read more about it actually - I have it on my list to check out :)
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I don&#039;t ever try out sites like that either but I&#039;d imagine I would if I thought I couldn&#039;t do it on my own.  Some of them have pretty good communities going on and relating to others is always nice &amp; motivating.  Kinda like our clan here on the blog in my opinion :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Oh my gosh that would be horrible!!! Haha... now way I&#039;d try that one out, would be a bad way to start the day :)  (even though I do, secretly, like math)
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Does it suck as hard losing money when it&#039;s NOT your fault? Haha... I think it would feel better for me when it IS my fault over someone else&#039;s... but I&#039;m not gonna put it to test and find out.  Either way I don&#039;t like it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, yeah we do &quot;wine tasting&quot; too, and even have one of those buckets to spill out/spit the wines we don&#039;t like, but usually we all just start chatting and not paying attention to what we&#039;re all doing.  The best part is having like 20 bottles to choose from and testing out all kinds :) Oh, and the food too. Muy muy importante if you&#039;re drinking all those grapes!
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I used to think about that too, but now I find that hundreds of people are emailing me and they usually require me to do MORE work ;)  Not even the paypal payments I get motivate me anymore! haha... you&#039;re always welcome to attend our wine meet-ups too if the stats ever align :)
@&lt;b&gt;Elise Adams&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  You gotta be afraid in order to REALLY change sometimes!  Glad to see you&#039;re still so passionate in your goals and writing - will check it out in a few :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lindy Mint&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahaaha  best comment of the day! (And I&#039;m totally tweeting that right now btw :) But I&#039;m not referring to you so you don&#039;t get in trouble!)  Thanks for inspiring this post to begine with!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Is that really a mode?  For the iPhone?  If so yeah - I can try that! :)  Though knowing me I&#039;d just come back into bed for &quot;5 more minutes,&quot; ugh...
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - At least then SOMEONE will be winning :) (which reminds me - whatever happened to all those Charlie Sheen references?  I miss them.  D&#039;uh!)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Well, I mean you set your own goals and your own punishments, so if you were using the site to motivate you better you probably wouldn&#039;t waste the time tricking yourself or changing it up before you slipped each time ;)  Then there&#039;d be no point.
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahahaa.. 2nd best comment of the day! Good one :)  Though I&#039;ll admit it took me a few seconds to catch on. Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s just crazy. I wouldn&#039;t be able to sleep if I knew there was a chance of my $ getting shredded up. 

The site about punishing you for not meeting your goals, couldn&#039;t you just lie about it and say you did? I probably would do that if I knew my money was going to be given away otherwise.]]></description>
