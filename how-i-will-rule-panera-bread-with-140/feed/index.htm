You know what&#039;s funny? I literally had a bagel w/ cream cheese yesterday and didn&#039;t even pay attention to the costs, haha... Interesting how your money mindset changes over the years :) 

(I used to watch every last penny when starting my journey, and now I allow myself to &quot;splurge&quot; on the little things without worrying much since I&#039;ve got the big ones covered. Not that I agree that cream cheese or bagels should cost that much - still pretty crazy!!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ROFLMAO... at the time of this writing, I&#039;ve decided that ignoring the cream cheese and going straight for the mint crinkles and you-pick-twos are better. Oh, and wielding that good old Panera Rewards card]]></description>
