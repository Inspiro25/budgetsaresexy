					<description><![CDATA[@SAT So true. You need to keep your promises or nobody will trust you.
@PKamp3 LOL! The walk of shame is like the minimum payment. Good one.
@MSS That&#039;s the worst when people don&#039;t remember where their money went. Who&#039;s supposed to remember?
@Stephanie No more sex talk! My gf has been sending me naughty messages all day lol.
@ WHB Yes the goal is to have a mutually beneficial relationship. Very few of us get to accomplish this with our credit cards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stephanie said it better than I can! I always think of my credit card relationships as meaningful and mutually advantageous (and forgiving of small mistakes). I pay off my balances every month and the credit card companies reward my usage with points and miles. When I do slip up and pay the bill a day or two late because of forgetfulness, I call and they remove the charges. It&#039;s not a PERFECT relationship, but I think it&#039;s a very beneficial one - for both sides. That&#039;s because we both understand how we want the relationship to proceed and we both upload our end of the bargain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d actually expand that metaphor and compare credit cards to sex in general.  If you don&#039;t use them responsibly, if you go on a big spending binge without thinking about the consequences, they can make you feel like crap afterwards, and even have a long-lasting negative impact on your life... but if you DO use them responsibly, you get to reap all kinds of rewards!  You can boost your credit score, get cash back or gift cards or a free flight somewhere... Or in the case of sex, you can end up with a stronger, more intimate relationship with someone you love.  In both cases - credit cards and sex - you&#039;re not dealing with something that is inherently moral or immoral.  It&#039;s all about how you use it.  It can mess up your life, or it can improve your life - it&#039;s all about whether you have the good judgment and self-discipline to make sure it&#039;s the latter. :-)]]></description>
