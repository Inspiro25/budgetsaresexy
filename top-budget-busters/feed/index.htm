yeah, car payments are no fun at all.. esp with other debts with much higher %&#039;s! I&#039;d probably do the same in your case, unless the amount left was small enough where you could get a &quot;win&quot; sooner than later by paying it all off and feeling good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally freak out trying to figure out where my money goes from time to time. What helps me is going over the budget. I add up how much i actually am saving and how much for debt repayment. And how much i pay in taxes and insurance! Then i look at my discretionary money and it isn&#039;t a lot. Then i usually feel better. :)

Right now my most hated expense is my car payment. I love my car, and I&#039;m happy with the purchase and expense, but the payment is killing my cash flow. The interest rate is 0.9%, so it seems silly to pay that off when i could work on my student loan, or mortgage instead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Obviously can&#039;t do much about the housing and insurance, but here&#039;s my &#039;communications&#039; setup:
Basic cable: DUMPED
Basic internet: $30
Netflix streaming (no delays on cheap internet): $8
Airvoice Wireless cell plan: $10
Google Voice home line: $0

Every bit of savings helps.]]></description>

Yikes! At least you have some time now to tweak here and there before the next winter season hits :) I&#039;m sure it would help in the Summer days too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By far I hate my electricity bill. We obviously didn&#039;t think about how energy inefficient our home is. We spent over $300/month during the winter on electricity for a 1700 sq ft house. OUCH!]]></description>
