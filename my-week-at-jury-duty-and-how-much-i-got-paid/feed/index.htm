					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/my-week-at-jury-duty-and-how-much-i-got-paid/#comment-134970&quot;&gt;Rebecca&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m sorry it came off that way, I actually do agree with you. My issues is with the way a few of these people were *treating* those around them. There&#039;s the professional way to deal with a situation, and then there&#039;s the disrespectful - &quot;let&#039;s cause a scene and get an attitude up in here&quot; route making it even worse for everyone involved. Particularly the employees just doing their job.

I&#039;d be just as frustrated and nervous as your husband too (and in fact, I was because I&#039;m a small business owner and fully self-employed too - pretty much being the *only* one bringing money to support my family with a baby), but I&#039;d imagine he&#039;d handle it a lot more respectfully than getting into someone&#039;s face and causing a scene (which hurts your chances of a positive resolution even more).

I can&#039;t remember the details, and I believe it varies state by state or county by county, but I do hope your husband can work something out so there&#039;s no financial hardship for you guys. That&#039;s scary :( I know there were people in our group which were allowed to leave under &quot;financial hardship&quot; so maybe it&#039;ll work out for you guys?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;because they thought they were too good to be there&quot;.   REALLY???? That is a really self important, judgmental and insensitive thing to say.  I don&#039;t think you get what a huge financial hardship jury duty actually is for some people.  Jury duty can literally bankrupt a small business owner. My husband just got summoned.  If he&#039;s stuck in jury duty there is NO income coming into the business because he is the only licensed professional that can do his job in our business.  His time is worth thousands of dollars a week - dollars that pay all the business bills, our employees, and are the only source of income in our family.  I&#039;m sorry, but $10 a day and the glow of civic duty won&#039;t pay the bills.  Perhaps people are cranky about being there because they are literally worried about how they will put food on the table and keep the doors to their business open, wondering if they should lay off their employees, and just generally how they will survive with zero income coming in for an undisclosed period of time.  Show a little sensitivity next time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Bobbi&lt;/b&gt; - Whaaat??? No way - that&#039;s crazy! Not only for all 8+ days of showing up, but the &quot;not knowing&quot; what to expect or plan in the future! Wow.... I will never ever complain again, haha... that&#039;s rough. Awesome your work was cool with it!!

@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, thanks so much for sharing your experience/thoughts with us!! Totally solidified my excitement for the whole thing! :) I agree with that judge more than I ever have before - jurors are super important! And although our trial was only 4 days long, even having THEM do it all over again would be a nightmare, so I guess being an alternate is just 1 piece to the puzzle - even though we do tend to feel un-helpful ;) So cool to hear from someone who works in the courtrooms - THANK YOU SO MUCH for commenting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, jury duty.  I always like to hear these stories because I&#039;m on the opposite end.  I am a court reporter.  I take down every word that those 8 lawyers, and everyone else, say in the courtroom.  SOOO many jurors come through my courtroom on a regular basis, but I&#039;m, obviously, forbidden to speak to them....that whole &quot;avoid any inference of impropriety&quot; thing.  :(  I&#039;m glad your experience was mostly enjoyable!  

Just a little FYI note on the alternate juror status....every state is different with how they handle alternate jurors.  I&#039;ve worked in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.  I can&#039;t remember if Virginia tells the alternate that they&#039;re an alternate beforehand, but I do know that North Carolina and Pennsylvania do.  Actually, here in NC, they specifically ASK the juror before they&#039;re chosen if they&#039;re okay with being an alternate.  The Judge tells them that they&#039;re being considered as an alternate juror.  Then they explain the purpose of an alternate, in which I&#039;ve heard an alternate referred to by the Judge as &quot;the sixth man on the basketball team,&quot; &quot;an insurance policy,&quot; and even &quot;a spare tire&quot;!  HA!  (It always generates laughter in the courtroom.)  I&#039;ve actually had jurors tell the Judge that they&#039;re not okay with being an alternate and they&#039;ve been excused.  

I imagine being an alternate is frustrating, but at the same time, I&#039;ve had so many cases use them and need them that it&#039;s vital to the process.  Some trials last for weeks on end, even months.  Can you imagine all the time and effort put into that trial only to have a juror get sick right near the end and not having an alternate to replace them?  The entire trial is then a mistrial and the participants have to start all over again with a new jury. 

I used to have a Judge that said that jury duty was one of the most important civic duties we have, and it is.  I know it&#039;s frustrating at times, but to J$ and anyone else on here who has served, thank you for your service!  It&#039;s such an important part of our justice system.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have you all beat. I had jury duty for the month of April, every tues and thurs for the entire month. That is showing up everyday until they either call you into a potential pool or send you home. Even if you make it onto a jury for several days you still have to finish all of your days. Welcome to Orleans parish, New Orleans. When my friend told me about it I did not believe her. Who can handle this burden? I was fortunate that my employer paid for jury duty but as I work for an out do state employer I know they were not thinking a month of jury duty. Basically it was lost month of work for my employer as they could not schedule anything important for me not knowing if I might make it on a case any day. Since then due to the overwhelming complaints they have lowered it from a month to two weeks. I am free from criminal jury duty for two years now. I can still be called for civil or federal duty tin the meantime and they do some ridiculous two week periods also. I never made it all the way onto a case, though I was fascinated by the process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s fun hearing all your stories so far :) I guess a lot of you have gone through cases too!

@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh that WOULD be fun! If someone around me went with I&#039;d totally do it :) I&#039;m not so good on going after it alone w/out any motivation, haha... Especially since I&#039;m so backed up with work now that I&#039;m a stay-at-home dad two days a week :( Great idea though! And I hope you get on another jury soon then too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, as a freelancer you pretty much get screwed. Luckily most of my money comes from advertising which runs whether I&#039;m in front of a computer or not, but it still backs up your entire week that&#039;s for sure... Maybe one day when you&#039;re swimming in millions you&#039;ll be ready to give it a shot :)
@&lt;b&gt;KM&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! Awesome employer :) I&#039;m sure there was a slight chance I could have gotten off on that reasoning too, but since I already pushed it back twice in the past year, I figured it was time to just suck it up and fulfill my duty. And I&#039;m really glad I did :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa@LittleHouseintheValley&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, if it were a murder case I woulda been STUCK there forever! And this post would have been a lot different, haha... but nah - it was determining who was negligent in a major car accident, and then who was owed what amount. It just took forever &#039;cuz ther were so many parties involved.
@&lt;b&gt;Angella&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! I&#039;m surprised the amount of spam that AOL probably lets through hasn&#039;t deterred him yet - he&#039;s pretty stuck in his ways! :) (And crazy you&#039;ve never been called to jury duty yet - you should swap with me some time, I get called every 3 years! Even when I move states!)
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, I&#039;m sorry to hear that :( I can&#039;t even imagine what that&#039;s like to go through - I hope you don&#039;t have anything nearly as crazy if/when you ever get called up again! And good to know about jury talking and stuff too - I guess my brain is still in &quot;secret&quot; mode since it was so engrained in us throughout the entire process :)
@&lt;b&gt;Veronica @ Pelican on Money&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well that&#039;s good! It&#039;s def. hard when you DO want to server - for a set amount of time even - but you just never know how long any of the cases can go for. Not being able to pay the bills is a BIG one too!
@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhh a million dollars? That&#039;s a lot! But it&#039;s totally true - your average citizen won&#039;t know anything about the law and precedence or any of that stuff, but those are the people tha are determining a lot! At least the system seems to be working for the most part though, at least on the surface :) And now you have a cool story to tell!
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Good thinking actually, though it turns out I can still write it off as they gave me a receipt that allows for it :) So I still win - yay!
@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - That def. blows. But at the same time 4 weeks is an INCREDIBLY long chunk to pause your life on, not many people can do that and not suffer any consequences. Guess it&#039;s just the way the system works though :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My experience with jury duty is that court is a wholly depressing place (which I already knew). Nobody wants to be there. I nearly got drafted into a four week fraud trial, which I simply couldn&#039;t do as I was about to start a new job (and had to make my case direct to the judge). Every single person called up before me did the same. Pretty sure the jury wound up - as juries do - being full of unemployed people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A couple months ago I had jury duty and got picked to serve on the jury, took Tuesday-Thursday.  The donation if you sign that away only counts for the first day of $6 then you get $15 the rest of the days that they will send you anyway.  Turns out my company will pay you for your time there, just send the check to the company when you get it, so no bonus cash for me.

It really was interesting to see what goes on but in the end I felt that it is kinda sorry that a group of 12 of us that have no clue on precedence or anything else ended up deciding on a case and awarding a bit over a million dollars... just crazy!]]></description>
