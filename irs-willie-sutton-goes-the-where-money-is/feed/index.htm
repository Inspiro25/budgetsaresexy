					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Monica C.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah it is!  But as long as you&#039;re playing by the rules, then at least you know there&#039;s nothing to worry about ;)
@&lt;b&gt;J. O.&lt;/b&gt; - That sucks!  I fear making that mistake too - I do my best to keep track of ALL money that comes in, whether I get a 1099 or not, and report it all anyways, but I can see something falling through the cracks like that too.  All we can do is our best! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Man, getting hit twice in your 20&#039;s is no joke. I hope I can get out of my 30s without ever getting one! *knock on wood*
@&lt;b&gt;The Ten Bob Millionaire&lt;/b&gt; - Very stressful for sure, I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not a CPA ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - WOWWWW very cool!  A great story to tell too, I love it :)  Thx for sharing!
@&lt;b&gt;Jerret&lt;/b&gt; - Wow that sucks... and twice in a year?? They must have thought something really fishy was going on, I&#039;m glad she&#039;s done with it now (hopefully)!
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMateKate&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That would be nice ;)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Same here - mine&#039;s getting more complicated too, gotta make sure we stay on track!
@&lt;b&gt;Carrie&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, well I&#039;m glad it all worked out in the end :)  And you have a healthy baby now!  At least that set off the nastiness, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ Debt-Tips&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo!  Hope you keep your streak alive!
@&lt;b&gt;Corey @ Passive Income to Retire&lt;/b&gt; - Good call, that&#039;s important :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I don&#039;t know of any...
@&lt;b&gt;Honey&lt;/b&gt; - I bet there&#039;s some truth to that :)
@&lt;b&gt;American Debt Project&lt;/b&gt; - Well, we wouldn&#039;t need them if people followed the law!  That&#039;s what&#039;s so frustrating really - that people F around all the time and try to get away with it, and then all of us &quot;good&quot; ones have to wade through all the $hit because now the gov&#039;t doesn&#039;t trust everyone... stupid people are always ruining it for others ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was audited 20 years ago, apparently before they went &quot;where the money is&quot;. I was a college student home for the summer and my landscaping boss paid me half check half cash. Silly me, I thought he was giving me cash for the weekend, but clearly he was only reporting the check amount. So I filled out a form and paid a few bucks and that was that.

I&#039;ve since been self employed (at least partly) for more than 10 years and have not been audited since (fingers crossed, wood knocked).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We got audited once in 2009 for our 2007 taxes. The letter came in about a week before our first child was born! It turned out we didn&#039;t report some income my husband received for doing some independent contracting for his father&#039;s company. I do the tax filing and I didn&#039;t even know about the contract work. The company didn&#039;t send us a tax form, but they sent one to the IRS. Grrr.

Thankfully the IRS people are really nice on the phone and they let us pay in installments. Between that and the new baby and unpaid maternity leave, 2009 was an interesting year, financially.]]></description>
