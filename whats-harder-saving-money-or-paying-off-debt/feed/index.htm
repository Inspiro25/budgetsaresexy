Indeed :) My opinion is that as long as your net worth is going UP it doesn&#039;t really matter which option you choose. Although the ones that *excite* you the most will always be more motivating.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love saving! Maybe that comes from being fortunate enough to never have had debt (until recently -- new mortgage!). Now I&#039;m struggling with having the option to emphasize one or the other. I feel like I equally want to invest more and pay down my mortgage quickly, so I think I&#039;ll throw money at them equally for now. I need to stop stressing about it -- both will make me better off. Once I come to terms with that I can have well-planned peace :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a fascinating scientific study, J. I think paying off debt is harder than saving, but I think that is because my debts are so large. Maybe I&#039;ll feel differently once I&#039;ve settled the debt once and for all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that unless you have the savings earmarked for a particular purpose, that saving money is much harder. It&#039;s too intangible to save &quot;just because&quot; or for some distant FI goal. Much easier to spend it on an awesome concert or something tangible, right?

Paying down debt has a clear, direct, and measurable benefit that you can see. You see your credit balance going down and you see the interest payments getting lower, a direct and satisfying correlation.

That being said, I haven&#039;t had anything but mortgage debt in a while, so I&#039;m working from memory!]]></description>

No shame in that! Having extra cash def. gives you options and keeps you away from getting into MORE debt - so that&#039;s good! Maybe once you hit a certain threshold you&#039;ll be more comfortable putting future amounts into debt? Like, once you hit X months of living expenses?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a hard one! I am actually struggling with this right now and sort of wrote about it on my blog. I have some savings built up and that feels awesome but I also have a car loan and student loans that I would love to pay off. For some reason the idea of putting more towards debt over saving bothers me. I can&#039;t put my finger on it. Logically I know paying off the debt sooner would save me money in interest and the sooner I pay it off the sooner I can save more. I think having money in the bank just makes me feel more secure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Documenting either saving or paying down debt is definitely a great trick. Very rewarding to see the progress.

I say paying down debt is harder. It&#039;s more fun to hoard cash!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perspectives and situations can shift this mindset for sure. Right now, paying off debt seems harder. Even though there is a clear end result (being debt-free! woohoo!) as opposed to saving, paying off debt feels harder because it seems I&#039;m always making payments, putting more toward it, and yet being debt-free still feels so far away.

Even when I was debt-free and unsure of strategically going about saving, I still thought paying off debt was harder. For some reason I really like making a game (and reaching each &quot;level&quot;!) out of saving money.]]></description>
