Haha nope! Not at all! 

I miss the engagement and working on a new project with folks I love, but I don&#039;t miss the act of podcasting at all. Just wasn&#039;t for me, and as you can see Paula is on fire over there and totally free&#039;d up to do things her own way and it&#039;s working! So no regrets leaving the show an ounce, but I&#039;m super glad I tried it out so now I know what it&#039;s about :) And it also allowed me to stay at home with my boys now too, which wouldn&#039;t have been possible!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, I&#039;ve been wanting to ask and this is the perfect time.  Do you ever regret leaving the Money Show podcast?  Is that a decision you would do differently if you could go back?

Thanks for your blog!

Amen, brother... When are you going to get your own blog going to pass these nuggets farther around for people?? You always have such strong (and usually thought-provoking) feelings on things!]]></description>

It is nice these days that you can stay as far away from banks as you&#039;d like :) It really changed when you could deposit checks right from your phone!]]></description>

Haha yeah - do it!! I was a bit confused at first too, but the more I poked around and started seeing them pop up everywhere, the more I thought it was complete genius :) It&#039;s hard to hate a bank that gives you a comfy place to crash and doesn&#039;t even require you to be a customer!]]></description>

Haha well that&#039;s good! Better to find out this stuff now about people than later :) And totally agree that if everyone is telling you not to do something that you should at least stop and consider it for a hot minute, but then still follow what you deep down feel like you need to do. Even major fails help you come out stronger than before, and sometimes there&#039;s really only one way to find out whether something is good or you or not - TO DO IT :) I&#039;d much rather do something and regret it later than always wonder &quot;what if&quot; and regret trying. Except for flipping homes - you&#039;ll never see me doing that, haha...]]></description>
