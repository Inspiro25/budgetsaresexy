					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also victim of Grupeer. Unfortunately I have other experiences with scammers and lawsuits against them.

My advise is for everybody to report Grupeer (and others) to authorities in the countries they committed the crimes (fraud, money laundering, tax evasion...). Authorities do the hard work of investigating and that reduces our legal fees. Authorities (Financial Supervisors, Police...) can access bank accounts, communication, freeze assets, arrest people and summon witnesses.

In a civil lawsuit we can also do it but we have to convince the judge and that costs more legal fees.

If you want a list of authorities in Latvia and UK to whom you can report, please contact me in Telegram @Luisdem]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My mother invested in a scam, and she lost a year’s salary. It had promised her 10%/year. She thought it sounded reasonable. And then she lost over 100K.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks you all guys for the comments! To answer some: yes maybe there is something legit in peer to peer, but the whole market has to be regulated - the sooner the better. And ofc the legit ones interests rates are nominal 13% which is 8% - 9% real with the delays of loan repayments taken into account. And you still have the risk of loan originator&#039;s default.

I consider myself lucky to have lost only 2k +3k (see below), for the numbers I see there are many in 5 figures amounts. 

Recover money is one motivation, chasing fraudsters is the other :)

However, sadly, the storm is not over yet. Other platforms, Monethera, Grupeer, are allegedly falling down right now, after I contributed my experience to J$. For those interested or affected: you can contact me @morenji on telegram.

Stay safe and healthy! Stay at home until the other storm - the most important one - is over.]]></description>

UGHH isn&#039;t that the truth!

And it&#039;s perfectly legal too!!!

Same with PAYDAY LOANS which charge even more!

There used to be a lot of P2P talk here back in the day - mostly positive - but haven&#039;t heard much about it in recent years... Not sure if a lot of the places have since closed or people just got tired of talking about it? (Or the stock market was too hot and overshadowed?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ouch! 
I risked 500€ with Envestio also, I had a weird feeling from the start, a p2p platform promising 17 to 22% returns. Sounds too good to be true. And as we can now say, it was.
Will most probably never see the money again and the scammers won&#039;t face any &quot;big&quot; criminal charges. Or worse, a few months or max one-two-three years for tens of millions of euros. A great way to become filthy rich ... Sad, sad times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you to the author for writing this, and to J for posting it.

First off, my condolences and empathy to you for going through this! My grandmother was taken advantage by a scam, and so was her sister! As we approach Easter I know (and I think most of us know too) that these scumbags will get their reward one day... God will judge.

Second, my sympathies to what the country of Italy (my ancestry) is going through with COVID-19. I sure hope you all see the light soon, and the rest of the world too.

Third, thanks for taking the time to write this. It must have been very painful but was a good lesson for us all. I&#039;m now even more suspicious of peer to peer or peer to business lending.

J Money and viewers - are there any good experiences with peer to peer or peer to business lending? i would be even more reluctant to attempt this today.

Anyway, in conclusion I do have to mention that for those of you mocking 20 + % interest - remember, that is what credit card companies charge!!! :-)]]></description>
