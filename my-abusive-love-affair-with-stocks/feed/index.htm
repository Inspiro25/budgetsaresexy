					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for guest posting for me while I was gone, brotha!  Always enjoy a little fiestiness up in here for my people ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Rachel&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahaha, that is hilarious... seems like something I would do too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I do the same for the most part, though I have an account specifically for me to play around with and try my hand at stock picking... it&#039;s a small % of my overall portfolio that lets me be dumb/super-risky ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Million Mile Secrets&lt;/b&gt; - Yep! Agreed.  And if you&#039;re REALLY weird/crazy like me, you actually enjoy seeing it go all over the place every week ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love stocks and enjoy the research. However, I&#039;m a bit conservative in my stock picks (S&#038;P 500 Index for my RothIRA). 
Now that I&#039;m debt free I can add to my portfolio every month or so. 
My current plan is to use David Fish&#039;s Dividend Champion list as a starting point on where to invest next based on the upcoming Ex-Dividend dates.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whoops just realized I used the wrong name when I was responding to comments above (Oren)... Anyhoo

@Jenna: I know what you mean...that&#039;s why I love a buy and hold strategy, just buy a few stocks that you know are excellent and are going places (at a good price, of course) and wait it out. I would only check the price of my stocks every few weeks or so. Once I started doing that my gains went up exponentially.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Rachel: hmm I actually also do have a love/hate relationship with socks...maybe I should write about that too...

@Cash Flow Mantra: glad you enjoyed it! :)

@Stephanie: I couldn&#039;t agree more, especially if you&#039;re good at finding stocks that are &quot;on sale&quot;, which I actually show how to do in my book (pardon the shameless promotion). As for the second part - to each her own! It&#039;s great to have an adviser that you trust :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post made me chuckle. :-) 

I totally agree with your second #3.  The stock market crashes not infrequently (although to varying degrees), and it has always rebounded.  If you&#039;re close to retirement, you shouldn&#039;t have that much money in stocks anymore.  But if you&#039;re young like me (I&#039;m 28) and retirement is a long way off... if anything when the stock market crashes you should be buying!  (On another finance blog I read, a commenter described it as buying stocks &quot;on sale.&quot;)  In the long term, the market will inevitably rebound and you&#039;ll make a ton of money.

That said, I don&#039;t buy individual stocks. (See the first #2 - I don&#039;t have time to sit around researching individual companies.)  I stick with an IRA and trust my financial advisor&#039;s judgment. ;-)]]></description>
