					<description><![CDATA[Hah!  love it :)  You&#039;re 1,000% right too on sitting back and watching it grow!!!  That has been one of the biggest motivational factors for me over the years.  Sometimes it&#039;s hard to envision saving up all that money or cutting costs and being frugal until you actually see it piling up in the bank account!  Or in my case, my 401(k).  It wasn&#039;t until I logged in one day and saw all those $20 and $50 deposits totalling $8,000 when I realized it was WORKING! :)  And from that point forward I&#039;ve been upping my game as much as I can...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(LOL) It&#039;s a little scary ain&#039;t it?I  do this with our finances.It&#039;s an eye opener.It makes it harder (for me) to let go of that money.I have been doing this since January.I have been tracking too.So I pretty much know what the bills will be.I put that amount in the checking.I leave a $300 buffer in there just in case.I have never had to touch that $300.At the end of the month I transfer that money to our savings account.We have accumulated $1350 to date.Doing this is so simple.I just deposit $150 a paycheck in to savings.And  1/2 the total of our monthly bills.I do this with each check.And sit back and watch as the money grows.Cutting costs in other categories puts a smile on my face and an extra deposit in the savings account.Another tip is to reimburse yourself for using coupons.I keep a change jar on the kitchen counter to drop my coupon savings into.I don&#039;t use a lot of coupons but every little bit helps.......Dena]]></description>
