					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/standardized-test-question-writer-job/#comment-218397&quot;&gt;Helen K Kreller&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi! My name is Eugenia and I am teacher of academic tests in Russia and verbal tests questions writer. I have been writing questons for the old version of the SAT test and for the latest one, as well as fot the GMAT and TOEFL tests. My favourite subject is reading comprehension in fact, but I also write Sentence completions, Sentence corrections, Error Corrections, Improving passages, Antonyms, Synonyms, Aanalogies etc.

Will you describe your project in mor details? Which tests are you going to develop? Do you still need questions writers?

Thank you for the answer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds great until you don&#039;t EVER get paid! 
I edited 50 test questions for a large company that does the entrance and exit exams for nursing school and it&#039;s been 6 months - no pay so far because after you re-write them it has to go to another reviewer and if none are available your questions sit in purgatory.
Think long and hard before you go into this, signing a contract that ties you to the company for a year, counting on a $600 extra payday each month that may never come.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you kidding me?! Pearson doesn&#039;t even write these questions? Millions of children and teachers are having their lives effected by people who might not even be qualified?! Did you just admit that you purposely try to write question to trick students, rather than test whether a child had mastered a concept?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$20 per question at half an hour per question, plus editing time.  And it&#039;s strictly work for hire, meaning the test writer has no rights to the work--no copyrights, no nothing.  The author can&#039;t resell the questions elsewhere, or even use them in her own classroom.  The pro writers I know (including me) wouldn&#039;t touch that gig, I&#039;m afraid!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, man, normal standardized tests tend to be pretty easy (except for that one time when we had a story about a drugged giraffe flying around?! SO strange), but the reading section on the SAT sucked. Those questions are so subjective so I have no idea why there&#039;s supposed to be only one &quot;right&quot; answer.

But this was definitely an interesting perspective on where these things come from... I wonder if any of my teachers write these. Hmmm...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J., yeah, I was actually looking at it to apply for a part time job that&#039;s similar to what&#039;s described above. I was reading through a handful of &quot;teacher&quot; blogs, and I read another article advocating the same thing. At least for the ACT, it seemed like they were most interested in current high school teachers, but I don&#039;t know that anybody&#039;s necessarily disqualified.]]></description>
