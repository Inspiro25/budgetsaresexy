					<description><![CDATA[My wife is a pharmacist so basically a year after we met, when she was done her residency and started making real pharmacist money, she was making more than I was at my job in the music business in tour finance.  And I&#039;m 5 years older than she is.

And now she&#039;s in medical school and is going to be a doctor so it makes sense that I&#039;m the one that will be the stay-at-home dad (like yourself), when she goes back to med school in the fall.  Right now we&#039;re enjoying both being at home with our new baby, Henry, born February 1.

I&#039;ve never had any issue with this.  I honestly do not understand the patriarchy at all and especially the archaic idea that one person should make more than the other.  Let&#039;s just make what we make and enjoy our lives without getting caught up in ridiculous ideas of what gender should do what.]]></description>

Daaaaamn this was great!!

SUCH awesome info here and thoughts - thank you!

YES to that communication and background stuff, wow... I&#039;m seeing it more and more in my own household too now that I&#039;m at home more and seeing my wife still do things like laundry and cook and kid stuff on top of working, etc while a lot of it I obviously can do and *have* started doing now... (for example I&#039;m now The Laundry Person during the week and my wife LOVES it! Even though I feel like it&#039;s such a minor thing?!)

I&#039;m still working on the cooking department and have contributed a little, but def. need to up my game there. And while I don&#039;t *make* the appointments for the kids, I am the one that now takes them everywhere most times so I know that at least helps out...

Still, I come from the exact same background as your husband does so I know it&#039;s about breaking old views and making new habits... Which thankfully I&#039;m always up to just being a curious person in general :) Not that I always *enjoy* it, haha, but at least I&#039;m game to it!

Anyways, awesome awesome stuff, thank you for taking the time to write this. Especially knowing now everything else you&#039;re doing for your family!! Super Mom over there!]]></description>

That&#039;s a good idea :) Or really *any* idea you come up with as it shows you&#039;re conscious about things and only want whats best for you guys! Which is the key to relationships! I&#039;m sure she&#039;s so proud of you for ramping it up too - well done :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re a two-woman household, so I guess that has a benefit in that neither of us is socially expected to make more money than the other :-) I&#039;ve just started earning more than my wife for the first time (about a third more) and it does mean we&#039;ll have to make some adjustments - both practically and mentally. We&#039;ve always split everything 50-50 but I&#039;m conscious that she now struggles to do this. We&#039;re still figuring things out, but one solution I&#039;m toying with is using my extra income to &#039;even out&#039; times in the past when she was doing well and I was in a pile of debt. For instance, she put down the deposit on our house, when we bought this place. Perhaps I can save up the same amount and pay a chunk off the mortgage now?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think other people&#039;s assumptions can be the most challenging. For example, one year my company sponosored the military ball and I had to host a table with several high ranking officers.  Mr. Tre came as my +1 and wore his uniform. He spent the entire evening hearing &quot;Sgt. are you sitting at the correct table?&quot;  It was a little awkward, but he laughs about it now.]]></description>

I&#039;m sorry it&#039;s so hard at times :( But I do hope you know that you&#039;re not a bad person deep down!! &quot;Drive&quot; can be an incredibly powerful factor!! Maybe he - or anyone else you end up meeting/coupling with later - will find their drive in other areas of life vs career? Like maybe in passions or philanthropy or something? I&#039;m totally with you though on wanting to be with a like-minded/driven person. It saddens me when people are just &quot;there&quot; and not adding value to other people or places/things/etc... Hopefully they *are* happy though even if we don&#039;t understand it! ;)]]></description>

Yes, I would imagine it would be hard to go back to a 9-5 after so much time off, haha... Have you sent him any of our Side Hustle posts before?? Maybe something there will excite him? :)

https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ways-to-make-money/

Totally understand the &quot;weird&quot; factor with asking for money/giving allowances though, and was about to suggest just that - having &quot;mad money&quot; to spend each! Hopefully he&#039;ll get a nice side gig going though to pump it up to his liking :) I imagine it&#039;s been pretty hard on you bearing all that weight on the income side as well - even though it as a mutual decision. Very interesting to see so many different paths and dynamics here on this post over the days... Thanks for adding to it :)]]></description>
