					<description><![CDATA[Nice, J$. I appreciate your integrity and honesty. I think I skimmed the post, thought, &quot;weird&quot;, and moved on. Thanks for protecting your guest poster from unnecessary bile, too! Like you said, it&#039;s one thing to dislike a product, another thing to dislike a person. See GRS here: http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/08/14/grs-comment-policy-updated/ . I thought JD said it nicely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, 

While I thought the post was HORRIBLE and borderline criminal I don&#039;t think you should have taken the post down.  People probably could have learned just how blind the product/mlm could make someone of reasonable intelligence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Holly. I want to see the comments.  :)
(I didn&#039;t think the post was that interesting, especially not comment-worthy, so I&#039;m curious what got people so riled up.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the post but not the comments.  I think that at the beginning of the post you wrote that you weren&#039;t sure if you should post it or not.  Next time trust your instincts.

the post just didn&#039;t interest me, deleted it and looked forward to today&#039;s post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had read the post but had not commented...although when I read it no one had dared to say something.  I can understand why you felt the need to pull it down just to remove the negative energy surrounding it...the post wasn&#039;t anything that was of particular interest to me therefore I had nothing to say.  For those who felt the need to completely bash the post I really didn&#039;t think that was necessary.]]></description>
