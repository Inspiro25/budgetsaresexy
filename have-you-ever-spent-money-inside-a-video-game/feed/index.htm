Don&#039;t interview Ninja! He&#039;s a bit of a jerk and seems to hold pretend moral high ground about being a pro gamer. Dominique McLean (SonicFox) is a better option imo. He plays fighters and is generally more down to earth and easier to speak to. And he&#039;s earned ~$650k in his career! We&#039;re all misfits though, so please be patient with us! ;)

Side hustle series? Here&#039;s some stats for Dom:)

I do like those city building games.... Never played one but always amazed at what people can create :) Will you send me a snapshot of your city when you end up getting it? Can you do that easily w/ games these days?]]></description>

Wait so you can FLIP stuff and make profits in the game???! That changes it a bit!! Can you literally cash out too, or do you just get more V bucks or whatever to then spend? Because if you&#039;re taking back straight cash money I might need to delete this whole post, lol...

(And too funny about digital stuff vs physical stuff - you&#039;re not wrong there! :) Though it usually still takes up *brain bandwidth* though probably less since you only see the stuff when you&#039;re logged in vs in everyday life.. Thanks for chiming in!)]]></description>

I would agree with that :)

Didn&#039;t even take in account the sense of *community* with it all - whether with strangers or friends like you guys are doing. I forgot it was a many multi-player thing vs the old days of just one or two players! So for that alone I need to backtrack some of my initial jaw dropping, haha... I never question money being put towards connecting with others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely use money in games! Also, we do at times allow kids to spend money in them, when sufficiently good value. For instance, in Minecraft you might get extensions or special worlds. On Fortnite, we haven’t yet allowed purchases.

I personally loathe free-to-play category games, as they often cripple the gaming experience for non-paying customers. The best ones don’t, Fortnite and Minecraft as good examples. Especially phone apps mainly suck with advertisements and game mechanism that benefits paying customers. 

I still pay for games from time to time, next one probably Cities: Skylines (older game so now quite affordable). Also in software, you get what you pay for and this extends beyond games. People are too used to things being ”free”. Also software devs need to eat ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have played Clash of Clans for over 7 years, well before learning about FIRE. In the early days of playing Clash I spent some decent money playing.

However, looking back I don’t regret it, it was entertainment and as far as entertainment goes gaming can still be cost efficient.

It’s all about balance of course and some people do get addicted. However, the reality is gaming isn’t any more or less silly then buying craft beer, playing golf, or other non-necessities. 

In fact, IMO watching people game is magnitudes more interesting then watching golf.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Video Game economics are something I&#039;ve taken interest in over the past few years. I currently play 3-4 nights a week after the kids and wife go to bed and while I enjoy actually playing the game I also enjoy the trading economy that has flourished in game (not Fortnite but another Epic Games owned property called Rocket League).

All items are cosmetics only and do not affect your actual gameplay but there are actual items I&#039;ve seen people pay up to $5,000 for ultra rare items in the game (not a lot in comparison to some cosmetics like in Counter Strike: Go -CS:GO). However, most items range from $1-10 but  there are many cosmetics that go up to hundreds. I for one have put $10 into the game the first week I could and now have actually cashed out on some of my &quot;returns.&quot; I have a $700+ inventory I&#039;ve built, have cashed out a few hundred dollars, and am having a lot of fun scratching my obsessive &quot;collector&quot; itch on things that don&#039;t take up physical space but that I can actually make a few bucks at.

We&#039;re in strange times, indeed. lol]]></description>
