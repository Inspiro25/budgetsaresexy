					<description><![CDATA[Thank you all so much for your wonderful comments and encouragement! 

Kaye: I think it totally sounds like you&#039;re going about it the right way! I try to keep our costs below our profits, even if it&#039;s just barely, some months. I would definitely recommend buying whatever you can in bulk- packaging, etc.- to cut down on costs. Your stuff in your shop looks delicious! 

Katia: You should definitely give it a shot! The great thing about Etsy is that there is no start-up cost, the fees are minimal ($.20/item to list, plus a small percentage if you sell something) and you can really put as little or as much time into it that you want! Go for it! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How wonderful to see this article. I was considering starting up on Etsy selling bags/clutches/etc because I would love to earn a little bit extra while also doing a hobby I love. You&#039;ve done an amazing job, and your story is pretty inspirational. 

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too have an etsy shop (shamless plug here) and while I&#039;m just getting started, I am really looking forward to really getting profits. Right now I am starting with minimal start up costs, so the business cards are currently waiting until I get 3 more sales.I&#039;m trying to do this as debt-free as possible and I&#039;ve only invested $70 into it so far and made $58 after fees. So just a few more sales and I&#039;ll be able to pay off that $70 investment and start buying more supplies (like those cards). 

I&#039;m taking it slowly, but hopefully it will work out and be a legitimate side hustle. =) 

Thanks for featuring etsy as a real way to make money on the side and congrats to Helen for making it work for her and her husband!]]></description>
