					<description><![CDATA[I am late to the party....   A friend and her family gift each other things that are really needed as they don&#039;t want clutter. Their kids who are still growing, are given clothes while her husband takes my friend to a shop and points out what he wants.  Interestingly, her husband doesn&#039;t ask what my friend wants  - he just buys her lingerie every year. She doesn&#039;t complain because she never buys her own so hubby takes care of that and he also has better taste.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Christmas gift giving has really changed over the years
First... Siblings and parents
Second.... Spouse and parents and siblings
Third......all of the above, plus our kids and nieces and nephews 
Fourth...... drop siblings, only gift exchanges with nieces and nephews for the number of kids
you have... as in, you have three kids, you only have to buy three gifts, if no kids, you don&#039;t have to buy.....once they reach 16, they were off the list. And still parents and Spouse of course
Fifth.....drop nieces and nephews.... this was all agreed to with other parents.....only now there are grandkids, so everyone else was happy for us to buy for only them....Spouse picks out their own gifts, because we have all we need......so Christmas is super easy.  Parents of grandkids give us a very short list....order on-line....delivered to our porch.....everyone is happy :)

So much less stress....and everyone is happier to enjoy getting together instead.]]></description>

Uncle of The Year right there!!!!

I&#039;m 99% sure you CAN set one up for yourself and then direct where you want the money to go, so I&#039;d just double check it online and then go for it since you KNOW it would get done in that case. And you can always open up more accounts under your main one too for future nieces and nephews that may come along! 

(Some places will let you print out a &quot;gift certificate&quot; type thing too to hand to people, as well as direct links for parents who want to solicit funds from others.... They do their best to make it as simple as possible, but it&#039;s just one of those things that seems complicated on the outside and thus people just move right on to the next gift idea :()]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, so have a new niece and thinking about trying to convince them to setup a 529. Or should I set one up myself for them? Or just send stocks?

You suggest wanting this, do you have suggestions on actually implementing this?  

One brother I had offered for years to contribute if he opened one, now his kids are about to head to college and never got around to opening one.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know, when I mentioned it she looked as if I&#039;d suggested we stop being brother and sister, and that was that. To me the cool part is about spending time together, and now having time off (since I no longer have a job in which I need to work holidays like Christmas). But I guess the spending part is inevitable. Sigh. 

Also my dad this year. He puts on his list an out of print CD and an out of print book. I take back my father&#039;s day guest post! (ok, I&#039;m kidding lol) 

The nice thing is I have a lot of time off this year, since we&#039;re not publishing for two weeks. Roadtrip here I come! (Maybe with niece in tow, which will be interesting.)]]></description>

I always found it hard to pick the right &quot;something to wear&quot; for my kids so we changed it. They now get &quot;Something to eat&quot;. Your very own favorite snack that nobody else can touch? Priceless!]]></description>

YES!! An even better time for money/college savings for sure :) All the parents&#039; money at that point is going right out the door in raising them so they&#039;re not thinking about future kids savings! :)]]></description>
