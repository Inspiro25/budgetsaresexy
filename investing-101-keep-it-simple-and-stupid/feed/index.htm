					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ornella @ Moneylicious&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! My ROTH account is pretty much my &quot;do and try whatever I want&quot; place where I test stuff out and get a bit riskier than normal :)  It&#039;s refreshing to have an account that you don&#039;t have to be super strict with!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@MakintheBacon$  Congrats on taking the first step--educating yourself. It must have been an amazing feeling that you were able to make investment decisions on your own.

					<description><![CDATA[When I first started investing, I just nodded yes to the recommendations  my financial advisor(s) made, because I was so clueless. I know I still have quite a bit to learn but now that I&#039;ve started to read up on it more, I actually understand what they are talking about. I even made suggestions as which mutual funds I should purchase. When one of them agreed that the fund I suggested was what he was thinking of and that was a good choice, I was so proud of myself! It can be overwhelming with all the jargon and what the media says, but I feel one of the key things is to constantly educate yourself about the market.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I keep it simple by rolling over any surplus money into my roth vanguard index funds, I also have 401K funds that I have been putting more money into Index funds in that account as well. Its pretty easy to scan the title of a fund and notice that it says Index and immediatley you will know that the fees will be a lot less than other non index funds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@AverageJoe. Thank you. Why can&#039;t they talk about the rebound that happened the last 10 years!  &quot;The complexity&quot; you are describing leads to so many detrimental investing decision making. I&#039;ve met people who rebounded from the recession within 3 years! Warren Buffet is right, be greedy when others a fearful...

@Em  if you are just getting started, low cost index funds are a great way to start. As you learn more and read the research behind them, you will find that the majority of active mutual funds don&#039;t beat them over the long haul.  You may want to check out The Little Book To Common Sense Investing and then of course there&#039;s my book--just had to throw that in there..lol.  Good luck and keep it simple.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just getting into investing.  Actually, finished a book yesterday that helped me learn all the common types of investing, how to determine where to allocate your money, etc.  Next step for me is determining where to actually put the money.  Its an overwhelming process for me but it&#039;ll get started soon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great points. I think it&#039;s important for people to realize that stations like CNBC make money on ads. Most of the complexity these shows present only make it worse for the average person who watches. So much of it is irrelevant to a healthy financial life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@SavvyFinancialLatina  hey, missy...nice to see you over here:-)  Glad you LOVE the post! Start that Roth IRA, it&#039;s a solid way to diversify your accounts. Actually, without realizing it, you are spreading your taxes around for the future--accounts that will be taxed at your ordinary income and an account where you will not be taxed at retirement.  Very cool!]]></description>
