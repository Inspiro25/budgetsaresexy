Yup! The same with trying them all out on nights/weekends too while you *are* still working. Doesn&#039;t effect your finances if you fail, but if you win it can supercharge things and/or even give you a fresh new career!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I especially love the failure tip!

It&#039;s something I still struggle with -- I&#039;m terrified of taking risks. It&#039;s partially why I&#039;m so interested in early retirement, as it could enable a lot of big, consequence-free fails. Etsy store not enough to pay for living expenses? Doesn&#039;t matter! Book never sells? You can still eat!]]></description>

Amen to that! I love the challenges and courses other bloggers come out with. We need as much help and motivation as we can get in this country :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cracking up over Idea #3 &quot;Do I want to clean this thing?&quot; I feel like this could solve a lot of overspending problems! I almost bought a juicer, convinced that it would be put to good use. Well, there&#039;s no way I have the time to clean that thing. Haha. I&#039;m glad I saved my money on that one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One game changer for me was the 31 days of financial independence guide of Trent Hamm from TheSimpleDollar.com.

I calculated my true hourly wage (also taking commuting costs/time, training costs/time, etc. into account). After that, I&#039;ve written down and calculated how many hours I need to work for those things in my life that are personally not important to me. This really helped me a lot. 

If you want to buy an item that is not totally worth it, but you have to work 20 hours or more to get it; you think about it twice. You also see how much this could help on the big goals of your life; for me, this is early retirement or financial freedom.]]></description>

The only item I refuse to give up in the kitchen is our apple slicer thingie with those same wires like you&#039;re talking about with the eggs. Makes the process of chopping up apples sooo easy! :)]]></description>
