					<description><![CDATA[Love the take on happiness here, friend. I personally think we adapt to our circumstances, good or bad, and end up reverting back to a certain level of happiness if we stay in one state long enough.

That&#039;s why it&#039;s good for us to have challenges: to engage in things that involve our improvement or, better yet, involve a march towards mastery. 

The change itself creates a change in our mental state, and hopefully one for the better.

If not: not a huge deal. Give it some time, and we&#039;ll revert to the mean.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I often say that it&#039;s my goal to never need an office job again (where I have to actually GO to an office that&#039;s not in my home 40+ hours a week) but I know that&#039;s just because it makes me happy right now and for the foreseeable future. I also said I wouldn&#039;t live through a home reno again, or sacrifice years of my life to do home flip level reno like Mr 1500 did, but let&#039;s be honest, I&#039;m willing to do whatever it takes to make myself and my family happy. If changing the terms of my life is what it takes, you know I&#039;m there!]]></description>

I retired last year and now volunteer at a Sea Turtle Rehab Center. One of my duties is scooping up turtle poop (it&#039;s wet and falls apart easily in the water). Working with the sea turtles brings me joy and it&#039;s something I can do with my wife, so we&#039;re both happy. Scooping up the poop may not be the most glamorous part of my duties, but when we get to release a healthy sea turtle back in the ocean I&#039;m truly happy and glad I was able to help. It&#039;s your attitude that makes all of the difference.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Number One - that gif.  Amazeballs.  Number Two - I was SO that girl who paid off debt and told everyone and their mama &quot;I will NEVER get a credit card&quot; again.  And just last night started researching cards to apply to so I can a) keep my credit score up now that we are debt-free, and b) score some free flights  with my points.  When Mr. 1500 shared how his family flew for $200 because of their credit card, I realized maybe I was missing something in my &quot;Screw credit cards&quot; mentality.  Such a well-timed post.  (Both of them!)]]></description>
