					<description><![CDATA[As a kid I lived in hand me downs from a sister two sizes smaller then me. I longed for my own clothes. The trade off is that I learned not to care about clothes at all (so I only buy comfortable).

My other goals- travel, paid for house, stable family, seeing all the Van Gogh I could---all done before 50. I have to say---I love my life!]]></description>

HAH!!!

We used to be neighbors!! :)

I take it you saw this post from earlier?

https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-to-get-health-wealth-and-comfort-peerless-rockville/

For me the &quot;set&quot; # was $45k, and when it came it actually did affect my life pretty good - but prob only because I was still single and didn&#039;t have a million kids yet ;)

Thx for finally stopping by and saying hello! Very nice to e-meet you.]]></description>
