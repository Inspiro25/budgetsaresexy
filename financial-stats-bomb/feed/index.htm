The transponder doesn&#039;t upload to the cloud. Dexcom Share, the app that lets other people look at your Dexcom data, requires a smartphone. So if a caretaker wants to see real time data and get push notifications, the patient has to have a smartphone with Internet access.

					<description><![CDATA[My husband&#039;s divorce cost $100,000. His ex got 1/2 his 401k &#038; 1/2 the equity in the house plus big lawyer bills. It took years to recover. To young people: one of the most important decisions you can ever make is finding the right partner. Divorce can be extremely costly. PS we skipped a wedding/engagement ring. I&#039;m not a jewelry person &#038; a private ceremony in our living room was just fine (and cheap) since we&#039;ve both been married previously.]]></description>

100% there&#039;s a need for it! And we&#039;re starting to see a lot of *apps* come out to tackle just that as so many usually are focused on *individual* use.

Here are three on the scene that seem promising after poking around and personally talking with them:

https://www.honeyfi.com/
https://onist.com/
https://www.zetahelp.com/

There&#039;s also blogs and podcasts that focus on couples too!

https://couplemoney.com/
http://couplemoneypodcast.com/

https://www.hisandhermoney.com/
https://www.hisandhermoney.com/podcasts/

So stuff does already exist, but certainly not enough to connect ALL couples yet...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m happy to see 55% (and growing!) of couples are combining their money. Combining money after marriage is one piece of advice I will always give to newly weds, if asked.  It forces communication about finances, which can often be an area of disagreement or misunderstanding.  I&#039;m indifferent on each person having one separate account for discretionary spending. If you choose to have side accounts, I&#039;d recommend (and as J$ says above) making sure all of your &quot;combined&quot; financial goals are being met first.  I&#039;m pretty passionate about this, I wonder if there&#039;s a need/desire for financial literacy training for couples...who&#039;s with me?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For sure!  I still spend money on the things I love but fortunately, I have simple interests.  I love barbecuing (lunches for the week :), good craft beers (cheaper than good wine) and sports (road trip for a hockey/football game is cheaper than a trip to Europe).  I travel internationally for work so I&#039;ve been able to visit Bali, Cape Town, Rio, Santiago (Chile), Fiji, Tokyo and other small wonderful places for really cheap since my divorce.]]></description>

That is so beautiful!!!! And would take that in a heart beat if we had any old family heirlooms passed down! Which we didn&#039;t, but maybe we need to start the tradition ourselves with this ring! Would make me feel much better about spending the $7k on it, haha...]]></description>
