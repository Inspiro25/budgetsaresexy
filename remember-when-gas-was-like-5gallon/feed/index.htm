					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Rebekah&lt;/b&gt; - Isn&#039;t that great? And scary at the same time? The fact that you can live on soooo much less but it takes losing a job to find out?  Good for you guys for realizing it though, that&#039;s wonderful :)  Some people might never!
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do w/out gas.  Buy an electric car? :)  Ride my bike and/or quit my job! haha... it is pretty freaky, you&#039;re right.  And I can&#039;t believe you got rid of all your stock investments! wow, that takes balls.  glad you know what you&#039;re doing though :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bryan&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a helluva perk!  Awesome, man.
@&lt;b&gt;Suzanne&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that&#039;s not twisted - it&#039;s smart!  I barely spend a dime on some categories, and then I go out and invest $500 in Kiva on a whim! haha... or on 80 new domain names or something.  You actually have it RIGHT.  Scrimp on the stuff you don&#039;t care about, and splurge on the stuff you do!  Ya gotta use money for something, might as well be toward things that you actually appreciate ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am definately showing my age but, gas was .99 a gallon when I started driving! Lucky for me I have a short commute (I work virtually most of the time) so gas isn&#039;t a major expense for me today. In my twisted mind saving on things I can like groceries, dining out, and everyday items leaves more money for things I covet (like the iphone I paid $200 for), totally worth it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Juicy blog post :)  Because of last week&#039;s nice stock run up, I felt like I could finally get rid of my last mutual fund.  As of last Friday I&#039;m truly all cash.  Hallelujah!

Money is in banks.  If those fail then I&#039;m guessing China couldn&#039;t collect on the debt the U.S. owes and nuked us.

I think we have about a 5 year emergency fund if both of us were laid off or fired.  We are striving for the 30 year emergency fund btw.

$600 dress?  Probably not, but should live life more.  It&#039;s a tough balancing act to play and to save for our 30 year emergency fund :)

I don&#039;t trust Facebook. I only got on it to claim my name.  As much as I love the internet, I feel it&#039;s becoming too invasive these days.  I like my privacy.

I actually miss the high gas prices, less traffic and obnoxious SUV&#039;s.  However, it sickened me because I never realized how dependent we are on gas.  Just think if all the gas in the world just disappeared!  What would you do?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I still remember filling up for 89 cents a gallon the summer I started driving. Of course, I also remember those $50 fill-ups (small car!) when gas prices were so high. Right now, we&#039;re living as close to car-free as we ever have--going through a tank less than once a month in our shared car, thanks to living in a great walking neighborhood and commuting by public transportation--and loving it! I hope I never have to go back to filling up once a week.

My hubby and I dealt with the unemployment thing at the beginning of this year, when I got laid off (he&#039;s a full-time student, only doing occasional freelance work). It was scary, but we discovered we could live on much, MUCH less money than we normally do. A good lesson to learn!]]></description>

@&lt;b&gt;Rachel211&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, well GREAT job on cutting down house costs by 50%! That is incredible.  I would love nothing more than to do that myself - and finally starting up a plan for it!
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMan @FinancialOdyssey&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch.
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, same here.  I remember one day it hit $0.34 due to price wars back and forth w/ these 2 stations down the street from me, it was insane!
@&lt;b&gt;Steve&lt;/b&gt; - Anything above 14 miles per gallon is great for me! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I hear ya brother.  Nothing wrong w/ affordable 4-doors though.
@&lt;b&gt;Becky&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhhh that is CRAZY!!!  I had read about China doing stuff like that but man, you have confirmed it.  Glad you found a work around ;)  And very true about expensive gas in other parts of the world, we have it pretty good - esp with everything else the U.S. offers (which people REALLY like to forget!)
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  You are the only one I know who has done that!  Willingly! Haha... that&#039;s impressive.  Great job on investing like that too.
@&lt;b&gt;WR&lt;/b&gt; - I LOVE Oldsmobiles!  Or I should say OLD Oldsmobiles - they are so pimp :)  And I like this &quot;how far you go&quot; mentality too, hadn&#039;t heard it viewed that way before. So thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post J.

I lived in Atlanta in 96&#039; and could fill up the 79 Oldsmobile (I have very fond memories of my &#039;Ghetto Sled&#039;) for .93 cents a gallon at the QuikTrip in Vinings.

Now I&#039;m gassing up 3 vehicles &#038; a Lawn tractor for 2-3 bucks a gallon but gas is actually cheaper now then it was then.

It&#039;s all a matter of perspective.

We aren&#039;t buying gas for gas&#039; sake, we are buying the utility that the gas gives us. Gas means distance. How far can I go on a gallon of gas?

My Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale got about 12 MPG (less when the A/C worked). A Gallon of gas had little utility.
My friends Toyota Prius goes 50 miles on a gallon of petrol.

It costs my friend a nickel to travel a mile today to his office at $2.60 per gallon, It cost me 7 cents back in 1996 when I paid 93 cents.


I&#039;m pretty flexible now. If gas went to $20.00 a gallon, I would &#039;drive&#039; my mountain bike and have taller grass. It would not hurt me one bit to burn a few more calories.

I think we are in a state of equilibrium right now. Gas companies cannot raise prices without hurting their bottom-line. Don&#039;t want to sound too pessimistic here but in a few years when 100 mpg cars are the norm, gas prices will rise considerably in order to preserve profits. 

It&#039;s not how much it costs, its how far you can go.

					<description><![CDATA[I sold my car last month and I couldn&#039;t be happier! No more gas, no more insurance (the reason I sold it), parking, and thecar washes and oil changes are gone too. 

To answer the questions though:

We have a tax free savings account up here, max we can put in each year is 5k so I try and max that out every year. I&#039;m getting 1.25% interest, not much, but it helps diversify my investments.

Being single, it wouldn&#039;t be as hard since there would only be one of me unemployed. I&#039;m still working on my ER fund. I&#039;d say I&#039;m about 75% there with an extra paycheck coming in October which will really help.

No $600 dress, but my weakness is clothes and electronics. Once I get a hard budget, I&#039;d be able to cut or there wouldn&#039;t be enough for me to get by the rest of the month.

I deleted my Facebook in August some time, haven&#039;t looked back yet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You &quot;keed&quot; about Facebook but it actually happened to me! I moved to China and in China Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and a ton of blogs are blocked by the Great Firewall of China so I did indeed lose facebook. 

To be honest, it wasn&#039;t so bad, and actually a bit of a relief! It was nice to disconnect a bit and of course I still had email and skype and such so I could keep in contact with my close friends and family. 

But after 6 months we got tired of the limited internet access in general and got a VPN so now I can connect again on Facebook. Because I didn&#039;t miss it as much as I thought I check it only once a day for a few minutes but it is nice to feel &quot;in the loop&quot; again. 

And don&#039;t forget gas fill-ups have always been that expensive in other countries. We like to cry about things in the US but people in other countries, such as Japan, have been paying $100 for a fill-up for YEARS! Of course the benefit is better public transportation which the US does not have now, but it is something to think about.]]></description>
