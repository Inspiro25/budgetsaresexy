					<description><![CDATA[This is incredible! I thought it was pretty amazing how quickly this dude made money without really doing anything. I was trying to think about how many times I would need the $5,000 I&#039;m investing to double before I would get to a million. That&#039;s a pretty great ROI in less then 10 years!

Honestly, this makes the story that much more entertaining. By the way, I&#039;ve discovered a way to make a million in a year and I&#039;ll write an article about it! The secret? Marry rich! lol.

Thanks for all of your great insights. It&#039;s always educational and entertaining to read your posts.]]></description>

By the way not a millionaire if you do a little research you he inherited his first house the second house is actually bought by his girlfriend and not currently his. also if you listen to what he has to say is you would realize that it wasn&#039;t true because his finances did not add up correctly. Shame on you for not doing it to due diligence]]></description>

Hah! I remember that game! (I did not buy though, I wasn&#039;t that hardcore ;))

You could be right - I haven&#039;t picked it up since. But I HAVE read The Richest Man in Babylon since and it&#039;s in my all-time top 4 fave finance books. Loved it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I have to say is thank goodness his old friend brought the truth to light. I must watch the show American Greed too much - because I could totally see how this could have turned into a fraud type situation in the future. If he could lie about this from the beginning and he was gaining some profit from referrals already, I believe it is possible for him to have seen a potential way he could gain more $$$ from gaining the trust from people who could have invested their money in him and his advice (to the point where he could have abused it). Maybe not -- maybe this was just one bad decision he made and he did fess up so good for him. But it shows a lot about his character if he could lie to that many people...

It makes me mad that I subscribed to his blog...I feel duped. I get inspired by real people - not phonies!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that advice needs to be evaluated for its own merits, regardless of who doles it out. 

Ever heard of the accountant whose own finances are in shambles? Of course, we all have. I even know one who had to declare bankruptcy. But that&#039;s where logic and emotion come into conflict. We don&#039;t always do what we know to be right or to be best. 

We&#039;re only human. What&#039;s important is to strive to be just a little bit better version of ourselves every day. And good advice, no matter the source, helps us do that.

As for lying? I think it often comes from embarrassment as opposed to from a place of malicious intent...unless you&#039;re a psychopath. ;)]]></description>
