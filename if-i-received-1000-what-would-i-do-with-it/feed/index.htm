					<description><![CDATA[Ugh, all this sounds so wonderful.. I can almost remember feeling kinda secure like this.  
Unfortunately I&#039;m here bc I found myself married to one of those abuser types.  In a short few years, I went from finally buying my 1st &#038; 2nd house b4 him (having any kind of property to rent out is so lucrative!), to now w/o a place to lay my head.  
I was clueless; giving up my career to be a SAHM, letting him handle all the finances (he was just too angry and I thought it would lessen the harm - despite me having an acctg biz), and allowing him to invade my brain were my downfall.  Trusting your partner is good, as things should be, but never, EVER take your hand fully out.  
So now, I&#039;m on the torturous CPTSD climb out of misery.  Sure I broke free, but am being punished for it at every turn.  He won&#039;t &#039;allow&#039; me my babes, and now that he forced me out of my second house,  I have little argument for bringing them &#039;home,&#039; when there is none.  It&#039;s debilitating knowing what they&#039;re going through, but is simultaneously my reason for trying again tomorrow.  
He demolished my credit, and the piddly few thousand I am to get every few months won&#039;t cover me ahead to buy my way into even renting anywhere for us.  I&#039;m blown away at rental prices - 2 or 3 times both mortgages. 
With an extra $1k, I&#039;d see if it could possibly go towards getting us in an apartment somewhere... so that maybe, just maybe we could pick up what&#039;s left of our pieces, I could start working again, and we could start all over.  
What I&#039;d REALLY like to do with an extra $1k?  Sign my 4 babes up for equestrian therapy.. so that they could begin to have hope again.. and maybe not repeat their mama&#039;s mistakes.  You just can&#039;t trust every soul that says you should.
I realize this isn&#039;t the forum you&#039;d like to see this sort of thing.  But I am as real as the next person, trying to find some way to make ends meet.. or I guess make something out of nothing.  If I want to get through this (and I do!), I have to work with what I got. 
I never - not in a million years - would&#039;ve believed these things do happen to actual &#039;innocent&#039; people.  I always figured there had to be two sides, and cringed at what I perceived to be &#039;sob stories.&#039;  What I know now doesn&#039;t feel worth the torture, but perhaps if someone else can take just something, anything from this...  
Financial abuse ALWAYS exists beneath any other kind.  Please, if you know anyone that you just get an inkling about - please - INTRUDE away.  They may have no one else, and you may just save their life.  
God bless you guys.  It IS good to see that others do succeed; maybe I can again too.]]></description>
