					<description><![CDATA[This story resonates so deeply. We weren&#039;t in a trailor, but we were on the wrong side of the tracks. Our high school was a joke, but I managed to get a scholarship to a fancy east coast school and started learning about money from the rich students I attended with. I diligently saved at least 10% from all earnings, but I was too afraid to invest. I just put it all in a savings account. Fast forward through my 20s and see me in a terrible relationship where I am financially supporting a woman who just stopped taking care of herself. It was hard. A year after that ended, I had restored some of my &quot;lost&quot; savings and transformed that into a small business that I&#039;m still growing. So glad I invest now and found someone with similar financial values.]]></description>

I love it, man :) And I think it helps a lot when the other person is *open* to change too over time. Both sides have to want it or what a mess it can become. Glad y&#039;all are a power couple now!]]></description>

haha! Ok... different &#039;stuff&#039;, but same emotional spending... and the worst is staying in a relationship that we know isn&#039;t serving us. Sigh... lessons learned. :)]]></description>
