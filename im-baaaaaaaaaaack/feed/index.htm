					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s pretty good for a budget. The ticket itself is what costs us the most money.

We&#039;re spending about $5000 for 6 weeks, but that&#039;s because we have a family apartment to use there in Paris.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice!
5K for about a week is nothing to be ashamed of.  We spent about 10K for a 12 day vacation about 7 years ago.  Granted, it was our last hurrah before kids and we stayed in 4/5 star hotels and hit 5 cities, but you only make trips like this so often and we had two incomes then.
We blew a lot on high end eating and bought stupid crap like paintings that we found out weren&#039;t real later (what sucker Americans!).  Anyway, it was right up there with Hawaii and I&#039;d do it again today if our family stepped up and offered to watch our 3 insane children for 2 weeks.]]></description>
