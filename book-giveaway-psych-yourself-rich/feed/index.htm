					<description><![CDATA[Well, I love Ramit Sethi&#039;s blog, which led me to buy his book! My favorite part about him is that he discusses a lot of psychology of finances and spending habits, which is fantastic. I am very interested in getting to the reason WHY I spend and have the bad habits I do as well as how I can help myself get out of debt and become wealthier. I also love YOUR blog, J. Money! Your blog was the first financial blog I had EVER read, and I found it by chance! It created an near obsession with financial blogging and it got me to be soooo excited about money! =]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first financial &quot;wake up&quot; was seeing Suze Orman on PBS about five years ago. But my favorite is Gail Vaz Oxlade and her show &quot;Til Debt Do Us Part&quot;. I LOVE that she doesn&#039;t take s*** from the couple asking for help. She tells them how it is, how their reality doesn&#039;t match what they &quot;think&quot; they owe or how they &quot;think&quot; they&#039;re doing. I need(ed) a kick in the butt like that. I&#039;ve gone to Gail&#039;s site and plugged my numbers into her &quot;online jar&quot; worksheet and was stunned by the numbers. I heart Gail!]]></description>
