					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s all a publicity stunt. He doesn&#039;t have to own a house. One of his many corporations can own houses all over the world, and rent them out to the CEO for $1 a month. He doesn&#039;t need to own a car either. He can use 7 company Teslas, one for every day of the week. He doesn&#039;t need a jet. He can use a company jet for free. See where this is going?

There&#039;s a fine line between genius and madman, and Elon Musk is constantly walking it.]]></description>

We passed items down to younger members of our families forever. Time to pass the torch! Having nothing of real value means we&#039;ll never have to buy insurance (medical costs are so cheap, many expats don&#039;t bother with medical insurance). PS this is a bit morbid but funerals average $700 in Panama OR $300 for cremation so we don&#039;t even need life insurance. Most expats rent furnished homes &#038; don&#039;t own cars either. Taxis average $1-$2 &#038; buses are also quite cheap. Many just walk to the store &#038; use a cart to haul groceries.]]></description>

True true..

And remember Musk is still keeping *some* stuff, just not *all* stuff... Though i&#039;m not sure only billionaires can pull this off as plenty of people in the minimalism/tiny home living space has def. done it on millions and billions less :) In fact, it&#039;s actually CHEAPER to not own and buy stuff all the time!  Though of course having $$$ as a cushion helps with making decisions faster without much consequences (financially-speaking). So maybe that&#039;s how he&#039;s able to make decisions like this easier than the common person?]]></description>
