So I just bit the bullet and did a 7 minute workout. Feels good! Bonus points because I found a banking keypad on my bedroom floor that I&#039;ve been looking for for a couple of weeks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use a similar method that I call my &quot;Rule of Twenty.&quot; I&#039;ll clean for 20 minutes, rake the lawn until I fill the wheelbarrow 20 times, organize 20 feet of the garage or do at least 20% of a project. The results are the same as you get with your 15 minutes. The hardest part of finishing anything is getting started. Once something is started the end is usually in sight.]]></description>

I like that :)

And sometimes once you make it &quot;official&quot; you&#039;ll actually accomplish it earlier too since it&#039;s then locked in your brain. 

This happened to me when I wanted to move to NYC after college. I kept telling people I wanted to go but wasn&#039;t taking any action to make it happen. So I set a date - Jan 15th - and as soon as I did that I started finding myself working on it little by little. I ended up moving there around December 20th I wanna say (it&#039;s been a while) and then smiled one of my biggest smiles when I was walking down the streets of Greenwich Village and realized it was THE Jan 15th. I had done it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice article.

JJ Luna in his book &quot;How to be Invisible&quot; had a line at the end of it that I never forgot that applies here. He said something to the effect: Whatever it is that you want to do...set a date and no matter what do it on that date.]]></description>
