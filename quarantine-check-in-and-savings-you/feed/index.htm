					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been a while since I posted here, but I&#039;ll give this one a go:

Financially, my fiancée and I are doing ok, comparatively speaking; I&#039;m marginally less comfortable than I would have been if this happened, say, a year or two ago, since we bought our first house about 10 months ago, and in the last 6 months have started to see some financial outlay for the wedding (which not coincidentally are the reasons I haven&#039;t posted in a while, watching these two things put a &quot;dent&quot; in my closeness to FIRE status briefly depressed me, lol), but ultimately I remind myself that I&#039;m blessed to be in the position I&#039;m in, thanks to my financial habits over the past 10 years, and my problems are small compared to many folk.(Too, I learnt my lesson from panicking during the market correction of 2011 (a year after I started investing), so psychologically I feel relatively well equipped).

I work in accounting, so I&#039;ve been deemed essential, which I&#039;m ok with, as our office isn&#039;t large, and we&#039;ve stopped face to face client meetings..and truthfully if my fiancée were both stuck at home 24/7 we probably wouldn&#039;t make it to the wedding, haha. :)

She currently isn&#039;t working, as she works for a craft brewery (they&#039;re still doing to-go crowlers and growlers a few hours each day, but they&#039;ve had to trim the staff to only ownership, which is 4 folk...though currently all signs point to them staying afloat well enough to bring back the full staff once this passes), but she got her first unemployment check yesterday, which truthfully is a big help, because though small, it means we don&#039;t currently have to drain the emergency fund to pay the bills.

We don&#039;t have any services such as daycare (since it keeps getting mentioned) that we&#039;re faced with the question of paying while they&#039;re closed down, but, thanks to my fiancée&#039;s job, we&#039;ve gained a new appreciation for local small businesses, so we&#039;re trying to do what we can to support those around us (which mostly involves drinking good beer and eating good food from mom and pop places, so it&#039;s not what I&#039;d call a hardship, lol).

I also think it&#039;s nice to see more folk out just taking walks, communicating (even if it&#039;s just texting more often), and making a point to try and support the folk around them.

“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J! It&#039;s great to hear an update from you and learn how you are surviving. I too have tremendous peace if/when it&#039;s my time. 

I can only imagine the waning sanity of parents around the globe! Yo-yo on drugs;) I compared the volatile market to that of the erratic behavior of a meth addict recently. The ripple effect of it all.

All is well here - working from home, getting out to run, walk &#038; bike in the park as much as possible. Unfortunately, the extra home time has inspired me to bake so I&#039;ve gotta work it off somehow. I do share with my neighbors though. 

Nice theme pic!]]></description>

LOL you will get a pic! ;) 

Yeah if yours is a small biz and you can, it&#039;d be good to support them. I won&#039;t share more details on our specific situation here because that would reveal private information about our lives I&#039;m not prepared to share publicly but if I weren&#039;t certain of my facts, I&#039;d be paying them.]]></description>

# of times I&#039;ve wished to have teenagers right now: 0, haha...

Though I guess it&#039;s just a swapping of issues whether they&#039;re 6 or 16 :) Except for the grocery store thing - my kids are obsessed with them too for some reason?! And dare I mention CVS or they&#039;ll get ecstatic! Lol...]]></description>

Sounds like you&#039;re adjusting pretty well! :)

Been seeing a lot of things in the media about how &quot;FIRE is dead&quot; now - and ironically coming from FIRE bloggers?! - but like you I only think it&#039;ll make it *stronger* since it really is planning for a life of financial freedom whether emergencies are going around us or not. Sure it&#039;s not optimal, but the people smart enough (and motivated enough!) to reach FIRE in the first place can surely adapt to anything thrown there way compared to the average person. So FIRE is still very alive and thriving in my books!]]></description>
