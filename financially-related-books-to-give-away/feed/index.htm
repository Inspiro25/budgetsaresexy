					<description><![CDATA[J,

First off I’d like to say thanks for all the work you do. Thanks to the money show podcast my life has turned 180 degrees. I went from overspending, underinvesting, and accumulating debt to being in a strong financial position. In less than 1 year since discovering the show and the FI community both my significant other and I have paid off all our debt (totaled $49,000), put away over 6 months in emergency savings each, and now comfortably save/invest over 53% of our income. I grew up in poverty so I hope you know that having others to learn fiscal responsibility from makes a world of difference to people like myself. My life will forever be improved thanks to the resources I’ve found such as bloggers/podcasters like yourself!

I’d like either Work Optional or Selections From Walden. I currently own Work Optional and loved the book. Actually rereading it for a 3rd time as I work out my path to FI. I would like to gift it to my brother though. I’ve realized that I can spark similar change in him as I’ve done in myself. The goal now is help my family rise up, not just myself. I’d give him my copy but it is full of highlights, page tabs, notes, etc. I try to pull all I can out of a good book!

As for Walden I’m mostly curious about the book as another book I read references it often (Atomic Habits). There is one quote I love from Walden even though I’ve never read the actual book. It’s goes something like this, “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I call life which is required to be exchanged for it”. That one line lead me to a huge epiphany. I can only imagine the rest of his work is equally powerful.

Thanks again for all you do!

-Bradley]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to win Walden&#039;s book, bc I&#039;m reading Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport and he mentions Walden quite a bit, going in depth about his move to the countryside and his new economics philosophy of how much does something cost in terms of his time spent, and that all of his basic needs could be covered by 1 day of work a week...hence, why work 5-6 days and to what end?]]></description>
