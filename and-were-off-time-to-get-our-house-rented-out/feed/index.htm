					<description><![CDATA[I thought you lived in Washington, D.C. I guess not:)

Have you looked at college towns? They may be smaller than you&#039;re looking for but they have good activities, a good overall vibe and tend to have stable property values with good options for rentals if you decide to go into that area of investing.

Best of luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Getting your house ready to rent is as big a project as getting it ready to sell. We are on a 2-4 year plan to rent our house out. My big goal is to live in a few foreign countries for a few years but rather than sell our house, I&#039;d like to rent it out furnished so that we could always come back if we don&#039;t like nomadic life. I imagine my to do list will resemble yours!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/and-were-off-time-to-get-our-house-rented-out/#comment-119900&quot;&gt;jestjack&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s not really all that sudden, we&#039;re just finally making a move on it :)

Here&#039;s what I commented to others above:

We’ve wanted to move *somewhere* (anywhere) for the past two years now, but never took any steps to make it happen. I’m going stir crazy working from home all the time, and my wife will now be working at home finishing up her dissertation, so we figured now was as good as a time as ever to get our place rented and move somewhere closer to a city where we can have more of a life again ;)

So it does seem kinda all of a sudden if you haven’t been a reader of the blog for a while, but really it feels (to us, anyways) that it’s “about time.” So we’ll get this place ready to be rented out and in the meantime find a new state to move to!]]></description>
