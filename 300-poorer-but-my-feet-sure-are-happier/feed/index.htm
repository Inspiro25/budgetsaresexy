					<description><![CDATA[Just have to share my latest shoe find - I wore these when I was a teenager, which was a few years ago ;)  These are not really like the originals, as they were saddle leather only back then, but I am just tickled that I can still wear them -

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAW9F0

They won&#039;t break the bank, but give a real &quot;vintage&quot; feeling :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Frye Boots are the most expensive shoes I own and I bought them on sale for $165, I think. But, I love them and still wear &#039;em years later. So, seems worth it to me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the info - but &quot;Sorry, California state law prohibits the sale of python.&quot;!  We will still enjoy checking out all the stuff at the site, though.  As well as the hair product :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Airwalks!  Forgot about those!!!  Used to always want a pair when I was young :)  Never got a chance...
@&lt;b&gt;Becca&lt;/b&gt; - Woah!  A millions dollars?? On feet?  I&#039;m afraid to ask :(
@&lt;b&gt;Ross @ Go Be Rich&lt;/b&gt; - Really??  That&#039;s what I like to hear!  I don&#039;t run much anyways, but I just do want to feel good walking around in general :)  Thanks man... looking forward to having better techniques.
@&lt;b&gt;Ornella&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah girl!  Huge fan of splurging when it&#039;s financially okay to do so :)  Looking forward to your book coming out.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh that&#039;s another type of shoe I really wanna try out soon.  Absolutely LOVE what Toms is about!!  Did you see him speak at SXSW?? Freakin&#039; incredible.  I had tears rolling down my face after 15 seconds... brilliant, brilliant, concept.
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, thanks man.  My dad actually tried to convince me to get the Merrells too but I told him I wanted to experience all that came w/ the toe shoes first ;)  Then I can allow myself to cheat and go w/ the more normal looking shoes, haha... rock n&#039; roll!
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Well I love your husband already :)
My boots: $169 (Almost $200 with tax and products to keep &#039;em purty and all that) -- Larry Mahan Mens Natural Python Snake with Black Exotic Western Boots
My spikey hair:  I use Salon Grafix - &quot;Unscented&quot; #8 (Though #9 works the best if you can stand the smell ;)  It practically freezes your hair as soon as you spray it!)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I thought the exact same thing actually until I started trying them on!  It&#039;s crazy to believe, but cowboy boots CAN be comfortable!  I tried on a lot which weren&#039;t, but the one I ended up with is totally comfy... and there&#039;s something about the big heel and making you taller that feels good too - more manly like.  I&#039;m pretty surprised I&#039;m sitting here typing this actually - I would have laughed in your face if you told me I&#039;d spend almost $200 on a pair!
@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  You read my mind :)(look at above response)  And those boots are HOT you just linked to!  Wowwwwww.... I don&#039;t know how much they cost, but it sure would be something fun to save up for!
@&lt;b&gt;kh&lt;/b&gt; - Huh... I guess you do kinda have a point there - never thought of it like that.  I guess it&#039;s just that we can usually find shoes much cheaper that seems comfortable anyways, so it doesn&#039;t make much sense to splurge and pick up something 4 or 5 or even 10 times more expensive if we don&#039;t have to.  And we all know there are certain $500-$700 shoes that&#039;s all for looks and brand - certainly not helpful in the foot-health category ;)  But yeah, I&#039;ll agree it&#039;s super important to keep your feet happy.
@&lt;b&gt;Quizshow&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well at least you&#039;re honest! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Those DO look like dancing boots! haha... oddly enough I didn&#039;t come across any like that while shopping at the store over the weekend... then again, they are kinda girly ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MariaN&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, I&#039;ll be sure to be careful!  Since I don&#039;t run much anyways, hopefully I won&#039;t get too hurt going on my daily walks :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.... time to customize them like Shaq! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - THANKS!!!  I won&#039;t ever get tired of hearing that! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A good pair of shoes will last half of forever. My father is still wearing his cowboy books he bought 20 years ago. (the store he bought them from went out of business 15 years ago).

As far as the barefoot shoes, they look interesting, but there is never going to be a pair that fits by flintstone feet. Between the fat big toe, the gap in-between the big toe and 2nd toe, the raised pinkie toe, and the flat side of my foot the shoes that fit best are the ones that just give the front half of my foot as much space as possible.]]></description>
