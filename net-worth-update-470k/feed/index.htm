Way to go!!! And agreed w/ the stock run/etc. If I didn&#039;t kill myself during the Real Estate bubble when my house value crashed and burned, I don&#039;t think I will when the stocks do the same later ;) I&#039;m in the same boat as you - Just keep plowing the money in and concentrate on the long run. Congrats on your net worth!!]]></description>

It&#039;s just recently that I  really understood this idea.  It amounts to seeing all of your investments as one big pile.  So there is no reason to own bonds in a taxable account,  but rather to hold the bonds just in the retirement accounts and do your allocation across the total of all of your investments.  Easy example: you have $100k in both a retirement account  and a taxable account.   You want to own 20% bonds, but corporate bonds because they have better returns.  You would allocate $40k in your retirement account to bonds, and do all stock funds in your taxable account.

BTW, you have been investing during a wonderful run.  Don&#039;t get discouraged when the inevitable drops occur.  We&#039;ve been doing this for 25 years, and we always try to invest more when everyone else in panicking. We are coming up on a net worth of $1.5M soon.]]></description>

No - I expected to have given up both on this blog, and chasing the million dollars, haha... but with every month and small win the motivation adds up and continues pushing everything forward! Great proof that tracking things works pretty well :)]]></description>

Welcome aboard, Mr. Zombie!

And good job starting to track it. All that really matters is that *you* know the number, regardless if you share it with the rest of us :) But to answer your question - yes, I believe the transparency has helped, both with the growth of this site, as well as my own accountability for that matter. When you know you&#039;re going to be posting up your #&#039;s to the world you tend to pay attention more - hah.

I do get some grief from some people here and there (mostly people in the real world who I accidentally told about this and now wish I hadn&#039;t), but outside of that it&#039;s been pretty good. Helps to keep things more anonymous if you can.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking real good! You haven&#039;t been putting any money away for months and are having great gains, I am socking away as much as possible (well almost as much as possible) and have two consecutive declines.

Great job! Always look forward to clicking through the different blogs watching peoples net worth go up!

					<description><![CDATA[WOW! Congrats on the $10K increase!  It&#039;s always a wonderful thing to have your money work for you :)  You&#039;re almost halfway towards your goal of a million dollar net worth, and that encourages me to keep going.  Did you expect to be at this point by your 7th year?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J, 

O_O  7 years worth! That&#039;s awesome. Inspiring stuff mate. 

Started tracking my NW this summer but haven&#039;t had the balls to post it online. Respect.  Do you find it helps having it so transparent online? No ever gives you any grief for doing so well?

You got yourself another subscriber :) 

Mr Z]]></description>

Haha... That would make for a good blog post, wouldn&#039;t it? :)

And yup - you&#039;re right, I&#039;m married and this net worth # includes both of our assets. Though, also our liabilities (ie mortgage). I wish it was more even between the two of us, but since my wife basically went into grad school right when we got married it&#039;s all been most of my own doing (and at times, like now, my undoing - hah! At least with cash flow problems...). I just keep telling myself it&#039;s temporary though and by this time next year we&#039;ll be well on our way to stellar incomes again - I can&#039;t wait :)

And I think it&#039;s totally fine to track your net worth separately if it makes you feel better! The number is really only for you anyways, it&#039;s not like it affects the rest of us ;) So you track it however makes the most sense to you. Or even track it along side WITH your husbands and see what the difference is? That could be fun? And maybe inspire him/you both to work on things together too?

Every person who posts up their net worth for us to see has a mixture of variables that go into it. What&#039;s important is just that you can tell if you&#039;re doing better over the months or worse so you can adjust. So you&#039;re fine either way :)]]></description>
