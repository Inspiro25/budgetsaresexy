					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been planning to do a big overhaul and evaluation, but kept putting it off. Maybe I&#039;ll finally get around to it a couple of months after we get into our first house. I know things are going to be crazy for a while, but they should settle down soon.

Great job getting $hit done, I&#039;m sure you feel loads better. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Money After Graduation&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, one account is pretty minimal!  Not sure I&#039;m ready for that yet, but I admire you for it :)  

A TFSA would be a great addition as well.
@&lt;b&gt;My Money Design&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! Exactly what we&#039;re going for here - glad you figured out how to do it smoothly too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Donnie Lawson&lt;/b&gt; - THAT&#039;S WHAT I DO!!! I use a money clip and it&#039;s one of the best things I&#039;ve started doing :) 7 years now and going strong, haha... you can fit a lot in them too, here&#039;s what&#039;s in mine: &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-in-your-wallet-purs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2011/07/whats-in-your-wallet-purs/&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;misterstress&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, whatever works!  If you&#039;re rockin&#039; it like that and things are going smoothly, keep running with it :)
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I did the same thing.  ING is great for a lot of things, but only if you put in the time to use it :)  I eventually had to close mine out cuz it was just lingering...
@&lt;b&gt;Call Me What You Want Even Cheap&lt;/b&gt; - Perfect!  Lots of fun changes your way, congrats :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, great idea.  That was at the top of our list too with all this condensing and streamlining - making sure the wife had access to 100% of it just in case.  And now tha she does it&#039;s another small weight lifted off my shoulders :)  I highly recommend it!
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey&lt;/b&gt; - YAY!!!! FUN!!!! OMG you&#039;re gonna feel a ton better when it&#039;s done too, I&#039;m excited for you :)  Nerds unite!
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well there always has to be *something* ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, I don&#039;t blame you! If I had equal experiences with them I&#039;d dip out too. No point in giving a company business that you&#039;re not confident in! Even IF it&#039;s USAA :) They&#039;re certainly not perfect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J.  I feel bad, but USAA is a dead account to me.  I haven&#039;t switch house insurance or anything else over, because I don&#039;t see the point after all the hassle.  I use it to pay one bill and transferred my 401k into an IRA account and that is it.  Maybe if I let it lie and concentrate on school I will forget their bad and start looking for the good.  It&#039;s really hard to do when they couldn&#039;t even get me my debit cards!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A couple years back, I set up a personal checking account to pay my debts. One of the companies isn&#039;t very consistent on what day they take out their pound of flesh and it was driving my wife crazy. That was pretty much the only big shakeup we&#039;ve had since combining finances when we first got married.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now! My fiancé and I are buying a condo together and I&#039;ve realized that trying to maintain 4 checking accounts and 2 savings accounts is a lot of work.. And a lot of transferring to follow. I manage all of the money together, and we&#039;re getting married. It&#039;s just a lot simpler to just manage our money together now that virtually all of our expenses are managed together as well. Once we close on our condo, I&#039;m going on an account closing spree and shutting down every account that is no longer used or doesn&#039;t provide some sort of financial or convenient benefit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice work! Sometimes it gets a bit too complicated and definitely doesn&#039;t need to be. And I&#039;m the KING of complicated budgeting! But I have found that streamlining can help put my wife and ease, and since she handles most of the spending, this actually helps us stick our budget better.

We&#039;ve been combined since we got married because it was easier that way, and it&#039;s worked great for us ever since. The one thing I need to work on now is getting her more involved in case I can&#039;t do it for some reason (like death).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re reminding me of what I am going to have to do in a few weeks. I am getting married next weekend and we were just talking about which accounts we&#039;re going to close to bring it all together. I have a line of credit that I haven&#039;t used since 2009. I am surprised it&#039;s still open. I&#039;ll be closing that account in a couple of weeks.]]></description>
