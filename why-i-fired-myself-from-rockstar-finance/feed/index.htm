Haha love it man! Gotta go with the flow of life sometimes, and sounds like you made the right call for yourself :) Really glad you stopped in to say hello as I&#039;ve been wondering where you were lately! I miss your raw posts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats J and thank you for all your hard work. You’ve helped a lot of people - including me. Bizarre, but at the same time you were making your big change I was too. I got an offer I couldn’t refuse to get paid blogging and coding. 

It was a tough decision because all of Joe Strummer’s lyrics were rolling through my brain like a ticker tape of shame. I was LITERALLY selling out!

But I justified it this way;

- now I can get paid to do what I love the most
- I can help people by steering them away from predatory lenders
- no contract so if it sucks I can bolt

Either way - it still hasn’t got weird enough for me.

Good luck with EVERYTHING!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holey Moley! Congrats J$! Man I&#039;m certainly a bit behind on the news - just discovered this from your latest net worth post! (Now I know where that little rocket in the last 2 months came from!)

So thrilled to hear you&#039;re focusing more on &#039;living&#039; given the major hustling you&#039;ve been doing over the years. That is why we all do what we do - to make this experience of &#039;living&#039; as good as we can.]]></description>
