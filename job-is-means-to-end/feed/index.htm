					<description><![CDATA[I am a marketeer with a big Indian bank. Now with increasing awareness about personal finance, I literally shudder when we talk about marketing nasty products like pay day loans (which thankfully are still rare and nascent in India) and essentially telling kids to live it up today. But as you rightly point in this post, sometimes you gotta wade through stuff just to earn money which can give wing to your dreams. That&#039;s what keeps us all going, right?]]></description>

No shame in that at all :)

I def. spend wayyyy too much time thinking about my &quot;job&quot; as a blogger when it wasn&#039;t at all the case back in my 9-5 days... On the flip side it&#039;s very rewarding to me and hopefully to those who read it as well, but there&#039;s def. a fine line there with the work/life balance. Especially as everyone gets more connected and connected to the internet and you know an extra hour or two could catapult you.

Good to know who you are and what motivates you though in either case - so well done figuring that out :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I fall into the second part of that quote, the ones who don&#039;t want to be passionate about their jobs. I see people who &quot;do what they love&quot; for a living and it seems to me that their lives end up revolving around work to the exclusion of almost all else. I want to leave my job at the end of the day and forget about it until i go back the next work day. I want what I do when I&#039;m not at work to be the focus of my life because those are the things that give my life meaning. Most importantly, I would never want to ruin something I love doing by turning it into something that I have to do every day, whether I feel like it or not. For me, a job is a means to an end. It feeds me and finances my lifestyle, and gives me the means to spend my free time doing the things that truly matter to me, chief among them spending quality time with people I love. I don&#039;t want it to be more than that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup, money is the only reason I work. I think this arrangement works for me because I thrive on extrinsic rewards (money) rather than intrinsic rewards (making the world a better place with your job). While it would be ideal to combine the two, that&#039;s just not realistic. I&#039;m perfectly content working just for the money, because it lets me do things that I actually love to do.]]></description>

Sounds like a good plan to me :) And much easier to carry out knowing *what you want* in the end too! I struggle whenever I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m actually trying to do with my life no matter how good it may look from the outside. Once that mission is locked in though you can barrel through the tough parts much faster knowing what&#039;s on the other end! So good for you for figuring it out and then working on a plan for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was talking about yoga to a coworker today &#038; she said &quot;Why don&#039;t you teach yoga full time? You light up when you talk about this stuff!&quot;  It&#039;s a lot of hustle to have sustainable income from just teaching yoga. A full-time with benefits corporate job for now, and getting to FI is my plan. Having the &#039;f you $&#039;, to negotiate less corporate hours, and more yoga teaching time is key. Spend some time proving myself in this role, so I can get recommendations if I go free lance, and one day set my own schedule. :)]]></description>
