Thanks for sharing these! All these micro-lending programs bring me back to the Kiva days when they first came on the scene - remember that? It was fun to see how far your dollars could be sent (and re-sent), all around the world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They have a similar program in Vancouver, Save on Meats is a historic butcher shop that became a trendy and renowned diner. They also happen to located very close a highly populated opioid crisis street and homeless area. I had a great meal here and discovered it for myself last year.

The program has been running since 2012

					<description><![CDATA[I love the breadcoin idea - thanks for sharing J$! That&#039;s a great idea and especially interesting to me as it seems like I&#039;ve noticed a definite uptick of people in need around my neighborhood.

A couple of my Austin-area favorite charities:
- Austin University UMC micro-lending program (https://www.uumc.org/microlending/) which I think is pretty cool!
- Allies Against Slavery organization works against human trafficking (https://alliesagainstslavery.org/our-story/).]]></description>
