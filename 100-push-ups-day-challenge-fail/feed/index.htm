					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;RJ&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah?  Well that&#039;s cool!  209 pushups is no joke!!  Way to go yo :)  I don&#039;t have an android phone, but I&#039;ll see if there&#039;s something similar for the iPhone.  Thanks for the info!
@&lt;b&gt;BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - I know, that&#039;s the downfall of taking on so many things - you end up stopping a lot of them and then feeling bad :(  I need to be more selective too, though the only problem there is then I&#039;ll *not* try things out that in the end I would have succeeded in!  So I guess it&#039;s just finding that happy medium.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J Money. Like the new challenge about the pushups. Check out this app on the phone (android) - Push Ups by Rittr Labs. It has totally worked in increasing the amount of pushups I can do. My goal is to do 125 continuous pushups. I did 209 pushups today (with breaks of course...haha), but it is training you to do them continiously through your training. And best part is it is free. Not normally one to plug a something/product, but this is worth a look.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;GB @ In Budgets We Trust&lt;/b&gt; - Damn right! Haha... did she accomplish 100 a day?? And whip my ass?? If you still talk to her, tell her I&#039;m proud of her and I bow down! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Okay okay, I&#039;ll agree - saving even $1 is good ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah L&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh I like that!  Maybe I will :)  Though I think I&#039;m already doing the &quot;30 day goals&quot; every month too, so maybe it can be merged with that?  We&#039;re only on month #1 right now (where I gave up lottery tickets), and I plan on dong a new mission come the 1st again.  We&#039;ll see!
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!
@&lt;b&gt;Andi&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, I&#039;ll check it out thanks :)  I&#039;ve def. heard of it before, but never spent the time poking around... will do so after I post these comments up.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Woo!  Then come over here and help ME paint :)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - I think you&#039;re right on that one ;)  We gotta remember how we operate so we can do our best to avoid all the nonsense we put ourselves through! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  All fixed up ;)  And yes - go for it!  I&#039;m up to 6 a day right now, so you can join me and do it together :)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahhahahaha.... omg dude, you crack me up!!  Haha... Love that.  You should totally hook her up with some financial knowledge in return for some non-financial payments ;)  And oh - I still have your guest post btw!  Haven&#039;t forgotten about it, I&#039;ll ping you soon as I should be able to post it up sooner than later now.  Glad things are well!  (And congrats on losing 15 lbs already - that&#039;s great!)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Oh no, really?  NEVER again?  That&#039;s crazy, but at least you&#039;re all in one piece :)  I like the $1,000 goal too - it&#039;s a great one to strive for.  Even if we don&#039;t do it on this site here, you totally should try starting May 1st! Even if you fail and get, say, $500 more, it&#039;s still a lot more than you had before! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Leigh&lt;/b&gt; - Wowww good for you!!  You&#039;ll get to $180k for sure, without a doubt doing that :)  That&#039;s incredible!
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - You totally should!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started maxing out my 401(k) last year and I&#039;m LOVING watching the balance go up each month. When $1500 goes into an account each month all year, the balance sure shoots up quickly! Having over $180,000 in your 401(k) still seems super far away for me, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be here before I know it!

I&#039;m really excited about buying a condo this year or next. It&#039;s fun looking at places and it&#039;s exciting to think about the fact that all of the money I&#039;ve spent the last few years saving up in cash will go towards something tangible and real pretty soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would totally do a $1000 in one month challenge or something similar if you came up with it.  I don&#039;t know how I would get it done, but I would make it happen.  I tried the 100 Sit-up challenge and totally blew that away, but then again I also killed myself doing it.  (Unrelated: Now I am never allowed to do another sit-up again, because of a surgery I had.)  No way I could do that many push-ups; maybe I could if you gave me A LOT of extra time. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a great lesson here about respecting your own limits—something I fail to do all the time (i.e. comment on 50 blogs a day, while writing posts for my own, and writing guest posts, and managing marketing, and keeping up with social media, and, and, and...) I definitely gave up (temporarily) after all of that.

My fitness goals, however, have been going much better (although, I definitely won&#039;t be doing 100 push ups a day any time soon). Down 15 lbs. in the past two months. I&#039;m now back down to my lowest weight in college. :)

But, in other news, how&#039;s it been? I got burned out and neglected my blogger duties, and I haven&#039;t been around to read much the past couple of months or so.

Matt

P.S. There&#039;s this chick who I think is into me, and I found out that she has a maxed out credit card and no financial skills to speak of, and the first thing I thought was &quot;budgets are sexy.&quot; Turns out, it&#039;s literally true. Maybe you should switch up your slogan. &quot;Can&#039;t get a boner if you&#039;re a serial loaner&quot;? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job with your 401(k). You might want to fix the header, it says 410(k).
Yeah, I know what you mean about the push up. I could only do about 30 in a row too. I should start with 5 and +1 everyday.]]></description>
