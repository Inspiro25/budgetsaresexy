Smart to get in the habit of contributing either way :) It&#039;s nice when you don&#039;t notice the money being gone anymore!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Adam’s comment aside (with which I fully agree), boo hoo. I participate in my employer’s 403b. Some years there’s a match, and some years there isn’t. But it doesn’t stop me investing because it’s so easy to just shoot those $$$ out of my paycheck before I even see them.   Great eye Adam; I love the idea and will still consider...after much thought.]]></description>

I did not, but I&#039;ve still got those paragraphs in a text editor on my desktop in case I change my mind! 

I&#039;m not interested in my address and likeness being blown across the interwebs by whomever they might sell their database to, so it all comes down to &quot;do you trust that we won&#039;t perform these actions to which we&#039;re laying legal claim?&quot; You&#039;re right, tricky questions.]]></description>

oh wow - yeah, that last part is hardcore!

you end up still submitting or change your mind?

i feel like at this point you either have to be off grid completely or come to the realization that our info is already out there - or will be at some point - whether we know it or not. But maybe that&#039;s just my way of coping with it all, haha..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oof... I was all set to enter (and had written up some fun stuff to contribute) when I went over the rules. I realize it&#039;s boilerplate, but man that&#039;s a lot to sign away, even for a shot at a thousand bucks:
