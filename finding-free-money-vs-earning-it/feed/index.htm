					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE, LOVE finding money on the ground!! But not change. I like to find the good, ol&#039;e green stuff. You&#039;re going to think I made this up but I swear that this is true. A few mornings ago, while ridding my bike to work (yes I ride a bike to work; I live a few blocks away and it saves gas money; and my husband takes our one and only car). I aw a man on his knees on the ground on the other side of the street. At first I thought he had fallen and couldn&#039;t get up. I noticed his white cane after getting closer. I asked him if he needed help and he didn&#039;t respond. Anyways it turns out he was actually blind and deaf (thank goodness I stopped). And a tree branch had knocked his hearing aid out of his ear and he was looking for it. We found his hearing aid, he gave me a nice thanks and I went on my way.  Later that day, in another part of town, lo and behold, I found a 10 dollar bill lying on the ground with no-one in sight! It was on a street next to an empty building. What comes around goes around :)]]></description>

Hahahhaah... Awesome! I was wondering if people still turned in bottles too as I had this genius/moronic idea that I could just go to all the houses around me and ask to pick up their recycling for them instead of the recycle people, haha... I have no idea what they do with it really, but I&#039;d imagine they&#039;re making money off it too and in BULK. Maybe that&#039;s how the whole system works though? It cost the city to pick them up, but they make up for the money by turning them in for cash?? I need to look into that more.. I&#039;m still pretty intrigued by it :)]]></description>

Earning money is definitely more *rewarding*, that&#039;s for sure. Especially if it came from a single idea in your head and played out nicely in the real world for you :) Finding it is just pure sexiness.

(And you&#039;ve got an open door anytime, my man! For friends I cut the rate in half so you&#039;ll only need to find half the real cash later ;))]]></description>
