					<description><![CDATA[LOL, &quot;as sexily as you can!&quot;  LOVE IT!!  You are da bomb!

Well I was paying just above my minimum payments to SLs until I got a decent EF that I was comfortable with.  Once that was done it was time to throw everything the SLs&#039; way.  So essentially I&#039;m attempting to quadrouple my montly payments and it will still take me til 2014.  Imagine that.  Effing perturbed.  LOL... but I&#039;ll get to the end sooner than soon.  Beats 2040 or whatever stupid plan they had me on.  While I have a sexy stash in my EF, it could still be sexier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Laura in ATL&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That is too funny - I would have never thought of that ;)  Fortunately (unfortunately?) one of our cats is way too old to run anymore anyways, haha... the other one?  Well, she&#039;ll just have to deal with it.  And I&#039;ll be ready w/ my camera on hand ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jerret&lt;/b&gt; - Man, I&#039;m sooooo tempted!!  All I hear is GREAT things about that thing -- when is someone gonna hate on Tempurpedics?? Like, about how expensive they are or something? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, roger that!  The badge is on my list to make - as soon as I&#039;m back from all this traveling :)  I guess I kinda reward myself w/ that, even though it&#039;s technnically &quot;work&quot; eh?  I could do me some crown molding action too though, good one!  Always a pleasure seeing you here, my friend.  Come back again :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ms. S&lt;/b&gt; - YUP!  Gotta nix it all at some point, right? Might as well go all out and then pump up that E. Fund as sexily as you can! :)  Or maybe do a little of each?  (not as fun, I know, but always a possibility?)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Green&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh now we&#039;re talking!!! I can get jiggy w/ those facts!  Clicking away now, thanks! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with @SMB, and I have a tool for you to prove it- The Energy Star&#039;s &quot;Refrigerator Retirement Savings Calculator&quot;!  http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=refrig.calculator 

When we bought our new home, the only kitchen appliance that was working was a circa 1980s fridge, when we used the calculator we realized it was using $1/day to operate.  Our payback on a new fridge will be less than 3 years, not to mention the environmental savings...  and it&#039;s pretty sweet lookin&#039;...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know exactly what you mean.  When I think of how PHAT my emergency fund could be if I&#039;d put all this money I&#039;ve been using to pay these stinking student loans there instead, it makes me a little, no a lot angry.  But ah well.  I want them to get as little interest from me as possible, so to SLs it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Go with the hardwood and enjoy good looks and great laughs--I&#039;m w/ Laura on this one; my 2 kittens go wild across my floors then can&#039;t stop (unless they bounce off the wall, which is pretty standard).  It can be quite entertaining.

So this is my 2nd post where I&#039;m on the same wavelength as you--I&#039;ve also been paying down my mortgage as fast as possible, but now I&#039;m beginning to think of some home improvements I want to do.  I have an empty wall in my kitchen that is just screaming for some sexy, matching cabinets and a nice granite workspace to be added to it (plus a wine fridge, yes!). I&#039;ve also been lusting after crown molding. 

As someone here suggested, I&#039;m &quot;rewarding&quot; myself with these projects each time I hit a milestone in my mortgage payoff frenzy.  I just hit $7,500 extra paid off today, so I&#039;m tackling some of the molding projects.  

Whatever you decide to do, good luck!   And get that badge up, eh?  Haha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FYI about hardwood floors and cats . . . 

Your kitties will slippy-slide all over the place!  Poor little knuckleheads, there is nothing for them to &#039;hold onto&#039; so when they run and stop, so they just slide and crash into stuff.  Make sure you have some area rugs around for them! 

(And for you of course, but we all know that the cats are really the most important thing.)

:-)

~who has kitties that slippy-slide every day when they play chase each other through the living room and hallways. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Everything Finance&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  I can DEF see how hard it would be to do one large chunk at the end of the year! I&#039;m gonna stick to my monthly ones - that&#039;s too hardcore ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Morgan Polotan&lt;/b&gt; - I just mean that I&#039;ve been much more of a saver in general than I have paying off things (like my mortgage).  I carried some credit card debt here and there, but the % was only ever 5 or 6% or less - and only for like a few months.  If I had high interest or large debts other than mortgage, I&#039;d most DEF be paying those off first for sure.  If I had the choice of having a LOT of savings and a LOT of debt, the old me would have chose that over being $0.00 across boards, if that makes any sense?  Basically I like having lots of money in the bank - makes me feel better, even w/ debt ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff @mymultiplestreams&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a good way to do it. Esp w/ the projects - best of both worlds?  The one thing I need to work on (possibly?) is going all-in one way or the other :)  I rarely do things down the middle, haha... but the decade&#039;s still young!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think when we get to that point it will be done like ashley up there. little bit each month then at end of year a big chunk of left over cash. There are so many little projects around this house. (I really want my bathroom back) when the other debts are paid off I think it will be half to the mortgage and half to the projects.]]></description>
