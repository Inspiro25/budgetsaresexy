						<p><em>INSIDE: One of my readers wrote in about &#8220;child support taking all my money.&#8221; Please comment with your suggestions below&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>So yeah, don&#8217;t even know where to start on this one :)</strong> Don&#8217;t have any kids of my own yet, and haven&#8217;t a clue about child support and how exactly all that stuff works out. All I know is it makes me sad.  Mainly for the kids, but also for their wallets. 60% is a LOT of money!  Man&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping some of you can chime in and share some of your thoughts? Maybe you&#8217;re experiencing something similar and/or have advice on how to improve their situation? I know our reader would REALLY really appreciate it, and I think it&#8217;ll help the others out there going through the same thing that may be too afraid to ask. Here&#8217;s the situation:</p>
<h2>Child Support Taking All My Money</h2>
<blockquote><p>My husband and I have been happily for married for 3 years. I&#8217;m his second wife and he&#8217;s got two children from a previous marriage. She lives 9 hours away so we get the children on long breaks, summers, etc.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t plan to have any kids of my own&#8230; reason #1 being we can&#8217;t afford them!</p>
<p><strong>The custodial parent, ex-wife, gets 60% of his net income for two children.</strong> Two whole pay checks plus part of another go straight to her! Every time there&#8217;s a change in circumstance, (oldest takes piano lessons, youngest enrolls in ballet), we go back to court, pay more legal fees and ultimately, the CS order is increased. He knows the children are his financial responsibility too&#8230; but good God! He&#8217;s gotta eat! I don&#8217;t know how he&#8217;d survive financially if he wasn&#8217;t married.</p>
<p>He and his ex-wife both bring home about $3000 per month. Only, we&#8217;re only able to see about $1000+/- of his money after witholdings and CS. He could get a second job&#8230; but ultimately, he&#8217;d just pay out more and they payoff to us wouldn&#8217;t be worth the time away from home?</p>
<p><strong>I knew when I married him I&#8217;d be taking a financial hit, and I have.</strong> I still manage to <a href="../compare-retirement-savings-age/index.htm">save for retirement</a>, not incur debt and keep a little cash tucked away but we definitely don&#8217;t live the lifestyle we would otherwise be able to afford. My poor husband can&#8217;t afford to put anything away for retirement. We don&#8217;t have excessive debts, just a car payment and two <a href="../pay-off-student-loans-or-save-for-house/index.htm">student loans</a>. We don&#8217;t have any <a href="../its-all-about-credit-cards-baby-4-steps/index.htm">credit cards</a>. We don&#8217;t own our home. We don&#8217;t shop excessively. We don&#8217;t eat out. You can imagine the resentment I feel for working my butt off to pay for someone else&#8217;s kids. But, what we do for love, right?</p>
<p>My husband and I both have good jobs with good benefits. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s lot of families out there in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your advice on coping with ever increasing child support payments?</strong> Do you put off saving and then &#8220;double up&#8221; the saving once the kids are grown? I&#8217;m able to put some of my check away into our retirement&#8230; but what about my husband? Does he have to put his <a href="../financial-planning-dont-be-a-tool/index.htm">financial planning</a> on hold for the next 13 years? Do you think it&#8217;s &#8220;unethical&#8221; to make a minimal cash income on the side and not report it? **I think I do**</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatcha got for her, friends? Have you experienced child support taking all of your money? Let&#8217;s try and get them on a good <a href="../50-year-financial-game-plan-by-age/index.htm">game plan</a> :) I&#8217;m drawing a blank&#8230; except for that last one, I don&#8217;t mess around w/ that non reporting stuff. Too afraid of getting in trouble!</p>
<p>I did find this <a href="https://www.lawhelp.org/dc/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-child-suppor">child support FAQ</a>. Maybe it will help people in this predicament.</p>

																<p>No, they will not see that as one income.  That is what W2&#8217;s and tax returns are for.<br>
The new wife&#8217;s income will not be included.  Ex-wife can&#8217;t touch it.<br>
The only rare instance is when the new spouse is independently wealthy and the non-custodial parent is living a lavish life.<br>

																<p>It&#8217;s hard my had kids with his ex wife&#8230;.( We have two little girls together) his ex has custody and my is not behind in child support. My was ordered to pay $700 a mth. In child support. His son was living with us and the mother was getting child support, good stamps,etc.my husband had been fighting in court for two years now. They have taken our tax refund totaling $29,000 so far and I&#8217;m not even sure what&#8217;s going on now since it&#8217;s still being disputed in court. After six years now the mother is taking back her child she never fought for until they ordered child support payments to cease because she&#8217;s been lying! I don&#8217;t know if we will ever get that money back but supposedly the attorney general office has a levy on our tax returns and we&#8217;re trying to see about credit owed to us or how they are going to figure out this whole mess! It&#8217;s crazy&#8230;.. Can anyone help me understand what&#8217;s going to happen or has anyone been through something similar?</p>

																<p>If the bank account is under your name and your tax id you can use what ever money is within that account. As well as if it is a joint account a joint account gives both people access usually one is a primary person. If you can get a account balance ,If you can get information on the account from a teller then you can withdraw money. Federal law insures that tellers and or banks  can only give people this type of information if the account is there&#8217;s primary or joint.The only time this would be illegal is if you yourself are not on the account and try to use the funds then in that case its called theft. (I should know I work at a bank and deal with things like this on a daily basis.) I wish you luck and god bless you and that child.</p>

																<p>Get a joint account. The children are grown therefore support has stopped. He is paying arrears which is money already owed cause he didn&#8217;t pay. You can also file a joint tax return and get money back. You need to complete an IRS form for injured spouse relief. The IRS will then calculate what part of the return is yours, which part is his, and send you your share.</p>

																<p>My husband has 3 kids from a previous relationship. A year after the 3rd was born he found out it wasn&#8217;t his. Moving forward&#8230;&#8230;we are married with 1 child of our own now. We have his 3 kids every Tuesday until Wednesday morning (he picks them up from school on Tuesdays and they stay the night and he brings them to school Wednesday morning) we also have them every weekend until Monday morning which again he drops them off to school. He is paying 30% child support plus all their health insurance needs. Me and my husband fight on a daily basis because he&#8217;s paying all this money to their mother that A owns her own business B drives a brand new Mercedes and we can&#8217;t afford to put food in our fridge. Am I wrong for being upset? Please some input would help ease my mind. Oh BTW this is not court ordered. If he doesn&#8217;t pay she holds the kids for ransom.</p>

																<p>My husband has two kids with different moms. One doesn&#8217;t work and her husband works three jobs to afford her spoiled brat lifestyle. The other has a masters degree as a teacher making $60,000-70,000 a year and works a waitress job on the weekends making more money. The second mother is so greedy she&#8217;s taking him back for more child support. We can barely afford essential items and live paycheck to paycheck. We both make $14 and hour. He pays their benefits and pays both moms $600-700 a month in child support. He only makes $145 a week. Who can live off of that by themselves?! The second mom has a brand new infinity and lives in a nice house. We can barely afford our mortgage on a mobile home which is fairly new (2014 model). The second mom also lied on her financial affidavit when she originally filed for child support saying she only worked as a waitress when she was in fact making $20 an hour as a teacher. My husband is a bit lazy because he is afraid of the courts from spending $13,000 on his first kid to end up getting screwed. So now I&#8217;m trying to figure out how I can stick it to those money hungry brats by trying to find out if I can claim one of the children and still file injured spouse on our joint return. That way they can&#8217;t screw him even more with their back child support that was just ridiculous. So don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re crazy. I read an article of this greedy chick asking online of she is able to receive her ex husbands wife&#8217;s tax return to intercept it for her back child support she needs apparently. That made me so fired up because I couldn&#8217;t even believe a woman would ask for someone else&#8217;s money who&#8217;s not biologically related to their child. What kind of greedy monster would even dare ask a question like that???!!! Anyways, don&#8217;t feel bad cause I know exactly what you are going through.</p>

																<p>Perhaps you should have considered child support before marrying someone who was paying child support to two different women. THAT should have been a red flag to you and if HE had any intelligence at all he would get away from YOU before you end up knocked up because it seems YOU are money hungry and simple minded. His first obligation is to his children. Period. I hope you aren&#8217;t able to claim &#8220;injured spouse&#8221; or better yet, maybe you will owe the IRS. All of you who are complaining about child support should have either found spouses who didn&#8217;t already have a family and the ones who complain about paying and being broke should have worked your crap out and not broken up your child&#8217;s home. To those wanting to claim your step child as dependents on tax returns, you had better be sure you have a court order stating you have permission, as well as file the appropriate forms signed by the custodial parent because that is federal law. The real shame here is that these poor kids have to spend any amount of time with a step parent who resents their existence and begrudges them financial support. Shame on you. To those complaining about paying too much &#8211; get off your rear and file a modification petition. If you are indeed paying too much, the court will adjust the amount, but be careful. My ex husband&#8217;s wife insisted he file a modification to have support reduced and it actually INCREASED an extra $105 per week. My kids are thanking her for that from the shoe store because they can finally get more than one pair of shoes per year!!!  Step parents better back up because those kids and ex&#8217;s were in his life long before you and they will still be there long after you are gone. If you truly love him, stop making his life hell by complaining all the time and accept the fact that he is a package deal and no matter what financial percentages the court imposes, morally, his kids are 50% HIS responsibility. He made them and shouldn&#8217;t expect to enjoy the life he had before because his kids certainly are not. They LOST a parent in all of this. Now think about that.</p>

																<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. I fully understand your point of view but it doesn&#8217;t take in to account that things happen. Have ever done anything in your younger years that still haunt you in the current day. Child support is not for the child&#8217;s benefit. It is a way for the state/ government to receive monies from those support orders. The state gets a percentage of each and every penny they collect for custodial parents. There are so many other ways to enforce parents to do the right thing. Offer classes, mandatory time with non-custodial parents, etc. that&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t happen because it&#8217;s all about the money. The unfortunate matter is the custodial parent has the chance to better their life, gain additional income, qualify for mortgage loans and a host of other advantages. No one can live on 40% of ones net income in today&#8217;s economy. There are many situation but most people in the system are young kids early in adulthood who had unprotected sex. They don&#8217;t get the chance to mature figure things out and support themselves well enough to cultivate a home and life suitable to be a great parent. The child support system limits them by the amounts they deem fit. Check the stats on the success rates after child support. Most are mothers that have raised their financial/ class of living and have a substantial retirement savings. The losers are middle aged fathers from 40-50 years of age with little to nothing and starting from scratch to save a have a better life.<br>
In closing if it was really about caring for ones children; then mothers who chose to give their children up for adoption would have to pay child support as well.</p>

																<p>Not true. If a mother gives her child up for adoption, she shouldn&#8217;t have to pay child support because she knew she couldn&#8217;t support it and gave it a chance at a better life. And for all those young kids that didn&#8217;t get the chance to mature and figure things out yet&#8211;they shouldn&#8217;t have been having sex if they couldn&#8217;t figure things out yet. Don&#8217;t have unprotected sex most of all. They start younger and younger and then cry about the results. It&#8217;s called consequences for the choices you make. You have to pay for them so you won&#8217;t keep doing it again. Also for all the ones complaining about no money because of three previous kids and two with you, it wouldn&#8217;t matter if he stayed with the first wife, he wouldn&#8217;t have any money then either. When you support five kids, you are going to be broke any way you look at it.</p>

																<p>If he is morally responsible for 50 percent. Then can I assume your morally given him 50 percent of the time?  If not truly this is not any sensible moral.it would balance that he pays more and gets less. Am I wrong ? Or are the children a burden to you? In that sense your getting paid back for your moral duties ..so that&#8217;s not moral either..should be less time less money. Cause you get the time and he gets the shaft</p>

																<p>I can say so many perhaps at this point darling here&#8217;s a few. Perhaps my husbands exwife can get up and actually find a REAL job- she&#8217;s a home tarot card reader lmao. Perhaps my husbands exwife can stop receiving food stamps and any government assistance. Perhaps my husbands exwife can stop buying expensive designer glasses for all three kids every couple of months and bill my husband for half. Perhaps my husbands exwife can stop buying my step kids junk food with her food stamps because all 3 are obese. Perhaps she can stop poisoning my step kids minds with nonsense. Or maybe perhaps she can finally stop causing drama in our life and stalking us everywhere we go. Before you start pointing fingers look at your own and make sure they are clean- which I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;ve got some dirt on them too.</p>

																<p>True I have 3 girls I don&#8217;t work cause I take care my kids I don&#8217;t know anybody I don&#8217;t have friend to help me out with<br>
My girls recently my husband leave me for a side chick and now he  do pay all the bills  but he don&#8217;t send money home for his kids.  We married  this side chick tell him no to give me money anymore and he did look las be real fathers complain about paying child support but. We the ones who take them to the doctor appointments go to school meetings.some woman&#8217;s have to work and take care the kids take off from work to get a sick child from school stay all night if your kids sick knowing nex day they have to work so. Talking about child support and new car. I thinking woman deserves those things. My husband walk out us and will man happy and go out on a date we in the house taking care our kids we don&#8217;t have no freedom. Personally I didn put my husband on child support cause I wanted to or to being greedy because my girls don&#8217;t have to suffer wild he is taking care some else kids.  I can even buy simple things. Now some people gonna said then work y&#8217;all don&#8217;t know my situation he knows and he don&#8217;t care. So for those who complain thinking twice is good mothers out there  if he would do his job I don&#8217;t have to  put him on child support</p>

																<p>Wow&#8230;.You must not know how hard it is. Most stepmoms don&#8217;t want them to not pay and love those kids just as much as if they were hers. Its about the fact that they can&#8217;t pay there bills buy food for the kids when they have them. its super hard. In some states it don&#8217;t matter how little or much you make they take the court ordered amount even if you go to a less paying job and going to court cost something most step parents don&#8217;t have.</p>

																<p>I think it&#8217;s insane how many people are bashing this woman. Plenty of &#8220;mature people&#8221; have children and still wind up divorced. Have you seen the rate in the United States? There are plenty of women and men who make mistakes because we are human and that is what we do. My fiance was with his girlfriend for 7 years and high school sweethearts with two beautiful little girls. She cheated on him multiple times he had no idea then took the children away with this new guy 3 hours away and my honey had no idea where his kids were. Oh by the way she admits this and in court and apologized to him but doesn&#8217;t matter. The court said she never should have taken then but she still did anyway. Thousands of dollars later trying to show the court she is LITERALLY an alcoholic and has put the children in danger multiple times by having been passed out drunk or not even being home, she has custody, lives with MY ex who makes 100k (and admits to saying to my fiance &#8220;if I stay with you I struggle if I go and he with him I get to go on vacations at the drop of a hat&#8221;) and she lives off of him (has bragged that she doesn&#8217;t pay for anything she keeps her money from the only job she&#8217;s ever had anywhere, Victoria&#8217;s Secret, for manicures and purses etc) while my fiance pays and is even looking to adopt my daughter I have with my abusive ex (went to court) who this girl is with and my ex has dropped off the face of the earth and doesn&#8217;t care about my little girl. That is fine because if he couldn&#8217;t hold his temper with an adult what is he going to do with a child? Who only knows another man as daddy who never hurt anyone?<br>
My fiance works for the post office. he has insurance covered. He is only scheduled to work 4 days a week but works 6 to pay the child support for this woman who I know does not go to the kids. She is barely with her children as we have her word and proof that she goes out drinking all the time. Yes. we are fighting in court as the children come here with snarled hair and crying that my ex is hitting them and their mommy is locking them in their room and going in the other room and being &#8220;loud&#8221; with my ex. But here&#8217;s the deal people. Some people are not good. some people try to make it work and get screwed over. We barely make it. and I&#8217;m not saying we barely make a lavish lifestyle I mean we don&#8217;t eat out we only buy diapers for my daughter and feed her and some days we barely eat anything. It isn&#8217;t your place to judge if you haven&#8217;t lived the hell of dealing with someone who really just is malicious and out to get you. And I&#8217;m pregnant too, and out of jealousy this woman has come to my house and lingered just to harass me. Working 6 days a week or a part time job just puts you in a higher tax bracket so guess what grossing 2400$ the government takes 600$ his ex get 450$ and we only bring home 1100 after other deductions ins. etc. I understand there are some people who are complaining and don&#8217;t care. I get there are mom&#8217;s who take care of their children take them to doctors appointments and sports but this woman is not that woman it&#8217;s my ex&#8217;s sister or her friend and if that money was going to shoes that fit or hairbrushes or clothing that made sense like jeans in winter shorts in summer not vice versa or actual coats in negative weather maybe I would understand. Because these are children who rely on parents to take care of them and be their voice when they have none. But there are some people who genuinely are not good, and are selfish, not just for money, and being able to see my exhausted love of my life is not something I think I have to &#8220;suck up&#8221; because he wasn&#8217;t &#8220;mature&#8221; or should have triple checked before being with this girl and devoting himself to her. Before you open your mouth to judge other people step in their shoes. there are people struggling to make a living and children struggling too because they aren&#8217;t seeing a dime of money. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to attack someone because oh well you made a baby with her deal with the consequences. Obviously having children is a very real thing that should be taken seriously. I feel for all of you who are in a similar situation as us. I just want to be able to make a payment for a roof over our heads and for the girls when the come over. Not Gucci purses and cruises. (yes. cruises.)</p>

																<p>I logged in today because I&#8217;m going through the same thing. I hate to complain, because I see now that my situation could be worse. My husband has 3 kids with a witch who makes twice as much as we do. She has free lawyers through her job at Proctor and Gamble, so she takes us to court whenever the wind blows. We had to get a lawyer to avoid losing our shirt. My husband pays $600 on time every month. He&#8217;s up to date on all his payments. So she took us back to court for $200 more a month.We just found out she might get it and doesn&#8217;t need it. I know he needs to pay child support he had those kids. I just don&#8217;t think she should take it all. Now I&#8217;m going to suffer. But it could be worse, at least he wasn&#8217;t dumb enough to have several kids with various people.</p>

																<p>Wow&#8230;$600/mo. to support 3 children&#8230;.what a travesty of justice!  that mother must really live it up on that $600 after she pays the kids&#8217; expenses..  Heck, I bet she could feed those 3 kids on $50/month.  I mean, how much could those kids eat, &amp; why do they need clothes anyway.  And she heats her house for herself anyway, doesn&#8217;t she,,,so why does she need child support?  They&#8217;re her kids, aren&#8217;t they?  why should the spermbank have to support them?  Yeah, I can see there is great injustice in collection of child support.  I mean, 49% of child support is paid in this country, &amp; 25% of that receives at least some of the support owed.  Really, doesn&#8217;t that prove that child support is just used to exploit the father?</p>

																<p>My fiancé pays $3000/mo including a 19yo and they recently divorced so no back support. However, the custody and support agreement states some bs about keeping all three on support until the youngest 10 is 18. P.S.: he also pays all medical expenses and her post grad student loans. And the kids have 10,14, 19. Have zero concept of monetary value and will request a trip to the mall and restaurant seafood every other weekend.

																<p>RoseNikki.. You are so judgemental about things you have no experience with enduring. Absolutely full of would have should have could have bs. From the start, you are saying, people should have not gotten with people who already had families.. if thats not the dumbest thing Ive ever heard. For instance, the statistics state that in most cases, the woman is the one who files for divorce. So, by your logic, if your wife leaves you for another man, (very common) or whatever the situation, then he should be fighting to keep the wench to keep his family together, LOL. She hated him enough to screw another man, then why would he risk stalking charges pursuing some worthless garbage failed attempt at making a woman into a good wife, when she isnt one.  But, by your logic, he should live a lonely solitary life regardless. The truth is, they can garnish 65% of income, which leaves people facing becoming homeless unless they have help with their living situation. This is an abomination of the law. You cant take so much of someones money that they cant afford their own reasonable rent, and also take their drivers license, and call it anything other than modern day slave labor. All you have to do in America now to become a slave is get CHild support involved in your life. Wake up lady, articles like this can wake people up and help bring much needed change to a severely messed up system.</p>

																<p>The child support system is what it is; however, when a man tells a girl (who prior to becoming pregnant &#8211; on birth control so the story was) that he does not want to have the child and offers to pay for the abortion and health care to obtain one, he should not be required to pay child support for that child in my opinion.   SHE made the decision entirely on her own to have the child.  I view it much like a woman who goes to a sperm bank and has a donor.  That donor does NOT pay child support.   I don&#8217;t see why it is different.   The man was a sperm donor for a lying woman who wanted a child.   The whole system is broken.   Unmarried women with children get mostly free college, benefits, day care, etc. and the man is stuck for 18 years.   Totally unfair.</p>

																<p>You send like the typical bitter ex that&#8217;s upset he&#8217;s moved on. Stop trying to milk the man &amp; take care of the children EQUALLY! Sometimes relationships/marriages don&#8217;t work out. That&#8217;s life!!! MOVE ON! You can&#8217;t stand to see your ex happy &amp; you use child support as leverage &amp; your children as a pawn. Think of caring for your children. Life&#8217;s too short to stay miserable. And I&#8217;m an ex wife that has never received a dime of child support but my child&#8217;s well being is more important than getting back at my ex. Move on lady&#8230;.MOVE ON!</p>

																<p>Obviously this is why the system is changing, as it must. This commenter can&#8217;t grasp the fact that she is actually divorced, and therefore uses a child as an object to attempt to exert control over two sovereign human beings, and obviously can&#8217;t keep emotion in check enough to respond rationally to a reasonable discussion. Perhaps she should be mentally evaluated and have all children removed from her home until she is proven to not be as abusive to them as she had proven herself to be toward her ex and his non-rejectable wife.</p>

																<p>ATTN: RoseNikki</p>
<p>Your &#8220;argument&#8221; is flawed in so many ways. You sound like the sort of lady who sits on her ass at home all day; waiting for her husband to pay childsupport. So she doesn&#8217;t have to do anything, but take &#8220;care&#8221; of the kid. And if that&#8217;s not the case.. you probably do work and use that child support on YOURSELF. </p>
<p>Wake up and smell the roses sunshine; this is the year 2018! Women are able to take care of themselves; and neither party should be paying child support. How low one must be.. to require another individual to be paying YOUR way through life. Grow a pair!</p>

																<p>We are all imperfect but all human. And we all only have one mother and father.<br>
I got married and two children. My husband left to become a trucker.<br>
My son has to be home schooled.<br>
I am his Green card sponsor.<br>
He has lied for 3 years.<br>
He went 10 months without seeing our children.<br>
I just gave birth to second baby when he left.<br>
I have a degree<br>
Yet, I hav eno baby sitter.<br>
I  live with family but my folks are seniors.<br>
My husband uses false adress of melteling friend who help him cheat and avoid paying child support.<br>
no separation is ok.<br>
A fmaily gotten broken. How many years?<br>
My husband never had stop having relationship . and I learned of infidelity<br>
and trick every time.<br>
No two world is the same.<br>
Please try to speak with more sensitivity<br>
because like my case there are EXTREME cases<br>
and even going to court is stressful.<br>
Remember that man you are blessed to be .<br>
also, fail his kids and his wife.<br>
That wife was promised a family.<br>
There you are having a life.<br>
Some women dont have any personal life because you might have not been the homewrecker.<br>
But still youshould have the outmost compassion<br>
you got someone else&#8217;s family missing link<br>
that is grieving the lost  of a loved one<br>
that can be a great pain and nobody has the right ..Please make a mental note and consider this<br>
You ..have no right to tell that previous wife that has his children to STOP missing, loving, or having mixed feelings.<br>
you should know as a woman they both will always have feeling.<br>
and maybe,,, You should accept<br>
the fact they were there first and children are his family forever.<br>
I pray for the lack of sensitivity.<br>
You are in the middle of children&#8217;s development.<br>
You dont know needs of any household.<br>
Maybe, you can invest more in getting to know his ex wife.<br>
I once dated a man who was divorce and had children.<br>
The ex wife had someone else.<br>
Nobody he was dating before welcomed his kids.<br>
I never dated someone like that<br>
but i said I have to welcome every part of his life with grace.<br>
I focused on giving respect to their history and present.<br>
When people have children they are not history in your partner&#8217;s life . Actually, if their is any humanity they need to both coparent and be present in their chidlren&#8217;s life.<br>
I found myself coping with even ongoign conversations that they were planning visits.<br>
Lets be adults. Don&#8217;t behave ..in such a way you are marginalizing and minimizing someone&#8217;s reality , place.<br>
I been emailed by an ex lover who told me I should STOP taking my ex to court.<br>
He barely pays the bills.<br>
You knew he had an exwife and children.Acknowleged. Try to help.<br>
I used to help out that boyfriend with his visits and expenses.<br>
And his ex wife conveyed and hug me<br>
Because her ex was sad<br>
he wa sdating me at the time<br>
but he was sad because he wa sbroken hearted.<br>
dont think your now spouse is telling you the TRUTH.<br>
this was your choice and hopefully he doesn&#8217;t abandon you.<br>
Help your partner with his short comings.<br>
When I did date a man who was divorced I regarder him enough to invest.<br>
May it be ,that you are the one who does nto want to give.?<br>
You accepted this man with his HX .<br>
so with all the respect.<br>
You knew his past and his present<br>
I hope I didnt offend<br>
But generealizing  ex wife or single mother is cruel<br>
Many times we have to bring our rxes to court because they are even seeing or talking to their children.<br>
and Most of the time is because they are distracted by other partners who whether now marrie dor not knew that they had children and then want to help alienate the children from their father.<br>
that is CRUEL for the children.<br>
Please try to be sensitive  and fair</p>

																<p>Except&#8230;65% is only withheld from deadbeats who owe back child support.  And it is then 65 % garnishment after all state &amp; federal taxes are withheld. And, unfortunately for mothers who support their children completely by themselves, who don&#8217;t have the luxury of saying that they won&#8217;t be feeding, clothing, and housing their child and bringing her to visitations with the deadbeat father because they needed the money for a rock concert, or for date nights with a new partner, precious few of these dead beats are handcuffed.  Or if they are, it is not for non-payment of child support.</p>

																<p>First of all, your use of the word &#8220;deadbeat&#8221; mirrors my family court judge&#8217;s attitude. Her Honor (sarcasm intended) does not differentiate between &#8220;deadbroke&#8221; and &#8220;deadbeat&#8221; parents. As far as Her Honor is concerned, any parent who does not pay child support for any reason is a &#8220;deadbeat&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s do the math here.</p>
<p>Assume you now make $1000 a week after a long period of involuntary unemployment (such as the so-called &#8220;Great Recession&#8221;) and the court refused to change your child support obligation because &#8220;you&#8217;ll get another job that pays the same soon&#8221;.</p>
<p>After taxes, your take-home pay will be about 750 a week. Now deduct 50% of your gross income from that $750 figure to pay a combination of current child support, a child support arrears, and more interest on the child support arrears than allowed by Federal law [42 US Code 654(21)(a)]. You are now down to about $250 a week take-home pay, which is just over minimum wage.</p>
<p>How are you supposed to support yourself and be more than a visitor in your life when &#8220;our friends in government&#8221; treat you as an indentured servant who should consider themselves to be damned lucky to be allowed to visit with their children at the custodial parents whim?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also going to ask you the same question that I asked Her Honor when she threatened to lock me up because I did not have the money to pay the retroactive &#8220;child support&#8221; that I was ordered to pay to my unfaithful ex-wife in a lump sum &#8211; how is a parent supposed to be able to work in order to earn the money to support themselves and their children while they are in debtor&#8217;s prison?</p>

																<p>You&#8217;re wrong! NY state is anti-father!! they don&#8217;t care if you have a house note, student loans, bills none of it matters! CS takes 25% of my bf net income plus another 15% for daycare! he can barely afford his bills to keep a roof over his head for when he has his children. He cannot do anything fun with his kids bc the ex takes all his money and buys them ipods and xboxes and trips. We both have good jobs and can barley make it bc the state doesn&#8217;t take into account&#8230;LIFE! plus the real killer is they divorced 3 years ago when he was still in school, yet the court finds it fun to give the kids a lifestyle that they never had off their fathers back. the ex makes really good money too almost equal yet he has to pay! NY STATE does nothing but downgrades a fathers earning power therefore interfering with his relationships with his children. this is also with joint custody and until sept 2018 he had the children 3-4 a week! it&#8217;s gross. oh yeah and NYS wants him to pay 51% of her health prem. even though he was carring the kids on his but the court switched it bc she requested it! So it;s closer to 48-50% net income goes to a women who doesn&#8217;t provide for the children, but gets her hair done and goes on shopping trips to NYC, yet drops the children off in small clothes and not showered for days! awesome. thanks NYS&#8230;we&#8217;re going for custody.</p>

																<p>I agree, if a man wants to complain about child support then be with the mother so that raising the child is cheaper. That old saying is true, it is cheaper to keep her! Especially if the mother wants to work things out. It burns me up when a new woman comes along and gets angry at child support when they wrecked the family by not getting out of the way so that the father can work it out with the mother. I spent 6 years with my sons father and he cheated on me and got the new woman pregnant so I left and filed support on him. He got ordered 1400$ for our son and it is more than half his income. So now that new woman wants to complain about how he can’t afford to take care of her baby. I’m like well that’s karma! She shouldn’t have slept with a man who already had a family!</p>

																<p>“ being broke should have worked your crap out and not broken up your child’s home” </p>
<p>Wow someone got cheated on. I am very happy I am not as miserable as you sound. I happily paid for 2 of my husbands children and provided them food and shelter but it is not my obligation to provide for children when the mother uses them as a paycheck and them continued to have idk 9 more children she cannot provide for. I chose to be childless and I did chose to marry a good man with a lot of baggage and a crazy X. </p>
<p>Not everyone can plan their life out to be a cold heartless person but you seem like you’re doing a great job.</p>

																<p>I have to agree with Nikki.  You married into this problem. These other women are not trying to hurt you yet you believe it&#8217;s your task to beat them. You married a $14 per hour sperm bank who doesn&#8217;t have the sense to wear a condom.  Unfortunately the simplest way to lower his support is for you to have a baby. Then when he dumps you, you can get in the child support queue with the other baby mamas.</p>

																<p>Men. Are getting hit way to hard, women use children to hurt men. My son met a evil woman a couple times. She disappeared, over two years later she shows up with baby in arms. Saying it was his. &#8230;.. She was married, her husband was in Navy, he and his parents thought the baby was his, Navy paid all bill for baby, birth ect. Grandparents added a lot to make life wonderful for baby. One day evil woman decides to leave Navy man , letting him know baby is not his, he wants the baby and so do parents, but D&amp;A said it wasn&#8217;t his. Evil woman sits out to find my son . When she takes him to court, she claims, she went Hungary while pregnant   Had now means of support because she was to sick to work. Son works construction at the time making pretty good money. Court ordered him over $600 dollars a month child support ( wheather there was work or not)  and u can never believe this, order him to pay her $16,000 from time of conception&#8230; So she got money from Navy for FRUAD  and my son is $16,0000 in debt day one with $600 a month he owes.  We have paper to prove she drew money from Navy  for baby from conception, till after she left. Now the child is grown in late 20&#8217;s and my son, has to pay the evil woman almost $600 a month on the money the Navy already gave her. She gambles, travels, has a ball with money from my son and a dead husband!!!!   The child was never given any of the money, in fact he was placed in foster care for her husband beating him, my son was never notified , the evil woman just drew the money and gambled, and partied . The child also would not live at home for last year or more of HS , the evil woman would not give him any money to help him . My son just pays and pays. And of course she rarely works, but he can&#8217;t claim this  on his taxes, . He served in Airforce, woman&#8217;s husband was Navy, son Airforce. Great way for good  military men to be treated. This happened in Tn. We have tried to do something, but she can afford good lawyer. We can&#8217;t seem like the Navy would care she committed fraud against them, and last we heard of her Navy husband he had committed  suicide , men are now being mistreated for what use to be done to women, I was  divorced  mom who rarely got any money, and some women never got a dime, but that was other men, a generation ago now courts are making men pay, pay and pay,. Like the poor guy above paying 60percent of his salary, and one child not his. Please , please someone help make courts be fair. This is a horror story if u are forced to live it it.</p>

																<p>I have the same situation at this time. My fiancé&#8217;s child support increased double, there has to be something to prove this &#8220;system wrong&#8221; How can they only care about the previous family and let the new family be in debt. I do not believe that a child spends 1000 dollars a month. This is an injustice for fathers, that the only thing they do is work hard to pay child support, living and not even being able to afford food or provide a good life for their new family due to this high payments on child support</p>

																<p>You are not wrong for having those feelings. I am in the same situation.  Child Support is extemely unfair to the NON CUSTODIAL parent. I believe that the child support guidelines are outdated and need to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m currently going through the same situation. In California, new spouse income is not counted towards child support&#8230; it is used as a factor in determining support, but only because it affects the tax liability on the support parent.<br>
So if I make 50k a year and that puts me in a 20% tax bracket that would leave me with 40k a year in net income&#8230; but if my wife makes 50k a year and that bumps us up to a 30% tax bracket, my 50k salary, which would have been 40k in net income for me, now becomes 35k in net income for me, so it actually lowers my child support because my tax liability went up&#8230; and in ca child support is calculated off of net income. </p>
<p>Hope that helps and was understandable</p>
<p>Ps. I agree, the system is totally screwed. My ex works 7hrs a week at Starbucks and wants me to pay based off of multiple jobs and 80-100 hour weeks. The system is a total joke.</p>

																<p>I don&#8217;t believe there is a single state where they include the new spouse&#8217;s income. Now if you walk into court and tell them your name is not on the house, your name is not on any vehicles, you own nothing in the house, you have no money in the bank, etc, etc, etc they will know you are hiding your assets under your spouse&#8217;s name and will therefore assume you actually can pay child support because you are not paying any bills. In the case of the above case, father had a shitty lawyer, period. No one should have to pay 60% of their income for child support. More over, all these things, piano lessons, dance, sports, etc should be coming out of the child support mom is already getting not having child support renegotiated every time Ken and Barbie take up a new hobby. Seriously, either the new wife is lying or dad seriously had the worst lawyer he could find.</p>

																<p>My husband also has a daughter from a previous relationship. We are lucky that he doesn&#8217;t have to pay 60%, however I know many that do. Some, as you said, are unmarried and have had to move back in with their parents at 40+ years old because they could no longer afford to support themselves with what is left. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to agree with J. in not messing around with &#8220;under the table&#8221; earnings. If the custodial parent is taking you back to court as often as you say, you are going to be in big trouble if she catches wind of unreported income. You may owe back CS, taxes, fines, etc. That&#8217;s even riskier to your situation than where you are now. </p>
<p>This is part of the life that you chose. That sounds harsh, but it&#8217;s true. Having resentment towards the situation won&#8217;t solve any of your problems. Have you considered picking up a second job? Your income isn&#8217;t figured into the equation. I have a good feeling that isn&#8217;t what you want to do with your current feelings, but it may be necessary if you want a more financially stable life for yourself and your husband.</p>

																<p>Wrong. In most states, only the first full time job is counted, provided that you work full time at that job for at least 48 weeks per year. Overtime can&#8217;t be counted against you if it&#8217;s not a requirement of your job and not guaranteed as a regular thing. Also, if both parents bring home about $3000, there should be minimal child support. Child support is meant to bridge the gap between the parents incomes to make them about the same. Also, if custodial parent gets daycare assistance, food stamps, or cash aid that counts as income. Same for financial aid for college. I&#8217;ve done a lot of research on this subject. The new wife&#8217;s income does not count towards the fathers income.</p>

																<p>In NY ALL income is counted so if you acquire another job to make ends meet, she can ask for more.  I go back every year so she can slice me up some more.  My take home is $160 a week. Since my income is imputed, I am forced to pay support based on my potential income and not my actual income.  I live in squalor with no hope of every getting out all while she still lives in a beautiful house, drives a new car and takes really great vacations.  I drive a 20 year old vehicle to three jobs just to meet my obligation.  It isn&#8217;t just the $35% support but then I get monthly bills for her out of pocket expenditures which I can never know in advance in order to budget for.  It is a deeply flawed system.</p>

																<p>How come nobody has changed the law? Nobody has ever said &#8220;this is crazy, the law is not fair, there has to be a more humain and reasonable way to make this work&#8221;. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the law only sees money and does not put the kids first. Also, the law only favors the mom, why is that? I have seen mothers making double what the fathers makes, and still the father has to pay 60% of his income. How is that possible?</p>

																<p>I agree. It&#8217;s crap. I was ordered to pay support. I was unemployed at the time we went in for the hearing. Even though I was unemployed and not collecting unemployment, they still ordered me to pay a set amount based on the wages of my last job. How do they know I would get a job making that gains? I have been studying up on how to change this. Florida, from my understanding, is the worst when it comes to this.</p>

																<p>People have to work together to get laws changed. My husband has given up. He hasn&#8217;t been able to live up to his NY alimony agreement since it started and is almost $200k in arrears. One kid is now married and the other about to finish college and go to law school. He&#8217;s still paying child support as if he has 2 teenagers. Plus the giant alimony, which is the bulk of the payment.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t afford a lawyer. His payments are supposed to be $1,776 per week. 55% of his pay gets deducted and goes directly to her and since he doesn&#8217;t even make that much per week, he is always behind and it&#8217;s been this way since we met 4 years ago. I married him anyway. I thought by now something would change. She lives with a millionaire and they started a company together. For all we know she married him too. Because how would we know? She lives in a mansion and drives a luxury car. Takes vacations all the time. </p>
<p>Even to do a modification ourself is complicated. Three states are involved and we don;t even live in NY. He lived there briefly when she filed for divorce.</p>
<p>My husband basically has resigned himself to paying her forever and letting the arrears pile up. Me? I can&#8217;t sleep at night and my growing resentments are making me hate him for not doing something about this. He works 12 hour days, 6 days a week. I&#8217;ve told him to just quit and follow his dreams and who cares what he makes because we&#8217;re resigned to being poor. Giving any money to her at all makes me ill. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a low-paying field and already work long hours. At 52, I&#8217;m not going to find a way to hustle a $100K a year to bail us out. His job pays that. But with 55% going to her pre-tax, and then the government taking their share, he&#8217;s making peanuts for the hours he puts in and the shit he puts up with.</p>
<p>Why work at something you hate if you have to hand it back to the someone who kicked you to the curb without looking back? I can&#8217;t even wrap my head around any of this. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s the ex-wife I feel the most hatred toward. How can she continue to take and take when she already has so so much? We live in a tiny 1 BR apt and share 1 car. Or rather, he has a car. I rely on him for rides. We gave up my car to save money.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even sure I can live like this anymore. The resentments are eating me up.</p>

																<p>Omg I understand! I married someone who has a money hungry ex and I hate her!!! She initially went to court and lied saying she had no income and that he had two jobs when he didnt&#8230; he couldn&#8217;t afford a lawyer so she was granted temporary support for $1600 a month. She actually made more money than he did and its tax free bcs she sits on her lazy ass being a foster parent collecting $4-5k a month. She gets about $800 a month food stamps and gets free medical for her kids (3). He was ordered to pay $400 a month for medical her kids don&#8217;t need and he gets garnished for all of this so instead of making $30 base per hr&#8230;he brought home $400 biweekly. We subpoenaed her wages and tried to take her back to court showing she lied and was making as much as he was however the courts only took $200 off&#8230;fast forward, we get married, paid a lawyer to get an adjustment bc he then had to relocate an hour away and couldn&#8217;t afford to keep driving 1hr30mins one way to work for $400 ish biweekly..now he&#8217;s making $11.00 high school education only and she&#8217;s still making the foster care income plus a part time job and she has the nerve to be playing games with submitting her income&#8230;now her lawyer has the nerve to ask for my income info I&#8217;M NOT GIVING THEM ANYTHING I&#8217;m so over it!! Ugh&#8230; resentment, yes!! I don&#8217;t even want her kids coming to my house or near me bcs she&#8217;s a liar and always starts shit</p>

																<p>Perhaps it is because they hide and sensor the true damages.  A man burned himself to death in Wisconsin over the treatment of losing his kids and his money to survive. He snapped aND soaked himself in gas and burn to death at the front door of the court house..did anyone hear about that ? I didn&#8217;t think so. So maybe if the pain was pushed on to the ones making the rules they would understand more?</p>

																<p>Yeah don&#8217;t listen to Angie getting a second job doesn&#8217;t do any good . I work two jobs and my husband works as many hours as he can at his and we still struggle because of his greedy ex. Don&#8217;t forget it&#8217;s not just the ever increasing child support they want it&#8217;s also the legal fees every time the ex gets an attorney for something that could have been settled out of court between two reasonable people but mom wants to cry in front of court to get more than her fair share .</p>

																<p>Awful reply, courts, and lawyers are giving men awful lives. Maybe this was not his choice as u said. I have seen my son work 90 phrase , get that 90 days  straight with no day off , and about 5 hrs sleep a night, only job he could find at time drove over an hour each way, to pay money to a woman he  ( never married only met a couple of times) . While she went gambling. Biggest loss is the child is wonderful. What few time we have ever got to see him.</p>

																<p>60% of his income may seem high, but the court is also looking at all his assets, and that includes his new wife’s income, as it is a marital asset. This is where she should have done her financial planning before she married him. She needs to maintain her assets as separate property from the marriage. This means no joint bank accounts, no joint credit cards or loans. Nothing owned jointly. I would suggest she meet with a lawyer to figure out how to unentangle her assets from his. Then draw up a post-nup that clearly separates their finances. Once the only assets he has are his solely, then he can go back to court and request they re-evaluate his situation. Although if the wife is receiving spousal support, he may not see a lot of change, child support is normally around 25% of his income, with spousal support on top and can easily reach 50% of his income.</p>

																<p>Its her burden for marrying him? 60% is ridiculous.. The child support system is a disgrace to all of us it takes away from a father who&#8217;s relationship failed. Well that decision works both ways. The cost of raising a child is no where near what they illegally impose on the fathers. And also how do you justify a modification of support after several years have passed? Just because I&#8217;ve bettered my life and moved forward I should be punished? Why should I even try to better myself if all it&#8217;ll do is cause me to pay more? Once set it should be done. But the courts seem to think they rule the world. And you well your not seeing clearly.</p>

																<p>you sound absolutely brain-dead. raising a child, costs far MORE than what the system imposes on fathers. just because a &#8221; fathers&#8221; financial responsibility ends at 18, doesnt mean that it should. the MOTHER still helps, and takes care of there child. regardless of the COURT telling them too. as should the father. THAT is why the court makes it so high. too many Dead Beat Dads, and shit show husbands.</p>

																<p>Ashlee, so what you&#8217;re telling us is for example, the average person in this case brings home $3000 a month. She said 60% in cs. So he pays roughly $1800 a month.  So if you match that $1800 in what the mom should pay to make it equal support for the child,  it cost $3600 a month to raise 1 child? This is very interesting to me&#8230;.</p>

He doesn&#8217;t have a problem paying his share but his sons mother doesn&#8217;t have to pay a dime for her child. 50/50 is understandable but a child doesn&#8217;t cost as much as the court orders. The sad thing is we have children of our own and his leftover money couldn&#8217;t cover that much for our children? To the courts that&#8217;s okay&#8230;it&#8217;s sad</p>

																<p>60% of 3000 is a lot of money and she&#8217;s a gold digger and is probably live off just that income which gives us moms working our asses off a bad name. Now when you come into a situation like mine it&#8217;s frustrating. My daughter is 6 I&#8217;ve take full support in my own until recently when after a 4 year power struggle with her dad, we finally go to court. He pays 200 dollars a month and chews me out on a daily basis. I pay 1200 for rent alone, 215 a month for child care, food, school necessities, clothes etc. so there are some shitty dads out there. In your case this is not fair.</p>

																<p>But you get the child and the happiness of that. So life&#8217;s burdens is what seams not fair to you. If you have the child more he should pay less. People have it ass backwards. Give the father 10 percent and take all the money..how is that even sensible? And how women turn their children into burdens is beyond me. I raised 3 kids on just my income..I never once blamed the kids that I worked hard. Try giving more time to him then it won&#8217;t be as expensive for you..doesn&#8217;t that sound more like sharing the expenses of raising a child ?</p>

																<p>&#8220;But you get the child and the happiness of that&#8230;&#8221; while this statement is true, having the child more means you are required to provide more necessities&#8230;clothing, food, education, entertainment, etc. A man, in most cases, has more earning power, and truth be told, has more time to work while the mother is caring for the child(ren). Seems the men don&#8217;t want to &#8220;man-up&#8221;, instead, want to live a a girlfriend&#8217;s apartment and squander money on penny-ante things, all the while complaining about paying their half.<br>
You are indeed a saintly person, however. Unfortunately, it costs money to feed and clothe children.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m late to the game, but the letter states that $1800 is for TWO children. That sound fair to me. I would assume the custodial parent&#8217;s contributions will even out to that much or more. Lets consider:</p>
<p>Daycare -The custodial parent was likely a single parent for part or most of her children&#8217;s lives, which means she was probably unable to stay home with her children. Monthly daycare costs are astronomical and surpass average rental costs in most parts of the country. Think of what rent for a two-three bedroom house or apartment costs and double it &#8211; there&#8217;s child care for these two kids. It appears the youngest child is five, so chances are this is the first year without daycare or nanny costs.</p>
<p>Housing &#8211; Non-custodial parent and his new wife can live in a studio apartment if they really need to for a short time. It&#8217;s not the same case for the custodial parent. She needs a home or apartment big enough for three people and if she&#8217;s planning to send them to public school, she needs to factor in the increased costs associated with renting or owning in a desirable school district. Or she needs to plan to pay for private school. </p>
<p>Extracurricular activities &#8211; why should the children miss out on participating in dance or science camps or sports? Should they have a different childhood than the one originally planned for them when mom was part of a two parent family? These things can add up to several hundreds of dollars per month.</p>
<p>After school care &#8211; If the custodial parent works, chances are she&#8217;s paying a person or organization to make sure the kids are safe after school. Schools let out around three. Most jobs don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>College- The writer of this letter asks if they should just wait thirteen years &#8211; until their child support obligations end when the youngest turns 18. This is a strong indication that dad and stepmom feel no obligation to support the kids through college. If there is extra money from child support, than the custodial parent may be squirreling that away for college costs. We all know how much college costs. A lot of people fell it&#8217;s not an obligation to pay for college, but I know I wouldn&#8217;t want my daughter to graduate with crippling debt.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not fair for us to pass judgement on the custodial parent. Kids ARE expensive, especially without the benefit of a two person family where there are either two incomes or one person who can provide free childcare and meal planning services. </p>
<p>Child support laws are made with the interest of the child in mind. It unfortunate that other custodial parents are commenting that their former partner does not provide adequate support, but that shouldn&#8217;t equate to these two children deserving less than adequate support in anyone&#8217;s minds. Divorce is hard enough for everyone. The children&#8217;s standard of living shouldn&#8217;t have to take a nose dive on top of it.</p>

																<p>I take offense to that, Court. Why would you assume he abandoned his first family? My fiancée is in a very similar situation. His ex-wife took the kids to the other side of the country (on &#8220;vacation&#8221;) before filing divorce proceedings. And now of course, she is the custodial parent and receives support payments. I agree raising kids is hard, and being the custodial parent takes a lot of work. But atleast they get to see their kids almost everyday. The truly hard part is being forced to pay huge amounts of money to your ex, and still not being allowed to be there often enough for your kids. You just have to hope the custodial parent is doing what they&#8217;re supposed to. So everyone, stop jumping all over these poor parents who are just trying to move on with their lives. Child support should be fair. Every child of divorced parents should have the right to TWO happy, loving households. But it is hard to have this when our family court system so blatantly favors one parent over the other. </p>
<p>We should all just agree that the entire family court system is unfair and leave it at that. Ok, I&#8217;m stepping off my soapbox now.</p>

																<p>Actually, you don&#8217;t pay them. You pay for your children. I was in an accident that left me hospitalized for a year. My ex took our boys during that time. He soon found out that paying child support was less expensive and a whole lot easier than raising 2 boys, 24/7, on your own.  He found out about lhaving to leave work to pick them up, carpool, get them to practice etc. He learned about trips to the Doctor in the middle of a work day. He learned about preparing 3 meals a day anddoing huge amounts of laundry. By the time I was well again, he gladly paid that support!</p>

																<p>My husband has 3 kids with his ex. She got caught cheating and took off. Called my husband to pick up her truck but never for her kids. Here we are 3 years later and now she wants to act like a mother. She gets them 3 weekends a month and in the summer so it&#8217;s considered 35/65 percent (65 with us). He took her to court for child support and because she&#8217;s a dumb ass doesn&#8217;t make that much money so she was ordered to pay $250.00 a month. She&#8217;s only made 3 payments of $65.00 each so $65.00 per month and now she&#8217;s taking him back to court because she wants him to show paystubs, w-2&#8217;s and tax returns for the past 2 years! She wants him to pay her for the 35% they are with her or to at least get her amount reduced!  My husband makes 3 times her income. Can she really do that? Can she actually win??</p>

																<p>Ok now how about we flip the script. I was married for 14 years and my ex decided to leave me for my best friend. I&#8217;m glad she choose him because if I were to pass away he would have been the guy that I would&#8217;ve wanted to help raise my five kids. She told me that she only married me because it made her parents happy ok great so the last fourteen years where a lie. Any ways I pay so much in child support that I can&#8217;t pay all my bills let alone afford to rent a place to live and I have the oldest of five living with me. When the kids are with me I can support them with three hundred dollars a month for food clothes for the year an additional 60 a month it&#8217;s exactly the same as it was when we where married. Ok so how does punishing me for her leaving mind you I gave her the house also I pay over 1500 a month equal fairness not to mention between her and her boyfriend average over six thousand dollars a month in a joint bank account not including my cs plus all the bills from when we were married that I&#8217;m now filing bankruptcy on. I can&#8217;t even keep up on cs so I also get punished because in order to support a second family they have to starve even though she has a job of her own we don&#8217;t live nearly as wealthy as they do. So in other words in order for me to live a happy life like my ex I need to find someone with equal number of kids with the same child support income as me to offset my fine. Sounds like I&#8217;d be the gold digger I say cs is the biggest crock I have to pay 18000 dollars a year so I can spend 60 days with them tell me that&#8217;s fair that&#8217;s 300 dollars a day for my time with them. I believe in supporting my kids one hundred percent but the courts should take into account everything bills on both sides and the fact the children don&#8217;t need fashion designer clothes or three hundred dollar shoes. Or steak and potatoes for every meal. Boy I wish I could afford a steak let alone find a women that would enjoy struggling and not being able to start a family of our own for the next thirteen years.</p>

																<p>Tim, </p>
<p>My husband is in the same boat as you. He paid $20,652 per year for 7 years. His ex finally got a job and claims she&#8217;s not making a lot, even though I tend to disagree but fortunately we were able to get it dropped to $12,216. We have 2 more years until the oldest turns 18 &#8211; thank the lord &#8211; and another 7 years before the next one turns 18. They have bought a house, and remodeled it inside and out. We are still renting 7 years later. They both have relatively newer vehicles than we do. We don&#8217;t take the kids on any trips anymore because we can&#8217;t afford to. Hopefully I can get started with work soon and help support on all the bills. If we could NOT pay child support, but often see the children, like every weekend (that we already do), everyone&#8217;s life would be much better off. Kids would get gifts randomly, new clothes, new shoes, money for the mall, etc. But because we do and clearly the money does not go to the kids at all, we&#8217;re stuck with one stressed out and mostly bored on the weekends household.</p>

																<p>Nice assumption. My fiance was deployed to a combat zone when his then-wife moved another man into his house, wrecked his truck, and then drained his bank account and took off with his children when he found out she was sleeping with someone else. </p>
<p>He fought for and won visitation, but she moves quite a bit and won&#8217;t give him their address. She rarely answers the phone. He has almost no relationship with his kids because of her, and the state does nothing to enforce their visits. </p>
<p>We send this woman a huge chunk of change every month. She quit her job to pop out several more babies by one of the dudes she cheated on him with, so we&#8217;re subsidizing his children with our money, too. Awesome system, right?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re waiting till his kids are adults to get married, because I don&#8217;t want my money getting into her hands. There are women out there who don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass about their marriages or the best thing for their kids, and it&#8217;s incredibly unfair to punish the men they&#8217;ve screwed over for the wife&#8217;s misdeeds. Dad isn&#8217;t always the one who ruined his relationship.</p>

																<p>Why the automatic assumption that the guy is the dead beat or the one who &#8220;ruined&#8221; the marriage? Maybe she&#8217;s the trifling one who made it end. I have a child of my own who is in daycare and I can assure you it doesn&#8217;t cost $1800/mo to raise my 16 month old. </p>
<p>As for housing, any stable adult should be living in a home of their own with kids or not. So, the man should&#8217;ve required to pay the difference between what a studio or one bedroom costs vs a two or three bedroom, whatever is necessary. And then, he should only have to pay half of that difference because that&#8217;s his half of the increase. There are tons of trifling women out there with multiple kids by multiple men who are only gaming the system. Maybe we should start sterilizing some of these hussies.</p>

																<p>Did you ever consider maybe it was the ex wife&#8217;s fault that the marriage ended in divorce??  The husband could have a new wife now and children that his income also is providing for. Also some women are out to destroy their exs financially. The child support laws are screwed up!</p>

																<p>First of all lets stop calling custodial women single parents. My mother never took a cent from my father. He was a true piece of s&#8211;t! Rarely showed his face. She did it all herself&#8230; And she still doesn&#8217;t call herself a single parent! </p>
<p>Answer these questions&#8230; What happens to a family when times get hard (and for many living in poverty is lifelong)? Do they have to cut back on spending. Do they find other ways of supporting our acquiring the better things in life? Do they simply have to tell their children and themselves no, at times? When times are good what happen? Do all in the family benefit? </p>
<p>What about the fact that the self-pitied-single-mother never had to miss a beat financially because of court mandated income to her while the father works every waking hour, hours that should be spent with his child/ren while the mother benefits not from just the c.s. But their own income as well as the income of their new spouse. Oh and gets to share in the children&#8217;s every inch of growth. </p>
<p>Most are hard pressed to belive that money solves everything and that love takes a back seat in child rearing. Tell That to half of Americans that lost their father due to oppressive legal action. A man can only take so much.</p>
<p>You ever hear of the statistics of father&#8217;s who stop paying or seeing? I&#8217;ve struggled to not be one of those statistics. It only gets harder. And my bonds with my children have become loosened.</p>
<p>&#8230;Might want to rethink your stance on believing the courts have the best interest of the child in mind. I believe if parents can&#8217;t figure it out on their own, well then let nature take its course. If &#8220;he&#8221; don&#8217;t show or pay, f&#8211;k him. But if he is willing to be repaints, let him. Don&#8217;t make him. Remember it took the both of them to make the child. Both parties will have to soul search and gave what they did wrong, not place the blame on the man. The system places blame on the man as soon as separation is a thought. </p>
<p>I was working 40+, managing 10 rentals (took kids with me a lot, made it fun for them), cleaning, taking kids to and from school, coming home and cooking for everyone, eating at the dinner table while mom sits on the couch, with a plate, on the phone, in front of the television exactly how she spent most of her time. Then bathed children put them to sleep. And then went to my bedroom, climbed over a mountain of clothes knocked the debris of my bed and tried to get rest. But at least my kids got to see me. We had strong bonds, my babies and I.</p>
<p>I also helped support her first born from a previous including health insurance, who by the way she had no court mandates on at all!  I loved him and bonded with him too. Now she is on her fourth child from a new unwed relationship trying to prove to our children god knows what. And miserable as hell.</p>
<p>But now it&#8217;s all about money and &#8220;I&#8217;m the custodian&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m a single mother&#8221;, &#8220;do as I say&#8221; &#8220;love them as I say&#8221;. Give me a break!</p>
<p>All I Want is to parent my children without a court telling me how to do it. Period!</p>
<p>Men make this pledge and pass it on to other men and your children: &#8220;I will never give a woman the time of day if she has EVER taken court mandated child support from a father&#8221;. And teach them that when they think of marrying, child support enforcement could very well be a fact of life if it were to fail. And also give failed marriage statistics to key them know what they could be getting into.</p>
<p>For the original question, do what you have to. A free man acts as a free man even when he knows there may be repercussions. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tread on me&#8221;!</p>

																<p>$900 per child sounds fair to you? 30% of income per child sounds fair to you? Let&#8217;s consider: </p>
<p>Daycare -The non/ custodial parent was likely a single parent for part or most of her children’s lives, which means he was probably unable to stay home with HIS children. Monthly daycare costs are astronomical and surpass average rental costs in most parts of the country. Think of what rent for a two-three bedroom house or apartment costs and double it because a father should be entitled to the same living standard and equal parenting time as the mother. There is no scientific proof that a mother is more fit than a mother. </p>
<p>Housing – A custodial parent and her new spouse (or no spouse) can live in a studio apartment if they really need to for a short time (because why should a non-custodial father have to live in a studio apartment but you not feel as if a mother should have to?). It IS the same case for the custodial parent but there shouldn&#8217;t be a custodial parent. BOTH mother and father need a home or apartment big enough for three people as EQUAL parenting time is truly in the best interest of the childre. and if THEY are  planning to send them to public school, THEY will need to factor in the increased costs associated with renting or owning in a desirable school district. Or THEY need to plan to pay for private school.</p>
<p>Extracurricular activities – why should the children miss out on participating in dance or science camps or sports? Should they have a different childhood than the one originally planned for them when mom was part of a two parent family? These things can add up to several hundreds of dollars per month. ** Again- you keep giving Mom all of the decision making rights as if Mom is more fit. You are clearly sexist and hold mom to a higher standard based off gender. Dad was also apart of a two parent home and Mom could get married at any point in time. For all we know, mom could be in a serious relationship for a longer length of time than dad but refused to get married to reap the benefits of state funded programs! Happens all the time! But you&#8217;re assuming and being sexist that mom is a poor single mother who needs all the help she can get while dad just ran off with the first woman he met. Typical. </p>
<p>After school care – If the custodial parent works, chances are she’s paying a person or organization to make sure the kids are safe after school. Schools let out around three. Most jobs don’t. Let me correct you again, there shouldn&#8217;t be a custodial parent- its shares parent. Equal 50/50. Neither parent gets off at 5. Or if one does, they work within both of their schedules! </p>
<p>College- The writer of this letter asks if they should just wait thirteen years – until their child support obligations end when the youngest turns 18. This is a strong indication that dad and stepmom feel no obligation to support the kids through college. If there is extra money from child support, than the custodial parent may be squirreling that away for college costs. We all know how much college costs. A lot of people fell it’s not an obligation to pay for college, but I know I wouldn’t want my daughter to graduate with crippling debt. ** The letter absolutely does NOT indicate it. The letter indicates that the fathers obligation is HIGHER than the mothers- which is almost always the case. If you do research on the matter , fathers child support obligations are higher than mothers in almost every single case. Custodial parents typically pay less. In almost every case, non custodial parents pay child support on top of a matched percentage of daycare (which you pointed custodial parents must pay for which is typically false but not always). </p>
<p>It’s not fair for us to pass judgement on the custodial parent. Kids ARE expensive, especially without the benefit of a two person family where there are either two incomes or one person who can provide free childcare and meal planning services.</p>
<p>You are clearly a very bitter single mother. Let me ask you, if the tables were turned, would you be able to live without your child/ren for only 4 days or 2 months of the year? Would you be able to go weeks /months without seeing your child/ren? Would you be able to afford paying 30-60% of your income to your ex and still be able to provide for yourself and possible a new family? Would you be able to get another job because a judge told it wasn&#8217;t his problem? Would you be able to NOT become frustrated? Would you be able to not become heartbroken when a power hungry ex dangled your children in front of you and used them as a paycheck and was never satisfied with the amount of money they received as support? Would you be able to be happy if your ex didn&#8217;t allow you to see your children just because their gender is seen as superior in family courts? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t answer those questions truthfully though. I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t be one of us women standing at the courthouses with the tens of thousands of men who fight for their parental rights against a biased and unlawful court system or for our children who deserve two fit and loving parents involved in their lives equally both physically and financially, because it&#8217;s both of our responsibilities to provide for our children not just the men&#8217;s. </p>
<p>Child support laws are made with the interest of the child in mind. It unfortunate that other custodial parents are commenting that their former partner does not provide adequate support, but that shouldn’t equate to these two children deserving less than adequate support in anyone’s minds. Divorce is hard enough for everyone. The children’s standard of living shouldn’t have to take a nose dive on top of it.</p>

																<p>@Rachel&#8230; I am not going to debate much, because I need to get back to work. But your argument is way off. </p>
<p>My ex has her single-family house paid off (no mortgage), has about $50,000 in savings in the bank. She admitted in her DEPOSITION that she got a job that makes 1/2 of what she could earn because she knew it would affect support. By the way, she refuses to let me have any more visitation with my kids (all i&#8217;m asking for is 1 extra day per week). She has the kids in daycare for all of 45 minutes per day (by the way&#8230; I now live 5 minutes away from her and I have said that I can take the kids before&amp;after school to alleviate the childcare costs. She says no because &#8220;the kids need socialization at daycare &amp; camps.&#8221; She figures what the hell&#8230; I&#8217;m paying 2/3 of the coast anyway so it doesn&#8217;t matter to her). </p>
<p>Now that my support just got upped to $1700/month (yes, this includes $700/month in childcare costs that I am 67% responsible for&#8230; proportional to our incomes), she now puts away about $1500/month into the bank!!! That is, she has this much left over AFTER all expenses are paid every month. This does not show up on her income reports  though because child support is not declared as income! </p>
<p>My cushion at the end of each month is a whopping $150, if that. And I go into the red if she takes the kids to the doctor that month. </p>
<p>So yeah&#8230; you just go ahead and try to argue that this a fair situation and that the dads on this board are paying what the deserve to be paying. Go ahead&#8230; try to do it.</p>

																<p>My husband was totally screwed by his ex-wife. I knew this when I married him but I had no idea how hard it would be to do a modification on our own.</p>
<p>The system is rigged in favor of women and if a man doesn&#8217;t have lawyer money, he will pay that woman forever. My husband fell into arrears because of alimony. Months into his divorce, which she initiated, he lost his job. The arrears just kept piling up. Then he was underemployed and even making $100K a year, is still underemployed per the divorce decree, which stipulates a combined payment of $1,776/week.</p>
<p>In that time, one kid has gotten married and the other about to graduate college.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s been living with a millionare, drives a lexus, toured every country in europe, and now is a VP in the new company her rich boyfriend launched. She has zero financial concerns. Yet she still takes 55% of my husband&#8217;s salary pre-tax, has not removed the married kid from the &#8220;payroll&#8221; and lets the arrears just keep piling up. She demands 50% of all the college son&#8217;s expenses and has dragged us to court when we couldn&#8217;t pay. She knows we can&#8217;t afford a lawyer. Hell, we can&#8217;t even afford a 2nd car. So she always wins.</p>
<p>I don;t make enough money to make up the difference of what she takes from us each week. Her level of greed, and that cold fact that it&#8217;s allowed, saps my ambition.</p>
<p>The fact that in 2010, when the divorce took place, that a ridiculous alimony award was handed out to a smart woman with teenagers &#8230; it&#8217;s over my head.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be paying her until we&#8217;re dead. And we&#8217;ll never get a vacation.</p>

																<p>But what if the custodial mother doesn&#8217;t work and the child is of school age (11) and doesn&#8217;t need daycare. Maybe a baby sitter but not full on daycare. Should the father still be paying so much that he can&#8217;t provide even half of what is necessary for his new family. The child I speak of has full health benefits, lives in a large comfortable home and father pays for all extracurricular activities. I&#8217;m not his wife yet but my boyfriend pays ~50,000 per year to his ex wife who has not worked in ten years. Thoughts?</p>

																<p>Yep another one. The children are hard and it&#8217;s such a burden. Poor poor kids..if it&#8217;s so hard go 50 50 with the dad..then your burden will be 50 percent less. Right. Then suddenly it would be maybe taxes or gas are the problem ..but nah why say that when you can play a poor poor kids game</p>

																<p>1) Daycare really, why do you need daycare if you don&#8217;t work. if you do work then you also have a responsibility to financially take care of your children.<br>
2) Housing, why is the responsibility of living in a new neighborhood the sole responsibility of the child support payer. If this is a burden, hand the children over to your spouse. You can&#8217;t claim a right to the children but not the financial responsibility. Maybe if you let your kids stay with your spouse you can live in a studio and he and his wife can live in the &#8220;good&#8221; neighborhood (see how that works)<br>
3) Extracurricular activities, again being a mother does not mean you have no financial responsibility to your children.<br>
4)After school care, college: you want good things for your child get a better job so you can contribute more. seems you are claiming rights for your child but no additional financial responsibility on your part (rights without responsibilities, the new American way). I am yet to see one child support recipient put money away for their child college, at least no meaningful amount of money.</p>

																<p>Really? Is that so? Ok well I&#8217;m in both situations. My husband had an ex wife who drinks everyday had her own cleaning business and photography business, rips oft the system every chance she gets and yet child support WON&#8217;T investigate her earnings. I on the other hand have a child in my care and a court order to say so yet his narcassistic father refused to return him and he refuses to come home hitting me for full child support a fast before he planned to just take him froM school. Yes there are dead beat dad&#8217;s out the majority of dad&#8217;s just want to survive each day financially. Don&#8217;t judge unless you&#8217;re in the situation!!!the system is all for the women and they dint give a crap about dad&#8217;s! !as for Australian family Court system ,well what an absolute joke that is as well. And if you knew these two people that continue to be financially destructive towards our happiness and well being you wouldn&#8217;t be judging! My husband&#8217;s ex wife slept with his best mate and everyone else in town then moved the boys to a place she thought would be better. .huh she moved because the gf of the best mate she screwed wants to smash her face in because she was the reason the gf committed suicide.</p>

																<p>I may as well put in my two cents. It is the responsibility of the father to help .Yes, but what about paying 60% it&#8217;s Ludacris.  We pay it also &#8230; and that&#8217;s fine thy r his children. But what about BOTH PARENTS WORKING TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN . I see that as fair. She doesn&#8217;t work, but o yes she has a photography business but forgot that she failed to claim or mention to the child support agency!! That&#8217;s ok c/s doesn&#8217;t care I bet irs will tho! / some mothers want to make their exs lives MISERABLE!! KEEP IN MIND I&#8217;M AN EX WIFE ALSO. Do I put him through this &#8230;..NO ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Also keep in mind my husband left his ex after she cheated 3x so HE DID TRY!! Misery loves company ppl and while many exs are not like this MOST ARE AND IT&#8217;S SAD BC WHAT ABOUT THE DADS RETIREMENT life ect just bc thy had kids w someone who DID NOT WORK OUT DOESN&#8217;T MEAN THEY SHOULD SUFFER!! GET OFF YOUR FAT ASS GET A JOB AND QUIT LYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE U MAKE LESS .JS</p>

																<p>You&#8217;re full $hit Ashley. There are more dead beat mom&#8217;s then there are dead beat dad&#8217;s.. Proven by state wide CS.in my opinion yes a father should pay childsupport until there children are 18. But after that it&#8217;s the 18 year olds job to help pay for college. No more childsupport&#8230; Eighteen year olds are old.enough to get a job and learn about life. And the mom or father&#8217;s job to learn to deal without the extra paychecks&#8230; That&#8217;s why my husband and I don&#8217;t share any accounts. We don&#8217;t even claim taxe together. This is all legal. So how if you must check the internet&#8230;. If you must. P.s in the state I live in if a woman on purposely gets pregnant, and the be or ex hubby is able to prove it with a Dr&#8217;s letter proven the discontinued birth control or recording. Then the ex does not have to pay one cent forwards that child by state law.</p>

																<p>Don&#8217;t matter what dead beat dads don&#8217;t pay. They don&#8217;t get screwed. The honest ones paying get screwed. The ones that show up in court get screwed. My husbands ex has 4 kids only one is his. She earns $4600 a month he earns $1300 a month he pays $200 child support. She gets child support from two other guys for the other two kids. All four have different daddies. So imma tell you this: you don&#8217;t know shit. Just because you don&#8217;t believe single mothers don&#8217;t always do that doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t its just your belief.</p>

																<p>Lol, this response is ridiculous. Typical stereotype assuming that there are too many &#8220;deadbeat&#8221; dads. Use your brain and analyze how the judicial system puts them in an impeccable bind. How can you possibly raise your children in a loving manner if your faced with homelessness due to the greedy capitalistic society that wants to starve fathers, who would otherwise be successful components to the world and most importantly their children.</p>

																<p>first let me say in ny i pay 24 percent for my 2 kids and that 24 comes out to be almost 500 a week&#8230;i know being a father does not end with the child support, but damm come on i cant afford a place with what i am left with and the reason there are so many dead beat dads is just that&#8230;..we cant afford to live&#8230;and we need to live too, or is it because u are a woman and that is why you answer the way you do&#8230;.because i am no dead beat dad, just a broke one because of the system in place&#8230;</p>

																<p>Ashlee you sound like the one that&#8217;s brain dead I don&#8217;t even have to pay child support but I can plainly see how unfair it is. I have seen plenty of women that do t even work make more than me because they just live off there kids and use them like paychecks.its the cold hard truth child support is so high be cause the government is going to make sure you pay outrages amounts so the dead beat mom that doesn&#8217;t want to get a job doesn&#8217;t ask them for money. And it is your choice to baby your kid after they turned 18 just because you want to baby them until there 40 doesn&#8217;t mean the other parent should have to pay. Ashlee if you have done your job as the custodial guardian and raised your child to be a self sufficient member of society you wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for them for the rest of your life I had a job since I was 16 never asked my parents for a dime.</p>

																<p>I just think about it like this&#8230;my husband pays 900 a month for his children and she wants more.  His ex is lazy and his kids always look homeless when they visit.  We can&#8217;t even buy them nice things for birthdays or Christmas because they always end up in the pawn shops.  She has a new husband who doesn&#8217;t work and lives off of my husband.  But one say&#8230;one day when those kids are 18, my husband and I am will still have careers and retirement plans and she&#8217;ll have to kill herself because she won&#8217;t be  able to live off of section 8, food stamps and child support anymore.</p>

																<p>Sorry, I completely disagree with your statement as it relates to my family: $2,700 + $400 for child care + 50% medical expenses and those are just the monthly costs not counting extras she&#8217;s taken him to court for &#8211; or the fact she could remarry and have technically a third income in her household mix. Or the fact that while they live with us this summer he has been ordered to pay 100% child care while sending child support to her (where&#8217;s his child support for covering the girls&#8217; living costs while they stay with us?). elementary age girls don&#8217;t cost that much. We actually looked at a table of how much a child costs and found my boyfriend is paying 100% of their cost. Where&#8217;s her share? And by the way she&#8217;s a nurse. She also was dishonest about the second child&#8217;s conception and asked for the divorce herself. The system meant to protect children and the custodial parent is legalized theft in our household.</p>

																<p>Sorry, you just have no idea what it costs to raise a kid. Health insurance, doctor visits when they&#8217;re sick, seeing a dentist a couple of times a year like they should, daycare or afterschool care or just maybe a dance class, food, clothes, a good safe place to live, driving them where they need to go&#8211;yeah, it costs more than $500 a month to raise a kid. I mean, it costs more than that for just daycare alone. I&#8217;m sorry for the ways your situation is hard, but kids do deserve to have what they need. Just the basic stuff. Which does actually come to more than $500 a month most months.</p>

																<p>My fiance is hit with over $2k a month in child support AND has to pay half of unreimbursed medical expenses, educational expenses and day care on top of that. By the time it&#8217;s all over he pays his ex more than I take home. The kicker? SHE MAKES MORE THAN I DO, and that&#8217;s before we consider that she can claim the kids on taxes, etc.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re supposed to just assume it takes $4k a month to feed, house and clothe kids, right? If they&#8217;re paying the expenses equally? Sorry, you can&#8217;t convince me of that.</p>
<p>When I suggested he start asking for EOBs and receipts on the medical/educational stuff, you&#8217;d have thought -I- was the devil. Come to find out, she wasn&#8217;t properly filing the kids&#8217; medical insurance so neither one of them owed the money she kept dunning him for! Whenever it did get straightened out and she got a refund she was -keeping- it even though it should have gone 50% back to him.</p>
<p>And yet I was the bad guy here for simply insisting that she gets enough money to play with on her own and that she should have to justify anything extra. Right? Please.</p>

																<p>My thoughts exactly. I&#8217;m about to go to court again trying for 50/50. And just landed an awesome passing job. Way better than my last but now I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m gonna take a huge hit for cs. But what I was giving before was half my check. Why keep increasing what I have to pay? Because we all know that a cs payment of 550 a month is not all used for the child. So because she can&#8217;t get a good job but I can I&#8217;m made to suffer, and put my current family in financial crisis? I&#8217;m not allowed to move on either?</p>

																<p>Nope, you are not allowed to move on and any women who fall in love with you are not allowed to have a child wish and are doomed &#8211; doomed for love and doomed for sticking it out while the ex is whining she has a hard time WITH the support not ever thinking how hard it must be not only NOT getting support but paying it out while at the same time having also a family.<br>
But the custodial parent qualifies for all kinds of government help because of the kids she(or sometimes he) can get quite a bit on foodstamps, can get child tax credits and earned income tax refunds  &#8211; that can amount to over 10k/year and no taxes have to be claimed on the child support received. There is programs for free daycare for low income parents or for working parents so the daycare cost are not necessarily that high if at all present, food on a kid can be paid by the government including also the WIC programs, clothing -there is a lot of cheap second hand around, formula can be paid by WIC, medical can be covered in full by Medicaid. So to say a child costs that much is crazy. The courts tell the non custodial that they can live of 600$ per month but one child 50% share at 600$ is too low for the child to live, a child which does not need a car or pay for gas. And there is no oversight if the custodial even uses the money for the kids- she might just use it to have more kids and qualify for more deductions and  get income from a new husband but that does not matter to the courts they still see her as the victim (even if the custodial left the non-custodial) and the second wife has no right to have money for her kids no matter how long she waited to have her kids but then the second wife does often not qualify for some programs since the child support paid out is still calculated as household income even if the 2nd family never sees a penny of that since it is deducted after TAXES right out of the paycheck and for the automatic deduction there is also a fee charged and the deduction comes out no matter if there is a slow week or 10 slow weeks and if you want to modify the lawyers want 2500-5000$. And still the exes kids think that the non-custodial does nothing for them cause he cant afford to buy them DIRECTLY presents since so much support is taken out.</p>

																<p>Child support is made for money hungry women. And come to find out if the man remarries and have other kids those new kids don&#8217;t get counted. Which is bull shit that is saying the first kids are the only ones that matters. That just makes women not want to deal with a man who is on child support. And before you money hungry women start complaining about my comments. I have 3 kids get no child support and yes my husband is on child support for two other kids and all his money gets taken. And no I should not have to pay for kids that aren&#8217;t mine. And if I ever get a divorce I would never expect the next women to take care of my kids.  I feel bad for the guys who get screwed because of child support. The system gives everything to women and leaves the man shit out of luck.  And of course for the second women who gives the man a chance gets screwed too. It&#8217;s ridiculous then the women getting support wants more. We pay full bills go without so my kids have the stuff they need but my husband&#8217;s ex gets to buy all the new cell phones get her hair and nails done buy brand name clothes and oh by the way gets everything the government has to offer. While we can&#8217;t get any help and lose more money. And to the women who said this lady married into it you are dead wrong.  You&#8217;re basically saying she has to get a second job for them to have money no she should not have to do that. The ex wife nerds to own up for her own kids just like I do.</p>

																<p>She has the prize. Why is that the burden ? Most men don&#8217;t even get support from the women. When my brother got a divorce he had to pay 1200 plus maintenence.  But when the boys got older and he got custody. And he is happy with no support cause he has the boys. He got the prize.</p>

																<p>I agree with you, in the sense that what the child support is at the time of marriage breakdown should be, what it is. So now, I take it upon myself to study, further my career and make more money, why should she have her hands on that hard work? I get my kids 38% of the time. The CS guidelines basically leaves me scratching the bottom of my car for change to feed them, clothe them and entertain them a bit. I mean, I just bought a 9 year old car (an upgrade) in order to keep them safe on the roads and had to beg my bank to make it into a 4 year loan so I can afford payments on it. Im left with nothing! All because she cheated and I decided to leave the marriage. Seems unfair, especially for the men who love their kids and try and spend as much time with them as possible and Pay their exes without question. Now, the other side of the coin is the fact that CS is so much because the children need to keep the same lifestyle as they did before the marriage breakdown. My children DONOT cost $1795/month, but it might for the ex to keep her fancy car and nice house and keep her happy&#8230;for the kids sake.</p>

																<p>Tea, your post is very informative, however if they remain married (even with separate accounts) it has been documented that the income is there and available.  The judge might view this as &#8220;hiding&#8221; the income and come down even harder at the next hearing.  It&#8217;s always been suggested to me that you file for divorce (again, on paper) and &#8220;rent&#8221; from your new ex-wife.  A judge who has a heart will not enforce those payments as some states have a clause about &#8220;financial hardships&#8221;.  Either way, this is a good lesson; ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS sign a prenup.  In that prenup you need to stipulate n% for each child and 0% (ZERO) for spousal support.  I&#8217;ve seen bitter ex-wives living off their ex-husbands support for decades while not even lifting a finger to look for a job. &#8220;It&#8217;s what I am accustomed to, so therefore he has to pay for it&#8221;, meanwhile the ex-husband is living in a trailer park.</p>

																<p>Prenups aren&#8217;t worth anything if you have a vindictive, entitled ex-wife.</p>
<p>The first post was good advice.  Legally divorce the current wife.  As far as the court and state is concerned you&#8217;ll be divorced and the payment should go down.  It would be better if you had children with her, then divorced so you&#8217;d pay your current wife child support too.  As for the legal divorce; man cannot separate what God has put together.  You aren&#8217;t really divorced, just under color of law in the judicial system.</p>

																<p>When it comes to child support  no man out there is going to win.  Not to bad mouth all women, but they own you when you have a child with them.  Ive seen many a friend go through the same situation time after time.  Today many of young men are saying no to marriage and is there any wonder why.  Marriage is nothing but a legal document that is signed by both parties so legally the man is agreeing to give up control of his life to his wife and kids.  This day and time any man decides to get married pre-nup or conventional marriage pardon me , but HE HAS GOT TO BE TOTALLY ILL INFORMED OR JUST A COMPLETE IDIOT.  There is a huge number of men that are deciding to not get married.   Marriage is for women only,  when are men going to take their set of jewels back and own them for himself.  Today most all marriages that are made and then when the divorce comes it is filed by their wives .  They cannot come out on the bad end of the deal.  There is no such thing as commitment  anymore from anyone.  All of you know that if the man in the marriage is unhappy WHO HAS TO PAY of course HE DOES   and likewise if the woman in the marriage is unhappy WHO HAS TO PAY of course HE DOES.  Marriage doesnt mean equal commitment.   Im warning anyone not to do it.  Ive studied psychology for many years and there is a much larger pool of women than in the older days that are just not marriage material anymore.   Even today when you look at it who is complaining about men not wanting to get married anymore.  ITS THE WOMEN.  Women can change as fast as a heartbeat.  They are always looking for the better deal for themselves,  and who has the upper hand .  They do!!!!!!   I&#8217;m warning you again not to get married, keep your sanity and your strength and dont do it.</p>

																<p>Just wanting to point out the fact that once you have a child with someone if you are not with that person you should be paying child support if you don&#8217;t have full custody regardless of marriage.  I&#8217;m not saying what amount, but your reasoning behind not getting married is pointless if you have a child anyway.  Also your theory doesn&#8217;t work if you live somewhere that common law marriage is legal and most states require that in order for the ex-spouse to receive alimony they must have not had a job for X number of years straight.  I believe in Texas it&#8217;s between 7 and 10, can&#8217;t quite remember.</p>

																<p>Any man who says marriage is &#8216;no good for them&#8217; should NEVER marry, SIMPLE!<br>
AND don&#8217;t think you can &#8216;afford&#8217; kids either &#8211; on what ground&#8230;? You want a woman, to love you, fully commit to you, support you emotionally and otherwise, and bear your children &#8211; while in return you want to remain FREE and UNATTACHED!!<br>
Free from legal marriage &#8211;<br>
Free from legal obligation what comes with it &#8211;<br>
Yet, willing to have ALL the benefits what normally &#8221;marriage&#8217; offers ..!<br>
Ain&#8217;t it little too cheeky..?<br>
Sorry, but no self respecting woman, smart woman who understands that life is life and precautions must be taken in ALL things, will ever want to get involved with you..!<br>
The contract of marriage is a legal form of protection, as you NEVER can predict how things will turn out, and legal system stands behind a woman (or any custodial parent) she is the one who takes on the most of work load on when it comes to children&#8230;</p>

																<p>As a woman going through a difficult custody battle and not seeing a dime of child support in the meantime (even though I am under-employed for the sole purpose of caring for the children), I am going advise the following.</p>
<p>1. Let go of your resentment. It&#8217;s not hurting anybody but yourself.<br>
2. Make a budget and stick to it.<br>
3. When the child support payments increase, re-do the budget.</p>
<p>You husband made a commitment to his first wife and an even bigger commitment when they had children. He is obligated to care for them. End of story. Like you said, you knew this when you married him. You might not be able to have everything you want right now, but the most important thing is to make a budget according to how you ARE able to live. There&#8217;s no point in fantasizing about &#8220;if only he didn&#8217;t have to pay child support we could live a much better lifestyle&#8221; because what you are really saying is &#8220;if only he didn&#8217;t have kids.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to sound harsh, but I think you&#8217;ll be much more successful in dealing with your situation if you accept its reality and stop looking for ways around it.</p>
<p>I am FLAT BROKE, but it is what it is. I stick to my budget and I don&#8217;t complain.</p>

																<p>Now, wait a minute, please don&#8217;t lump all women in the same category.  Four years ago, I lowered my ex&#8217;s child support on my own from $750/month to $250/month, because he came to me like a sensible human being after trying to pay it for a few months and he was having to pick and choose what bills to pay and his house payment was one of them.  We sat down and looked at his bills, which he brought with him, to include his bank account so that I wouldn&#8217;t think he was lying and showed me where his paycheck was going in and only bills were coming out.  We matched them to his statements that he brought from his bills.  I had to be that strict with him in order to agree to lower it, because he has lied to me many times in the past and was getting large bonuses from his previous job and wasn&#8217;t reporting it.  However, with his new job, he didn&#8217;t get any bonuses and there was no unreported income.  We drafted up our own agreement, based on what he could truly afford, which had absolutely nothing to do with my income, which was only $1000/month at the time.  I worked with him and it was an agreement that I was okay with, because it was based on honesty.  Now, I know a lot of exes can&#8217;t work together like that, because there is resentment from the divorce, but it&#8217;s truly best to work things out than to go back to the judge all of the time.  He has since dropped out of my son&#8217;s life, because he has a new wife and she has two kids of her own, but I chose to leave the child support the way it has been, because he still has the same job and his new wife works to support her kids as their dad has passed away.</p>
<p>HOWEVER:  There are some women that are extremely greedy.  My husband&#8217;s ex wife is blaming my husband for the military giving him orders to move from Michigan to Texas.  She thinks it was a choice, which it was not.  He tried everything he could to stay and it just wasn&#8217;t in the cards.  They only have one child together.  Before we moved, we had his son every other week, they have joint custody, and they make the same amount of money.  Though he was told by a judge that he didn&#8217;t have to pay any child support, because we payed for the daycare and all expenses on our own week, paid half for any extracurricular activities, and carried the health insurance for him and paid for the dental insurance, my husband still decided to pay money to go into a 529 account in his ex wife&#8217;s name so that his son would have money towards college.  When he moved down to Texas, she got angry and went to court to raise his child support, child care, etc even though we offered to send her money for half of the child care, half of the extracurricular activities, and half of anything else she would need for him.  That wasn&#8217;t enough for her.  She took us to court and was awarded $950 and we all of a sudden owed $4000 in back child support while waiting for a court date.  We have two kids together and we don&#8217;t make a whole lot of money, but it seems a bit ridiculous that even though we still have him 106 days of court ordered time (we actually ended up having him 136 total, because she let him come early or stay longer so she didn&#8217;t have to pay child care those extra days).  A temporary order was put in place back in February 2013 until our objections can be heard, which her lawyer keeps getting permission to delay the court hearing, maybe he and the judge are buddies, who knows.  Anyways, after 8 months of paying that large amount plus back child support that magically showed up, our house in Michigan (which we were unable to sell before we moved and our renters that were there left in June after 6 months, because they were soldiers and had to move as well) is going into foreclosure, we are now behind on our vehicle payment by a couple of months, we haven&#8217;t been able to pay the credit cards since April, our vehicle insurance was cancelled for non-payment and then we had to decide to pay that bill instead of others, because you can&#8217;t drive without it.  We are rationing out milk to our two little ones, who are 3 and 4, because we can&#8217;t afford it.  I can&#8217;t even work, because we would be using all of that money to pay for daycare, because it&#8217;s so expensive down here.  We went to the state to try to get help temporarily until our objections are heard, but they go by his income before deductions and child support doesn&#8217;t count as an allowable deduction.  Our 3 year old needs a $232 dental procedure done, but we can&#8217;t afford that either.  We have also gone to her and tried to be civil and come to an agreement, but she won&#8217;t even hear it.  When my husband was gone to Iraq, she agreed to allow us to pay $200 on top of the amount we paid for the 529 account, and I took him every other week still to offset her daycare (though I ended up with him more because she&#8217;s an alcoholic and likes the bars and partying, plus she got a new boyfriend and was spending nights there).  Now, we move to Texas, not by choice might I add, and she&#8217;s punishing us for it.  She is the type of person that is greedy and causes divorced parents to be in and out of court constantly and ends up ultimately punishing her own child, because when he was with us all summer, we couldn&#8217;t do one thing as a family or go to one event, because we literally were down to allowing the kids one glass of milk per day, no seconds at meals, etc.  It&#8217;s just getting worse and worse.  Our court hearing is on Tuesday next week, hopefully we get some relief and no delay.<br>
I am not trying to get out of paying child support, by all means, but there is a line between reasonable and unreasonable.  If the child is supposed to enjoy the same standard of living as when they were married, then why is she living high on the hog while we are rationing milk to our kids?!!  The system is truly flawed and you don&#8217;t see it truly unless you can see both sides of the fence, like in the situation with my ex compared to my husband&#8217;s ex.  The system is flawed in that, even though it would be great if the child could truly enjoy the same standard of living as when his or her parents were married, that&#8217;s not feasible.  There are now to separate incomes, houses, expenses, bills&#8230;double everything.  It doesn&#8217;t leave room for you to move on, be happy, start a new family, and still include your child from your ex as though they never go back and forth.  The system says that child support and visitation is separate and that the two don&#8217;t inter-mingle, but that&#8217;s not the way that greedy parents look at it.  They look at it as though your love for your child directly relates to the amount child support you pay, which is the furthest from the truth.  They allow these greedy parents to continue to operate this way and never reprimand them for it and that&#8217;s why they continue to do it and get away with it.  However, there are deadbeats that don&#8217;t pay at all, even though they are ordered to, which directly relates to why fathers ultimately get shafted, unfortunately.  It is a catch 22 all the way around for the parent that makes even a minute amount more, my husband and his ex are literally $127 difference in what he makes a month compared to what she makes a month.<br>
SO, before I got all long-winded, which I apologize for, I was saying that you can&#8217;t lump ALL women in the manipulation and playing the systems category.  It simply isn&#8217;t true.  There are just as many manipulative women as there are deadbeat dads, unfortunately, it&#8217;s the ones that are actually doing the most for their children that get screwed because of those that mess up.</p>

																<p>@ Raul&#8230;..you are being completely repulsive to crankymommy and quite frankly very bittter. </p>
<p>Both situations apply to me here. </p>
<p>#1 &#8211; I am a second wife, my husband has two children from a previous marriage. I completely agree with crankymomm, I married my husband and his children. I am happy to help support these children through thick and thin. A second wife must always understand the situation that she is marrying into, and that&#8217;s that your husband has a responsibility to his children first and foremost. </p>
<p>#2 &#8211; In the last year my husband has become the sole legal and physical custodian for both children. This essentially means that now their mother has a financial responsibility to help support her children. She has yet to pay one cent, barely has any visitation time with them, and now we are 100% financially responsible. </p>
<p>Raul &#8211; I agree that often men seem to be mistreated both from not gaining custody to having to be more finanically responsible. However, in our home state whoever makes more money is more financially responsible for the care of the children. In our case that means my husband, whether he has custody of the children or not. However here is a concept&#8230;..he is happy to do it! They are his children! He cares more about them than being bitter about money related to taking care of them.</p>
<p>Over the past 9 years that means he and I have made many sacrifices, but that is what you do for your children! It&#8217;s not about manipulating a system! And if one parent works more than who is watching your children?! They need constant parenting and a healthy enviornment. If you want you kids and are capable as you indicate in your post, than go file for more custody! Prove to the courts that the children should be in your care because it is in their best interest. But really money should have nothing to do about what is in the best interest of your children.</p>
<p>Bottom line &#8211; think about who you are marrying and having children with! You both chose a divorce and therefore you are in this situation, stop playing the victim role and just be a great parent who provides emotionally and financially.</p>
<p>For the woman who posted this question originally and all other wife #2&#8217;s. Focus most on raising these children the best you can, enjoy the moments while they are here. Soon enough the children will grow up and move on. You won&#8217;t have to &#8220;pay for them forever&#8221;, focus most on their emotionally stability right now. In a few years you all can take more vacations and have more money. For now put your head down and focus on what&#8217;s really important, the children!</p>

																<p>Your statements may apply to some, but definitely not all.  Divorce is. 85% 1 sided. Both parents rarely agree to a divorce. 80% of the time the wife initiates the divorce.  Most states are no fault, and the wife goes down and applies for the divorce and be awarded custody over 90% of the time because she supposedly interacted with the children more because the husband is out working, busting his but to support the family he loves.  In my case my wife commits adultery, and files for divorce after I find out about it.  Was I mad? Yes!  Have I ever hit her? Never.  She files an injunction on me after I leave the state and gives a fake address where I live.  So the injunction becomes active on me. Through routine check my employer informs me and I go down to Florida to contest it. I&#8217;m granted a hearing and she goes to the courthouse and requests the injunction get dropped be caused it was based on a lie.  I&#8217;m paying her 62% of my income as child support and spousal support and we still aren&#8217;t even divorced.  I have a short every month of $400 and my lawyer could care less.  I&#8217;ve gone through 2 lawyers and they are no help because they take on more clients then they can handle screwing over fathers and their rights that are being violated.  My children?  I haven&#8217;t seen then for the last year becaus my wife has been alienating me with them.  They fear me, not because of anything I&#8217;ve done to them or her, but because of what my wife has done.  I have  no contact with them at all.  I love my children dearly. Through joint friends I have been told that in that year, my oldest has raped a 6 yo, 2nd oldest has been arrested 2 times for arsen, and 3rd oldest has been expelled from school for fighting.  I am heartbroken and cry every night because I am being denied access to my children.  My lawyer could care less just like the last one.  My wife is laughing at the state of Florida and I am devastated, going bankrupt and will lose my job because it requires a security clearance.  Financial problems will remove my clearance.  If I loose my job, I will not be able to afford to make my payments&#8230; I just learned that my oldest could be molesting my 2 younger children&#8230; My lawyer? Where are you and why are you not on my side?  Now I will be labeled as a deadbeat dad who doesn&#8217;t care enough about his children to make his child support payments&#8230; Cost to maintain children when we were happily married? $300.  Cost now? $1610.  Something isn&#8217;t right.</p>

Meanwhile the ex has the kid, doesn&#8217;t work because she&#8217;s living off the new fiance and in his home. I have no doubts how they paid for there two plus week trip to Europe last Summer!

																<p>My husband is going through the same. Ex wife cheated and left for more money, a ton more. Her new husband makes $200K a year and yet she still wants 65% of his income. He can&#8217;t even afford the gas in his car to get to work or his insulin (you know, to keep him alive.) She doesn&#8217;t work and has a new baby and another on the way. We just went to court and judge said that there&#8217;s no way she should have to count any income or take any financial responsibility for their three children because she&#8217;s pregnant. Did I mention that she also lied to the court and had his time reduced, no matter how much proof that he brought in. I am also a mother of three from my first marriage. I have NEVER, NEVER committed these acts or behavior to my ex and he is an inconsistent father as far as time is concerned but my kids love him. I have given back his CS at times when he was struggling financially. I choose my kids happiness and well being over money. Too bad more moms (who claim to be good mothers) don&#8217;t. Just because you stay home and make lunches doesn&#8217;t make you a good mother.</p>

																<p>Unfortunately, this is usually the case.  The ex-wife initiates the separation and the divorce and the ex-husband pays for it, even if she was the adulterer, SO STUPID.  Men, please stop marrying and having children with women who behave this way.  You are marrying actresses who manipulate their way into your bed and you get comfortable because she makes you feel like you are the supporter and she wants a family with a dog and picket fence.  Amazingly, she wants a family that is not living together.  So you get stuck with paying for their life thereafter with her new live in deadbeat boyfriend who has sex, but no financial responsibility to her or your children and you end up paying their  rent/mortgage, food, utilities and transportation, or all of the kids needs for up to 18 years, and the children suffers the most because they are now a &#8220;purchase agreement&#8221; and not a child reared in love.  The trashy mother doesn&#8217;t contribute to anything the child needs, she calls you.  Disgusting.  </p>
<p>You have been SUCKERED.  Find a woman who is fair, rational, honest, emotionally stable, and who has integrity BEFORE you get married.  Marriage changes two things, 1) How much alimony/money you&#8217;ll pay after the divorce 2) and her last name to yours for as long as she cares to have it.  Men, you are compromising your integrity and the rest of your life with a woman who could be the best thing that has ever happened to you, and all for a woman you thought was someone different. From a woman&#8217;s mouth, we don&#8217;t change after marriage and babies to be worse wives and mothers, we change to be better wives and mothers.  I feel sorry for your situation, however, the marriage and court systems need to change so that couples can live in harmony, without the  comfort of knowing that an ex-wife can sit at home, have sex with whomever she wants, ignore the children and receive payments from the ex.  I believe that in order to receive alimony or child support, a woman must maintain a certain income after the children are 4.  I also believe that child support and alimony should not be paid in cash. It should all be tracked on what is actually being used and where.  I also believe that the children should maintain a certain grade in school and have a certain acceptable behavior and upbringing for the custodial parent to remain the custodial parent and receive payments. I believe both parents need to contribute to the financial upbringing of the child, not necessarily 50/50, but when there is no investment, there is no value in the upbringing.</p>

																<p>As a Mother of 3 and a step-mother of 2, I am very familiar with both the struggles of being a single mother as well as the devastation of ridiculous CS. My question for you, crankymommy, is at what point did the commitment/obligation to care for the children become solely his? I ask this question honestly as a mother who financially supported my son solely on my own.  And did so proudly as that was the commitment that I MADE to my child. At some point you have to accept responsibility too and do what&#8217;s right because far too often it&#8217;s not &#8220;if only he didn&#8217;t have kids&#8221;&#8230;it&#8217;s &#8220;if only his ex shared the responsibility of supporting the child/ren that it took both of you to conceive&#8221; In many cases, CS is set ridiculously high as though it is a fine for a failed relationship. What&#8217;s that teaching your child/ren?<br>
 My advice to you:<br>
1. work to change your status from underemployed to gainful employment with benefits so that you can care for the child that you brought into this world.<br>
2. make a budget and stick to it.<br>
3. accept that BOTH parents are responsible for said child and his/her life will be much richer for it. Teaching them that every choice has a consequence and a strong work ethic will take you much farther than a handout!</p>

																<p>Bitterandcold, I agree with you completely! As someone who has lived on both sides, not receiving a dime in CS for my son to marrying a man who pays out the butt&#8230;the world is full of women who are always searching for greener pastures and act as though they have no financial responsibilities for the children that they brought into this world. To them I say&#8230;Get a Job, set an example, earn your child&#8217;s respect. STRUGGLE, then next time you find yourself tempted to betray a &#8220;GOOD&#8221; man you might just stop and reconsider.</p>

																<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more!! Most of us as single/divorced moms have had to work and also provide support for our children. I find it disgusting that the court is basically saying that husband and I (two income family) are responsible to contribute all my husbands wages (nearly) to a one income family by choice and completely absolve the mom&#8217;s responsibility to support her own children.</p>

																<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more! Child support laws are unrealistic and extremely biased against NCPs. My husband pays $300/week to his ex for their 10 year old, plus he provides medical insurance and pays 75% of all copays, daycare and other unreimbursed expenses. They alternate full weeks during the summer and school breaks and my husband has to pay the full support amount to her even when we have his son for those weeks.  So, we are providing food, clothing and entertainment, etc. at our house and at hers.  Now, his ex is taking him back to court again for an increase as she &#8220;can&#8217;t afford to provide for their child on the little she gets&#8221;. She is remarried, has a job making 50k/year and only has their child to support and they live in a small rural area. She kept the house and all it&#8217;s contents in the divorce. My husband and I have 2 children under 8. The laws say child support is meant to allow the child the lifestyle he/she would have enjoyed had the parents not divorced. This is unrealistic. I can understand a cost of living increase but why should she financially benefit from my husband&#8217;s hard work and him striving to better his life.  So, every time he works hard and gets a raise she can go back for more money? It&#8217;s basically punishment.  I would never condone him not supporting his son but child support should be based on the standard of living at the time of divorce as no one can say for sure that their career paths would have gone the way that they have had they stayed together. My husband will tell you for a fact that he would not be where he is professionally if they had stayed together. Who can say what kind of lifestyle the child would have enjoyed? So, basically my husband busts his hump working sometimes 80 hours per week and in the end she benefits. He went to school full-time and worked full-time to get his degree while supporting his family and she benefits. She isn&#8217;t the one who sacrificed for him to go out and better himself, yet she benefits. She is happy pushing buttons in a factory because my step-son makes about $1500/month. There is no accountability and a line needs to be drawn. But, instead, our state says &#8220;yup, you pay her more money because you have a child with her and those two little ones you have at home, they don&#8217;t count. In this state first children come first.&#8221; What about the rights and needs of our children? What about their lifestyle? It&#8217;s okay to decrease theirs or, at least, not increase it because his ex wants more money? My husband can work his tail off but they are not entitled to the same quality of life that their older brother is because he came first and daddy was married before? How fair is that? What about her accountability and responsibility.  There is absolutely no way that she cannot afford to provide for my step-son on less than she gets for CS.  Something needs to be done about this. If you go by federal guidelines as to how much it costs to raise a child in a certain area, according to the USDA it costs about $13112 to support my step-son annually based on the income of both parents and where they live. Why is that not taken into account?  Why is it just, we&#8217;re taking this percentage of your income so keep busting your butt to better your ex&#8217;s life, at least until he turns 21?  BTW, the ex-wife went to college about 6 years ago and was bragging about this new, higher paying job she was getting until her lawyer told her that her CS would decrease based on that salary so she actually turned down the job.  Do you think the court punished her for it?  Of course not!  Nothing like not thinking about bettering your own life instead of living off of someone else&#8217;s hard work and sacrifice.</p>

																<p>Careful with that. I filed for divorce, because my husband never did any kind of paperwork for the family&#8230;I always payed the bills and filed the taxes and got cars registered, too, during the marriage. But he was the one who left the house, and he was the one who wanted the divorce. I actively did not want it. And he does pay both child support and alimony, because we always prioritized his career over mine. It&#8217;s gonna take me a bit to get on my feet, because of choices we made together, to support his goals. There is more than one possible story.</p>

																<p>You are so right Richard. It&#8217;s funny how the amount to support the &#8220;kids&#8221; changes so dramaticlly once the parents are together anymore. It is not a man or woman&#8217;s place to support their ex once things are over.</p>

																<p>As a mother of 3 myself I COMPLETELY AGREE. I do receive child support for my 3 kids but I was completely reasonable and my ex thanks me almost weekly for being so reasonable. My boyfriend&#8217;s ex is the opposite. They have 50% custody, she lives in income housing paying $0 rent, gets food stamps, doesn&#8217;t claim her income on eBay AND STILL he&#8217;s supposed to pay her $300/month and pay for 2 kids to have insurance. Funny thing is, he lost his job and can&#8217;t do either, she will not allow him to claim even one kid for food stamps, she makes about $3,000+ a month and has like NO BILLS, and he makes $0. Ya she&#8217;s so concerned about the kids&#8217; well being by not letting him have food stamps to feed them while he has them 50% of the time. So guess who has to pick up the slack?! Ya me.. and I&#8217;m a low income family myself with 3 kids and now my kids get the SHAFT because NOBODY wants to take responsibility for these 2 kids, not even their own MOTHER.</p>

																<p>I agree with you, but you are much nicer about it than I am. My response would be, &#8220;oh well, you said it yourself, you knew it when you married him&#8221; Do you expect the children to go without because of you? I would continue to say that I have no sympathy for her, that it is what it is and stop bitching because I can guarantee that the mother and the children have it MUCH worse. That the mother scrapes and probably goes without so her kids should have things, well the husband should do the same!!! I would also say that she lives a good distance away, she hardly EVER has the kids so she does not pay for much most of the time and EVERY LITTLE THING adds up. And since this woman has no children, she has no clue about all those little things, all the birthday parties, class field trips, &#8220;designer&#8221; clothes that EVERYONE has, just going to the movies or going to get an ice cream or&#8230;&#8230;.. She has no clue!! I have no sympathy for these &#8220;second wives&#8221; I am sorry, they knew this when they signed up. Sorry!! Just my opinion. YOU did not sound harsh and I do not think I was that bad either because I could say so, so much more!! lol</p>

																<p>Kack &#8211; I have to disagree completely.  There are users/abusers of our legal system on both sides of this issue .. men and women .. custodial and non-custodial parents.  Pick from a long list of reasons why vengeful ex&#8217;s do it and go all the way down to some are simply that greedy.  On the other hand, there are plenty of &#8220;deadbeat&#8221; parents that seem to forget they have an obligation to help with their children once the divorce has settled and do everything they can to circumvent the process, regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on both sides of the issue myself.  I seldom saw child support for my two oldest children and had to struggle to make everything work out.  We all know how expensive it is to raise a child these days.  I had jobs I definitely would have preferred to avoid, from being a correctional officer in a maximum security prison and a second job at night at a chicken processing plant.  I also eventually joined the military so we could have some degree of security, financially and medically (we have a special needs child).   Right from the start though, I disagreed with what the court said it would be for child support.  It was over $1100.00 for two children.  It DOES NOT cost an additional $1100.00 to HELP support two children!  It didn&#8217;t cost half of that.  I did the paperwork to ask for a modification to reduce it to almost $300 per child.  Granted, I seldom saw that either, but it was a figure that allowed for me to put them in childcare while I worked as well, and do some of the things the kids enjoying doing.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the other side of things. My current husband is paying $600 a month for ONE child, in addition to providing health and dental insurance, and helping with extra activities.  While the child is continually told by his mother that they don&#8217;t have money for this or that (she almost makes more than my husband does without counting the child support), she is out at bars, shopping for herself, getting tattoos and surgically inserted piercings.  She blows money like it grows on trees and then comes around with sob stories about her utilities going to be cut off.  Meanwhile, we continually tell our children we have to save in order to go to the movies, or the shoes that teens think they must have will have to wait until a birthday or something along those lines.  They are needing braces, and we haven&#8217;t been able to afford that for them, either.  Do the children in those situations also just have to &#8220;suck it up&#8221; as you say the wives should?</p>

																<p>DISAGREE. My husband and I have 3 children together; &#8220;Our&#8221; children go without because of the ridiculous amount of child support he has to pay his ex wife for 1 child. We both work, pay for childcare, and I go to school as well. We are suffering and get no assistance at all. While the ex-wife gets child support from three different men, welfare, foodstamps, free healthcare, and commits IRS fraud by having someone else claim her kids so she can get more money. I agree that he has an obligation to &#8220;help&#8221; support them but, hello? Our children matter too and they deserve that support as well. They don&#8217;t see much of their father because he is always working. He works so hard to not even be able to afford to help raise our children, provide for them financially, or feed himself while working.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m response to cranky mommy, I am the &#8220;second wife&#8221;. In response to your  comments.<br>
1. I agree, any resentment I have only hurts me,  but also my relationship with my husband.<br>
2. We have a tight budget.<br>
3. There might be something I am missing but in 90 percent of the situations where we incur an increase in the monthly child support is when the mother of my husband&#8217;s daughter decides they will live in the most expensive suburb in the state and things are needed such as private sailing, painting and golf lessons.  We pay half of an absurd amount without the option to give input, we just pay half of whatever and say thank , can I have another.  In addition we pay half of all dr and dentist which in this case the mother takes her to have a brain scan for a mild headache. </p>
<p>This is ridiculous and puts a huge strain on us, on purpose I believe. The bitterness stems from her and they obviously &#8220;use&#8221; my step- daughter to hurt each other. Sad.</p>

																<p>Well said&#8230;tired of hearing how hard it is for the new wives&#8230;half you probably made the situation what it is &#8230;about 60% of the new wives were the reason that father is no longer in the home ..I&#8217;m not saying all but remember when you marry and you&#8217;re the second wife your only getting half the story and if you were the reason he left you probably wanted what they had together. . Simply put&#8230;now to be very clear a child needs a roof over their heads food to eat clothes to wear childcare transportation medical care medication and most importantly quality time and equal time with both parents not to mention who has to take days without pay when the child is hospitalized or sick at home because sitters or childcare facilities don&#8217;t allow sick children to attend and that&#8217;s just for boys add to that for pads pain relievers bras and grooming products if you have females so do the math cause last time I check no prices on any of those things listed have decreased. .so for all them second wives unless it&#8217;s your child you really have nothing to say&#8230;because if if it were your child or children I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d do the same to assure your child has everything he or she needs..</p>

She made a decision to have a child, the father&#8217;s do not get the right to choose whether to keep a child or give it up for abortion, they don&#8217;t get a choice on taking birth control. That&#8217;s what the woman gets to choose. So if the woman gets to make the final choice on keeping a baby, she should also realize that babies are expensive, they should not equal a payday. It&#8217;s not right that the man is left absolutely broke while the woman gets away with having her rent paid for her. And I speak as a woman, with a child. My ex is gracious enough to give me 1/4 of what the courts would deem fair due to income, but he spends time with our daughter, treats her well and loves her. I have never taken him to court or talked to a lawyer because it was my choice to have a child, therefore that child is my responsibility on my days with her come what may. The entitlement among women that are okay seeing someone they once loved scrape the bottom of the barrel to be able to make a rent payment or buy food to support their family is absolutely disgusting.</p>

																<p>pre-nup man, most states have predetermined figures for the courts to use for child support, so an pre-nup that is less than that is likely to be thrown out. Also zero for spousal support won&#8217;t fly if you asked your wife to stay home, be a homemaker, and care for the children full time. She will be given, and be entitled to support while she reestablishes her ability to support herself. If you accustomed your wife to a certain lifestyle, you are likely to find divorce will not eliminate your responsibility to provide that lifestyle. The longer the marriage, the longer she will be allowed to maintain that lifestyle.  As for a divorce on paper, there is no such thing, they are either married or divorced, if she wishes to remain married, and not just live with her husband, then separating her assets is the best she can do at this point. It also might make it easier for her to accept his responsibilities if she remembers that the ex-wife is only getting the spousal support, the child support portion, while the check may be made out to her, is for the children, and must spent on their care. Marriage is a partnership, and involves legal complications for both parties, it is best to do your financial planning prior to the wedding. I am a big fan of pre-nups, I think a woman is more likely to get a good deal when negotiating with a man who loves her, and she can learn a lot about his character in the negotiating process.</p>

																<p>Tea, all great points.  Just to clarify, divorce on paper just means to go through the divorce, but still live together, etc.  Just a forced separation of assets in the governments eyes.  Like you, I&#8217;m a big fan of prenups (in case you couldn&#8217;t tell by my handle)</p>

																<p>&#8220;I knew when I married him I’d be taking a financial hit, and I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>His children didn&#8217;t appear out of nowhere. You KNEW what you were getting in to.  You made an adult decision to marry someone with previous financial obligations.  Period.  They are his CHILDREN &#8211; not some ridiculous time-share or a sports car he is paying for. </p>
<p>The upside is, it isn&#8217;t forever.  The court ordered financial obligation has a stop date. Suck it up and plan for that future.  There are cash job opportunities out there that can offset this financially lean time in your life. Babysitting (though you don&#8217;t sound like much of a fan of children) or something like picking up lawn mowing jobs.  Get a roommate if you have extra space. Things of that nature can help a person survive.  I know, I&#8217;ve been on BOTH sides of the fence.  I am a single mother and always worked two jobs. Sometimes three.  I&#8217;ve had to have roommmates as well.  You just have to accept what is and deal with it. </p>
<p>Besides, how much respect could you have for the man you married if he were a deadbeat dad?</p>

																<p>Yes, they&#8217;re his children, but somehow, magically, the ex-wife has to spend 3-4 times what they used to spend on the children?  Why is it that the state can come up with an arbitrary percentage?  Perhaps it&#8217;s the financial incentive from the federal government for maximizing child support orders?</p>

																<p>What about when the mom stays home and lives off her husband&#8217;s substantial salary continues to have kids, already has a welfare fraud conviction, left us holding the $10K bill for something she ran up and they caught my husband because of course he&#8217;s the only one who works. And yet we pay for her plastic surgeries, fancy cars, constant vacations and she cries about how she can&#8217;t make it. They can afford all these things and their rent is $700 MORE than our mortgage. We are trying to make ends meet and catch up on payments from when he wasn&#8217;t working.

																<p>I would go back to court and get a modification of the order, it seems too high. I work for the State of FL in Child Support Enforcement and the highest judgement in ANY case can only be 55% of the non custodial parents (NCP) income only &#8211; and thats if there are multiple custodial parents and families taking from the NCP income. Usually for one family the max is about 35% of income. It would help if he could change ownership of any large assets out of his name so he could bring down his net worth too.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m a family law lawyer in my state, and there&#8217;s a few things that can be done- 1) have your husband ask for a support modification. It can be reduced based on the needs of the parents and the child, reduced because a child is no longer in daycare, etc. The purpose of child support is to keep the lives of the children as financially equal as possible between the two households. 2) The only time 60% is taken out of someone&#8217;s income is when there is back support owed. Have your husband get caught up on any back amounts and then ask for the modification again. Or, if he can&#8217;t pay the back support, have him ask the court for a payment plan. 3) Most states adopted a new &#8220;cap&#8221; on support amounts being taken out (to 50%).See if that&#8217;s true in your state and (guess what) ask for a modification. 4) Look over your state&#8217;s child support formula. Every state is required to have one. The formula will define what is and what is not income. For example, in my state, only the parent&#8217;s income is considered for support&#8211; not the new spouse&#8217;s income. 5) See what the spousal support amount is in comparison to the child support amount- I bet he&#8217;s paying WAY more in spousal support than in child support. See what her &#8220;income&#8221; was set at, and ask for an adjustment. Has she gone to school/made herself more marketable? Can she work a job at minimum wage but is choosing not to (the court can impute an income for her)? 6) Steer clear of under the table earnings like J. says- it can only lead to an increase in the support amount AND possible jail time (you&#8217;re lying on court documents- that&#8217;s perjury/ hiding assets. That&#8217;s a contemptable charge, looking at a fine and/or jail time. 7) Every state has forms that a court participant can complete, asking for a waiver of fees. If he has to pay court fees every time he goes to court (which is odd in itself- usually only the person bringing the motion has to pay), he can ask that the fee be waived. 8) He needs to keep in perspective that the money is for his KIDS. He&#8217;s helping to make their lives better (ballet lessons, piano, etc). It shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that kids are expensive. The Wall Street Journal estimated in 2008 that it would cost $222,360 to raise ONE child born that year, up through the child&#8217;s age of majority. Putting your husband&#8217;s support amount into perspective&#8230; I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s not even paying *half* that amount. </p>
<p>And, prenups can be invalidated if the court sees that the support amounts you agreed upon for the children is unfair. If the prenup was signed 6 years prior to the dissolution of the marriage, and the circumstances of the parties have changed, the court can easily change the support amount. Prenups are used more for property and financial splitting- not for setting child support amounts.</p>

																<p>My husband is not in arrears and has never been.  Keep in mind, it&#8217;s 60% of his take home pay&#8230; not his gross. All incomes for both parties are current &#8211; we just revisited child support last month.  It&#8217;s the &#8220;extraordinary expenses&#8221; that are making the amount so great. If all of the &#8220;expenses&#8221; weren&#8217;t calculated in there.. the support would be about 35%.</p>
<p>If the two of them were still married, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to afford all of those expenses! It suprises me that the court considered so many things an &#8220;extraoridinary expense&#8221;</p>

																<p>I feel the agony of being married to someone who pays child support. It&#8217;s a hassle. The ex is constantly taking us back to court even when he&#8217;s at the same job. We constantly have the kids and they are taking out 48.9% for 4 kids and then the rest in taxes and still owes another 200 each month. He barely make over 1200 a month. I have a disabled child as well as a newborn with him and I feel as though I shouldn&#8217;t have to take up the slack by working two jobs because he has to pay her child support. I didn&#8217;t have the kids why is there not something in place for the moms who end up marrying and man who has to pay child support?? We shouldn&#8217;t have to choose to struggle with finances to be with someone who makes us happy. Especially if the divorce was the ex&#8217;s fault due to adultery. He didn&#8217;t choose to leave his kids. She just refused to let him have them and her family is loaded and can constantly pay for everything from her house to car to food clothes etc and she works while we struggle to make ends meet. It&#8217;s not fair to him and the children aren&#8217;t being taken care of by her. We buy them clothes and hair cuts and school stuff. While she goes out partying and drinking with her soon to be husband that is on his 4th dwi. Is there nothing he can do??</p>

																<p>Well first let me say that I am a father of 5 by the same woman. I never cheated always faithful and always home. I love my children with all my heart and would spend the last dime if I had to. With that said I have to explain that Cs is totally unfair and is extremely aggressive towards the father. Both me and my ex are military she has 21 of service and I have 16. Reason for that is when my son was born in decided to get out and take care of our son and let her stay in.4yrs later I decided to go back in to the service. Years later we are divorced in Hawaii. Side note never come to this place they take 70% gross income. Anyways the military pays additional money if you are married or have kids. You get extra money  if you decide to live off base. Who ever is the highest ranking get the most money and the other gets partial. She out ranks me so she gets more money for rank and time in service plus other entitlments and she lives on base. This means the military  keeps the money they normal gives you for rent.the add plus to this is you don&#8217;t pay utilities except cable. The other parent me. Can not live on base because only one of us can claim the kids so I am forced to live of base. Now remember I have to pay 70% of my Income plus rent, utilities, gas/ auto repairs, food for the kids when the visit, cloths, and any other items needed to survive. Now you may so well you have to pay daycare well her sister lives with her since we had our first born he is now 13. That&#8217;s another  story in its self. The point is here  if my money true is spent  for the kids then the kids should not sleep on the floor and wear other people clothes while she and her sister spends the child support money,</p>

																<p>Can I just say I don&#8217;t think divorcing, even on paper, is a good idea. It puts other rights and privileges at risk, like hospital visitation and medical decisions should something happen, inheritance if there is no will, and other things. Is losing out on those, something that I would consider to be invaluable (such as seeing your spouse in the hospital) worth a &#8220;paper&#8221; divorce? Because once you&#8217;re divorced on paper, you lose the rights that come with that piece of paper to.</p>

																<p>Yes, if they were still married they could not afford those expenses. But they are not still married. There are now 4 adults who can help pay for their expenses. His children are benefiting from that situation. It is his children who are benefiting, not his ex-wife. I would suggest trying to build a better relationship with his ex-wife, so that you can decide together what activities you can and cannot afford to provide. If you can decide together, you can avoid lawyers and court fees. Also, keep in mind that when child support ends, is obligation to his children does not. there will most likely be college and other expenses. So keep that in mind for your long term financial planning.</p>

																<p>I married a man who had three children (I have none by choice).  At the beginning, he was bringing home about $1900 a month and $900 a month went to child support.  Out of the $1,000 left, he had to pay car ins., gas, food, rent, a loan repayment to friends (500), basically, everything.  The ony reason his expenses for living were so low was because I had a very small condo. Otherwise, he would have had to move in with this mom, as $1,000 a month wouldn&#8217;t have been able to support him.  It got easier as the kids aged out of child support (2005, 2007 and 2009) and now we are in catching up mode with saving, retirement, etc.  </p>
<p>I knew full well what I was doing at the time but the funny thing is that I thought it would be OVER when they were 18!!  The joke was definitely on me.  I reasoned that ok, I had to suck it up all those years doing without part of his paycheck, now I wanted the whole thing for our joint goals.  Well, we had to figure out a way he could help his now older kids without me getting my panties in a wad.  (A generous weekly allowance did the trick &#8211; he gives part of his to his two college age kids &#8211; I save mine for travel &#8211; a cruise in June with my sister and a trip to Germany to see friends in October).  I&#8217;m happy with that arrangement but it&#8217;s weird to see that his &#8220;personal&#8221; account has like $300 in it and mine has about $2,000.  Everyone knows that kids are expensive and really, it never ends.  Even when they are adults.</p>

																<p>It becomes vengeful on the part of the ex when she is getting so much of your income that she is living high on the hog, going out to eat every night, and buying new cars, a new house (which her dad ended up paying for in full for her), plus going on vacations with friends&#8230;all the while the other parent is so strapped that their house they actually worked hard for is going into foreclosure, they are rationing out milk to their kids that live with them full time, and they literally have no extra money for the child shared in the first marriage divorce to enjoy any standard of living when he is at his father&#8217;s house.  My husband was already paying towards a college fund, splitting EVERY cost, giving his ex extra money (though a court order said his child support was $0, due to making virtually the same amount of money and having 50/50 joint and physical custody). My husband only had to put into a 529 account each month that he and his ex agreed on and had put in the court order, but he went over and above, because he loves his son and takes full responsibility for his child and is involved as much as he possibly can be. He is definitely not a deadbeat, but his ex wife is vengeful.  Does that explain the correlation between vengeance and child support?  And, yes, I am the stepmom.  I do have a lot of resentment as we are rationing milk out to our kids down now to one glass a day, but the situation has been explained to my stepson as he is 9 years old and wondering why we can&#8217;t even go to a movie at all or why he can&#8217;t have a glass of milk at lunch AND supper.  My resentment is definitely towards my husband&#8217;s ex, but it would be silly and a lie to say that any of the kids don&#8217;t see frustration when it comes to money and how the heck we are going to pay school lunches for my 16 year old Autistic son.  I am just the stepmom, but I lowered my own ex&#8217;s child support from $750 to $250, because that&#8217;s what he could truly afford without losing his home and vehicle.  I also treat my stepson like he is my own.  He is no different than my own kids, he is not above or below them because they are biological to me and he isn&#8217;t.  He is still a child and he is my husband&#8217;s son.  It would be shameful if it were any other way as it&#8217;s not the children&#8217;s faults when their parents can&#8217;t stay together for whatever reason.  And, it is not my place to punish a child, just because he is from my husband&#8217;s previous wife.  Again, it is greedy parents that get more than enough child support, whether it&#8217;s ordered or not, and then go for more just to punish their ex as much as possible for their marriage or relationship not working out.  Financial responsibility crosses over to vengeance when one of the parents is greedy.</p>

																<p>No kids or ex-spouse, but these are my random thoughts for what they&#8217;re worth.</p>
<p>1. His income makes a difference.  I would think the judge is basing the amount on the children&#8217;s requirements, not so much the father&#8217;s income.  So logically, if he increases his income, then he should be able to keep more money.  60% of $1000/month is $600.  $600 from $2000 a month would only be 30%.</p>
<p>2. The child support payments are not tax deductible and the mother most likely gets to claim them for tax purposes.  Hopefully the agreement takes this into account.</p>
<p>3. Hopefully the agreement only covers support through high school and age 18.  If college support is required, I think I might turn into a dead-beat dad after they graduated from HS.  JMHO.</p>

																<p>Robert,<br>
 The support amount is based on an income shares model. For EXAMPLE, Mother makes $3000, father makes $3000. (Before tax deductions) Combined income is $6000. Court documents say 2 children at $6000 cost $2500. There&#8217;s a chart for this.</p>
<p>Husband&#8217;s income is 50% of $6000 so he pays 50% of the $2500. He pays $1,250. Add 50/50 split on cost of medical insurance, ballet lessons, tap lessons, art lessons, day care, etc &#8212; you&#8217;re looking at $1800/mo. These are considered &#8220;Extraordinary expenses&#8221; and are in addition to the monthly child support.  This leave father with $1200 BEFORE taxes and health insurance deductions. I think if incomes were calculated on post-tax numbers, things would be easier all around.</p>
<p> If he increases his income, the combined income increases which increases the total child care cost.  His percentage of the total increases and increases the support. He wouldn&#8217;t see much of an increase in what HE actually sees unless he were to get a  HUGE pay raise.</p>
<p>Child support is non-taxable income for the custodial parent. The non-custodial parent has already paid the taxes. The custodial parent, more often than not, gets all tax benefits that come with having children. I don&#8217;t know much about those except that they are substantial benefits.</p>
<p>But, the purpose of my questions was to see how others are coping with this and planning for their futures &#8211; not to take jabs at the ex-wife or complain about my husband having to support his children. I&#8217;m honored to be their step-mother and will do whatever it takes to be sure they are taken care of. They are my family. When I married my husband, they were the best wedding gift I received! I hate that we can&#8217;t afford to provide all the extras for them when they are with us like they are able to receive when they are with their mother! They can&#8217;t understand that my husband does provide for them financially. They just see that dad has a tiny apartment and we never get to do anything fun like with mom. No fun.  It breaks my heart to see my husband struggle with this.</p>
<p>Support does end after high school. Of course, we&#8217;ll help with college expenses, etc. But payments to the ex end when child is out of HS.</p>

																<p>Amy,<br>
 Do you think that you and your husband will be able to &#8220;catch up&#8221; after all of those years? Are you seeing light at the end of the tunnel?</p>
<p>Thanks for the reminder about it never ending, even when they&#8217;re adults (College, etc.). It&#8217;s definitely something to ponder. Maybe it&#8217;s worth ME setting some of MY money aside for that now to avoid financial problems after the CS ends so that we&#8217;ll be able to play catch up!</p>

																<p>Prenups rarely apply to custody/child-support issues.   Any kid-related clause will easily get tossed in court.  It&#8217;s all judge&#8217;s discretion.</p>
<p>That said, get a better attorney.  60% is too much.  I would be willing to bet around half is alimony, which is crap in my book.  Unless the supported spouse was unemployed during the vast majority of the marriage, she can go back to work like everyone else.</p>

																<p>I haven&#8217;t read all the comments, so I may or may not be duplicating what&#8217;s been said already but first of all&#8230;</p>
<p>ODDS are, the current wife&#8217;s income is NOT being taken into consideration. Mine never has been. (This can and does vary by state) This also means that odds are that the ex-wife&#8217;s new spouse (if she has one, his income isn&#8217;t being taken into consideration either).</p>
<p>60% IS a lot &#8211; and it can vary by state. In MI, I believe the limit is 50% &#8211; a noncustodial parent has GOT to live on something.</p>
<p>I would look up the state&#8217;s support guidelines. I find it pretty interesting that the custodial parent is able to go back to court for extra funds for extra-curriculars. The fact of the matter is &#8211; child support is for the care of the child. It is to ensure the kiddos&#8217; needs are being met &#8211; food, clothing, shelter, the basics. </p>
<p>The extras? They&#8217;re just that. Extras. And IMO, they should not be dictated by the court. If you want your kid to play t-ball (random example), I think that is between the parents (and frankly, am surprised that the judge/referee/caseworker of this system isn&#8217;t frustrated by the constant appearances for more money&#8230; In MI, unless there&#8217;s a drastic change of circumstances &#8211; parent loses their job, parent starts making a lot more $, etc&#8230; &#8211; there&#8217;s a limit to just how often yo ucan ask for a modification).</p>
<p>We have actually stopped using any legal representation for child support stuff (thus eliminating legal fees and resentment) when it comes to most routine c/s matters re: my stepson because frankly, spending more money to lose more money just amps up the resentment (And honestly, giving a chunk of your income away each week can cause resentment enough on its own even when you know it&#8217;s really for the child).</p>
<p>Most states &#8211; yeah, that&#8217;s generic &#8211; have a table set up that shows mom&#8217;s income and dad&#8217;s income and what the support should be for those numbers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t advise going into arrears, though. If the support decree doesn&#8217;t already state it, I&#8217;d have your husband ask if he can claim his children on his taxes &#8211; if not every year than alternating years. No, it doesn&#8217;t fix everything, but it does help the financial burden on those years.</p>
<p>I would limit the extracurriculars though &#8211; i find it hard to believe he is LEGALLY obligated to contribute to those activities. Have each child pick an activity and contribute to those things if you CHOOSE to help (if it&#8217;s not legally required) &#8211; keeping a roof over your own head and feeling financially secure has to take precedence over those activities&#8230; even if it&#8217;s a bummer for the kids.</p>

																<p>prenups are a legal binding document between the two parties; just as a contract is.  IF it is written in a way that has no &#8220;wiggle room&#8221; and everything is stipulated, by law, the judge cannot throw it out.  He has no grounds to void a legal document that the two parties agreed upon.  Just ask any union rep.</p>

																<p>From the numbers you put forward, it would appear that the child support is going to support his children. The payments are to the children, not the ex-wife. Her name may be on the check because she manages the children’s expenses, but they are payments to the children. Yes, you will stop mailing the check to his wife when they are 18, but you will probably still be paying for their health insurance. Day Care and dance lessons will be replaced with tuition and car insurance. And once you finish those expenses, there will be weddings, then grandchildren. I think for long term financial planning, I would count on 60% of his income going to his kids for the rest of his life. If it turns out they need less, then great you will have extra money. As for your living situation, I think honesty is best with kids. It doesn’t hurt for them to know you make less than their step father does, so no you can’t afford the kind of home they have. But there are plenty of fun things to do that don’t cost money. And the best gift you could give those kids is to teach them that life can be good without spending a lot of money.</p>

																<p>Thank you for the suggestion, Tea. </p>
<p>The only part of CS that I have a problem with is that my husband doesn&#8217;t have a say in what &#8220;extras&#8221; HE can afford. Just because she and her new husband can afford to pay it, doesn&#8217;t me that we can? But this a flaw in the court system and not really a &#8220;financial&#8221; question. </p>
<p> I hope everyone understands I&#8217;m not angry about my husband supporting his children, I&#8217;m not angry that the check goes to his ex-wife and I&#8217;m not looking for loopholes to get out of paying! I just wanted advice from others who are coping with this.</p>

																<p>We&#8217;d love to have them half the time. The ex wife moved out of the state with her new husband and lives 9 hours away so it&#8217;s not feasible. They moved to a very rural part of the country so moving there would be very difficult as far as finding employment. Plus, we can&#8217;t follow them around the country. They&#8217;ve moved a few times to different states.</p>
<p>Crankymommy,<br>
 I agree with you and have begged for that! If only it were that simple between the two of them! They can&#8217;t even stand in a room together. It&#8217;s tough on the kids I&#8217;m sure and it&#8217;s a shame but out of my control.</p>

																<p>I am confused when people say the parents have to take care of their children after 18 y/o (tuition, car insurance, grandkids, etc). I know plenty of people (myself included) who were pretty much &#8220;kicked out&#8221; of the house at 18 and had to pay for their own college, rent, car, expenses, trips to Europe, etc. Are divorced parents not allowed to &#8220;kick out&#8221; their kids at 18? And what about the grandchildren? I think grandparents don&#8217;t &#8220;have to&#8221; help pay for those, only for the things they &#8220;want&#8221; to pay, whatever those might be (toys, lessons, whatever). </p>
<p>Not that I have a bad relationship with my parents, we are great! I think they taught me a lot about growing up and taking care of myself by doing this. And if I am in a tight spot, they help out but I&#8217;m still on my own to make ends meet, isn&#8217;t that what being an adult is about?</p>

																<p>M.L. I was not suggesting that you don&#8217;t love his kids, I just think you will be a lot happier if you think of the money going to his kids. It may seem unfair that his kids are taking 60% of his income.  But if you make your financial decisions based on that continuing, you won&#8217;t find yourself in a situation you can&#8217;t handle. If you decide to have a child or buy home, only 40% income may be all he will ever be able to give you. Hopefully at some point it will be more, but you don&#8217;t want to make life changing decisions on money you may never have.</p>

																<p>Honestly, I think that the two of you should consider moving closer to the ex-wife and kids.  If he was taking them every weekend AND long vacations AND summers, not only would the child support probably decrease, but he&#8217;d be a better father.  </p>
<p>If either of you are unwilling to make that move, than I think you should suck it up and deal with not having the money.  The time sacrifice you make for his children is only two months out of the year.  You can spend that extra time that would be spent helping with homework, settling sibling disputes, driving to lessons, providing guidance, enforcing discipline, etc, finding ways to be more frugal with your money.</p>

																<p>I am a stepmom myself, so I understand how it feels to be pulled in two different directions. On one hand you want the best life for that kid because you love them and want them to be happy and well-cared for. On the other hand you don&#8217;t want to be destitute yourself, working like crazy to be broke. It&#8217;s tough to feel both those things at once. You mentioned that you aren&#8217;t interested in having a child of your own right now, with a good part of that decision being based on not being able to afford it. Keep in mind that if you and your husband have a child, that child then becomes part of the equation and you can request a modification based on the fact that he now has three children to support. Because he is just as responsible for providing for that third child, the amount of support going for the other two should be reduced accordingly to allow adequate resources for the third. At least that&#8217;s how it is in my state. Your should be able to get a better idea with some research (in my state, the formuals and everything are readily available online and this concept is called a Qualified Additional Dependent). If you still don&#8217;t want to have a child that&#8217;s fine, just don&#8217;t make that decision for the wrong reasons or you may end up regretting it.</p>
<p>As for budgeting, I recommend you completely forget what he &#8220;makes&#8221; on paper and plany using only that leftover amount coming in. Combine that with yours and then decide how much should be going into retirement accounts (for both of you, because if you are planning to stay together your fates will be intertwined even into retirement), how much you can afford for rent, etc. You may find that your lifestyle is more expensive than you can actually afford which means trading down where you live or selling off the car with a payment and buying an older car for cash&#8230;basic frugality and debt-snowball type stuff.</p>
<p>Finally, I would recommend that you reconsider moving closer to the kids (therefore getting more time with them and paying less support money). While the salaries are smaller in a rural area, so is the cost of living so it may not be that much of a net change. As a child of divorced parents I can tell you that face time with the noncustodial parent is so important to the parent-child relationship. You are all missing out on some great stuff by being so far away. If you move there and then the ex picks up to leave you may be able to get the court to give you primary custody since you could provide a more stable home and you made the effort to be close. This depends on the laws of the state and sounds a lot easier than it is, but it&#8217;s a possibility.</p>
<p>Anyhow, wishing you the best of luck. It sounds like you are making the best of a challenging situation and just looking for ways to make things better for everyone.</p>

																<p>As a single mom who has my child roughly 85% of the time and does not regularly receive child support, this is probably going to sound strange coming from me, but I can understand your frustration.  I of course want my child to have the best of everything, but that&#8217;s just it.  I want him to have it, but it&#8217;s not a necessity.  He will be completely fine if he only plays one sport and not three.  He does not have to attend every extracurricular activity that is thrown his way.  Personally, I think children involved in too much are stretched way too thin.  Sometimes they just need to be kids and have fun.  Anyway, my point is to check into your state&#8217;s laws.  Not all states take extraordinary expenses into account when calculating child support.  I know mine doesn&#8217;t.  It does consider things like daycare costs, but not discretionary extracurricular activities such as dancing lessons or sports lessons.  My best suggestion is to find a really good family law attorney.  It may cost you more upfront, but the money you may possibly be able to save in the long run could be worth it. And I do not think that this in any way diminishes your or your husband&#8217;s love for the children.  Of course you want what&#8217;s best for them.  But you also have to survive and should not have to struggle because of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; items that the ex can afford but you can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Jennifer,<br>
 My husband is the best father that he is able to be. As I stated before, the new wife&#8217;s husband moves frequently with his job from state to state. He works in the oil business. We are unable to follow them around the country. Their current home is in a very rural part of the country, there&#8217;s no way we can afford to quit jobs, job search in a difficult market (esp in that area!)  and not get behind with CS and other bills just to have to move again in a year or two. Impossible. We get the children one weekend a month, long vacations and the summer.</p>

																<p>Confused Reader &#8211;</p>
<p>Whether or not a divorced parent can &#8220;kick out&#8221; an 18 year old child might depend on the agreement made when the divorced and child support were finalized. In my case, my divorced parents were each obligated to pay 1/3 the cost of tuition at an in-state university. So 1/3 from Mom, 1/3 from Dad, and then I was responsible for the last 1/3. If I had decided to go to a private, more expensive college then I would have also been responsible for the additional tuition costs. Some child support arrangements specify that support continues until the child reaches the age of majority (18), then some other financial support kicks in for a few years provided the child is enrolled at a qualified educational institution.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m curious about the extraordinary expenses.. correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but it looks like almost $600 a month is just for extras like lessons and sports, etc?  It just seems excessive to me.  We just finished paying child support last summer and hubby and I have two children and there is no way any &#8220;extras&#8221; have ever cost us that much, even when paying child support.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on what the judgement states and what state you are living (actually the child lives)?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m completely in agreement that the children shouldn&#8217;t suffer, but niether should the noncustodial parent.</p>

																<p>That is very sad.  I don&#8217;t think there should be child support laws at all.  Parents should support their children.  I don&#8217;t have any advice, because I don&#8217;t know a good solution, but it&#8217;s an option to seek full custody.  The custodial parent is the one actually supporting the children; child support payments have little to do with the child.  It&#8217;s a punishment payment levied on the non-custodial parent using the child as a weapon of extortion.  If there&#8217;s a way to keep the law out of the situation, that is the only way there can be any winners.  Children cannot win when their very existence makes a living hell out of the life of a parent, and it makes love &#8211; which is what everything good is all about &#8211; secondary.</p>

																<p>My first suggestion is get a new lawyer. Find the meanest, ugliest shark you can because the one you have is gettin&#8217; their butt kicked. I would look for a lawyer that got angry WITH me about the injustice of the matter. Until I found that I would keep shopping. Pay the fees, because it is going to be worth it in the long run.<br>
Second, find out what the child support garnishment laws are in your State. In California for example, child support is only allowed to take 50% of net income, which will get 10% of it back into your pocket.<br>
Another thing to do is make sure that your husband&#8217;s withholding is correct to claim the children that he is allowed to claim, via court documents. A lot of people forget about this, but a child tax credit is $1000 per child, which could help throughout the year. If his W4 is adjusted to reflect that then he will have more money in his checks. YOU DON&#8217;T WANT A TAX REFUND! Child support will just take it from you if you get a tax refund because of the 10% that isn&#8217;t being collected.<br>
I&#8217;m not saying that you shouldn&#8217;t pay the full 60% of child support due, but I do see that your family CAN&#8217;T pay that amount. It&#8217;s too much. If you had the money I would say do what your obligation is.</p>

																<p>Hubs should be allowed to claim the tax deductions for the kids. I&#8217;m not sure I have any advice for coping, because as some have already pointed out, it does continue on past age 18 (my stepson flunked out of college and is living less than paycheck to paycheck with mom paying most of his bills, but managing to guilt dad into an average of $400 a month.) Someday it will be over, but there has to be something legally he can do. You need a better lawyer&#8230;</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m a single mom, my kids are with me 100% of the time and after going back to court, I&#8217;ve just recently begun receiveing child support again. My ex has never been required to pay for any extra curricular activities. Yes, they are good for the kids, but it&#8217;s my choice to allow them to participate. I would love help with tutors, dance, sports, etc., but I&#8217;m not going to get it and frankly, have never heard of this. (Probably since the laws vary from state to state.) I do want to say thank you. I know this is difficult for you guys and I think what you&#8217;re paying is excessive, but I appreciate so much that your husband IS paying. Too often, that&#8217;s not the case.</p>

																<p>Wow! My heart goes out to you and your situation! I can relate from both sides of the fence &#8211; I receive CS for my oldest son and my husband pays out CS for his oldest daughter.  Fortunately, we&#8217;ve not had to experience what you are going through.  My original court order is from Texas (which is very strict on CS) and I&#8217;ve received the same amount each month for the past 10 years &#8211; even though my ex has changed jobs and pay grades &#8211; because I chose not to press the issue because ultimately as the primary parent it is my responsibility to provide the majority of the support for my son.  The child support is to help supplement some of the expenses &#8211; but not ALL of them. There is no asking his father for funds for extracurricular activities &#8211; I choose to put my son in those activities and I make it work with the budget I have with my income and the monthly CS I receive.  The only &#8220;additional&#8221; money that I receive from his father is 50% of all his medical expenses &#8211; which is pretty standard. Both sets of parents have families to support and it&#8217;s not fair to anyone involved to make the other live paycheck-to-paycheck.</p>
<p>Is it part of the court order that he has to pay CS and ALSO send extra money for extra-curricular activities? It sounds as though that is double paying&#8230; The child support is just that &#8211; support for the child and up to the parent receiving the funds to determine where it needs to be spent.</p>
<p>I would definitely take the advice of others and check into the laws of the state that the order is for and see what the percentages are and what the funds are supposed to go to.  Also, ask for a modification.  I have seen instances where the income of both parents was taken into consideration in extreme hardship.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you all!</p>

																<p>This hits too close to home.  My husband had 2 children when I married him and my life was at the whim of his ex until they went to college.  My income was included in the determination of child support, so I think this issue is dependent on the state you live in.  I&#8217;m in California.    Courts use a chart in determining child support.  Unfortunately there is nothing you can really do.  Maybe you should get pregnant and when the baby is born have your husband quit his job to become a stay at home dad!  No income. . . I&#8217;d get advice from an attorney.</p>
<p>Although my husband and I have survived all this mess and are in a great place, I would advise anyone considering a relationship with someone who has kids to run the other way.  It ruins more marriages than make it.  Sad but true.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

																<p>I have never thought that child support extends beyond 18 years of age. It seems unfair to the divorced-parents to have to support the child after they turn 18, while still-married parents get to make decisions like that for themselves. I&#8217;m not saying parents shouldn&#8217;t take care of their kids after they turn 18 IF THEY WANT TO. That&#8217;s their adult decision. But why, oh why, do we punish divorced parents with this crap! And why do we detain kids from growing up and keeping them bundled after they turn 18. </p>
<p>Good luck to the OP, I hope those step-kids of yours get themselves on their own two feet when they leave for college (and that they DO leave for college). I have no personal advice to give but getting a second opinion with a tougher lawyer sounds like a good option recommended above.</p>

																<p>In NY child support is until 21, sometimes 22 if they&#8217;re in college full time.  That&#8217;s right!  Kids away at college full time?  Continue paying mom the child support while still getting requests from your college student for some spare cash.</p>

																<p>As a single mother of two young children, I am in shock that that much is being paid out per month.  I don&#8217;t get a penny from my ex.  :(  It gets really tough at times.  Being a single mom is extremely tough.  Personally, you knew what you were walking into.  Just because the children don&#8217;t live with you and your husband, doesn&#8217;t mean he shouldn&#8217;t be paying to help support.  However, I do think their mom should cut back on the activities, as I do NOT think a child should be in that many things at a time.  I wish that my ex would even send me $100 a month!</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m both a lawyer and a stepmom, although I don&#8217;t practice in family law.  (My husband does.)  In NV, for two kids, it would be about 25% of the income.  60% seems excessive for two kids with the same mother.  (It would still be under 40% if they had different mothers.)  Changed circumstances are typically things like a drastic drop in grades, a major life event, etc.  Not taking up piano lessons.  </p>
<p>If she has primary custody, however, she is due child support.  Plain and simple.  If he can&#8217;t afford the payments or if they are not in line with what your state statutes outline for the percentages per child, your husband needs to have a long discussion with his lawyer.  If he isn&#8217;t represented, he needs to be.  Plain and simple.  He should not have to work a second job to pay his support payments.  So it seems that there is more going on here.  (It may be a marital settlement agreement with some type of alimony or he is paying her for a division of their assets.)  </p>
<p>As for how to avoid this, get a lawyer at the divorce. The best that you can find.  Don&#8217;t try to do it yourself when kids are involved and you may have to pay support.  You will often end up in a situation like this.  And, please, do not see a paralegal service that is practicing law without a license.  Even worse.  Then, you think you are getting decent advice and you aren&#8217;t.  (I read this comment on another blog &#8211; you wouldn&#8217;t let some random person on the street take out your appendix, right? That&#8217;s how you need to treat the law. Go see someone with a license.)</p>

																<p>M.L. Why not have the court put a maximum amount allowed for extraordinary expenses so that the amount does not ever get beyond 1,200? Have you guys considered filing for custody, so she would have to pay child support to him. If you love the kids, and the husband wants to provide for them, why not share them equally? Maybe it is your husband&#8217;s turn to raise the children in his household and the mother should get a break and pay child support. Just a thought.</p>

																<p>Something I keep seeing cropping up is the change of custody thing &#8211; it&#8217;s really really DIFFICULT to change custody &#8211; and w/o knowing the entire situation, it&#8217;s hard to say if it&#8217;d be warranted. Yeah, it&#8217;d solve the money problem&#8230; but it&#8217;s not that easy.</p>
<p>(Though, who knows &#8211; the argument of providing a stable home without moving so frequently could actually be an argument in the OPs favor if they did opt to go that route. I dunno.)</p>
<p>I like the idea of seeing about getting a cap on extra curriculars though. Though I&#8217;m a stepmom, I have two kids of my own and the number of extra activities they can do is limited &#8211; I don&#8217;t need to FILL every minute of their day &#8211; and I think one activity at a time is a reasonable amount for a child&#8217;s schedule (and my wallet).</p>
<p>(And I feel bad for the custodial parents that are getting by without any help from the child&#8217;s other parent&#8230; Both parents should support the children, absolutely &#8211; and I give you much credit, those of you going it alone without any help, financially or otherwise from the noncustodial parent)</p>

																<p>WOW! I got a totally different tone from the question than what is being talked about in the comments! I thought she was happy with his kids and totally WILLING to pay the child support but worried about how to budget and afford his retirement! LOL!<br>
Think that you should meet with a financial planner and stick to a very strict budget so that you can make the most of what little you have left over each month.<br>
Also do either of your employers have a matching program for retirement contributions? And it might be worth looking into seeing if he contributes more automatically from his paycheck if the courts would consider that as &#8216;income&#8217; or not? It might reduce the amount he has to report to the courts because it&#8217;s going into a penalty to remove type of account?<br>
Just my thoughts! :)</p>

																<p>Kristi, we are willing to pay the child support and that WAS my question. I may not think some of the stipulations are fair but I don&#8217;t make those calls, the State does. </p>

																<p>I wonder, from the point of view of the second wife, it looks like unconstitutional desapropriation of her income. What does she have to do with these kids?</p>
<p>Of course, it seems they should have been intelligent enough to never marry. I highly doubt that there was a legal way to take money away from an unmarried person to pay for child support of an unrelated unknown party.</p>
<p>The entire child support industry is a single ripoff for men. Read the discussion here</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t answer for everyone but I know for me, the intent is not reducing the actual C.S. but the &#8220;extras&#8221; for non necessities.  Medical/Dental, sure those are necessary but most things outside of that are not and there should be a cap on what would be considered reasonable.</p>
<p>Any medical/dental bills split 50/50 would come after the service is provided and the insurance has paid&#8230; not a $600 cushion each month</p>

																<p>M.L., </p>
<p>My heart goes out to you in this situation.  It is TOUGH to be a step-mom&#8230;I always say it&#8217;s the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever had to do.  And like you, I&#8217;ve created a good relationship with the mother, which has helped tremendously.  I commend you on that&#8230;NOT easy to do!  You have a good attitude and outlook, and that&#8217;s what is going to get you through all this.</p>
<p>I work in the family court system, and I would say that a majority of these dads that I see on a day-to-day basis that pay these high amounts of support live with their parents AND have two jobs!  It&#8217;s unbelievable the sacrifices they go through to support their children.  Then, of course, I also see the ones that go to jail because they refuse to pay their support!  So I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to be a constant struggle for you and your husband to afford this obligation for quite a few more years.</p>
<p>My advice is just to hang in there&#8230;.it sounds like you know what&#8217;s important and what priorities are in you and your husband&#8217;s lives, and I think that&#8217;s going to be what gets you through this.  From what I&#8217;ve seen in court, most parents in your husband&#8217;s situation do have to wait until CS payments are concluded before really starting to plan for the financial future they hope for.  </p>
<p>And I know you&#8217;re not looking for advice on the actual CS issue, but I do honestly believe that the &#8220;extra&#8221; expenses are able to be litigated if your husband so desires; therefore, that could save you some in the meantime.  I really think that that part of his CS order is very unfair.  :(</p>
<p>Good luck to you!!</p>

																<p>@Yana: Of course parents SHOULD support their children. But plenty of them would not if it weren&#8217;t for child support laws. A close relative&#8217;s ex often did not send the money, forcing her to go after him legally. Maybe he thought he&#8217;d moved far enough away that they couldn&#8217;t find him. Guess what: He had to pay. If not for the law, he would have gotten away with skipping out on his responsibilities.<br>
The payments are not &#8220;punishment&#8221; &#8212; they are the non-custodial parent&#8217;s share of bringing up the kids s/he helped make.<br>
As for &#8220;the custodial parent is the one actually supporting the children&#8221;? &#8212; plenty of divorced parents could not make ends meet if not for the support checks. Those who don&#8217;t get any kind of help often end up in some pretty desperate straits.</p>

																<p>If I were in this situtation as new-wife, here&#8217;s what I would do:</p>
<p>* Create a budget that uses only wife&#8217;s income. Ignore husband&#8217;s income, if there is any left, use that for savings, retirement, etc.</p>
<p>* If husband has the opportunity to contribute pre-tax money to a retirement account, then totally do that. I would shoot for 20% to help cover his missing income. (This should also lower his child support payments a bit.)</p>
<p>* Try to find fun things to do that don&#8217;t cost much money. It&#8217;s amazing the things that kids enjoy.</p>
<p>Since you are already in a difficult financial situation, it will be hard to pretend his income just doesn&#8217;t exist. But, if you two can work together and create a budget and decide what things are really important in your life together, then it will get easier. If you really got a handle on things, it could maybe even work out much better by omitting his income. Maybe you could downsize your house/apartment, find a cheaper area nearby, give couponing a try, lower your quality of life (such as nice cars, fancy clothes, dining and entertainment etc.). I do have to say that all those $$$ activities the kids are doing are just nuts. I can understand daycare, but more than one activity at a time is kind of just seems like a waste. </p>
<p>Everybody&#8217;s circumstances are always different, but hopefully you two can find a way to get ahead. Good luck. :-)</p>

																<p>@Donna &#8211; I understand many people may agree with the way you look at it, but my take is that nobody is &#8220;forced&#8221; to go after an absent parent &#8211; unless there is public assistance involved.  It&#8217;s a choice, normally.</p>
<p>&#8220;If not for the law, he would have gotten away with skipping out on his responsibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>That makes me sad.  Children ought to be a blessing and a joy, with parents who love them and support them because they want to.  Not a burden.  My personal attitude is that if you don&#8217;t want the man, you don&#8217;t seek his money.  When I divorced the father of my child years ago, I wanted to waive child support rights.  My attorney said I couldn&#8217;t do that, but I never pursued child support &#8211; and I was as poor as could be and still be able to provide a home for us.  Desperate straits don&#8217;t justify what child support laws put children and victim parents through.  I wouldn&#8217;t wish it on anyone.  I&#8217;d like it better if they just called it &#8220;alimony&#8221;, because then it wouldn&#8217;t make weapons out of children.</p>

																<p>Personally, I receive child support from a dead beat dad. I don&#8217;t care how much or how little he makes, the price of what he has emotionally done to his child can never be re-paid. </p>
<p>I think he makes in the neighborhood of 35K, and my daughter gets $525/month. While that may seem like a fair sum of money to some, it&#8217;s really diddly squat compared to what it takes to raise her. And in 2 1/2 years when he&#8217;s &#8220;off the hook&#8221;, I&#8217;m still on it. There will be cars, college, books, first houses, weddings, grandchildren&#8230; He will wash his hands of all of this once she turns 18. I will reap all the rewards of raising a strong, beautiful, care, young woman. </p>
<p>I could care less about his money, it means nothing to me or her. If she had it her way she would rather have a relationship with her father rather then a savings account. </p>
<p>Pardon my french&#8230; he&#8217;s a douche bag.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be for you and your husband to create a budget that takes into account only your salary to live on.  Take the $1000 a month left over from his salary and put $500 a month into a ROTH IRA for each of you until you hit the maximum for each acct ($5000).  Then take the last $2000 a year that you will have left over and either plan a vacation for you and his kids, or a nice Christmas, or whatever.</p>
<p>But make your salary the salary that pays for the necessities.  Housing, food, car, etc.  His salary should fund joint retirement, and also any joint splurges.  Start couponing (if you don&#8217;t already) to reduce your food/toiletries expenses.  Try to use Groupon (or other sites like that) to get cheap membership to the zoo, or museum to take the kids when they come visiting.  </p>
<p>Yes, you may be living in a tiny apartment and not have a lot of spending money &#8211; but you know what?  A lot of young people live like that.  It isn&#8217;t shocking that you would need to too.  You chose to marry someone with previous obligations, and you need to be creative in how you can do that and also make the commitment to start saving for retirement.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

																<p>@YANA- Saying that child support is a weapon using the children against the other parent- WOW, that is all I have to say.  It costs a lot of money to raise children.  And when the non-custodial parent just up and leaves, moving out of state and hasn&#8217;t paid anything toward the children, that is on them.  I would never consider it a punishment against that parent when child support catches up with them.  It isn&#8217;t like the other parent got up on themself to help make the children.  Intsead of communicating to work it out, they just walk out and leave without even a warning sometimes (my experience at least).  It isn&#8217;t a PUNISHMENT.  The parent should help provide for their children.</p>

																<p>Sarah stop being resentfull calling someone names dosen&#8217;t help anyone.<br>
525$ for one child and you are complaining? I get 350$ for two if or when SHE pays.</p>
<p>M.L.<br>
There is usually a limit that can be taken based on state laws I would verify with his lawyer and the state.</p>
<p>Actually Goose if you had read how much he pays and done some quick math at 2K a month that is over 400K which pays for both children completely based on your numbers.</p>
<p>Raising children on a standard income can be done. I do it. I am a single father with two children. I get 350$ a month and save 20% of my income despite the fact half my money goes to daycare and mortgage. People want everything when in truth they need little.</p>
<p>M.L. I do not know how much you make, but if possible I would recommend the earlier comment of you being the bread winner and your husband the saver. Save ALL his money if possible. I know someone who lives in a 2 bedroom house on 16$ an hour. It is all about managing expectations.</p>
<p>If you have any debt pay it off<br>
Evaluate your needs versus wants. There are so many wants we don&#8217;t really need. We do not need big vacations nor giant Christimases. Be frugal and explore your own area or state.</p>
<p>Most importantly if you really want a child with your husband DO NOT let the other woman dictate your family. Check with the state also most judges take into consideration other children in determine child support. He has to pay for them as well.</p>
<p>Love each other unconditionally and support each other through all things. Your happiness is in your hands.</p>

<p>Some people do use child support as a weapon. They want all they can get as much as they can get. It is not about what is best for the children. They spend the money on clothes, phones, trips and the like. The poor child gets left in the middle between a parent who pays and gets seldom seen and another who cares more about the money for them-self than the child they helped conceive.</p>

																<p>@Yana: How nice that you are able to support the kids yourself. But here&#8217;s the thing: Not everyone can.<br>
Sometimes the custodial parent&#8217;s wages don&#8217;t cover the basics. It&#8217;s a question of survival &#8212; and, in MY personal opinion, what the man (or woman) is supposed to do, i.e., help support the children s/he brought into the world.</p>

																<p>@Donna &#8211; I had a poverty-level income.  I had little financial or practical support.  Anyone who could not provide what I did in the early days ought to seek public assistance or give custody to someone who can.  I made the most of what I had.  When my child&#8217;s dad took her for a visit, he paid whatever expenses were incurred.  That is what I call child support.  You support your child who is in your custody, whether temporarily or permanently.  You are (should be!) the master of your own life and your income, and hopefully you act responsibly.  Paying one&#8217;s ex is not supporting a child, but it absolutely can interfere with being able to support your own child when you have that child in your care.  Why is it that &#8220;deadbeat dads&#8221; are so irresponsible &#8211; criminal, even &#8211; but the moms are exceedingly loving, caring and responsible by pointing the finger and trying to extract money for whatever purpose they wish to use it?  It can go the same for a female absent parent, but that isn&#8217;t usually the case.  Someone before commented that a woman should RUN from a man with kids by another woman, and that pretty much reflects our child-unfriendly society and child support laws.  And incidentally, just one more reason that abortion must remain legal.  I&#8217;m also one who prefers that the law and government stay out of people&#8217;s personal lives, and people should be responsible for their own actions and choices.  Who married the jerks?  Above all, if a woman (because only women can bear children) doesn&#8217;t want to have, raise or support a child, she should not have one.</p>

																<p>@Yana: Again, not everyone is responsible. Some custodial parents never see the ex again (like my relative) and thus cannot get even the small amount of &#8220;support&#8221; that comes from the non-custodial parent taking the child for a visit.<br>
&#8220;Who married the jerks?&#8221; Surely you&#8217;re not serious. Have you never known anyone who married a person who later showed his/her true colors?<br>

																<p>The point I was trying to make in asking &#8220;Who married the jerks?&#8221; is personal responsibility.  I&#8217;m a believer in that.  Someone who makes a mistake involving a spouse showing true colors later is still responsible for his own choice.  It&#8217;s a gamble, for sure.  When I took a big leap of faith with my current husband early in the relationship, well, it was a leap of faith.  But it was my leap and my choice, completely.  It was a winning gamble, but I would still be responsible for my choice if it hadn&#8217;t been.  Life&#8217;s a gamble!  I just hate the idea of somebody&#8217;s life being ruined because they made a baby, because the law is involved in child support issues.  I think most of the time, the children and accused parent suffer the most.  I would never have wanted my child to think she was such a burden, and all about money.  She wasn&#8217;t.  And I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted her to have an attitude toward her dad that he was the guy we got money from, and that is what he was good for.  He was the dad she loved, and who loved her.  To each his own, but that&#8217;s the way I wanted it.  And incidentally, I was also responsible for marrying that guy, having our child and wanting to raise her solely, without joint custody or anything like that.  I like the responsibility I choose to take, because it means I am free and I have authority.  I would afford that to anyone &#8211; but as you say, some people are not responsible and shun responsibility.  It&#8217;s true.  I don&#8217;t understand it, really.  When somebody says, &#8220;The devil made me do it&#8221;, I think they are negating their own personhood.  If they are not choosing who they are and what they do, they cannot have any authority, even over themselves.  Not talking about the original subject, just rambling ;)</p>

Sorry for your situation, I never got child support from my dad and my mom had to do it all by her lonesome. When I did live with my dad due emergency reasons she kicked me out real quick so your tolerance, love and dedication to me is admirable seeing how some &#8220;step-xxx&#8221; do not have a lick of those above mentioned qualities. In regards to savings it really is all about budgets and sticking to them, downsizing and accomadating on behalf of both of you (which truly sucks considering that none of what&#8217;s going on is your fault) I&#8217;m not sure if I read about investing?, maybe buy little stocks to make some extra cents a year or if you&#8217;ve saved a good amount maybe a cd? If anything to make the dollar and situation work for you. Please remember that you should save for you even if he can&#8217;t right now and I&#8217;m sorry about that, make sure you save for retirement, save for yourself and in a non-related $ issue, if you want to have kids in the future (you did say you didn&#8217;t have them due to the situation) was this something you spoke to him about? Doesn&#8217;t sound fair) umm ok, every dollar counts,  every invested penny is more money be it big or small, and hang in there girl, your doing good morally and budget wise it seems. Sorry for the ramble&#8230;</p>

																<p>Most states have a max %, but it is undeniably his responsibility to support his kids. </p>
<p>However, I absolutely disagree that he should be paying more based on the activities of the children.  If the mother wants them in expensive activities, she should be footing the bill with her own income and what she is already receiving in child support&#8230;.. that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for.</p>

																<p>I have not read every post, but I need some immediate gratification by posting.</p>
<p>If there is a good relationship between the parents then, I would think that there would be communication about extracurricular activities to ensure what each parent can afford.  Especially when you are expecting them to take part in the expenses.  Not every child needs to be in every activity.</p>
<p>I would never think to go back to court to get these costs.  Heck, I don&#8217;t even go after the out of pocket expenses for medical (the Judge never even gave us a breakdown for these expenses) or dance classes.  I can&#8217;t be bothered because #1 &#8211; I don&#8217;t like him; #2 I don&#8217;t feel like have to discuss everything that I want to enrol her in with him.  I pay for it on my own if I can afford it because I can&#8217;t always ensure that he will have a job nor do I want to feel like I depend on someone to &#8220;make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, every time I go back my Judge does the opposite.  He practically kisses him on the mouth because he was Army Reserve in Iraq, lowers his child support obligation, and gives him a pat on the behind and sends us out the door (with me looking at my lawyer bill thinking &#8220;WTF?&#8221;).  When I finally got my Judge to add in my childcare expenses of $1K per month (at the time), and I got my support LOWERED again (this time by $13; $220 the first time) because he lowered Dad&#8217;s earning potential.  I gave up at that point because no matter what I am the &#8220;stable&#8221; earner and he gets to flitter.</p>
<p>I am not bitter, nope, not me!  Not bitter at all.  =o)</p>

																<p>I can understand that the kids need to be taken vare of&#8230;. However, why is it that the mother can keep taking the father back to court for more money even though she has about $130,000 in assets and cash, while the father has about $2,000 in assests??? And how is it fair that the father should have to pay for the childs insurance when he makes 3 times less that what she does???<br>
Personally I feel that most women/men just feel the need to screw over their ex/parent of the child just because they know they can or because they want to!! I think it is a discrace and someone should put a stop to it! If the parent with sole custody is better off and has way more money than the parent paying support, then they need to reduce their c.s. payments and not require them to pay all of the insurance. It just makes more since. If anything, give the kids to the parent with less money and have the other pay them money!!</p>
<p>Also, I was wondering how often can you taken someone to court to re-do child support?? I think every 3 to 6 months is crazy!! At least thats how often we go!</p>

																<p>@Prenup- Its easy to say that but Ive noticed that they always count te non costodial parents spouces income, however they never count the coustiodal parents spouces income. I don&#8217;t think that is in anyway right!! If your gonna count one then you should count the other as well when determining cs. Child support and their guidelines are retarded and need to be reevaluated!!!!</p>

																<p>Child support is nothing more than legalized extortion from men. It doesn&#8217;t take near the amount of money the corrupt court systems contrive, then rule awarded, to raise a kid. It makes me sick to think of all the money guys get screwed out of just for having a kid every year. To make matters worse many times the women just plays a victim card and sits on her ass and does as little as possible while sucking off of the man as much as she possibly can for as long as she possibly can. Now that&#8217;s repulsive. </p>
<p>Men are better off having one or two and getting a vasectomy in confidence. There will be no more so called &#8220;obligations&#8221; and it&#8217;s a nice way to nail the worthless all too often incredulous, cheater should she get knocked up again. Most women are not trust worthy to the full extent so plan on forking it over if you happen to be stupid enough to get semi or permanently involved and not take responsibility for contraception yourself. Sometimes they&#8217;ll lie about that just to get knocked up, use caution. </p>
<p>Your situation calls for action! Use every evasive procedure you can. Have him get the lowest paying job he is qualified for and hold it for the duration of the extortion (Child support). Let them base it off of that if at all possible. Take some under the table work immediately. Construction, insurance sales, car detailing, waiting tables, delivering pizza (TIPS) and any other cash projects that don&#8217;t include a W2 or W9 form. Take this money and or checks and cash them at a bank and don&#8217;t deposit the funds. Never deposit the funds anywhere and keep them at home in a coffee can or safe area. Working under the table is the best bet for keeping her leeching to a minimum. Rentals are good as well, just have someone else claim the money or get paid in cash. Farms (baling hay, picking fruit, milking cows), farmers markets (sell livestock, produce and crafts), ebay anything untraceable. Keep it off the books and out of accounts until your hardship sentence is over.</p>

																<p>There are other ways to minimize the damage that a support order can inflict to one financially. </p>
<p>Be as proactive as you can before getting an order established if possible. If you really want to avoid it from becoming a order disappear for several years before they can serve you. Most States will not place an order if they can&#8217;t get a DNA test. Move constantly (every 4-6 mos) for a decade or better with no utilities and/or mailing address. It&#8217;s not as hard as you think and you&#8217;ll get to travel and make friends all over. Just live off a minimum and save all the money you can. If you are cornered and can&#8217;t run move to a location with the best laws for YOU. Be sure you don&#8217;t wind up somewhere that lets her suck you for money while they go to college too! Be sure to live in a State where the age of majority is 18. Make sure the State doesn&#8217;t credit for daycare or anything other than base support. Run several calculators and see where the thresholds are for income and look for hidden deductions in the State&#8217;s formula manuals. You have to know the law to beat it if you can. </p>
<p>Hide and protect assets immediately if facing a support case/order. If you have real-estate market it before arrears are ordered (especially if they are imminent, it takes time for a lien to go through you have about 2 months time to liquidate it before they can snatch it). Sell it via auction if you have to, to move it fast; you may lose 25-35% but that&#8217;s nothing compared to all or most of it if the leech get&#8217;s it. Don&#8217;t deposit the money, keep it somewhere safe and say you lost it gambling if you get cornered on it. You can buy later ;for now, just be happy with renting or working for rent at an apartment complex as a caretaker etc, or with family or friends. Anything to save money and keep real valuable things out of your name. Some States will not let them seize your primary residence under a certain value. It&#8217;s worth spending $100 or calling legal aid to grill an attorney about laws and loop holes to find them and exploit them. College roomies are fun and usually cheap. Look around campuses if you can stand the crowd; otherwise go rural.</p>

																<p>Once you get hit with support you can do little to avoid getting leeched. You can minimize the losses however. </p>
<p>Side jobs (greenhouses, farms, construction, handyman, computer service etc), pay pal, ebay, on line money making, rentals, self employment is great use an llc and an attorney to minimize the leeching. </p>
<p>Constantly be a little late or behind to make it look like you have a hard tiem making the current order. If you always make it on time and they get the money they will inevitably want more and more. You have to almost go to jail a few times to avoid getting it raised. they want to make you suffer and make you pay. They don&#8217;t&#8217; want you to have it easy or be able to meet your obligation. </p>
<p>Consider going to another nation that will not deport you legally before getting behind. You can start over. Consider stripping, selling drugs or doing whatever you need to do to get more cash. You could off her but that won&#8217;t do much good if you get caught and of course &#8220;I&#8217;m joking. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue this later.</p>

																<p>You&#8217;re a little harsh there, OtsegoMI, but if you read my previous comments, you know I agree with you in principle.  I like your instruction to say you lost it gambling &#8211; it is good for them to think you are a loser!  Sadly, though, what all this brings to mind is that without even dropping our pants, we are subject to getting more screwed by the medical system in America, and your advice ought to be considered and expanded upon for self-defense in that area.</p>

																<p>I think child support is the biggest joke there is. The laws need to change in a major way. First, if you were married or not, I think custody should be split 50/50 unless the parents live in different states or the kid(s) is at the age to decide which parent they want to live with. And with that there should be no support. Things should be split straight down the middle unless the man..or woman shows they cannot handle their responsibilities. See I believe the man or woman will show their colors when the rubber meets the road. Once that happens then the courts can take corrective action.</p>

																<p>I did this with my ex 50/50 on everything. But when it came time for him to pay half of dr bills, extra curricular activities, insurance etc. he flat out refuses. So in theory this would be great if the other person does what&#8217;s right. I have provided receipts for everything and never see his half. He says I just want his money but the crazy thing is that I already paid these things I am asking for half and he says I want his money! Its insane. I have never received a dime from him but if he has her and has to take her to the doctor on the insurance I provide I pay him half of that expense even though he is not paying his half. I do this so when we do end up in court I can honestly say that I have always paid for my child while he has not.</p>

																<p>For someone that did not live with her daughter&#8217;s Dad, I am not down with 50-50.  Not every child can handle that type of inconsistency.</p>
<p>Child support is not JUST for supporting their daily needs, it also covers their portion of housing, electricity, water, gas, etc.</p>
<p>If one parent earns $25K and the other makes $125K, splitting 50-50 is ridiculous.</p>

																<p>If you are hit with a support order there are a few other things you may consider to stop being screwed by the system. </p>
<p>One is to change your identity and move on either in the US or elsewhere. Sometimes this is  a viable option if you have no family or friends you want to keep in touch with. A fake ID and SS number is easier to come by than you think and is worth its weight in gold to avoid debts and charges of all kinds. If your prints are in the system you have to commit to a life of non-illegal activity because if the fat cat finds out you&#8217;ll be facing additional charges. </p>
<p>Another option  if you want the kid(s) is to take them from her legally by proving her unfit. Remember she didn&#8217;t mind screwing you so perhaps you can return the favor. Imagine what would happen if she got pulled over because someone anonymously called the police and told them the driver of such and such vehicle had a gun and was pointing it at you or some kids and took off down the road. When they search the vehicle and find a large sum of narcotics or some other illegal items under the  seat that won&#8217;t look too good in family court now will it? Of course it&#8217;s even better if her prints are on the bag (trash is everywhere right). Remember to stay anonymous and even better use a  voice changer and a payphone with no cameras or a disguise walking in. This may require some work but it&#8217;s fool proof. Most people forget to lock things at night and are creatures of habit after all.</p>

																<p>Bottom line is the system is nasty sometimes guys are victims of unfair laws and have to be proactive. </p>
<p>A few more words on moving on with a new ID. For US people this will require some connections (think Mexicans, and other foreigner communities). Be sure to drop everything and everyone, liquidate everything and you&#8217;ll have to start over completely never to return to your previous life, accounts, home, or anything else. Protective custody if you will. </p>
<p>For an Ex Pat trying to escape the system in a foreign land is a good option if you have  some skills. Sometimes obtaining documents is easier in these places too. Again, no connections of any kind to your previous life. Pick up a skip trace book and read it a few times to get the drift of what this involves. This is for the person that is serious about getting away. </p>
<p>Remember if you have back support due you can&#8217;t get a passport and won&#8217;t be able to leave the country. However, remember too that once your paid up you can go freely. You&#8217;ll just need to stay gone if that&#8217;s your plan and have a good plan and some travelers checks and cash to keep yourself that a way. </p>
<p>&#8212;- </p>
<p>There are other problems with the system as well. They will try to get you to pay medical, dental, psychological and any other services they deem &#8220;needed&#8221;. </p>
<p>You  can avoid these &#8220;obligations&#8221; by simply not having the coverage available. If  you don&#8217;t have it through work or are self employed or its too expensive your order will likely be increased be a few percentage points but this fact can save you tons of money in the long run from a sleezy ex that just wants to rack up bills for you. Make them carry the coverage by claiming its too expensive for you and don&#8217;t carry it on dependents at work. Simply elect not to take it and buy your coverage somewhere else that they don&#8217;t&#8217; know about. Remember the less they know about you the better. </p>
<p>Avoid facebook, myspace and linkd so you don&#8217;t have your face, location and/or resume floating around for people to find you.</p>

																<p>While there is some ways to completely avoid support orders many times they require intense effort on your part, may be slightly illegal, and may not be for everyone. The best bet is to be proactive and avoid the situation in the first place. If you can run and not be served paperwork do it! You need to stay ahead of them and never let them catch you. Once the kid(s) are older you can slow down and enjoy life again. Otherwise, plan on paying if you have an order in place, or it&#8217;s pending the best thing you can do is minimize the bleeding or change your identity. </p>
<p>Remember Mexican&#8217;s cross the border everyday by the hoards. It&#8217;s not that hard to go the other way if you need to, even without a passport. Think of the giant border to the North as well. Canada is full of hiding places and under the table work. Staying in the US is a good option too but most don&#8217;t have what it takes to get the ID and the discipline to completely leave everything behind&#8230;I mean completely. </p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t want the kid(s) so I don&#8217;t want to get custody but for those that do you  can do it with some clever &#8220;innovation.&#8221; Otherwise, you may well be screwed. Taking temporary jobs is also  a nice excuse in court for why your income changes and may allow you more freedom and flexibility. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much more to say about this but I feel for every poor guy that gets screwed by the most unfair system there is.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m a little confused about the jurisdiction, no matter where the decree was origionally placed, the rules apply where the child resides.  My husband &amp; ex-wife were divorced in one state, their son grew up in another state, but they moved during his high school years to a third state.  That move was great for us bc it meant one less year of paying child support.  It&#8217;s money now that we can give directly to him to help with college.</p>
<p>Kids understand more than they let on&#8230; they definately figure things out, just as their son did that his mother cheated and left and married the other man.  </p>
<p>Distance stinks, we did it stationed overseas&#8230; all he can do is be the best dad he can be regardless of the miles.  Cards, letters and calls go along way.</p>
<p>Regardless, so glad you got a modification.. I hope you can breathe a little easier now and you can make your decision regarding possible future children without this stress hanging over you.  My husband and I have two&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t change them for the world, no matter how lean in the finance department it was for a few years for us, we never regret the decision to have children anyways.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you.</p>

																<p>Andrea, thank you for the kind words.</p>
<p>The law is very interesting regarding jurisdiction.  The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act was enacted in 2007 and basically states that as long as one parent remains in the state that the original decree was filed &#8211; that state retains jurisdiction. If my husband and I also move out of this state, jurisdiction is transferred to the home state of the kids but ONLY after the original state agrees to give up jurisdiction. This stops custodial parents from moving from state to state trying to get a better arrangement. It also prevents multiple custody/CS documents from being filed in multiple states. </p>
<p>Perhaps this law wasn&#8217;t in place during your situation? </p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;s been a saving grace for us and I love to hear from someone who&#8217;s been there and done that and survived!!</p>

																<p>my story is similar to many written here. The difference is my husband&#8217;s ex wife is an eye doctor with her own practice. She hired her boyfriend to work there, also an eye doctor.  We suspect she is hiding her income by paying her boyfriend more money in salary.  She is now wanting my husband to pay for college and according to her two years of health insurance she claims we didnt pay. </p>
<p>my husband has been paying child support and providing health insurance to his daughters since they divorced.  We have gone through unemployement for almost a year (both of us at the same time) and nw we are trying to catch up in paying off all our debt incurred due to unemployement.  We have no money saved for retirement and my son&#8217;s future.  </p>
<p>As is wife, I am angrey and bitter at his ex wife because she could afford to pay for their college.  She has brain wash their children to the point that there is no relationship between father and daughters for many years.  In the state of nj it is required that we pay for child support until they are 23 &#8211; 24 years old.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it is fair that we have to go through this since we try to do thinks right for a very long time.  The truth is the ex wife is a money hungry woman and can&#8217;t see her ex husband live his life.  And she has a house that is worth over a million dollars!</p>

																<p>A second job is STUPID!!!! all that will do is INCREASE the time away from your family and INCREASE your income so they take more &#8211; they only way to beat it is to get a job off the books. It doesnt matter what she gets wind of, b/c she has to be able to PROVE it in court&#8230; and as there is no paper record of it, thats pretty hard to do.  It doesnt matter what you know its what you can prove.  I am all for supporting the child but these women are greedy and selfish &#8211; and they use their children as their meal ticket.  If you have a job making $12/hr and you are driving a $50,000 car there is something wrong with that &#8211; child support is not meant to be a JOB.  They system is flawed and these women need to be taught a lesson.</p>

																<p>Such generalizations!  These women who?  For as many women that get tons of money there are a lot more that don&#8217;t get enough or anything at all.  I, for one, am the bread winner in my scenario.  He pays support and I certainly don&#8217;t eat filet mignon.  His money is a bonus since it is certainly not to be relied upon to come in a timely manner.  Let&#8217;s not generalize about all women and lesson teaching.

																<p>Every situation is different! I thing when you decide to have children you have to know that they come with a lifetime comitment.  Most of the CS laws are fair. Some people just choose not to take the time to understand them.  I have 4 children 60 percent of the time and my ex has them 40 percent. He makes more money than I make and he pays 600 dollars a month.  He was only paying 389 for a long time&#8230;&#8230; He had time and money to rent a nice little place for him and the kids and didnt.  Instead spent all his extra cash on travaling and living a &#8220;single man&#8221; life style which to me is &#8220;STUPID&#8221; He lived with his mom, and had the kids cramped into a bedroom,  while I bought a house and made a home for my children.  He then decided to take on a swing shift job; He was never there for the kids and never provided a space for the children. NOW that to me is selfish.  After 8 months of asking nicely to please make changes to his situation, I gott tired of waiting for this moron to make a change for the best interest of the kids and filled for more custody of the kids,  I was greanted the 60 percent and now his paying 615. The Dude is having a heart attack about it, and Im like WTF, you had time to get yuor shit together and you decided not to.  So now move th F out of my way so I can provide for theese kids.  One man alone with out re-marying should be able to provide for him self with a very small amount of money.  The courts dont believe that you will be stupid enough to marry or have more kids thats why they make the laws they way that they do!</p>

																<p>Boy, I thought we had it rough having to pay out $48,000 over a full 18 years on one kid. We had a good attorney and refused to pay the &#8220;extraordinary expenses.&#8221; She was only allowed to ask for a modification every three years and only got it once because of our wheeling and dealing with the good attorney and a judge that was a family friend. </p>

																<p>I forgot to mention we live in Texas. We were not made to pay insurance either. Child support is so unfair. It is to pay for the mother&#8217;s lifestyle more than the kids. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even want to think how much we would&#8217;ve had to pay out if we had to pay for insurance, extra expenses, daycare, dental, co-pays, and didn&#8217;t have a good team on our side. </p>
<p>$48,000 over 18 years comes out to be about $222 a month. Take away about $7,000 that my husband&#8217;s parents paid for us because they thought it was so unfair, then the amount we actually paid was $41,000.</p>

																<p>For the ex wived who side with 60%&#8230;.. Go ahead, keep typing why he left yo ass in the furst place because his best intrest is a non factor in your opinon.  You dont seem to mind that someone you claimed to love wont be able to move on and be a great father if he is still grumoy behind your decisions!!  If you decided you wanted to move on should you pay him?  Should you be forced to pay whatever the court says because he is bitter about the fact you two arent right for each other?  File separate taxes, sign a prenup that omit u from financial responsibility.  If you think he wont be there mentally and physical, u r justified, if u know he alway been there and do it to hurt the new wife you are super foul and pathetic.  Go get ur own man, cant handle your bills? Let them live with Dad and u pay support then!  Oh you dont wanna trade huh! Somebody should go file joint custody and joint child support for 6 months swapping the kids since its gotta be organized and impersonal</p>

																<p>I am a divorced mom of 4 beautiful children.  I could say so much here but do not know where to begin&#8230; (ex is in breach of contract)&#8230; The one thing I will say right now, is that in the state that we were divorced, it states that CS be paid until the child is of age 21..and/or, the age of 22 years old (if still attending college.) I am going to post again soon. After reading all of this, I feel horrible. Children are innocent, and every action and descision made should be in the best interest of our children.</p>

																<p>Child Support is just a flawed system that was built on good intentions.  In Texas, if you had a 60k a year job while you were married, and then lose said job after divorcing, then you&#8217;d still be required to pay the same percentage amount as if you had the 60k a year job.  It takes 3 years of not having the same income to get the child support modified.  I look at it this way, if you had lost the job while you were married then the whole family (including the children) would take a hit, so what&#8217;s the difference when you&#8217;re divorced.  Child Support should not be given to custodial parents as &#8220;free money&#8221;, because that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It should be distributed as &#8220;food stamps&#8221;, school meal tickets, clothing.  Texas now gives custodial parents debit cards to spend the money more easily and they can be spent anywhere on anything that the custodial parent wants.  Try requiring the custodial parents to report their child care expenses and the crap that child support is used for would cause several killings.  Just off the top of my head, child support should be broken down into percentages for needs (i.e.  40% food for child, 40% clothing, 10% hygiene, 10% extra-curricular).  I strongly feel the piece of mind non-custodial parents would have from knowing what their child support was going to would help the whole situation.  If the ex-spouses were married then each party would be entitled to a decision as to where money went to, right? Why should that change when they divorce? Of course something like this would never happen, it makes too much sense.  Thanks for reading.</p>

																<p>Apparently we all here are believing that it takes more money for his two kids to live than himself.<br>
That, despite that they have a shared residence and living expenses of their mother.<br>
Something that gets swept under the rug is, IT DOES NOT.<br>
The actual expenses of the two children cannot be possibly 130% of your husband&#8217;s income.<br>
I say 130%, because the other parent should be spending half of what it costs to raise the kids. If you pro rate it for that, then it is costing 30% more than your husband makes to raise these kids.<br>
I do not believe it.<br>
What is actually happening here is, it costs a lot less to raise these kids, and the mother is pocketing the rest.<br>
But we are institutionally prevented from knowing this, because there is no right to see where the expenses are going.<br>
This is a hole in the system. A non-custodial parent should never have to pay more than half of the ACTUAL expenses of his children. Anything else imposed upon him is forced socialism.</p>

																<p>You are inexperienced with rearing children and can not possibly know what money is involved. You are only 26 in time you will know. I don&#8217;t believe that you are &#8220;friends&#8221; with the ex-wife or you wouldn&#8217;t be trying to sabotage her support to raise her children. The mother loves her kids and why shouldn&#8217;t they go to all the classes they can go to? The father was not absent in their creation. You are just whining ! Because you can&#8217;t have your husbands money go toward you and future children of your own. To see lawyers on this thread say you should take the issue to court is ridiculous.  Unbelievable.</p>

																<p>Pocketing the rest of the money! really Gary? Ha I raised 3 children with out the help of their father believe you me there is no left over money when raising children. You do it because you are obligated and mature enough to handle it.Obviously. Remember if he left her he will leave you and if he deserted his children and bitches about supporting them monetarily someday you will be understanding all of this. So watch what you say you will eat it. Bon Appetit !</p>

																<p>I feel for you.  Not all parents are able to put their kids first and some women feel entitled to have their own money and half or more of their ex&#8217;s too.  I too am a step Mom and I love my step daughter dearly but I have to admit the ongoing shananigans of her mother make it difficult to feel love for the child. Sad but true!  I don&#8217;t understand anyone that thinks they should be able to sit on their ass and continue to leech from their ex. We have the child exactly 50% of the time and the ex is remarried and chooses to stay home with her &#8220;new children&#8221; so according to the table in our state her income is 0 which goes against ours. The harder my man works the more he pays even though the costs of raising the child do NOT go up because his income does.  Note to men out there single, in a relationship or married protect yourself DO NOT RELY on your partner for birth control protection. You will pay and continue paying for 20plus years! I just have to hope that regardless of the brainwashing like attempts our smart little girl will one day see her mother for the person she is. Way to go all you step moms and dads out there that love and care for the kids caught in these situations THEY ARE whats truly important.</p>

																<p>That is so messed up. 60%? Wow! That said we&#8217;ve been thru the ringer ourselves. Court, child support increase, custody issues because she won&#8217;t let us see the children. My daughter gets really hurt by it because she loves her brothers. This is what I know<br>
1) Your income should NOT count as his EVER. If you bought a business then they could ONLY count his part of the income from it.</p>
<p>2) He doesn&#8217;t have to worry about reporting his income. Why? Because they will NOT back charge him. He only owes what he already owes until its changed through court. Once he&#8217;s served(most people try to dodge it) and shows up for court. Then he reports his income and only then does he start owing that amount. </p>
<p>3) Overtime shouldn&#8217;t count because it&#8217;s &#8220;unreliable income&#8221;. Heard a judge say that exact thing during my husbands child support hearing. </p>
<p>4) He&#8217;s paying way too much and he should take her to court to lower it. Goodluck and hang in there!!!</p>

																<p>Your task is challenging. And its a never ending battle. There is no doubt that you support your husband and are intent on maintaining the welfare of your step children. But I&#8217;m in the same situation as you with my husband. The only difference is that my husband owed back child support due to his business going under but he failed to disclose this important information to me prior to marriage. Nonetheless, I married all of him when I said, &#8220;I do&#8221;. It is difficult when it seems that you work so hard to meet your own living standards and then the custodial parent decides to go to court to increase the payment. And now you are back where you started. In my situation, my husbands ex chooses not to work (her kids are school age and high school) for whatever reason. I have paid thousands thus far and am sure because of how she chooses not to work, I will pay more as my husband works a side job while he rebuilds his business.<br>
I don&#8217;t believe divorce ends parental responsibility. I believe both biological parents are responsible for the welfare of the child. And I&#8217;m aware that there are deadbeat fathers and deadbeat mothers out there that need a strong hand. But what about the good men and women who have been diligent in paying but run into financial misfortune, that get dragged through the mud (courts) despite their past good record. Yes, you can go to court and modify your payments but what if those payments are even a struggle? But I would like to know why are these women and men who have full custody of a child allowed to not contribute financially (have a job) to their child&#8217;s welfare? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it takes more then money to raise a child but in my husband case, his ex wife fought my husband in court to have custody of the kids, yet, she chooses not to work (she went to college and worked. But decided not to work once she and my husband divorced). If I had my way, we would have custody of the kids and refuse any financial support from her. She could see them whenever she wishes. I know, wishful thinking. Lol.<br>
But I will say that I agree with most. Budget with only your income, don&#8217;t consider his. This is what I&#8217;ve done since day one. It may exhaust your funds but its comforting in the end to know that there is stable income to pay for your own needs. Whatever extra he may have, should be saved in an IRA or 401k, however little that may be. Fortunately, I have a pension that was established prior to my marriage) and, I was able to save quite a lot prior to marriage (I stopped contributing to this account once we married and it remains a part of my assets only, per my lawyers advice). And I suggest you retain the services of an aggressive family court lawyer who will keep yours and your step children&#8217;s best interest in mind. Lastly, if you want to have a child, don&#8217;t let this keep you from doing so. The last thing you want is to regret not recognizing your needs and wants. Most likely, having a child might be even more of a blessing then you think.</p>

																<p>My husband and I are in the same boat. We have been married for almost teo years. He was not working for about a year. That means yoou have to pay back child support boo! My husband is paying on two kids and one is 16 and he never gets to see because of the wife. It really sucks we still have to pay on him. He said if he does&#8217;t the mom will tell him he didn&#8217;t want him. It is screwed up all the way around. I hope when he turns 18 and his sister tells him everything that happened he can choose to see his dad if he wants. All we can do I guess is keep paying and its all about karma baby. What goes aroound comes around.</p>

																<p>Ok just to throw another story in the mix and see some thoughts on it here we go:</p>
<p>I have 2 kids by 2 different mothers both of which I separated from them for reasons I would feel most people would separate for.  I lived in a tri-state area. 2 kids 2 different states.  Neither state recognizes the other for child support. I am happily married now with a 3rd child. When ex 2 heard I was getting married she jumped on child support and stopped letting me see my child. The first child the court left it up to her if I could see my child or not.  Keep in mind I was involved with my 2nd child.  The first I found out about her later on in life.  There has never been any abuse or anything reported or anything against me in my life. I&#8217;m a normal guy who works hard and wants a family.  I work for more than minimum wage which i&#8217;m pointing out because i&#8217;ll let you know how little I make now later in this post.  When ex 2 went for child support she had been to my house a billion times.I have pictures to prove this by the way but for some reason my court date and papers on this whole matter ended up at a random place in my state signed for by a random person.So I missed my court date. I got hit with 10,000 in backed child support from day 1.  They did not recognize my other child. I had proof of my other child I had proof of me being with her and paying bills and buying things for the child and being the only income in the house and still pretty much was though she still lived with her parents. I didn&#8217;t get to voice any of this so I filed to appeal to tell my side of the story to maybe get this lowered.  I was shot down for the appeal. I had no rights to my child to see them and was paying a lot of money.  I went back to court finally after filing for 2 years for rights to see my child.  It took another year to set any visitation up.  By this time   my child doesn&#8217;t really remember me.  My ex even on court appointed visits doesn&#8217;t even bring my child anymore (which i drive 3 hours to see my child ) she sends texts stating she won&#8217;t be there because she believes its hurting my child to see me.  I&#8217;m the father.  I have scheduled calls and have yet to talk to my daughter 1 time. The lawyer was friends with my ex&#8217;s brother which at one time was a lawyer but can no longer practice law. I now with child support bring in less than $500 a month. my rent is $595. I get food from churches and whatever else to feed my wife and child. Child support laws were put into effect in a time when men could support a whole household and housewives were everywhere. Its a new time these laws should be changed.  Do I have a problem with paying to take care of my child? no. I do have a problem paying for everything for both kids and myself and my wife and my other child???? yes.  Neither parent has a job or is willing. The law states after the kid is in kindergarden the father is attributed 50% of the support the other parent is supposed to get a job and do 50% as well&#8230; well again denied for this as well. The judge whos name is actually signed and stamped all over the order said his/her name is not on the order. They will do nothing i&#8217;m in limbo&#8230; anyone have any ideas of how i&#8217;m going to live?</p>

																<p>and to add more I lost a house, and several jobs because my paycheck came back 0.00 after 1 state was double dipping also that same state took all of the support so more support for state 2 and never gives them my tax returns. which they are supposed to alternate&#8230;I can&#8217;t afford to go to a dr and get the medication i need for panic attacks as well so i just live with those as well.  just thinking about this destroys my world every single day.

																<p>My husband has been faithfully paying his child support for the past 15 years.  Our last payment is June 2012. I have always supported the fact that he had to pay child support.   What didn&#8217;t seem fair was that the girls were with us from Thursday to Sunday &#8211; every week, we paid for many lunches, haircuts (because she wouldn&#8217;t) child care, school clothing and much more. We lived in an old run down appartment while she had new vehicles, snowmobiles, camper and a great big house.  She hardly gave the girls any money nor did she put any away.  We couldn&#8217;t put anything away for them because she was getting a big chunk of change.  She took us to court many times and got more and more&#8230;but it wasn&#8217;t for the kids, it was so she could spend more on herself!  IN SOME CASES, it should be written in the divorce decree that the mother needs to put some money aside for the kids &#8211; provided she can of course!  Not all circumstances are like the one I&#8217;ve described.  My two cents worth!!!</p>

																<p>I understand that child support is needed, but regardless if you have children or not you still are responsible to pay rent, utilities bills, car payment (if you choose to have one)..and so on. My husband has 2 children from a previous relationship and we have 3 together. She is now receiving more than half of his take home pay. The only way the courts will deviate from the guidelines is if he is paying child support for our 3 children. What is the difference if he is married supporting the kids or divorced and paying child support? Does this mean we should get a divorce and he pay me child support?? Mean while his ex has had two more children with her boyfriend, she hasn&#8217;t had to work for the last 7 years, and receives food stamps&#8230;oh and did I mention she drives around in a 2008 Chevy Tahoe with rims and she also has a 2005 chevy Tahoe. Whenever we see the kids their clothes are stained and old and they don&#8217;t look well kept, but their mother always has her hair and nails done and wears the lastest fashion. My husband has never missed a child support payment and is now being treated like a dead beat dad. My husband and his ex made an agreement on the amount of child support he would pay while in court, but a month later she went back to court and lied stating that my husband&#8217;s failure to comply (which was untrue b/c the support taken out automatically from his paycheck) was willful and now he is paying $2000 a month for child support for 2 kids, which is making it impossible for us to pay the necessary bills. I am hitting so many dead ends and am so frustrated with the system. Why work when you can&#8217;t support yourself. We have put in for an objection, but it&#8217;s been almost 60 days and haven&#8217;t heard anything. We are in the process of filing a petition for modification, but in the mean time we are falling behind in bills. Not sure what else to do.</p>

																<p>I wrote earlier and forgot to mention&#8230;There&#8217;s this woman who gets child support from her ex&#8230;she&#8217;s always claiming she is &#8220;broke&#8221;, yet her boyfriend(who doesn&#8217;t work) lives with her. She bought herself a new car as soon as the child support checks started coming in&#8230;and recently bought the &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; a car also!!!

																<p>It all comes around. It is kind of funny, all the damage boys do to females, in the end the female can do as much damage back. If not more.  HUGE lesson not to be selfish people. It is easier to live alone with a pet nowadays, it is extreme work to stay in a committed relationship. uuuuuug. I don&#8217;t want to get married. or have kids.  All these stories are pathetic!</p>

																<p>Iagree. Trouble is guys are still inflicting lots of emotional damage to both wives and all their kids. Now they argue about money. So much to not support serial monogimist.<br>
  These guys eventually give up, as soon as wife two or three gets fed up with his haraum of breeding females.<br>
    Too bad for him. These men are unstable and like this attention. Usually the tug of kid and money war ends up between his women, but kids get hurt.<br>
  Wish I had known and at w3 got blinded by a serial marriage deserter. Sucks.<br>
   37 year marriage 4 kids and he repeated history..probably during our marriage too.<br>
  Yea, I filed AFTER our kids were grown. I knew he was a toot after a short while&#8230;decided to stay for them,all ours. Wish I hadn&#8217;t.<br>
    They suffered greatly by his self centered behavior.</p>

																<p>Try having your husband earn a commission income and his CS only being based on his highest quarter of the year not the entire year. So on an average he pays 45% of his net income in CS for 1 child. This doesn&#8217;t seem ridiculous, right. Well he has 2 children living in our home with us that they don&#8217;t account for because there&#8217;s no CS order for them. Can we get a CS order for them in order to have the other order reduced to take the 2 children in the home in account. No, because they live with both parents is what we&#8217;re told. Apparently, the 1 child not in the home is more important than the 2 children in the home. FYI just venting here the whole system is messed up.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m also on each side here, but mainly at the moment I&#8217;m afraid. I have four children, all of them I had very young (20 when the youngest was born). Yes I made mistakes, but all of that is over now and the children are here, so please no &#8220;you should have thought of that&#8230;.&#8221; stuff. Situation&#8230;The children have 3 different dads. The oldest one&#8217;s (16) father has paid a grand total of $700 since he&#8217;s been born. The second one&#8217;s (15) father paid a total of $200 until he was 5, at which time he took me to court and won custody (we now have joint, with him being primary) My other two, 11 &amp; 13, belong to my husband of 14 1/2 years. Unfortunately, all of the baby making I was doing kept me at home with kids and not in school due to child are expenses. My husband has no formal education including diploma or GED. He is now working 79 hours a week just to pay bills and buy groceries. My son&#8217;s father never asked for support, so when my son came to live with me for 3 years, I did not either, I just continued to struggle and do without for them. But then my son wanted to move back to his father&#8217;s, which is cool as I felt he was old enough to decide. He then stopped calling me, stopped answering his phone, and would not return my calls. I received NO call on mother&#8217;s day even! Then two weeks after mothers day he called and asked to meet with me. I was so excited, then I found out he only wanted to meet with me so that he could ask for me to pay for half of basketball camp. I told him I would do my best, but deep down knew there was no way I could come up with it. Then I get no more phone calls and a child support petition. </p>
<p>Now to why this scares me&#8230;I currently work only 4 hours a day because I am in school full time for a dual medical degree. But also, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis back in 2008 and have since had a severe relapse causing severe fatigue and heat sensitivity. This in itself limits the jobs that I can work. Then taking into account my cognitive difficulties, I am having a very hard time in school, and was going to leave work so that I could focus completely on school. I need a very high GPA for employers to consider me even with my limitations, and I WILL fail courses if I have to work too. That happened to me last semester and I have to take my classes from that semester over again. I have no fatigue in the mornings, but it&#8217;s extremely rare to get an employer to &#8220;give&#8221; you morning shift and the only way I can get a good private practice job is if I can get to the top of my class. </p>
<p>I will struggle through this, but I already have to take my children to goodwill for school clothes. My son&#8217;s father makes about 3,200 AFTER TAX, I make 720 a month before taxes. Paying an extra $100 a month will most certainly make my other children go without a few meals. His father has 3 brand new vehicles, one they just bought my 15 year old who won&#8217;t even be 16 until next year. They bought him a brand new ipod4, $700 worth of brand new school clothes. They go to the local amusement park every month, to the beach every other weekend, and have been on 3 cruises just this year. I have to write bad checks just to get gas for the children&#8217;s doctor appointments. </p>
<p>My daughter was just diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and I have to take her 3 hours away to the only pediatric specialist in the area. My left recently because of all the financial stress we were under and now he pays the vehicle payment and $200 a month in child support, but that is it. We have nothing, less than nothing, and it will not get any better if I can&#8217;t graduate because my field has no open positions to anyone that was mediocre in classes. I tried for disability, but even a disability lawyer told me that I have no hope of winning if I was not in a wheelchair. But, to be honest, I don&#8217;t want to be disabled, I WANT to work, it just really can&#8217;t be after about 7pm because after a long day the fatigue and cognitive issues take over and I&#8217;m completely drained. I think I can work a full 8 hours, but what if I can&#8217;t? Then what?</p>
<p>Please forgive me, but I have no sympathy for my son or his father because I guarantee he is not going without, but the rest of them are and it hurts my soul to see it. I am trying to give them that kind of life, but crap keeps knocking us back down, and the government has no sympathy for the working class. My son even told me that he is working for his dad&#8217;s friend and making $10 an hour, so my brat makes more money than me!! I could put my 16 year old to work, but I want him to take advantage of education unlike me, so that he will not have to live this way. </p>
<p>Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t mind paying it. I never have, I&#8217;d he asked for anything for my son, he always got it, but he ne&#8217;er asked for anything that wasn&#8217;t needed like basketball camp. We have eaten Lima beans and cornbread for three nights in a row because there is nothing else, or no money for anything else. While I see on his Facebook that they all go out to Applebee&#8217;s &#8220;at least once a week for family time&#8221;. I have no faith in a family court system that will take from the 3 children that live with me and give to the one living with his father. These kids see me struggling and say there is no hope for their future, and honestly I am inclined to agree at this point.</p>

																<p>Its easy to form an opinion but at the end of the day it all comes back to communication between the 2 exes. You say your husband cannot be in the same room with the ex-wife yet they both moved on!! There is the problem, if they both put these kids first and settle the matter amicably for the benefit of the kids, you would have a better work out. But if he dished out jerk that&#8217;s what he will get back. However, if he treats the ex-wife with respect I know she will work around the numbers and cut him some slack. If he is feigning responsibility and turning the ex-wife to be the demon, she will return the favor the best way available to her. As for you new wifey, this could easily be you in her place where you fight for your kids rights to all they can get. So move forward with caution coz this kind of guy just might do the same to you. Be nice to the ex and she will compromise. Until you have kids, focus on your own home and work with what you have left. In the meantime caution your husband to be a man and sit down with the ex-wife to resolve these matters as a family. In fact courts appreciate when parents can work out these issues without the hand of the law. Its simple but idiots try to make it so hard</p>

																<p>Theres a lot of crappy advice on here. </p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that your situation is unfair. When you pay child support it would be silly to think that all your money is going towards supporting the children. The contrasting differences between income and lifestyles is obvious and theres no real way to justify paying that much support. Kids don&#8217;t have to have every thing in the world anyways. You either accept it as the normality of life or you get a new lawyer and or fight it.</p>
<p>Both aren&#8217;t easy solutions, but they&#8217;re solutions.</p>

																<p>Any advice for me?</p>
<p>I am paying 50% of my net income in support with 10% additional in arrears. Approx. 1700 a month! I have a good job, so does she. I cannot afford this amount and keep my life together. My rent, car ins and car payment are more than what I take home per month. I cannot afford these three bills, and that does not even include my internet service, cell phone, power, food, or gas. </p>
<p>I am a manager and I need internet and cell phone for work, not an option there. I also travel a great deal for work, cannot really downgrade my vehicle.</p>
<p>As well I have a new child that is 5 mos. old now that is not from the ex wife.</p>
<p>Exwife has changed the childcare to new places that are cheaper too.</p>
<p>I have an attorney still, but he never seems to get me any results. Issue is that I have already paid him thousands and don&#8217;t want to start with another attorney and pay again&#8230;.</p>
<p>What should I do, what are my options?</p>

																<p>I live in Texas and they are not suppose to take the new wife&#8217;s income into consideration. That&#8217;s her income not his.<br>
I&#8217;m a custodial Mother and my ex is to pay 20% of his income towards child support. I have a friend that married a man who has 2 kids from a previous marriage and she feels like most new wives do.. she loves the kids but it upsets her that her new families finances aren&#8217;t what they could be because the ex is getting a portion of his income. My friend actually has his kids on her insurance because it&#8217;s cheaper for them that way. It&#8217;s definitely a tough spot to be in I&#8217;m sure.<br>
My only advice would be to not get involved or married to a man with kids with someone else. It&#8217;s really the only way to make sure your income isn&#8217;t effected and you don&#8217;t have to worry about how you can&#8217;t afford to have your own children because your ex has to give part of his income to his ex. My friend is struggling with the same problem.. she wants kids but doesn&#8217;t see how she can afford it. She&#8217;s already working 2 jobs trying to make up for the loss of his income that goes to child support. I feel bad for her, but that&#8217;s just the way it goes when you get married to or in a relationship with a man who has kids with someone else. Not much you can do about it I&#8217;m afraid. </p>
<p>LIke Rachael said, if you do go ahead and have a child of your own with this man, yes you can get the child support reduced, but it won&#8217;t be that much. The ex will still get a good chunk of his income and if you&#8217;re lucky he&#8217;ll get to keep $75-150 of his money each month to raise your own child. So might not really be worth it as it will still be a struggle as the first mom to the mans children always gets the most child support. Even in the event y&#8217;all have a child and if things don&#8217;t work out, you&#8217;ll only get a fraction of the child support that Mom #1 gets for her children.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;ve just recently gotten raped by the courts for CS, too.  I will tell you this. I cannot afford to live.  Period.  The courts do not care. Period. Get a second job? Can&#8217;t.  The ex can then take me to court and raise support.  Can&#8217;t get a second job on the books.  Period. Cost of living raise?  Don&#8217;t want it bc the ex will take it.  The system makes you want to be a deadbeat.  The system makes it impossible to retain the same standard of living for the children from one house to the other. At my ex&#8217;s, they get everything.  At mine, I can barely afford to feed them. My car is probably going to be repossesed. There will be no Xmas for my children. I make too much to qualify for any assistance.  In short, I&#8217;m screwed.  Best advice I can give.  DO NOT GET MARRIED AND DO NOT HAVE KIDS. I love my kids, but life would be much easier without them.  And, by the way, child support does not go to the kids in the majority of cases.  It funds the social lives of the ex.  Take off the rose colored glasses people&#8230;child support is alimony.  My ex is remarried and living off his new wife.  Her income is not considered.  He has no expenses.  The state doesn&#8217;t care.  Period.  The system is unjust as hell.  I get why people run to other states and leave their kids behind to avoid paying. I get why people take under the table jobs and thus hide income.  The state doesn&#8217;t care,  the ex doesn&#8217;t care. Money is a motivator.  Money is a controlling factor.  Money makes you hate and resent and therefore makes it harder for the two of you to get along.  And again,NO ONE CARES that you can&#8217;t afford it.  I would run if I could&#8230;if I could leave my kids, I would. But I cannot bear to do that, so I will probably be homeless in a few weeks but at least HE WILL GET HIS DAMN MONEY. And the system is not gender-biased either, only income biased.</p>

																<p>I would really like to meet a father that while married used 60% of his income on his child or children.  Alimony is also absolutely ridiculous 80% of the time, I&#8217;d  loooooove to see a wife set her husband up with a &#8220;certain type of lifestyle&#8221; and then have to keep him living it after divorce HA!</p>

																<p>My husband has 3 kids with his ex wife, mind you we are military, up until recently we shared 50/50 custody with his ex, week on week off. He pays his ex $2150 a month with this arrangement. She has been unemployed for 3 years and recently she has moved to the east coast with her new husband. We still have to pay his ex $1200 a month, while his children are with us 100%. Tell me California isn&#8217;t jacked up. Where do they come up with these #&#8217;s? Who receives child support when they have no kids with them?.</p>

																<p>I am a single mother who receivers child support, 1100, from a military dad, he has to pay 72% of my daughter&#8217;s expenses.  He has an exwife and recently remarried, and is expecting a new baby in Feb, he took me to court to reduce his obligation, and the court reviewed my documents and his and ADDED an increase to his support, lol. He makes about 100k a yr, so it&#8217;s nothing to him but it does hellp me cope when I think of it, took me to court 3x and all three times they found in my favor, so careful what you might ask for. I am employed but don&#8217;t make as much as he does and when I file my taxes I do add the child support in there. So he gets some benefit and I claim my child but they dont&#8217; tax him on the CS, they tax me which is fine with me, I don&#8217;t care really, the money goes to my daughter.  I pay all the expenses for my child out of my own salary and have the CS going in to an investment account for which my daughter is the sole heir and the only one that can take money out, we can all put money into it, but only she can take money out and I also use a portion of it for her college fund, so if the ex-wife really is thinking about making life better for her children, she might want to do something like what I am doing for my child.<br>
My child&#8217;s father used to hate me and complained that I was wasting the CS on myself and when I showed him what I was doing with CS he got mad and said it was for spending on my daughter and for her to enjoy but it&#8217;s also for me to take care of her, granted I dont need it so I use it sole for her benefit and our daughter will thank mom and dad for a free ride to college and financial freedom at 25, and my ex? he can blow kisses out the window for all I care and his wife, she can blow kisses out the window too, she blames me for all his financial issues, when it was the first wife who put him in financial hardship, took half of everything including, two houses, cars, vacation home, retirement pay, savings etc. I only get child support and its only a fraction, so you all new wives need to chill out.  My husband doesnt care one iota as long as her daddy spends time with her, he doesnt care about the money.</p>

																<p>Being a father of 2 kids, the xwife wanted to live with her parents forever and not move away, so I divorced her as that was no condition for kids to be living.  Make a long story short, 60%+ of my paycheck is gone, anytime she thinks she needs money she cries to child support and they tack it onto me, deducting more from my paychecks without my knowledge.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even get to be responsible and make the payments myself, they just garnish what ever the hell they want out of my paycheck.</p>
<p>In the 2 years since that I divorced her, she has gotten a new car, new place to live, new top of the line cell phone, Put a pool in the backyard, purchased tablets for her parents, gets the bonus&#8217;s from taxes for the kids, but I can&#8217;t see the kids unless She approves it, and when she think&#8217;s It&#8217;s ok&#8230;. The only reason for our divorce was she was acting like a child, not wanting to leave the nest, now I&#8217;m stuck without my kids getting to see me, i&#8217;m lucky if i get to talk on the phone, any gift I get the kids, they never talk about it&#8217;s like they never got them, or they never get put together, always get put off, and I pay for all this&#8230;  Only time I hear from her is OH this came up and I need MORE money but i&#8217;m not a gold digger.</p>
<p>The only way out it seems is 160mph into a brick wall.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t afford anything, got a beater car, live with my parents, school loans I just can&#8217;t pay so they have garnished wages as well, because I have no money, but she makes twice what I do.  </p>
<p>I can really see why people snap and do crazy shit.</p>
<p>I love my kids and want their life to be the best it can, but what about my life? What about her just pissing the kids money away?</p>
<p>Courts don&#8217;t care, they just up the % I have to pay anytime I try to re adjust,  I got laid off for 3 months, and they wanted me to pull money from where the sun don&#8217;t shine to pay her or they threatened to sue me and put me in jail, ya that will get you the money you want, put me in jail.</p>
<p>I would love to see my child support payments accounted for by receipts, i&#8217;m sure she is buying everything HER heart desires, which is not a needed for the kids.</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t wait for the day I get to sit down with my kids and let them read what their mother says and let them see what she did as to why their dad is not around.</p>
<p>I took her to court for child visitation rights, which now accounts for me to take a required drug test before I see my kids? wtf is this shit?  Being dead would be so much peaceful.</p>

																<p>Here&#8217;s one for you all&#8230;<br>
My husband has a daughter and a son.  Daughter is soon to be 16 and son is 20.  20 year old was 18 at time of divorce and wasn&#8217;t considered in CS.  We pay 1200/month for daughter.  I married him this past April and have a settlement from my ex in the bank.  We recently purchased a home.  I used part of my settlement as a downpayment, the rest is mortgaged.<br>
Very little communication with his ex and both kids live with her and unfortunately very little communication with them as well.<br>
Went to court last fall to clarify alot of the double talk in the decree.  Some things were ironed out others not so much. Decided to revisit in 6 months.  Within this time like I said we purchased a home together.  It was either purchase one or rent one.. monthly payment is pretty much the same.  I am currently seeking employment and hope to soon find something.  We will be making our bills &#8230; but it will be tight until I find a job.  We won&#8217;t be living lavishly that&#8217;s for sure.  I have some of my settlement left over and will be purchasing a few pieces of furniture so we have something in the house we just bought.  lol Neither of us has much of anything.<br>
My concern is what his ex reaction will be in court this spring when she learns we purchased a home.  As I said it was purchased using my settlement for downpayment etc.  Not a cent of his income has been touched and won&#8217;t be touched except for mortgage payments and bills which we had anyhow, with rent/utilities.<br>
Is there anything she can do or say about this?  As I said I&#8217;m worried because she will think we are living luxuriously due to us BUYING a home when in reality it was a foreclosure and a steal basically and again we used my settlement from my divorce, when in reality we will be living paycheck to paycheck until I find a job.</p>

																<p>Hi Everyone! I am too in a similar situation, partner has 3 kids from two moms and we have a daughter together, the financials stress caused us to separate because my daughter was not taken into account in his child support orders so he could not help me, we had to separate and  put a child support order just so he would be able to help me support his daughter (his idea) we then got back together and are not suppose to, we would like to get married but can&#8217;t since the support he provides is vital. The irony here is that CS is suppose to be in the best interest of the children, it would be in the best interest of my daughter to live with both of her parents, but because she would not get accounted for if her parents are happily married her parents need to be separated so that daddy can help support her too, this I think is very unfair, why should a child in a family be treated differently, they too have the same needs as the other children. So we are simply not getting married, not &#8220;officially&#8221; living together, and I am planning on buying a house/condo since rent would be the same, he definitely can&#8217;t be on the loan either, if something happens to him (god forbid) I would not have to pay CS, but the mothers can come after his estate.</p>

																<p>My story is just alittle different from all these.  I am a single male raising someone else&#8217;s child.  I was in a relationship (gay) and my partner past away.  We took in his sister&#8217;s child when she was born.  When he past away, I made the decission to raise her on my own.  Things changed when I lost my job and had to resort to welfare.  That&#8217;s when welfare decieded to go after the mother.  Now things are bad between the mother and myself.  She is very angry with me by taking money from her.  I feel that if I am raising her child, which she never wanted, she should help pay for expenses.  I am now employed, but I am not stopping any of the support!!  She needs to take responsibility like everyone else that has children.</p>

I disagree you took on a child and all responsibilities just because governments make it possible for you to bleed money of someone else doesnt make it right .By your money for nothing attitude parents who adopt should be able to seek child support . And that also makes sperm donors liable .You want the child and somebody else to pay you for the privilege .</p>

																<p>Wow that is a horrible situation! Your post was from 2011, so I hope it&#8217;s been resolved by now. You need to make a motion to modify child support. If it&#8217;s affecting your life and putting you in a crisis you can get the amount you pay per month lowered. I&#8217;m actually going through a situation like this right now. My baby daddy went to court without me knowing about it because the court didn&#8217;t have an updated address for me, so I never showed up and he suspended my visitation, received full custody, and sued me for child support. I haven&#8217;t gotten to see my daughter for about two years now, and the last time he got money out of my paycheck last year I lost my apartment, got put in debt, and lost my job, and my car was supposed to be paid off last year and March, but he kept getting my money I was going to make a car payment with. It&#8217;s been so hard to pick up on my feet because I can&#8217;t get any free legal help, and attorneys are so expensive, and I haven&#8217;t even been able to start building a savings. I just now started getting back on my feet because of my bf. I know how you feel and I just hope you&#8217;ve gotten out of that mess, but if you&#8217;re not then you need to file a motion to modify child support, and if you can&#8217;t afford an attorney yet you will need to find the paperwork to file yourself online or you can get the paperwork to file from the court clerk if you know exactly what it is. Please let me know your results!</p>

																<p>I was living a certain lifestyle prior to the recession. However, as for many people, the recession left me in a situation where that lifestyle had to be altered. I don&#8217;t see the U.S.Government designating anyone to allocate funds to me just because i was accustomed to a certain lifestyle prior to the fall.  Why is it assumed that a parent who has been unemployed or a homemaker and &#8220;accustomed&#8221; to the luxury of being part of a team where the other half takes on the responsibility of being the primary breadwinner, is afforded the assumption that they should be allowed to maintain this lifestyle when a downturn of the relationship occurs?  I am sorry, but as a single parent, I have to be the homemaker and the breadwinner.  Both are hard work.  I think there is strength in independence; the ability to adapt to ones&#8217; situation and troubleshoot (ie get a job and support yourself rather than depending on taking a portion of your ex&#8217;s income) is an incredible lesson about personal responsibility, accountability and strength that one can teach ones&#8217; children.  The lack of personal accountability that is becoming more and more prevalent in the US astounds me and totally depresses me.  Getting married and having children are huge decisions and there are never any guarantees about how it is going to play out.  We should be prepared for the possibility that we might end up having to carry on the entire weight of the responsibility alone and realize that lifestyle changes will be part of that responsibility.  I realize that people always take issues too far&#8211;to the extreme&#8211;people abuse the system at both ends.  But good lord people!  People having to move to a trailer park to make alimony/childcare payments while the other stays unemployed or minimally employed and receives monthly handouts?  When did we stop being responsible for ourselves?</p>

																<p>I realize this is an old blog, but I found it while searching for help with additional expenses besides child support. I have a great deal of experience in matters of child support and have been dealing with my husband&#8217;s ex and children for 7 years now. Child Support for him changes every few months, because his ex is never happy with the amount, and finds loopholes and ways to get more. Mistakes have been made and in total, my husband has paid $15,000 IN EXCESS in CS than he should have over the past 6 years. He can&#8217;t get that back, even though these were mistakes made by the court, fraudulent expenses submitted by the ex wife, etc. If you don&#8217;t &#8220;settle&#8221; or allow the Judge to rule, then you go to a mini trial, and that costs approx $20k. My husband&#8217;s ex has no attorney and is &#8220;pro se&#8221;, and my husband has had (6) attorneys over the years. None of them have made it past ONE motion due to his ex wife and all her craziness. She is a sociopath who only cares about money and hurting my husband. She continually abuses him financially, but has committed the worst offense &#8211; Parental Alienation. She has made both my husband and the children suffer deeply over the years. One child disowned him, and the other has been so severely brainwashed, that they are in weekly therapy together. My advice is this: don&#8217;t EVER rely on your attorney. They do not really do what is best for you and they care about other things like, how well they settle a motion, how they look in front of the judge, etc. My husband&#8217;s attorneys will make him pay an initial retainer of let&#8217;s say $2,000, which is a great hardship for us, but then once they get a taste of his ex wife and her antics, they double, sometimes triple the payment to $6,000. My advice to all of you is this: ALWAYS do your own research and never settle for somethign that doesn&#8217;t feel right &#8211; don&#8217;t trust your attorney to do the right thing. They have different motives for doing things and I have seen it all!!  You are ALWAYS allowed to ask for proof of things, so make sure you ask for proof for expenses. We deal with an ex who submits fraudulent expenses and gets away with it. My husband once paid the kid&#8217;s medical insurance for months, only to find out, they didn&#8217;t have any and this $700 a month credit was going right into her pocket. Finally now after 7 years, child support has been adjusted to a somewhat &#8220;fair&#8221; amount, which is about 40% of my husband&#8217;s net pay. I did not think this was fair years ago, but he was up to nearly 55% of his pay going to the children at one point. The problem is, the ex isn&#8217;t happy with this, and she keeps finding reasons to get more and more money. She will &#8220;spend&#8221; just to screw my husband and has a real sickness. We realized that there was no way she could afford all these expenses either, and this is when we caught her committing fraud. She also has a second job with additional income, but has refused to disclose it, and no Judge has ever pressured her to do this! It is amazing what I see people get away with in court and the trick is what my husband ex&#8217;s does:  she brings up SO many issues and problems that the Judge becomes confused and frustrated, and barely listens to the important details. In the end, all they care about is the kids, so fair or not, he rules in favor of those kids. There are many vindictive ex wives out there that do this very thing and get away with it. My husband&#8217;s ex hated me from day one, I don&#8217;t know why, I am actually older than she is! She made sure to tell the kids all sorts of lies about me so they hate me too. It is not fair for the fathers out there and how they get raked over the coals for money and when an ex holds back the children from him. My husband didn&#8217;t see his children for over a year because his ex claimed he was a drug addict and alcoholic, and the burden was on my husband to prove otherwise. His ex even manipulated their daughter&#8217;s therapist into believing this lie, and the Judge temporarily took away his priviledges to see his children until the therapist could &#8220;work&#8221; things through. Now my husband is working with a therapist who has totally made a 360 turnaround, but alittle too late. His daughter is already alienated and it has taken a year to get back on track &#8211; and they are still only at one visit a week. This is still not right, but he has to go slow because the therapist thinks this is best. The ex wife presents my husband with expenses that total just as much as child support each month, so he is actually paying double. In family law, there are no real rules and laws, and it is all up to the discretion of the Judge. I have seen the most bizarre things happen that are so UNFAIR. Each lawyer that my husband retained in the past 6 years, represented him ONCE in court and then either &#8220;quit&#8221; or told him they would have to charge double to continue to deal with his ex wife. THIS is what she wants! She writes and calls these attorneys incessently, sometimes 10 times per day. She is pro se, so they have to answer her just like they would an attorney, if she had one. She thinks she can get away with murder, and does! My husband just lost his latest attorney who went from charging him $2,000 for a motion, to $5,000 for the next motion. After child support, my husband makes $40,000 a year &#8211; not alot. He cannot afford an apartment, vehicle, any expense above and beyond food and commuting to his job. His ex makes the same salary as my husband, plus gets his $2,000 a month in CS, another $1,000 from social security (death benefit). She has a side business that no Judge has ever made her disclose, but my husband knows she makes between $5-$10k per month. She nickels and dimes him for $10 items, making him pay half, $5. She sends him an invoice every month, where she spends thousands on medical bills for a 13-year old and a 19-year old. These aren&#8217;t babies that need constant check ups. She spends excessively as a way to hurt my husband and vowed years ago that he would have &#8220;no life&#8221; if he left her. Those who haven&#8217;t seen it with their own eyes will say, why would she screw herself like that, but she DOES because she is a sociopath who would rather HURT my husband and be vindictive. The worst part of it all is that she is a pathological liar and thief, and she will lie about anything,under oath, and has NO fear. It is important to mention that she has been in jail for embezzlement and fired numerous times for stealing at various employers. Wehn we tell the Judge these things, he doesn&#8217;t care! She explains it as if it was a &#8220;bad&#8221; time in her life, and viola, no repercussions. If it was the other way around, and my husband was in jail and lying under oath, he would be in jail right now! She alienated the children and abuses him financially. NO lawyer has been able to get a Judge to see this or sort the lies from truth. She confuses the Judge and everyone in the courtroom to the point where the Judge just wants the case over, so knows nothing more than to do what is in the best interest of the children. She is the most manipulative person I have ever known. Does anyone know what expenses are considered &#8220;frivilous and unnecessary&#8221; for children? When I went through my own divorce, we went to economic mediation and were told that contact lenses, cable TV, cell phones, vacations, and even our pets were considered &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; expenses. The economic mediators told us if we couldn&#8217;t afford our divorced lifestyle, we needed to get rid of these items above. How do you tell your children &#8220;Dad and I are getting divorced&#8221; and then say, &#8220;and we cannot afford our dog and cat, so they have to go&#8221;. My husband voluntarily decided years ago to contribute an additional $25 per week for his children&#8217;s extra activities, just so the ex would leave him alone about money. She harrasses him DAILY, sometimes numerous times a day, via email, text, and phone demanding exhorbitant amounts of money. She does not include him in ANY decisions regarding the children, and she is allowed to spend whatever she pleases and then demand he pay half. The bottom line is:  do your homework and don&#8217;t rely on anyone to do it for you. Research everything, ask tons of questions, and realize you are entitled to PROOF for expenses, and any information you want about your children. Don&#8217;t ever let an ex spouse hold back any information from you. Always demand to be involved in the decision process, where your opinion counts. Get an invoice, proof of her payment, insurance company EOBs for medical, and call directly and verify these expenses. I have seen everything from his ex &#8220;whiting out&#8221; an invoice to change dates/amounts, to providing false invoices that don&#8217;t exist that she typed up herself. Your lawyer and the Judge will NOT be fair and the only way you may get close to &#8216;fair&#8217;, is by protecting yourself. I came on here to look for a list of expenses that would be considered &#8220;unnecessary&#8221;, does anyone have access to something like this?  Thanks and good luck to everyone here&#8230; some of you are rather harsh and judgemental and obviously have NO clue of the flaws in our justice system that cause severe unfairness to fathers. I sympathize with all father&#8217;s out there who voluntarily pay child support and support their children&#8230;.the Michael Strahan divorce story is good &#8211; read it!</p>

																<p>J.O. &#8211; I wanted to respond directly to your post, if you are still out there. I hope a year later you have remedied this situation somewhat. I do think you need a different lawyer who can present your financial case better. Don&#8217;t listen to these other judgemental writers because they have NO clue what it is like to work hard, and then give more than half to your children. I wouldn&#8217;t do that if I was married still! Children will bleed you from every dime if you allow them, especially children nowadays who feel so entitled. I make my children work for things and pay for their own things and refuse to spoil them. Your husband is also being abused financially, and this is not just about his children, this money is going to his ex wife so her and the children can live a luxurious lifestyle, while you two struggle to get by and have NO retirement. When two people decide to divorce, they know this comes with sacrifices for everyone! I had an economic mediator who told us to get rid of our pets because that was a non-emergency expense! They also said no cable TV, no cell phones, and no contact lenses&#8230; all considered luxuries. While we all want children to have what they need, there is a line, and these fathers should not be forced to have to give up half their salaries so their children can live better than they do and the father barely makes it. It makes you want to go out on disability or unemployment&#8230; whats the point of working hard if it is all taken away from you? I am divorced too, but my ex and I are reasonable about spending and we do not overindulge or punish each other like this.  Suze Ormond always gives good advice and that is, when the airplane is going down and the masks drop, who do you put the mask on first, you or your child? Yourself. You have to save yourself before you can save your child&#8230; financially. You don&#8217;t give up retirement while your kids are living lavishly. The kids can pick ONE activity a season, which is reasonable. Remember, by law, child support INCLUDES all these activities, so your husband needs to look into this. Also, you may want to do what we did and that is to put a &#8220;cap&#8221; on extra expenses. My husband was being dragged into court every 3 months by his ex to pay &#8220;extra expenses&#8221;. This was thousands and thousands of dollars each time, and usually she would &#8220;out talk&#8221; him and she would win. This was before he got a lawyer. The court mediator came up with a dollar amount that my husband pays each week for all extra curricular activities. This amount is $25 per week in addition to child support. This worked for awhile, but now his ex is abusing him by submitting &#8220;medical&#8221; and &#8220;college&#8221; expenses, which are not included in child support. For instance, she allowed the son to take SIX (6) SAT tests in 9 months &#8211; ridiculous and excessive. She allowed the daughter to get new eyeglasses even though she had new glasses from last year &#8211; all because the daughter wouldn&#8217;t wear the old ones because they were babyish. I wanted my husband to fight this expense, but when it turned out to only be $60, we decided it wasn&#8217;t worth it. So while the weekly activity fee worked well for awhile, it isn&#8217;t remedying the problem we have now, which is that his ex emails us daily about this expense and that expense. This might work for you, if your husband&#8217;s ex is more reasonable. Also, make sure your husband puts in his agreement that he wants all proof for these expenses, prior to paying them. For instance, the mother should send a monthly envelope with invoices, showing her proof of payment, and any related information such as an EOB for medical expenses, etc. You then should have 15 days or so to verify the expenses are legitimate, and pay your half. If you make it a little harder for the mother, it may even lessen the expenses. It doesn&#8217;t work with my husband&#8217;s ex witch, but it does work with reasonable people.  I hope things are better for you now.</p>

																<p>@EXPERIENCED IN CHILD SUPPORT. You gave some very good advise. But I just thought that I would mention that extra activities are not always included in the amount that states determine for child support. For example, in Louisiana there is a chart. It lists how much it cost to raise a child. X amount for one child, X amount for 2 and so on. That base amount includes, food, housing, clothes etc. Then on top of that each family is required to submit a list of additional expenses, such as private school, daycare, dance, piano, sports, tutoring or whatever else the child is involved in. The judge then adds that total to the total amount it costs to raise the child (he can disallow items if he feels they are excessive). The total is then divided based on how much each parent makes. The total amount each parent makes is added together and then divided. If the custodial parents makes 60% of the total income and the NCP makes 40%, then the NCP has to pay 40% of the total amount it costs to raise the child to the custodial parent as child support.<br>
My only point is that states can vary wildly in the the way the determine child support, what is allowed as an additional expense and what is not. A friend of mine lives in another state than me and her experience is completely different. The judge said that extras were not allowed, that she had to pay for everything out of her base child support amount. To the original question asker: if I were you I would get a lawyer to help you navigate the system. Best of luck.</p>

																<p>My husband conceived a child during an affair. I didn&#8217;t find out about the child and neither did he until 8 years later. When she notified him that it was his child and she wanted child support. He came clean to me once it was determined the child was his. He&#8217;s now paying child support to this single woman who has 2 more children by 2 different men. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t divorce him because we have 3 children and I know it would devastate them (the only reason we&#8217;re together). It&#8217;s been 3 years since I&#8217;ve found out, and now she is requesting more money, receiving $650 a month now. We are trying to make ends meet, and my children are going without. </p>
<p>What can I do? I know he was wrong, and feel it isn&#8217;t fair that an adulteress can be rewarded money and more money when she had a child with another woman&#8217;s husband.</p>

																<p>I feel better now that I know I am not the only one who is dealing with a husband&#8217;s child support payments.   My husband has 2 children with his first wife.  We have spent THOUSANDS of dollars in lawyer fees over the past 13 years, and still owe him a couple of hundred yet.   My husband pays about $1000 a month in CS along with medical, dental and vision.  And yes, the court wanted my income as well to take in consideration when it came to paying child support.  I don&#8217;t mind that he pays the child support.  What I&#8217;m having a problem with is that we have 2 children of our own.  My husband went through cancer treatments and a job loss.  No matter what, domestics wanted that child support.  She would receive her complete payment, leaving only $20 in his check for all of us to live on.  Most recently, the court took OUR savings account to pay for his arrears.  There was no warning and no reason for this action.  We received no notice that he was even in arrears.  Nothing like waking up to find your savings account GONE!   I&#8217;m devastated and angry over this because the courts are taking money from my children for his 2 other kids.  The money they took was money that I saved from my paycheck for our property taxes.  His ex is remarried so she has her husband&#8217;s income, her income, half of my husband&#8217;s income, and her daughter&#8217;s income.   I have half of my husband&#8217;s income and my income (which is not much).   I watched my dad go through this when he left my abusive mother.  He struggled to survive until my baby brother turned 18.  Now I&#8217;m having to do the same thing.  My children shouldn&#8217;t be punished so that their sisters can live comfortably.</p>

																<p>i think the point being missed here is yes, he has a financial obligation to his first family.  but when he re-married, he ADDED to his obligations to his NEW family and they do not deserve any less than the first.  when HIS baggage of child support is increased, he does what he has to do to take care of his new family, working 2 or 3 jobs if he needs to.</p>

																<p>You missed the point the problem wasn&#8217;t supporting his children or paying cs but about the extras he is forced to pay.  Just because his ex and her new husband can afford to pay for the best extracurricular doesn&#8217;t mean he can.  Most people look at the best that they can find for what they can afford.</p>

																<p>I have to agree with d.  It is legalized fraud.  It is a very unfair, outdated system that displays blatant bias.  Unfortunately, I do not think there is a way to change it.  Fathers are an unspoken for minority within the child support system.Yes, fathers have an obligation to support their children.  Not even going to argue that point.  But they should not be treated like criminals when they do support them.  For those that pay child support, it is like being on probation.  Every time a father goes to domestic relations for any reason, he is treated like a criminal regardless of the situation.  I have experienced this time and time again.  As for the nay sayers, I guarrantee that you have never walked in the shoes of the father or have been on the receiving end of Domestic relations.  Someday I hope that your life, or the life of a loved one, is affected by our family court system that way you can experience the pain involved with it.  Then you may not be as quick to pass judgement on the fathers that are caught in the tangle of the court systems.  It is a true american tradgedy.</p>

																<p>My husband has 2 kids from a previous marriage.  His ex-wife came from a lot of money, received a huge trust fund and a huge inheritance.  She owns two homes (worth about 600K) and has hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank.  She has spent about $200K on very expensive private schools for the kids, who are now in 11th and 12th grades.  The kids have never gone without&#8211;iPhones, Mac laptops, Kindles, iPods, trips to France, etc.  She and my husband make about the same income&#8211; $55K/year&#8211;so clearly she and the kids are not living within the means of her income and child support.  Until now, my husband&#8217;s child support was based on the amount from during their divorce 12 years ago&#8211;which was about $600/month.  She has now taken him back to court to get the maximum amount of child support, plus pay for college!!  My husband has no savings, no assets, no retirement from paying child support and trying to have a small semblance of a life.  I have worked my way through 3 degrees and I have a good job and income to reflect that.  I have a child from a previous marriage as well.  When we married 3 years ago, I bought a house big enough for all of our children to come and visit and he pays me &#8220;rent&#8221;.  I pay for everything in our household&#8211;he can only afford to pay about 15% of our bills.  Now that I am in the picture, she is deposing me and all of my financials so that she can prove we have &#8220;means&#8221; to pay for college.  So essentially, he will be court-ordered to pay for college that he cannot afford (on top of child support) based on my income and assets.  As I have a child (and I don&#8217;t receive child support becuase i never wanted it) I feel that this is hurting me and my child unfairly to favor his children who have literally never suffered for anything in their lives.  The fact that she has almost $1M in assets and he has none doesn&#8217;t seem to matter to family court.  Contrary to some opinions, no, I didn&#8217;t sign up for this when I married.  I don&#8217;t care if he has to pay child support at the maximum level for our state.  That&#8217;s fine with me.  What I&#8217;m bitter and resentful about is that I&#8217;m expected to provide &#8220;means&#8221; for college for HIS KIDS while my own goes without. Sorry but family court is a joke.</p>

																<p>Why did he not go back and try to lower his support? Was the trust fund not brought up at his orginal hearing? If so then he had a sucky lawyer. It is woman like her that give mothers who go without for their children while their husbands new wives hide all their money!! WHy not try something scummy like Christine on here suggests. Be a total sleaze like her, obviously your husband is not like hers, he puts himself first and of course Christine!! Anyhow, you do not say whether you get child support? If you don&#8217;t you should be getting it. Your husband needs a good lawyer, I do not think your income can reflect her support. I am fairly certain it might help a bit, (meaning he has you to pay for much of the bills, but unless you are extremely wealthy, it will not help his ex to go after your money) but overall, your money can not be expected to pay for his kids education. College should have been brought up in his original agreement and if it wasn&#8217;t then once again he had a sucky lawyer. If it was brought up, his ex will have to prove what has changed in your husband&#8217;s life that would allow for him to pay for that. Marrying you is not change enough (I am fairly certain of that). So she should no have a chance, your ex should prove how she travels and spends money and that he should only be responsible for his fair share. Sorry you have to go through that, this lady sounds horrible, but sadly I do not think she is the norm. I am certain she isnt. Good luck.</p>

																<p>Me and my ex are still in a battle with child support. We went to court and I had to show bank statements for the last year and taxes from the year prior and pay stubs. I have my son 80% over night stays and he has him 20%. He had his own business and on his financial affidavit he put on there that he makes $300 less than I do and I only make $10 dollars an hour. He says he has all this money and he had two truck, two cars , two trailers and a boat but he can never pay his child support on time. I finally went to an attorney to get him to be able to show proof of his income because im trying to go for an increase in child support to make it half of the cost that will take care of out son so he never had to show anything he just put a number on paper that was less than my income. How am I able to prove what his income is. My attorney said that I would have to go to a accountant in family law but it will cost me 5,000 and I can&#8217;t afford that. Is there any other way? I know his income annually is about 75,000 at least!</p>

																<p>So since the reader posted and said that her income is not considered in her husbands Child support order, there is really only one explanation, because 60% is far above what the percentages are for two kids in any U.S. state. In my opinion the husband owes his ex arears, meaning that he was supposed to pay a certain amount of support for a number of months/years but failed to do so or failed to do so through the department of revenue. I am curious to know if the reader attended all of the court dates with her husband. Most states do not take into account a spouses income and only use half the value of jointly owned property as assets. I really just dont believe there is a judge out there that would order child support in the amount of 60% of his income. I believe his paychecks are being garnished for payment of arears. the only other way this would be happening is if the order is being written by criminal court (modifications to a restraining order or something) which is probably not the case since they have visitation and also because any lawyer would tell you to go straight to family/probate court and it would be significantly less.</p>

																<p>I agree. There is more to this than meets the eye. This woman like MANY of the women on here need to stop feeling sorry for themselves. There are children involved, they are adults, they knew this going in. I have no sympathy for anyone on here, Christine is an embarrassment and a disgrace to all fathers and their new wives. No wonder step mothers get the rep of being step monsters, that greedy witch totally fits that bill!!</p>

																<p>I was married for 14 years. I gave my heart and soul to my family. I worked equally with my spouse to provide my family with a beautiful home. I stayed home while our children were young and worked sometimes 2 job to support my spouse and his dreams while he went back to school to earn his masters degree. The deal was, I was going to get my degree once he got settled into his new career. He got in trouble with the law, i put off school to financially carry us through and I worked to pay off the fees for the lawyer to bail him out of trouble and ultimately exponge his record. I got sick and had to stop working for about a year. During that time his career took off due to his education status.He left me and my 2 children with literally the few dollars I had in my pocket. Now I struggle at a minimum wage job to make ends meet. He pays 60% of extra curricular activities and medical after a yearly copay and after school care. What he pays covers for our rent, utilities, the used car and insurance I use to drive them to school and activities and groceries. That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s would have to pay for if we were still married anyway! He no longer pays for school clothes, play clothes, school supplies, shoes, holidays and a million other things kids need on a daily basis. I don&#8217;t know ANY Single mom in my situation thaotsvliving the high life like you all assume your exes wife does. Its a daily struggle where often cable gets turned off so supplies for a science project can be purchased. I&#8217;ve asked him for help in really lean times for milk or christmas gifts from santa and he says too bad, i met my obligations.and then takes his new flavor of the week to italy or vegas or disney ( not the kids, just the girlfriend) that may be all good and fine for you now but Consider if you trulay WANT to have more children in this persons life- he could just as easily treat you and your kids like this one day!</p>

																<p>I just read these post and 65% sounds about right since I, too, was paying about that for two kids as well.  I make about as much as your husband and yes I was taking home about 1100 a month after everything.  I was living like I was getting paid a little less than minimum wage. Bunch of BS but here is how the judge explained the calculation to me.  Since I am a single male who is responsible and has a steady full time job and doesn&#8217;t have any other financial burdens like school or other kids, I was immediatly set at around 50 percent since i had only every other weekend and one evening during the week for visitation.  Granted that each state is different but here in California they base the percentage of visitation on over nights.  So really in the courts eyes I was only having 4 over nights per month.  So I was ok with the 50 percent since I was living on that before I got my current job and did ok.  And by ok I mean living in the ghetto in a small 1 bedroom apartment and driving a 10 year old car with a billion miles on it.  But oh well.  Then the judge asked for extra expenses that my ex was paying like child care, sports, medical bills, etc.  Well here in cali you can expect to pay around 1000 bucks a month for child care in an OK place for two kids so I was set to pay half.  Right there it exceeded my two thirds law on the max they can take.  Well he didn&#8217;t care about that law because up until recently I had around 27 thousand dollars in back support.  Well I had to go to court (both criminal and civil/family) to break down all the charges because DCS had a warrant issued for me eventhough I had been giving 2/3 of my check but yet they wanted more.  Well after that was cleared up and DCS was never held responsible for &#8220;small mistake&#8221; I was finally set for max 2/3.  Now we realize that our children&#8217;s well being is worth more than fighting over money so we came to an agreement where if she reports (with receipts) on actual cost of my boys like daycare, food, sports then I have to pay half and then she has to give me visitation.  Kind of like renting my children but hey it works and we don&#8217;t fight anymore and cost are way lowere.  So I suggest try to get along with the ex and work together and get the government&#8217;s fat head out of your children&#8217;s life.  Take co-parenting classes as much as possible and offer to pay half when you request it from the judge.  The judge will be like &#8220;what the hell&#8221; when your husband goes in there and is like &#8220;we need to work on our co-parent relationship so we can no longer rely on the courts and ultimatly the tax payers pockets and I would like to request as many co-parenting class as you can order and I am willing to pay half if she is ok with this&#8221;.  The judge will then look to her and be thinking &#8220;your kids dad wants to work with you to better the relationship with the kids and you so you better say yes&#8221;.  I will say that the co-parenting I went through made us work together and I started seeing how we were bickering and we started working togther.</p>

																<p>i have been paying for child support, I bring home 2000.00 by weekly, I paid uncle sam 546.00 biweekly, and then I get 775.00 net after child support by weekly, how can I survive with 1550.00 a month leaving in new York, my rent alone is 1100.00 a month. she does not paid rent because she is married with a superintendent of the building, don&#8217;t paid for cable or phone , they even don&#8217;t paid the garage, she is always traveling, while I cant even afford a vacation, to just stay home, I don&#8217;t have a problem supporting mu kids, they are my responsibility, we have three kids, she does not allowed me to claim not even one child on my taxes. I think they need to change the rules of child support, one year she claims them and the other year I claim them but its not like that, I know what the reader that posted this question is going through,</p>

																<p>I can&#8217;t believe the pathetic comments on here. Don&#8217;t marry men who have kids. Plain and simple. If you do, be prepared for all the trouble that comes along with it. Complaining and blaming the ex does not help at all. As a matter of fact, stop focusing on the ex. She has nothing to do with you. And stop using &#8220;we&#8221;! The child support obligation is solely your husband&#8217;s issue. You did not help make his children.</p>

Conversely one could reply: Men with kids should stay with the biological moms of their children forever and not get into another relationship. </p>
<p>Most people here are struggling to get by and usually realize the huge mistake of marrying a man with children from a previous relationship only after the financial stress brings them to breaking point. You really can&#8217;t blame them, since Disney and &#8220;Dad&#8221; both promised everything would be okay.</p>
<p>My boyfriend&#8217;s baby-mama recently informed him that he would have to pay several thousand for his son&#8217;s braces. This decision was taken unilaterally by baby-mama and told boyfriend on the day the child received his braces. So much for prior warning. As a result, my boyfriend can choose to pay for rent or for food but not both. I have gone over his finances thoroughly and I do not really understand how anyone in his position can make ends meet without having a rich wife/mother/father/girlfriend.  Meanwhile his married ex  is able to go on vacation, have two more children and support a menagerie of animals both in the house and housed in rented facilities. I am not sure how she does this since her husband is not working and her job is not that great. The funny thing is  she seems to be a nice person, so I can not even call her nasty names or anything. Ha ha, I actually like her. :) I just hate the situation.</p>
<p>I am not married and I have to admit I am put in the very real and uncomfortable situation of choosing between the man I love and my hopes and dreams which I have striven to achieve alone with much work and study but would forfeit if I married him. This really sucks but it is reality and I am a practical person.</p>
<p>Anyone who say that children are only there for a little while are living in denial. Children are a financial obligation well into their adulthood and any woman waiting until the kids are out of college or until they turn 18 is setting herself up for an unpleasant surprise. If the child is his first priority now and you are second and left to foot the bill you should expect this to be true for your whole relationship until you die nothing will change this. The ex will always be the mother of the first and most important people in his life and you can look forward to you and your family always coming second after his first family.</p>

																<p>Look people bottom line the child support system is a job maker and a cash cow for states. I&#8217;m on child support and I pay $557 a month for one child. My problem with the system is why does it take more to or less to raise my child than the next 9 year old. Why do they combine my income with the mother even though we were never married, and figure out a number for me to pay? Why do they intentionally put you in arrears when garnishing your check and not tell you that your support is due on the first of every month? The messed up thing is that if you pay out of pocket on the first they will still garnish your check anyways. Louisiana Child supports system is designed to put a father in arrears for the first 9 months of the year but they messed up big time. Any one of you fathers that are in arrears may have noticed that they report you to the credit bureau if you are behind on your child support. I have filed a lawsuit against the state of Louisiana under the Fair Credit Reporting Act for reporting me to the credit bureau for arrears but the only reason I have them is because their system is designed to put you there! The good thing is I have a strong case under the Act and I should be receiving a nice hefty sum back&#8230;&#8230;..I SUGGEST SOME OF YOU LOOK A LITTLE DEEPER INTO YOUR SITUATION. Learn to dance in the rain!</p>

Man o man! I feel your pain! Supporting another person sitting on there butt and collecting child support while you help your husband live because he can&#8217;t make it paying her&#8230;story of my life! I married him better or for worse and I will help him any way I can but when I know she is not giving the same amount to the kids and that she feels like we should support her too that is what gets me! No one understands unless your the stepmom taking care of kids 50% of the time, loving them like your own, barely making ends meet basically because you succeeded in your life and had enough pride not to think people owe me instead of working! I am also like you 27, wanting a child of my own, wanting to get off night shift but unable to do so because I have to pay the bills my husband can&#8217;t help with and he could get another job but heaven forbid they will just take more money. Maybe in 7 years they will live with us but I guarantee she won&#8217;t pay us a damn dime!!! This is the world we live in. The good fathers try to move on and do their best and most exs take all they can while they try! I have faith that God will reward me one day and I know he will for you too!!!</p>

																<p>Sadly not actually having children, you have no clue what it entails to raise them. You say you have them 50% of the time, well then if that were actually the case, then you are not giving her a ton!! She has as much money to raise them as your husband. Actually less, because he has yours as well. If you had any clue about all the little things she probably pays for, that you don&#8217;t, then maybe you wouldn&#8217;t bitch like you do. You knew this going in, but apparently you must have figured you would have some control over the situation, well guess what, they were there first. THEY should be his number one concern, not YOU or his ex wife. Stop complaining, if you don&#8217;t want to pay support, try to get custody now. But something tells me you do not want them, you like your free time. Well that is good, but you have to pay for it. Sorry it is just a fact, one you knew all about when you signed up!!</p>

																<p>My  husband had to pay $1,400 in child support each month to his ex wife. It was crippling us. I set up an LLC, and I earn all of my income through it. I work as a marketing associate and earn $61,000 a year. I take a salary of $21,000 a year&#8212;which drastically lowers the amount that is counted against us. The &#8220;business&#8221; pays our mortgage and expenses, and we live on a mere $21,000 plus his part time income. Since the court can&#8217;t order him to pay an amount that would put us below the poverty level, his child support amount was lowered to $50 a month. Yes, this is entirely legal. Ask your lawyer and accountant about this. There are ways to get out from under the debt&#8230;</p>

																<p>I think the best thing you can do is have your husband talk to his ex wife.</p>
<p>My situation is a little different. My exhusband and I do shared parenting. My exhusband does make more money than I do but he also has higher bills. He kept the house we lived in and that came with a high mortgage payment. Since I felt like my kids were being ripped into an unknown territory when we divorced I wanted my kids to have the comfort of the house that they had been raised in. I felt like it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I want the best thing for my kids. Had I requested child support from the ex I knew he wouldn&#8217;t have been able to swing the bills on his own, so I didn&#8217;t. I think talking to the exwife like an adult and explaining the situation is the best thing to do.</p>

																<p>Sadly, HE should have given YOU the house and paid the mortgage, so the kids could live there all the time. (assuming you kept custody?) It is hard to tell from your post if you have custody or if your ex has custody, if your ex has custody, then you are really in no position to be posting advice like that because of course you would not take child support. If you have custody and did not take child support, then you are a fool. Your husband could see the house because if your kids are not living with him most of the time, you uprooted them anyhow. Your ex chooses the lifestyle he has. If you have a great job and do not need his support, then you really are in no position to be commenting on child support anyhow, you do not know that his ex wife does not need the money? She has the children 95% of the time, there are MANY costs that go along with that.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m one of the mothers receiving child support. We do things outside of court and he pays me a little over half of what The court would determine. I did work up until recently when I moved in with my boyfriend and therefore have less bills. I have paid all dental bills myself as well. However to be honest I don&#8217;t want to go to court but feel it is necessary because he won&#8217;t agree on sharing claiming the kids every other year on tax returns which seems fair especially since my state would determine I get to 100%. He doesn&#8217;t pay dental but never brushes their teeth so dental bills are high and says the dentist I chose is too privy but he is good I drive an hour to take them And the kids love him. It is true he is pricy but these aren&#8217;t toys and crap these are their teeth and their comfort. He recently got married to a woman that was formerly on welfare with two financially uncared for children. They married after two months and he is now having another baby. There is possible child abuse going on at the wife&#8217;s families house and he won&#8217;t keep them away from there. I would have been fine not going to court but it is more than necessary and when I get twice as much I&#8217;m child support because I had to take him I&#8217;m not going to reject it. I&#8217;m also planning not to work for two years because I&#8217;m in school full time as an honors student and in an active volunteer group. Between classes I volunteer at my sons school because he has problems. I will get the angry card all the way around but why should I feel bad. The kids are with me most the time and they should be because they are safe and cared for properly with me. I wish I had finished school before I had kids but I didn&#8217;t and my kids shouldn&#8217;t pay for that. There are a lot of single parents in the same situation so I don&#8217;t think it should be so harshly spoken about. It&#8217;s not as easy in either spot and should be dealt with civilly truly based on need but sometimes it has to go to court which is very sad.</p>

																<p>@kack<br>
Baloney on the &#8220;You knew what you were getting into&#8221; and the &#8220;She has as much money to raise them as your husband. Actually less, because he has yours as well.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Did you not read the part about the BM&#8217;s new husband earning 3X what biodad earns?</p>
<p>1.  I was a true single parent in the eighties with ZERO CS and worked 2-3 jobs to support my children WITHOUT alienating (aka trash talking dad) the children.</p>
<p>2. I did not know that this biodad I am currently with would believe ex-wifey about &#8220;owing her his ENTIRE income till eternity&#8221;  something I put my foot down about six months into the deal</p>
<p>3.  In my case, biodad earns 32K a year gross in NYS, yet pays $1K a month non arrears taken out of net income, yet still owes taxes at the end of the day.   He is scared crapless about going back to get a downward mod as a significant part of the CS is for childcare expenses which the BM has not used in over five years.  She is greedy and will find SOME way to increase it.</p>
<p>4.  If it weren&#8217;t for my income, biodad would be living in a cardboard box, never mind a trailer.  He has ten years down and ten more to go at least (21 not 18 here in good ol&#8217; golden uterus centric NYS)</p>
<p>5.  The BM earns 10K+ more than biodad and her new hub earns almost six figures.  The children lack for nothing materially; they have iphones, ipads. take many vacays to Florida and the like.  Yet all three are failing academically as the BM (who is a CPS worker with Cadillac health benefits and retirement) doesn&#8217;t act as a parent but instead BFFs her kids and doesn&#8217;t make they do homework, classwork or even attend school, yet insists they participate in all the extra curriculars despite what the school says.   All the children are hopped up on ADHD meds and anti depressants in lieu of discipline and social mores.</p>
<p>The laws stink.  Custody should be 50/50 with no CS changing hands other than in the case of Parental Alienation.   Whichever parent commits Parental Alienation should IMMEDIATELY and PERMANENTLY lose custody and be ordered to pay CS.  The modern day stay-in-bed Facebook Mom should be outlawed.    And CS should go to 18 not 21+ like it is in many states.   Half of college attendees should be replaced with trade school.  Not every child is college material although community colleges LOVE the &#8220;C.O.D.&#8221; (child of divorce) for whom no bar of expectations was ever held due to sheer pity and &#8220;everyone gets a trophy.&#8221;   Seems today&#8217;s &#8220;institutions of higher learning&#8221; are enamoured of the endless payments for remedial grade and high school non-accredited classes from the &#8220;cash cow&#8221; biodad.</p>

																<p>Very well said, these current laws are unreal and the amount of money some of use are forced to pay is a stick up plain and simple. I feel better if they would come to my home with a pistol and just rob me, at least I&#8217;d have a better understanding as to what&#8217;s really going on.</p>

																<p>I don&#8217;t know about your state, but mine allows a non-custodial parent to petition the court to require an accounting to make sure that the money is actually spent on the children.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been trying to get my ex-wife to use a shared checking account like this one (<a href="http://www.mediate.com/articles/if_they_can_do_parenting_plans.cfm" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.mediate.com/articles/if_they_can_do_parenting_plans.cfm</a>) so that I can make sure that what is labeled as child support is actually spent on the children.</p>
<p>Other questions &#8211; is it worth considering moving to where the ex-wife lives so that the parents could share custody, with no exchange of money between the parents, and is the ex-wife willing to allow your husband to claim the kids for taxes because of the percentage of his net income that he pays in &#8216;child support&#8217;?</p>

																<p>We are in that situations, she lives in the states though. We pay what we can afford, if we paid everything she wanted us too we&#8217;d have nothing. We have a son whos 7 months old together but he doesnt take alot of money. She wants Air jordans for her son, new iphone5&#8217;s for the kids and were like we dont even have iphone5s why would we get it for the kids? then she will say well because he is in canada and we are in the states he should have to buy them more gifts???&gt; He says if he wouldn&#8217;t buy it for him if he were there why would he buy these for them when he&#8217;s here in Canada. Kids for 2 do not cost as much as your husband is paying. The thing is that it isn&#8217;t about the kids its about her greed she&#8217;s going by what they want not what they need. Make an agreement what you can afford and she can take any lessons music, ballet whatever out of that amount. He has to support the kids not go hungry doing it</p>

																<p>each situation regarding child support differs. In my situation, I am the custodial parent and mother who has financially supported and raised my 2 children on my own. My son is 21 and my daughter is 19. Throughout the entire time that i raised them, I have been unsuccessful in having their dad help financially, and be involved with them period. I was surprised when my children&#8217;s father even showed up in court. I was relieved when a court order was issued for the non custodial parent to pay child support for the 19 year old until she turns 21. He didn&#8217;t voluntarily support them on his own. He has not been in their lives since my 21 year old was 9 years old. before that the non custodial father didn&#8217;t help out financially.</p>
<p>The non custodial parent has missed all of the important moments that occurred in his children&#8217;s lives as well as the times my son needed his dad. I have wore the mom and dad hat all along. The non custodial parent who is not active financially and physically in the child&#8217;s life has no reason to complain about paying child support. Better, a court shouldn&#8217;t have to force a person to pay support. The way I see it. After all the years i have been paying the absent parents&#8217; share, i wouldn&#8217;t allow him to dictate what to spend the money on. especially since i have been sacrificing, while paying the non custodial parents, share the entire time. It&#8217;s ludicrous to pick and choose what the money is spent on. The custodial parent did not make the kid on her own. The only thing i would recommend however, to the spouse, married to the non custodial parent, who is paying for child support is; deal with accounts separately as opposed to jointly, and don&#8217;t add the child support as part of the budget you pay out of your pocket. I would arrange everything separately before marriage knowing that their is a child support issue. This way, you don&#8217;t &#8220;make a bed that you haven&#8217;t slept in&#8221;. I have nothing but respect for parents who are there for there children.</p>

																<p>That is a rarity ESPECIALLY in BM-centric New York State.   I too was a single mom in the eighties and held down two to three jobs supporting my children since I received no child support.  </p>
<p>Somehow I still managed not to alienate the children from my ex-husband.  Oh and my now adult children are productive members of society.  More than I can say for the budding felons that the BM in my case is &#8220;raising.&#8221;</p>
<p>My husband I&#8217;m living with now has had his children alienated by the BM, but she sure does love that $1k a month coming in tax free!!  She got what she want.  His wallet and not him as father.</p>

																<p>Everyone is making good points but the fact of the matter is the child support system is not fair. I am a married woman and my husband pays a ridiculous amount of child support. We both work and we also have 2 additional children. What about them? They are suffering because he pays over 2 grand a month in child support. He technically has a good job, but once that comes out and the medical insurance, even with my salary, we barely break even. He is not working the hours he use to either, due to kidney dialysis. The funny thing is we can&#8217;t even afford to go to court to try to get a modification because we can&#8217;t afford a lawyer and I know we can do it ourselves, but we heard it was better to  use a lawyer. I definitely understand that the father is suppose to do his share but why can&#8217;t both parents share the responsibility? She is a nurse who works off and on. Ironically, I applied for child support for my oldest child and never received a dime. When I went through the state with a ss number and address, still nothing and now she is in college. I am not defending the deadbeats, but should everyone be punished? Also remember, there are mothers who pay child support as well and I am sure they are probably struggling too. I don&#8217;t want to offend anyone because I notice on these blogs when someone come in defense of the non custodial parent, the responses are brutal. But what do you suppose to do if you are a dialysis patient who is trying to do the right thing, but once you receive a paycheck, can&#8217;t even afford prescriptions?  When the kids do visit on the rare occasion because she refuses to bring them by or have him pick them up, you can&#8217;t do anything because there is no money? It&#8217;s not easy to go to court if you are going to dialysis 3 times per week. And then you call the state to see if there are any program to help the father and there are none. There should be some balance on both sides.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m divorced in 2004 . These child support laws are way out of hand. I work 6 days a week . Made more then the average bear last year. I&#8217;m flat broke! I lost my biz , my house , I don&#8217;t own a car because fl dept of rev will take it . I have been arrested three times in 10 years because I didnt have money at the time. I live in a bed room at my mother inlaws. As of recently , I have been informed I no longer am allowed to fish. On top of that I have my kids half the summer need to provide for them and pay support. My drivers lic is suspended multiple times a year. I have to drive to work. So if I get into an accident with my kids in the car we are all screwed.  Why we do this to loving caring fathers is beyond my own comprehension. Not only that but now my children are in a higher socio economic class and resent their dads imposed poverty which strains our relationship. we need to change Florida laws and criminalize being a father.</p>

																<p>I just would like to say I am a Woman AND I COMPLETELY understand a lot of men&#8217;s frustration on the matter of child support!! I am a mother of an almost 7 year old and because I didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;stable living situation&#8221; , or a vehicle,  or money to afford a lawyer and the father of my daughter DID have all those things I got COMPLETELY screwed in court during our custody battle that got finalized in 2012 ..he won..I lost. My daughter means the WORLD to me but I was only able to work part time jobs and minimum wage jobs and because I have a few domestic violences on my record cuz my daughters dad was always super quick to call the cops on me bit when he did stuff to me I never once called the cops on him..but I have been turned away from A LOT of good jobs cuz of that..he has One domestic violence but I got like 2 or 3..I&#8217;m not a horrible person but he ALWAYS knew the right buttons to push me off the edge..anyway back to my point..I am COMPLETELY bitter and resentful of the courts cuz let me tell you WHY! For starters my daughters dad had ME served with custody papers saying I was an unfit parent and said many very malicious LIES about me that was just disgusting and appaling ..now let me justsay this too..I may not have been the perfect parent but I loved my girl soooo much I made a lot more sacrifices for her than he ever did hands down..I was the ONLY one scheduling and takimg her to her doctor check ups and dentist appts..when I lost my studio apt I cpuldnt afford my own place so I stayed at friends house and I slept on the floor so she could have the couch. If I only had enough money to feed her I just didn&#8217;t eat..she has ALWAYS been my world and I would do anything for her! Well between her dad and his awfully sadistic mother took me to court..they coached her to say UNTRUE things like that I was spanking her when I had stopped after CPS told me I couldn&#8217;t and I hadn&#8217;t in over a year and all a sudden she&#8217;s scared of me!  They brainwashed her telling her mommy starved her and locked her in a closet and gave her baths in swimming pools and SO MANY other CRAZY HORRIFIC things! I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to say such awful lies cuz its NOT ME..and here is what REALLY blows my mind!! I got served saying I was the unfit parent RIGHT?! My swell daughters dad shows up to the first court hearing HAND IN HAND WITH HIS MOMMY DRUNK!!! Yes! Drunk!!!  He is 5 years older than me..in his 30&#8217;s now and mommy walks him in while he&#8217;s REAKING of booze so much so that the judge WAS INFORMED and he had to do a breathalyzer in the middle of the court room and failed it..got called an alcoholic as he had first told the judge he had a beer and one shot before midnight (YEAH RIGHT!!)  so he got a slap on the wrist and our court got rescheduled and from then on he hired a lawyer..he AND his mother said him drunk that day was 100% MY fault and when we had to do mediation which I KNEW would be a TOTAL waste cuz this ahole is IMPOSSIBLE and he tells me before we went..exact words ill never forget &#8221; I&#8217;m gonna get custody so I can get child support from you so u know how it feels!&#8221; What a vindictive SOB!!! Well needles to say I lost DESPITE EVERYTHING!!  He lied under oath and got called out on it..he showed up drunk and a slap on the wrist but it was never mentioned again..HE STILL WON!!! I went in empty handed but did ALL the things I was spose I was most compliant I didn&#8217;t lie underoath or make up lies about him AND I&#8217;m the MOTHER and lost to that jerk who soley just wanted money from me that I DONT HAVE! So I agree IF HE CANT AFFORD HER THEN LET ME HAVE HER CUZ I MADE IT WORK BEFORE WHEN I HAD EVEN LESS THAN NOW AND I WILL MAKE IT WORK IF I HAD HER!!! at this point I don&#8217;t want a dime from him JUST my girl!!!  Currently I&#8217;m at over $8, 000.00 in arrears and am spose to pay almost $500 a month in child support but I ONLY see her 30 days in a WHOLE year cuz he screwed me there too..EVERUTHING he&#8217;s wanted and asked of the courts EVEN IF I say my wants first he ALWAYS gets what HE WANTS!!! ITS MIND BLOWING!!!! and he has se decision making on EVERUTHING&#8230; I got NO say and since he and his twisted mommy loathe me so much I really don&#8217;t have ANY say..I get MAYBE  a small handful of pix of my girl in a whole year despite me asking..I only hear from her if I call her but she&#8217;s mostly with his mom and she NEVER answers my calls or texts..they won&#8217;t even let me cut my daughters hair and it Desperately needed it ..she hadn&#8217;t had even a trim in a whole year!  They haven&#8217;t taken her to a doctor or dentist AT ALL since he won custody..he just cancelled the appts I had made before I lost and moved out of state but I visited her and my mom and I took her to see the dentist and a doctor and I got her hair trimmed despite what I was told cuz I don&#8217;t want her to look like a scraggley bum!  I don&#8217;t get updates on her..I don&#8217;t know when she&#8217;s sick or if she everr gets hurt..I get nothing!!  He wouldn&#8217;t even put me down at her school as her other parent cuz he told me I wasn&#8217;t one cuz he was the one doing everything for her&#8230;.WHAT THE POOP?!!!? NOW I&#8217;m married and got 2 other babies that live with my husband and I full time..he works full time and I am a stay at home mom I actually am a better person now and still progressing..I&#8217;ve done A LOT of counsiling and I got an AMAZING husband who is helping me WANT to be an even better mom, wife, and person..my oldest daughters dad just got put on house arrest last christmas..isn&#8217;t married and according to her his girlfriend (the one he chose over me a few years back) was asking my girl who daddys new girlfriend is and she told her the name but he&#8217;s still with both..sorry this is soooo long but I got sooooo much resentment and frustration buolt up inside of me cuz of this&#8230;and to all the men out there that think its just you and women get favortized&#8230;we if that&#8217;s true then why did I get SCREWED like this?! I just can&#8217;t wait til my husband can finish school so we can make A LOT more money so we can afford a GOOD lawyer and fight again..this is messed up and this momma ain&#8217;t giving up!</p>

																<p>My hubby has paid faithfully for 13 years on two kids! The ex GF is a welfare whore who smokes dope and will not work. She married a pot smoker who works.

The teenage kids come over with nasty dirty clothes on, have not eaten, and thy smoke cuz mom lets them! I always take them shopping when thy do come over for nice clothes!!! Thy are 14 and 16! I am a mother who supported 2 kids w no child support, maybe just maybe 1,000 their whole life! My kids have always worn name brand clothes and never went without with me supportig them only!!!!! I cannot stand worthless mothers who act like thy cannot MAKE IT and want more money! Called a job! I have worked my whole life and never had to be in any assistant even as a single Mother!!! I worked my ass off to give my kids food on table, clothes on their backs, etc! Still to this day my ex husband owes me 17,000 in bak support which I will never see due to him playing the system! We hired an attorney for my new hubby child support hearing which will cost us around $250 for atty to attend the hearing for us! We are requesting a hair drug test on the mother, cuz we were told she smokes dope in the bedroom! Now we know where the money is going!!!!</p>

																<p>Pretty hard to get the advice your looking for, lots of people have lots of energy. Whatever the case, we are in similar situation, finding ourselves difficult in making ends meet.<br>
The system is flawed.<br>
Simply put, we pretty much have to check our finances every 2 weeks.<br>
Yes, we may have to lose our house if something bad happens. My truck broke down, so now I may not be able to take my kids to school. Don&#8217;t have the money to fix it&#8230;<br>
Its a crappy situation. And it opens the oppertunity for a vindictive ex to say &#8220;you can&#8217;t support your children properly&#8221;<br>
So, what should you do? take it a day at a time. if you don&#8217;t have enough for the phone bill, well, i guess the phone bill doesn&#8217;t get paid. By the time it gets so bad that you might go to Jail?? Well, I guess someone goes to jail.<br>
Sorry, thats my advice. Of course, there&#8217;s always a way to try to reduce the severity of the situation. Like &#8211; go to court and reduce the amount, sell the boat, sell expenses&#8230; etc.. but if you&#8217;ve already done all that, then that&#8217;s the situation we&#8217;re all in. Sorry, there&#8217;s a small light at the end of the tunnel, but I&#8217;m never absolutely sure I&#8217;ll see it come. And I&#8217;ve accepted this.<br>
I am a father of 5, 2 step, 3 my own. I play with them immensely. No regrets.</p>

																<p>I understand the responsibility of the father to provide x dollars or a percentage of income to have the ex wife baby sit.  In my case, I have an ex wife of who lives off of her parents at the age or 45.  Her father is a millionaire.  At present, my children of who I have every other weekend states that their mother doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; taking the summer off to sit for the kids.  I am at 29% of my income for 3 kids.  I am underemployed and am searching for other opportunities.  No more marriage for this man.  Why complicate matters.  So, after all is said and done with better that 50 grand in debt, I make about 5.70 dollars per hour.  Hard to live off of the income that I currently have.  I do perform minimal side jobs as a result that pays very little, but an extra 20 bucks in my pocket goes to tooth paste and toilet paper.  Not to mention that vicious cycle that I am into, I currently live off of the system receiving food and healthcare benefits from the state.  It is difficult to try and better myself in light of being involved in such a bad situation.  No resentment on my behalf.  With all of the opportunities to gain a better employment situation, a rut has formed and no need to continue to better myself.  I have 12 plus years to endure.  In my case, the court serves the wealthy and slams the impoverished father.  If things go bad and jail happens&#8230;what good comes from it.  Terrible system based on traditional values that just aren&#8217;t applicable anymore.  Keep the head up and try to stay afloat for the kids and never focus on the vindictive ex louse.</p>

																<p>I am in both positions. My husband has kids from his first marriage. He pays almost his whole paycheck for child support and insurance for the kids. He could not afford to live on his own. He works 7 days a week (2 jobs full time) so that he can bring some money into our household. Is it hard? Yes. Does him working everyday suck? Yes, but guess what? He made those babies, and he was completely open with me about his financial situation when we started dating. I knew what I was getting. </p>
<p>On the other hand my ex stays purposely under employed to keep low child support for my 2 kids. What he pays literally will cover lunch money for the month. What a joke. They are in sports and activities because they want to be. Who pays for everything? Me. Mom. I work full time and my dh with working 7 days a week. Not only does he support his 3, but he steps up to help support mine and carries us all on his health insurance. My ex has never paid one dime extra and whines about what he does pay. He has a huge arrearage and will not pay unless they find him to take it from his paycheck.</p>
<p> Is it hard? Hell yeah! Did I know what I was getting? Yes! At least I was getting a real man who works his ass off to support his kids and family and does not try to cheat the system. I will take husband number 2 and be poor for several years 1000X over. </p>
<p>So basically, my advice is sorry, it is what it is. Is your husband worth it?</p>

																<p>Hi everyone im 17 and Im in love with my ex, I&#8217;m still trying to get her to come back to me but she&#8217;s not ready to be serious. She is 16 and she is pregnant with my child. She says she doesn&#8217;t want me to have to pay child support because I am not a dead beat dad. When I found out first that she was pregnant instead of doing what most teenage fathers do(run) I got a second job and I finished my junior year of high school. I am currently waiting to enroll for my last year coming up in august. My question is it required of me to pay child support if she does not ask for it? I am not greedy and I want to make the best life for my child. I want me and my ex to get back together but I don&#8217;t see that happening. So for now I&#8217;m planning on working and getting my education to be finally ready to support my child and keep him happy. Take in mind that I haven&#8217;t spent a dime on myself, all my money has gone to my ex when we were together to keep her healthy and happy and now it is currently going towards things for my child.<br>
I want to finish school and get my degree and I also want my ex to do so as well, because im still in love with her, how will that be possible for my side if I have to pay absurd amounts of child support even if she doesn&#8217;t take me to court for it?</p>

																<p>and don&#8217;t get me wrong for i would pay child support and live in poverty, because it is my child, I just want to get a better job with a degree and be able to live and keep my child happy. I wouldn&#8217;t force my ex to pay child support if i had custody. And if she was anything like me i wouldn&#8217;t think any less of her for it because i know she would help out just because she wanted too.</p>

																<p>Not sure how that would work since you are considered a minor.  If you are giving her money, you should use money orders and keep a record.  She may not want support now, but could change her mind in the future.  Also, if she ever tries to get food stamps or welfare benefits and name you as the father, in most states, they would make sure you paid support.  They can go after you for back support at a later date.</p>

																<p>I generally read these blogs and don&#8217;t post, but I figured I might be able to add some insight.  I am a Step-mom and we have two small children of our own.  We have been dealing with issues like this for almost 10 years.  Here&#8217;s what I learned&#8230;.</p>
<p>If your ex is anything like ours, then you pay a significant amount of child support, yet the children are under-dressed, have very few toys, books, etc, don&#8217;t participate in extra activities; yet their mother has new expensive tattoos all the time (shes completely covered!), top of the line purses and clothes, hair and nails always done.  At first this would aggravate me because clearly the significant amount of child support did not go to the care of the children, rather her party life, lack of employment, and her dress up habits.  Numerous court appearances did not help, as we found that the judges generally favor the mother with warnings.  So what did we do??    10 years ago we were strapped with my husband only bringing home about $400 a month after child support, health insurance, taxes, etc. So we went to college and got better jobs.  Yes, he pays even more than he did then because he makes a lot more; but his take home pay after child support is also a lot higher, which makes a difference in our household.  I also went to college, obtained my Master&#8217;s degree, working on my Ph.D., and got a much better paying job.  So now between my husbands left over money, and my income, we live comfortably and can afford to spoil our two children we have together.  No we do not have a million dollar house or drive Bentley&#8217;s, but we have a nice middle class home, nice cars, we can take vacations, do extra stuff when we have his kids, and still spoil our two.  </p>
<p>My recommendation to those above, is to invest in the &#8220;new&#8221; wives education so that she can make more money; which can not be included in the child support garnishment.  I make a significant amount now and it all goes to our household.  We keep assets in my husbands name to a minimum.  For those wives who don&#8217;t want to make up the difference in income because they prefer to stay at home with their kids and avoid daycare; I work from home as an online professor.  So I can make up the difference in income, avoid daycare, and spend more time with my children.  College is a lot of work but it can be done!  </p>
<p>Get comfortable with living modestly because child support raises and lowers all the time.  Normal home, not lavish; and cook or bbq instead of eating out.  In the end you will gain much more than a monthly paycheck; memories and family time.  Remember that at 18 it all ends and you will no longer be supporting the ex wives life style. (At least for us, being it is clearly stated in the divorce decree that child support ends when they graduate high school and our state honors this.)  Once they turn 18, any support you provide will go to the kids at your discretion, not the mothers.  Also remember, that at this point, your wallet will increase significantly with no child support, while the your ex wife will take a big hit, that she won&#8217;t likely be able to make up on her own.   (Generally they don&#8217;t plan for the extinction of child support)  You will have extra money free and clear of debt because it&#8217;s money you are not used to having.  So keep working your way up the ladder.   Don&#8217;t quit because it causes you to pay more in child support.  Once your children are grown, all those raises will pay off for your retirement and make the next 50 years of your life easier.  In our case, the ex will still have a minimum wage job and will have to live/struggle without a significant child support check, all on her own.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

																<p>Thanks Beenthere. I read almost all of these comments, and this one was my favorite. I&#8217;m in a similar situation. My boyfriend had a five year old when I met him, who&#8217;s now almost 8. I never imagined I would date someone with a child, but it&#8217;s different because he was never married and wasn&#8217;t even in a relationship with her, just a random college hook up, so I have no reason to be suspicious or jealous ever. And he&#8217;s a great father. But lately I&#8217;ve realized that my life seems to be on hold because he can&#8217;t save any money because of his child support. She doesn&#8217;t work because she&#8217;s on disabilty, but she&#8217;s perfectly capable of working, and apparently well enough to have primary physical custody of a minor child. She&#8217;s moved 9 times in his 7 years, lived with different guys, went to drug rehab, and now she&#8217;s pregnant by her live in boyfriend and filed for more child support from my bf, which she got. We barely get the bills paid every month, and I&#8217;ve started feeling like she is ruining my life. How&#8217;s he gunna buy me a ring, how are we gunna have a wedding, a honeymoon? We work our asses off, and I&#8217;m feeling like I might never be able to afford to have children, and she gets to sit home all day doing nothing, AND she&#8217;s pregnant again. It&#8217;s not fair!<br>
I know it&#8217;s my choice to be with him. And I love him. I love his son. So I&#8217;m sticking it out. It&#8217;s just frustrating that her actions affect my life. But you&#8217;re right that it&#8217;s not forever. In 10 years he&#8217;ll be done, although that only applies to giving HER money, I know he&#8217;ll still support his son, but the funds will go directly to him after 18. And I know we&#8217;ll always be better off than her. It&#8217;s her choice to live a life of hand outs, and she will never amount to anything. I like what you said about bettering myself through school, and furthering my career. And I&#8217;m wise enough to make sure my ass is covered before we get married. I&#8217;m glad you made it through what sounds like a very similar situation. Hopefully we&#8217;ll see some change in the system in the future.</p>

																<p>I feel the pain of these situations. I have 2 children who i would do anything for. Unfortunately their mother is all about the green. I pay 2/5 of my take home pay in child support, and barely have anything left over after bills (rent/utilities, cant afford cable or internet) are paid (just enough to take the kids out to eat once every other month.) On the flip side, their mother&#8217;s rent is 50% more than what it was when we were together, brand new car, and is always taking trips to amusement parks and vacations. Sorry to say, but the system is rigged. There is no way for a father to do anything out of the ordinary for his children with the levels child support are set at.</p>

																<p>This is a subject that hits home for me on many fronts. I pay $2k a month for my children from a previous marriage. I think the systems needs to be revamped in a major way, my ex has a college degree and is just plain lazy, she makes $38K a year but will not think about getting a job cause she is lazy and content I don&#8217;t even know where to start with our story, I always paid the majority of the bills and have paid for the families health insurance etc, since they&#8217;ve been on this earth. It&#8217;s funny how my ex got a new 2014 Maxima  and her place is decked out with new furniture once they increased my child support from $950 to over $2K once I got my new job and raise.  My kids who are 17 &amp; 14 (twins) are constantly call me telling me they need things cause their mom says she has no money. I do not have a problem taking care of my children but it is total bs that I can not afford a decent place to live, pay my bills and student loans etc. I am currently living with my best friend at 43 years old which really sucks, considering I put in the work and pushed myself to get to a certain level in my career and she is content in  average. I don&#8217;t see where the money goes, I personally think she is saving the money to support her wants cause she knows that the bank will be closed to her for good in less that 3 years. I could type for days about this crap but I feel my blood pressure rising. Again, I have no problem taking care of my responsibility but cmon man, $2K a month is ridiculous and excessive, when I get my kids we can;t do much cause the income I do have goes to covering living expenses as I rob Peter to Paul.</p>

																<p>Really? Boo hoo.  If things had worked out these dads would *hopefully* dedicate 100% of their income toward their children&#8217;s well-being, education, and cultural/extracurricular enrichment.  *I&#8217;m SO upset that ex-wife is providing those kids with piano lesson.*  Get a grip.  At least she is not spending the money on HERSELF.  These women know what they are signing up for.  You&#8217;re getting someone&#8217;s leftover remnants that the *first wife* has to bring to court to fulfill obligations.  The courts are very lenient toward fathers and the mother should not be the sole caretaker and provider.  Best wishes you don&#8217;t procreate with someone else&#8217;s deadbeat or you will most likely find yourself in the same situation.  Consider both sides and how you would feel if left high and dry with children.  Best of luck to you!</p>

																<p>Umm.I hate to say it but you married some one with baggage. Poor him? Poor kids who don&#8217;t have a real father and at least the extra lessons and such help the children develop as real humans where they lack a father.  If he was half the man you say he is then he would have the kids. If he didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;fight&#8221; for them then that&#8217;s his deal. Never mess with a mama bear. BUT sorry honey&#8230; you knew what you were getting into when you met him.   Clip coupons and get a second job.  That&#8217;s the benefits of being a part time or less than such dad.  AT least with all the extra activities an such that they are in that you know it is things being used directly for the kids and not some Crack or drugs thing. You know they are in good hands.    You being a step parent should embrace that&#8230; and should have embraced such before you married the man.  To know that when you say I do&#8230; that it means you do accept his kids as yours as well and would want the necessary benefits for them. You should be great full they are in good hands and kids are not cheap.  So embrace your role.</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m the 2nd wife and my life is going to be the sacrifice. My husband has several health conditions and 700.00 a month in child support. Better then half his income goes to child support. I have the income carrying both of us. His medical needs bow absorb what little he has left. </p>
<p>I now have major health issue I cannot afford to fight.  We can&#8217;t afford both medical expenses. Kids come before 2nd wife&#8217;s life… right?  Ex wife and kids will be overjoyed!</p>

																<p>Hi everyone<br>
Up here in Canada the men have it even worse&#8230;<br>
My husband had a child at 18, has always paid the maxium support allowed since birth and its been a struggle for us to put him through university and pay rent at the same time. Basically he started on an income of $25,000 at $365 a month plus every extra possible expense you could get. Once we ate our kd for a year and he finished his education, his income rose to $70,000. We got married, had two babies and of course I worked through materninty as his payments rose to $1000.00 a month. We paid half of braces, soccer lessons, glasses, computers for school, driving lessons any and every expense you could think of. His ex has an income of $60,000 plus is married to a wealthy husband.<br>
This week we found out we my husband is responsible for half the university tuition/ dorm (about an extra $10,000 a year ON TOP OF the regular $1000 a month. This will be until she gets her degree about 3 years. Im devestated&#8230;..<br>
I have to pick up the slack now since we will be in mad debt. No point in him getting anymore income because they will grab some. I make $30,000 so combined we make $100,000. I really dont think we could ever afford to put our two kids through university. Lets just hope they are not those entitled type , or we are up the creek.<br>
Hey , how many of you had to struggle a bit for their tuition? Whats next , our own kids suing  us for tuition? I guess my parents had it lucky, I had to work and pay my own.</p>

																<p>Wow:(. We are actually in the same boat ourselves.  Have 2 younger boys at home and my oldest techniqually isn&#8217;t mine but has been since he was 3:)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get how the courts can still order Child Support when your daughter is at College AND your paying for College.  Is she coming home every weekend, and if so then the amount should be lessened?</p>
<p>My husband of nearly 17 years was never married to our sons Mom. It was a one night stand and I find it crazy that a court can say &#8220;these are the benefits of what the child would&#8217;ve had if they would&#8217;ve stayed together&#8221; YET they never had a relationship.</p>
<p>We used to pay a little more monthly for Child Support BUT like you had to pay all the extras.  We even have to pay for Car Ins. right now: even though he&#8217;s in College w/a pass that we pay for through the School that transports him anywhere within our state..</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be that bad but it&#8217;s not right when we r paying 68% and her percentage is a measley 32%. The courts don&#8217;t care about our other 2 boys at home. When we went to court our take home after tax for a family of 5 was $5,600, while hers for a family of 2 was $5,726.</p>
<p>Please also understand that we pay for his medical &amp; Dental insurance.  As does his Bio but she works for the state so it&#8217;s dirt cheap.  Anything not covered we pay 68%</p>
<p>Crazy thing is my 17year old isn&#8217;t my husbands (we have a yours, mine and ours thing) and I&#8217;m supposed to receive a measly $285 for Child Support.  Nothing else.  No extra curricular actives, no medical or dental insurance nor even help paying for medical bills.</p>
<p>The problem is the system.  My husband is a good guy and they knew they could get the money from him.  My ex was a piece of crap felon that they knew they couldn&#8217;t get a dime from so I couldn&#8217;t even talk the family courts into getting him in front of a judge. They literally told me they couldn&#8217;t get nothing from him so it wasn&#8217;t worth it; so if ur a good guy like my hubby they could threaten u but if ur trash and could give a s#t well it works in your favor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s makes it hard for these relationships.  Just realize it&#8217;s not your partners fault and literally be slow to anger and take one day at a time.</p>

																<p>PLEASE HELP!!<br>
So I am married with two children by my husband. He has a child before our relationship and  he pays child support for that child. But the court never took in account that he has two other children that he has to help support. In fact, when he brought that up the judge actually said &#8220;That&#8217;s not my problem&#8221;. So when he gets paid after deductions and child support is paid, he literally comes home with $100!!! That is not enough to help me with supporting our two children who live at home. Also, my stepson&#8217;s mother lives in a subsidized house rent free, also gets help with food stamps. I receive none of the above. Why don&#8217;t the courts take in account all these things?</p>

																<p>My advice is to keep your finances separate, divorce the husband legally, stay with him if you want, get an attorney, and go to court showing why he shouldn&#8217;t have to pay that ridiculous amount. I made the mistake of marrying someone with children. To be fair, he didn&#8217;t tell me about them until six months after I said, &#8220;I do&#8221;. We already had a prenup, and thank GOD for that, because he makes around 40,000 per year and I make just over 100,000 per year. I am not paying for anyone else&#8217;s ex or children. I hate to break it to you first wives, but nice girls don&#8217;t want you or your kids. I left him, but found out I was pregnant with twins, so I came back for my children. Because of the amount of support he pays, I pay for everything related to our children. I have a lot of resentment toward him because he supports his ex and her kid (that he didn&#8217;t want, he was young and too stupid to wear a condom), but can&#8217;t support our kids. So, it&#8217;s probably a good thing you aren&#8217;t going to have kids with him. Just make sure that doesn&#8217;t build into more resentment later. If you wanted children, you shouldn&#8217;t be punished for his bad decision to marry his ex. (For all of you bitter women haters out there, yes, I did consider abortion, but I can afford my children without him. I shouldn&#8217;t be punished for his bad decisions, but that still doesn&#8217;t help with the hatred I feel when I go shopping for birthday presents for my kids knowing I will put his name on them and he didn&#8217;t buy a damn thing. You want to talk budget? Mine is very tight.)</p>
<p>Another option you have is seeing if she will allow him to relinquish his parental right. It&#8217;s a long shot, but it can happen. If he wants to be a part of his children&#8217;s life, then that&#8217;s a no go. Just a thought because I don&#8217;t know you or his situation.</p>

																<p>hello everyone! I would like to see what everyones opinion is on my situation&#8230; My boyfriend recently divorced his wife. They have two children together a 15 yr old and an 18 yr old. His ex refuses to work but her dad is LOADED and pays all of her bills and any bills of the children and any shopping or other expenses. Like I have said she refuses to work but everything she could ever want is paid for by her father at the age of 47 btw. But because she refuses to work (after she completed her masters in child psychology) my boyfriend is obligated to pay 73% of all child expenses leaving her (her father) to pay for the other 27%. She claims to not be able to work because of bipolar disorder&#8230; in that case she and her suicide attempts are not the best place for the children to be. Or if she is not capable of working she could collect disability but in order to do that she has to prove that she cannot function on a daily basis in order to shop and or raise children etc. I guess my point is she has the opportunity to either collect an income such as disability if she is deemed to not be suitable to work or she could just go get a job instead of being lazy because her father has money to support her STILL so why is my boyfriends child support higher because her lack of interest in making an income on her own&#8230; also if her father gives her about 2200 dollars a month why is that number not figured in to her income if it is the money that she supports herself and the kids with? just because she doesnt work for it on her own doesnt mean she doesnt have an income to support herself or the kids. If she has no income why should she get custody of the kids over my boyfriend and I who have a stable home with two stable jobs rooms for each child food on the table electric bill paid etc etc&#8230; Sorry I know I have rambled a lot but I am irate on the amount of money going to child support due to a mother not willing to make her own money.!? And where do they come up with the amount of money it takes to support a child anyway?! I only get 59 a week for my daughter who is 7 years old! he has to pay 220 a week for a teenager and technically an adult! that ads up to a total of about 335 a week they are claiming it costs to raise those kids!? Im sorry i love my daughter but i can tell you right now I could have a million dollars and still wouldnt need 150 a week to raise my daughter! Again sorry for the rant but please someone tell me they are going through this same b.s.!! is there any way to force her to either file and claim disability in order to get her money or force her to work or get the courts to claim her FATHERS money as her weekly income in order to get that 73% of childs expenses lowered!?</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m sorry to hear about your situation, and I think you&#8217;re probably right when you say you don&#8217;t believe your husband would make it if he wasn&#8217;t married to you. I am a man who pays child support for my two children, and I&#8217;m not able to survive on my own. I&#8217;ve had to call in every favor I&#8217;ve ever had owed to me just to keep a roof over my head. This has unfortunately caused me to have to move several times, and each time it seems like it takes me further away from my children. 60 percent of my income is taken from me, plus I have to pay 100 percent of the cost to provide full health coverage for my children. After rent I&#8217;m left with $12.45 a month to live on. I haven&#8217;t seen my children in over a year, because I can&#8217;t afford travel to where they are. It pains me that I can&#8217;t be a father to them, and it&#8217;s not even my choice to not be there. There are tons of resources for women seeking child support, but the men who are removed from their children&#8217;s lives are almost completely ignored. I&#8217;m glad your husband has somebody like you to help him through this, because this is something that can prevent a person from being able to advance in life in any way, the way it has done to me.</p>

																<p>Girl claims 60% of money goes to child support<br>
60 % of 3000 = 1800<br>
Girl also claims that he has $1000 left after withholdings and CS.<br>
I assume Federal withholdings are at minimum (15%) 450 (15% is the bare minimum that would be taken by the Federal government) and this number is actually probably closer to 540 (18%, but that is still low and doesn&#8217;t account for health insurance, etc.) My withholdings are about 37% including taxes, dental, health, retirement, etc.</p>
<p>There is a discrepancy in this story.<br>
If he has any sort of benefits at all, I would estimate that the child support order is closer to 3000-(Leftovers) 1000- (withholdings/benefits) 750=1250.</p>
<p>Not saying that&#8217;s not a lot, but some daycares charge 1600 a month for two kids, and that is just for daycare. Don&#8217;t forget sports, clothes, school trips, lunch money, health insurance, doctor visits (which you might as well add 100 a month for two kids given the going rate for 1 visit is about 200, and kids do get sick).<br>
Yeah kids are expensive dumbassess.</p>

																<p>I can&#8217;t believe the comments I&#8217;m reading here! I don&#8217;t know how these commenters parent, but they are clearly doing the bare minimum. Day care for my 10 month old son is almost 750 a month, after school rides to a babysitter for my 2 daughters (5 and 9) is 150/week. Dance class for my girls is 75/ child each month and every time I turn around they need new dance outfits. They also skate, and play soccer.. I get 1450 a month, I would give anything to get more. My ex lives with the girl he was caught cheating with, their house is not as large as ours is, but it&#8217;s way nicer. They eat at fancy restaurants a few times a week.. I can&#8217;t stand when a man complains about having to give money to his family! I would like to take my 3 children out to fancy restaurants sometimes too.. I would like to be able to get the clothes for my son and not worry about whether or not I will have enough left over for groceries! These comments make me sick! I&#8217;m so glad someone else thinks these ppl are nuts and selfish :)</p>

																<p>I definitely agree with you Ashley. I was naïve and thought me and my ex could co parent and get a long so I agreed to 50/50 on everything. But there is nothing forcing him to pay his half! So not only am I paying all of my daughters expenses when she is with me I am also paying for half when she is with her dad! He always has an excuse as to why he can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t pay for half of insurance or daycare or extracurricular activities. Then this year she started living with me full time and only seeing her dad every other weekend. I asked again for help with expenses he refused so now I am taking him to court. Its a nightmare and is costing me a fortune in legal fees but I know at the end of the day they will make him help me eventually. And I can go to court with my head held high knowing I never slacked on doing whats best for my daughter. We have joint legal which is also a nightmare. He thinks for every sleep over, dr apt, extra curricular activity that he has a say in it its insane! I hate this BS that everyone thinks that women want the money! ITs like hello we are raising your children daycare and food alone cost me all my extra income after all my bills! But he can take her on vacations and shopping for toys while I have to buy her necessities for birthdays and holidays!</p>

																<p>The CSED is an incredibly flawed &amp; gender bias bureaucracy.  Accepting this is difficult yet necessary, in order to hold on to your sanity.  I sympathize with those Moms that are raising little ones.  That&#8217;s when we as parents seem to hemorrhage money.  However, let&#8217;s be real here.: Simply saying that kids are expensive to raise &amp; thus the non-custodial parent (Dad in most cases) should be burdened with astronomical payments and/or treated like a criminal is ridiculous.  I&#8217;m currently in the process of my 1st CS modification.  My payment will be increasing by just shy of 75%.  Oh, but wait there&#8217;s more.  The &#8220;kicker&#8221; here is that it&#8217;s retroactive back several months.  Which means I have to either write a check for the entire amount of the  difference or be put on the CSED&#8217;s &#8220;Dead Beat Dad&#8221; registry, reported negatively to all 3 credit bureaus, have my State tax refund intercepted, threatened with the suspension of my Driver&#8217;s License &amp;  harassed until the &#8220;back child support&#8221; which was just now created, is paid.  Do Dead Beat Dads exist?  Of course they do, I had one.  I watched my Mom get divorced &amp; raise me with 0 child support.  I&#8217;ve never missed a payment &amp; always make sure my kids get some of those extras they want as well.  However, all Dads  get to be swept up in the CSED&#8217;s net &amp; demonized together.  Thank you CSED, Thank you so much.</p>

																<p>60%? Wow. My Ex only pays 10% in child support. He has 2 jobs &amp; i get at least $40.00 a month. Sometimes $30.00 &amp; Sometimes he will skip payment altogether &amp; if I want 2 put my child in sports or ballet or in piano lessons, I would have 2 pay 4 that myself. I had her in ballet once &amp; I paid 4 it. Recently i found out that she needs braces 4 her teeth. I am saving up the money 2 pay 4 them. I make at least $700.00 a month &amp; the cost of living isn&#8217;t cheap. Plus I have 2 more children, one is still in diapers.I also learned not 2 complain to the Friend Of the Court (FOC,) because last time I did, they sanctioned me &amp; I recieved nothing for 6 months but  I guess every state is different. I learned 2 accept &amp; be grateful with how much I was receiving. But you paying 60 % is an unfair amount &amp; should the ex choose to put your children in piano lessons &amp; so on, she should have to pay, not you. It&#8217;s not fair that your child support goes up every time she pulls this. The non-custodial parent should be allowed enough money to live on.</p>

																<p>I married my husband knowing full well we would have a struggle on our hands. Ex has the adopted daughter from their marriage which he does not see at all. no visitation. He pays child support every week and never late, she came to see him the other day and informed him she was putting her in day care for the summer and it would be $600. a month which she wants him to pay over $400. a month of it.. we are living week to week as it is and It will completely break us.. I don&#8217;t know what to do at this point. We live in fl which really sucks to be the man in a divorce, at this time I must say I would not be the woman to ask for a 401k which I did not work for but this is apparently what is ok in this state.. REALLY. I just don&#8217;t know what to do at this point for the stress to make everything ok, our life becomes well I don&#8217;t know&#8230;&#8230;</p>

																<p>Im not sure that anybody will read this being as its so old, but I really need to vent about what is going on.<br>
I have been with my bf for almost two years now, and planed to get married, now about six months ago one of his ex gf had papers served to him saying she believed him to be the parent of her 9month old. We both went to the court date to of course file for paternity he said he didn&#8217;t know if the baby was his(cheating). Now there was some issues for a while to be able to find a day that would work but finally we were able to get in for the testing. I just got the papers today saying that he is the father. I even went to google to see how to read them just because well Im nervous as to what is going to happen if he really was. Anyway I love him very much and I DO NOT want to leave him, but I don&#8217;t think that we should get married now because I know what the court does for the mothers. I have my own daughter with someone else who maybe lives in florida or maybe not knowbody knows. But he has never been in the picture nor has he ever cared to be. I do not nor have i ever recieved a child support payment, and truth be told I wouldn&#8217;t care if I ever did. But what is he going to do about all of the birth expenses and everything else he didn&#8217;t have insurance at the time so  I&#8217;m not sure if what he has now will pay for it, it will cover a child for free if he does so thats not a problem. But after that it&#8217;s going to be the court fees. I just don&#8217;t know what to do. I read some of the posts on here but most of them are just saying whats fair and whats not. I just want to make it through this rough time and still be standing next to him. If anybody has helpful advise I would LOVE to hear it. </p>
<p>Thank You for reading ^_^</p>

																<p>I&#8217;m sorry to hear :( I can&#8217;t speak to the court/child support/etc stuff, but the thing I&#8217;d be focused on is the *trust* within your relationship. Marriage and raising kids and love and all that is hard enough w/out your partner cheating, so to me that&#8217;s the area I&#8217;d be most concerned with. I wish you luck whichever path you choose though! It&#8217;s good you&#8217;re looking into and researching stuff!</p>

																<p>It goes by the paying parents income. If dad is rich..why should his kids be in poverty. Although..they still can be, depending on what the mother is able to make. I read all these comments about vacationing moms. I know no such single mothers. Most are struggling to survive with their kids. Take the frequent real-life scenerio of&#8230;stay at home mom of several children. Dad has mid-life affair..abandons dependent family to be with his homewrecking whore. He has made a name for himself..at least makes a good paycheck over the years..plus the OW/New wifes money. Mom has children to raise mostly alone, gets part time min wage job..if she can..and is too busy raising the kids and surviving to hunt down a man to help them. Dad is always missing support..leaving them at high risk for homelessness, and he doesn&#8217;t give a damn. Middle aged Narcissist that he has become. And what if this stay at home wife/mom of 6..which he wanted her to be..is effing 50 yrs old? so he pays half his paycheck..sometimes. It was his choice to cheat and leave..and those are still his kids that suffer daily because of him..Poverty and fatherless..while he lives high on the hog. Mom will continue to love and sacrifice her self and money after they turn 18. and what if one of those kids is special needs and will be dependent on mom maybe forever?? People need to think before bellowing like cattle about &#8220;selfish single mothers&#8221;.</p>

																<p>My daughter is 16 and I have never received a dime from his drunk ass. I have paid all of the child care, preschool, medical insurance, etc&#8230; On paper I am owed $508 a month by my ex. The $ keeps ticking up. If he actually paid, there is no way I would allow him to pay such a ridiculous amount. But since he&#8217;s never paid, I don&#8217;t care how much the state says he owes me. One day he might have an asset and I&#8217;ll swoop in on it&#8230; My daughter knows who her real parent is. Not the shit bag on her birth certificate. (and no, I don&#8217;t speak this way in front of her) just venting.</p>

																<p>Ok&#8230;.. in florida,  there is a statute for getting a second job to support your second family.  And it can not be used for calculating an increase in child support.   I don&#8217;t know where you live,  but go to Google type in your state like this.  ( Florida statutes childsupport )  you can even narrow it down further,   by adding the. Second job.  Good luck.</p>

																<p>Hate to tell ya, lady, but those aren&#8217;t just &#8220;his kids&#8221; anymore.  When *you* chose to marry him, *you* became a legal guardian to those kids.  Those are your kids, too.  </p>
<p>By the tone of your email, you don&#8217;t like them.  That&#8217;s fine, you don&#8217;t have to like them, but you do have to help provide for them.  </p>
<p>That being said, 60% of his income for child support is absolutely outrageous.  There is absolutely no excuse for him being assessed that amount.  It sounds to me like he has a really, really crappy lawyer (possibly himself?) on his side, or that the judge is biased against him (both of those are, unfortunately, realities of family law.)</p>
<p>So find a new lawyer AND try to get a new judge to oversee the case.  Go back to court.  Explain about the child support being 60% of his income and how that is no longer acceptable.  If he&#8217;s been paying the full amount on time, the judge might be willing to scale back the amount he owes.  It&#8217;s worth a shot, anyway.</p>

																<p>His kids have 2 parents, Sporksoma. THEY are the ones responsible for providing for them. Stepparents should not automatically assume they will suffer quality of living when the TWO PARENTS both work full time.</p>
<p>The family court system IS a joke.</p>
<p>My husband also has to pay 60%. When he finally got a hearing (he was jerked around for 2 years by the courts), the judge told him that she is &#8220;accustomed&#8221; to receiving that amount. SO no, it isn&#8217;t fair, but so what. Husband&#8217;s gross is $46K, her gross is $75K plus 60% of his income. Stepson goes to public school yet she claims $600/mo for books and $500/mo for &#8220;enrichment programs&#8221;. And the judge allows this. It&#8217;s absurd.</p>
<p>I have my own children that are not my husband&#8217;s, and do not get child support. I bring in 85% of our household income. I do love my stepson dearly but no, I do not feel that me or my children have to go without so that my stepson can have &#8220;more&#8221;. And no, I didn&#8217;t resign myself to a life of poverty because I got married. That&#8217;s why I have an awesome job with an awesome income! Someone else suggested to me once that I get a part time job.</p>
<p>YEAH RIGHT.</p>
<p>Like the OP said, if we weren&#8217;t married there is no way he would be able to support himself. And unfortunately for us, it *is* affecting our marriage. My last kid will be out of the house in 3 years yet even though stepson is 9, my husband has 14 more years of outrageously high child support because of an unfair court order.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s bananas.</p>

																<p>Im going to put my .02 cent in here I was married and with my wife for 15yrs. We have two children I pay a pretty penny in support and all transportation cost to get my kids that live a couple hundred miles. Because the judge in my case said that because I moved to get a better job it was solely my responsibility to get my children. After paying my monthly support each month and paying to get my children every other weekend I barely have a dime to my name. Im 40 years old and had to move in with my parents or I would be homeless. But it is what it is, right&#8230; My question to all the mothers out there that feel this extreme child support system to be fair, and justified. Why not walk in the father shoes. Let them have custody of the children while you pay the support or any other expense. I bet there wont be one of you willing to do that. In my case, my ex wouldn&#8217;t hear of me taking her kids. As if they weren&#8217;t my kids or I wasn&#8217;t a good enough parent to be responsible for them. The truth is you don&#8217;t want to be response for paying the other party support. The court system is a joke&#8230; the system is design to make the father suffer and wont ever change. We are suppose to provide our children with a lifestyle that they were once use too at their homes, but we cant provide them with that at our own homes.</p>

																<p>I agree with you 100%.  The court system is a joke.  I have a friend going through the legal separation and his ex is trying to suck every penny out of him.  He&#8217;s the same age as you, but he&#8217;s on disability and CPP due to 2 different diseases he had been diagnosed with a few years ago.  It was bad enough that she blew close to $30,000 in savings during their marriage, but she&#8217;s fighting for half the matrimonial home which he inherited and is about the only thing he has left from his parents who have both passed away, child support for 3 kids, and she cleaned out all the furniture and appliances from his home when she bought her own &#8220;newly built&#8221; unfinished townhouse.  She&#8217;s also threatening to go after him for back support for the past two years when they first separated, even though she was living in his house with him paying all the bills which equaled the child support amount, while he lived in his sister&#8217;s basement.  It&#8217;s unfortunate that the court&#8217;s will be on her side, while he won&#8217;t even be able to afford his physiotherapy anymore since she is even more desperate for money ever since she maxed out her mortgage and has to finish her entire basement to add two extra bedrooms since she only has two.  Stupid buy but she wouldn&#8217;t settle for an older home that she could afford that would accommodate the 3 children. And she has to have a new car!  Now he gets to live off of $2400 a month which will end up going down to $2100 a month after she gets her full child support, and she will live off of a total of $4300 (wages, supplement from ex husbands disability, and child support), not including the extra she gets from the government towards the kids every month.  How is that fair?  The system needs to change.  If the ex wife gets half the house and half of everything else she didn&#8217;t contribute to, then the ex husband should get half the kids, if you know what I mean.  Shared custody would mean that no one would have to pay child support to the other, which is really how it should be for the children&#8217;t sake.  I just don&#8217;t understand it.  And then they have the nerve to call the men deadbeats because they can&#8217;t afford to supply extras.  Something needs to be done.</p>

																<p>I am completely against the new spouse having to disclose her income to the courts in regards to children that are not hers.  This is something that should be stopped.  Those children belong to two people only &#8211; the father and the mother.  God forbid the man remarries someone who makes good money and can help him recover what he&#8217;s losing in child support payments.  If I ever marry a divorced man with children, I will never disclose my income to the courts.  After all, not my marriage, not my children, not my business.  If it were to become an issue, I would simply temporarily leave the relationship so basically the ex would be wasting her money and filing for nothing.  I have seen too many fathers get taken to the cleaners and end up living in poverty while their ex wives live like queens.  It&#8217;s sickening and the laws need to change.  Besides, what are teaching the children?</p>

																<p>M.L. Good for you in sticking by your man! Too many women would have just left to get away from the struggle.</p>
<p>I have 3 children I love dearly, my state (Mi) has forced me to become a &#8220;Deadbeat&#8221; through financial shackles.</p>
<p>Support here is based on Gross Income (Income before taxes for those who may not know), using your tax returns to calculate what you should &#8220;Owe&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been on and off homeless for the last 2 years, I was brought in on &#8220;Contempt of Court&#8221; charges because they could not By Law take any more funds from my paycheck. The Judge found Me &#8220;In Contempt of the Court&#8221; and found that to remedy my so called &#8220;Contempt&#8221; by sending them the remainder of the &#8220;Owed support&#8221; to them.</p>
<p>Now I pay for insurance on them medical, dental, and vision. But because the cost of my plans isn&#8217;t high enough for them they tack the remainder onto the child support as well.</p>
<p>I &#8220;Gross&#8221; roughly $2,400 a month. My personal &#8220;Net&#8221; is roughly $400.</p>
<p>Here (in Mi) some cases for failure to pay is a Felony. Under the support laws a father is 52% responsible while the mother is 48% responsible. Much more interest in collecting money from a man.</p>
<p>I want Time with my children, I wanted a Family. With these kinds of financial constraints neither is possible.</p>
<p>To the naysayers, who will say get<br>
another job(s). I say why so I can &#8220;Net&#8221; $600 maybe $700 and Still be unable to do either, sure I might be a little better off, but at the end of the day I will still be living this unfulfilled life. Without Them&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s so bad just move.&#8221; Yea, thought about it. You see The FOC has the power to revoke your passport, drivers licence, report ANY arrears to a credit agency, have you hunted down (For a Felony(Also making it impossible to be employed)), (Arrested) Where ever you decide to move to, Bypass any constitutional right you think you may have. They are as I&#8217;ve heard at least one lawyer call them &#8220;The Mafia&#8221;. Organized crime perpetuated by the government against their people. And set up in such a fashion that No One will ever be able to fight back. Individuals have been jailed by companies whom they&#8217;ve owed money to by the same laws that the FOC was built to protect.</p>
<p>There are more women out there that<br>
just want to live the &#8220;Golden Life&#8221; than buckle down and work for it. It&#8217;s sad really&#8230;</p>

																<p>Child support can definitely be a blunder with the family finances. Usually, it is calculated for how much the absent parent is making and then a percentage is given to the child/child&#8217;s physical parent. If you are paying child support and remarry then your new spouse&#8217;s income will not be allocated in the child support payments and they should remain the same. Some people even have to give up parental rights because they cannot afford child support, which is sad, or they just don&#8217;t want to pay. Step parent adoptions are a solution in this case.</p>

																<p>I married my best friend, we have known each other since we were kids.  He was in a relationship with a young girl when he was 17 and she was 19, he stayed with her till he was 23, he had two girls with her when they were both really young.  She got into the drugs and went crazy after being pregnant with the 1st child, she wouldn&#8217;t take care of the baby when he was at work, her diaper would be full when he got home and she would have diaper rashes, poor thing.  He couldn&#8217;t take her mentally sick behaviour anymore , she would throw things at him and scream if she didn&#8217;t have her fix.  He was breaking up with her then she came out and told him she was pregnant with a second child.  Well we all know if he said he wasn&#8217;t going to break up with her she would have not told him she was pregnant and would have had an abortion. She didn&#8217;t want the second child but to try to keep him around she had the baby.  This is a woman who would punch herself in the stomach while she was 4 months pregnant because he didn&#8217;t get her what she wanted.  Extremely mentally ill this woman is.  My husband was young and extremely naive to have gotten together with this woman, but he was trapped after two kids were involved and he was trying to make it work out.  This woman also got into the methadone while being pregnant with the second child because the doctor wouldn&#8217;t give her pain killers while being pregnant so the doctor subscribed her methadone!!,! Not a good thing! That poor baby was going through withdrawals when she was born because she wanted Her mommys methadone.  A year after the second child was born my husband finally had the guts to leave, she didn&#8217;t agree to sell the house so she stayed in it till the bank took the house.  She would never let my husband see his kids for a year until the court got involved.  My husband has to pay over $1800 a month for those two girls and she was and still is till this very day on welfare and weasled her way to getting disability now too.  She got away with everything, and my husband and I are broke living with our daughter we had together who is 5 now.  I find that the system is completely f##ked! The judge should have ordered her to work to contribute or  he should have  put her in a mental institution! Childrens aid  also has been called in her by the kids teachers and their doctor and the kids friends parents, a total of 14 times now they hVe been called and still nothing has been done because they haven&#8217;t been beaten to death.  She has had people in her house doing cocaine when they kids were home, she has smashed her oldest daughters  iPad on her knee because she was mad at them, she&#8217;s crazy!, This is not fair!, he&#8217;s amazing father does everything with them, and he sees them every other weekend and they only see their mom twice a week because she doesn&#8217;t want them around. So they stay with their grandma, and he still pays childsupport.  The  system has to change here in Canada it&#8217;s sickening!  It&#8217;s always in the mother Favor, well let me tell you there are a lot of dead beat moms then dads out there.  So who ever keeps saying that the dads are all deadbeats  should shut their mouth!  You know nothing unless your one of those moms who are an unfit mother and hate their ex&#8217;s and want revenge.  Grow the F up! Kids are involved stop ruining their lives by milking their father for more child support!</p>

																<p>Wow, plenty of emotion here.</p>
<p>I really wish someone would catch women before they marry divorced noncustodial dads and take them through the realities of child support, visitation, and stepmotherhood, because this happens much, much too often.</p>
<p>The reality is that if he&#8217;s a married guy making $3K/mo, he&#8217;s only seeing maybe $2300 of that after deductions, and it sounds like he&#8217;s got multiple kids. Raising a just-barely-middle-class kid, with in-state college included, is going to set you back around $200-250K by the time you&#8217;re done. Children are expensive. Child support for a couple of kids is not unreasonable at $1K a month, and it is not unreasonable to share other responsibilities with the custodial parent: camps, childcare, activities. Keep in mind that an 11-year-old boy can, by himself, put away $300 worth of pretty ordinary food in a month, and still be hungry. That $1K doesn&#8217;t go all that far for two children, who also need a home big enough for them in a safe place, new clothing and shoes and coats (sorry, hand-me-downs don&#8217;t cover it all), etc. Their mom is probably putting in more money than the dad is, and also a lot more time.</p>
<p>This is just the reality of children &#8212; and if she thinks this is bad, wait till college hits, when yes, once again her husband will be responsible for a slice of a lot, *and* the colleges will look at her income. The children of divorced parents finish school at much lower rates than other children do because the noncustodial parents/spouses freak at the cost and decide they&#8217;re not responsible. And there&#8217;s really nowhere for the kids to turn. The schools expect you, as parents, to chip in, and they don&#8217;t want to hear from the kids that you won&#8217;t pay. They won&#8217;t step in and help in your place. </p>
<p>I hope this lady is looking ahead to college planning and the likelihood of having to take out PLUS loans if they don&#8217;t start setting some money aside. You can bet Mom&#8217;s thinking about what she&#8217;ll have to do to pay her end of it.</p>
<p>If this is something she can&#8217;t handle, she needs to not be with this guy. He came with responsibilities and obligations &#8212; heavy ones, though not endless. Unfortunately, he didn&#8217;t report those obligations accurately to her, and now she&#8217;s caught in the middle. So she&#8217;s going to have to decide whether she&#8217;s going to sacrifice part of her life to those children or not. One thing she isn&#8217;t going to get is a financially comfortable life with this man, not for a very long time.</p>

																<p>We are going through the same issue. My husbands pay just got cut in half and his child support is now more than he makes. He has petitioned the court for a reduction, but has yet to hear back. We have 2 kids at home that need to be taken care of as well. Today we found out she is suing him because he cannot afford the amount she wants. It would not be as much if the mother worked, but she refuses too, but as it sits with his income right now his monthly support payments should be $400 and he is supposed to pay well over $1000. Not really sure what to do anymore.</p>

																<p>What I receive from ex for child support for one child equals out to just under $13 a day. When you factor in everything that is supposed to cover it no longer seems unreasonable. Food, clothes, transportation, daycare, extra curriculars, medical, electricity, rent, and any other costs that may arise.<br>
It can also be put towards things that help uphold the child&#8217;s quality of life such as car payments so you can drive them places, phone cable and internet etc<br>
When you consider the standard visitation schedule, every other weekend and 2 mid week visits, $13 a day for the time the other parent isn&#8217;t there to provide for the child isn&#8217;t that much.<br>
If you feel you are paying too much, you can petition the court. If outrageous payments are causing you are undue hardship, they can be reduced, or you can try to file for primary residence<br>
Most of you seem to simply not understand the system or have exs who abuse it. Take what you pay / receive for support a month, multiply by 12 then divide that number by 365. That number is what is supposed to cover whatever % of cost equal to the time your children are not with you. Still seem to high?</p>

																<p>Maybe if you think the child support is not enough you could have always been a good mother and not forced the father to leave. What are you women disabled now. what happened to equal opportunity.. Sure you did not have a problem mooching off of the dad when he was working all day. Now you want to say the money is not enough &#8230; you have to get a job&#8230; daycare is expensive&#8230; Well guess what .. the dad would be happy enough to raise the kid primarily and let you have weekends. So do not give me that story.. I have my son 195 days this year according to my agreement and she has him 170 days.. I still pay the support and insurance.. So tell me how that is fair if my son will live with me primarily.. Hey here is a good idea how about both parents are responsible for raising the children and paying support. I guarantee you do not see as many divorces or &#8220;non divorces&#8221; child custody cases then&#8230;</p>

																<p>There&#8217;s definitely a lot of right answers here,but what if your ex is just having kids to file cs and uses the kids for taxes let alone I just medically retired from the army because of my injuries from Afghanistan,she kidnapped my kids and fled the state of Missouri for food stamp fraud,while living with me I was still paying child support let alone I still cover all medical expenses, I make about 1240.00 right now until my disability claim comes in but the courts steady thinking I&#8217;m still in,the army and making almost 4 grand a month because she lied and told them I was still in the military. I have 2 kids with her and she was the one that ran off once she found out I was getting out the military,many said it sounds like gold digging but now she&#8217;s in Texas someone and claims I,have no visitation rights to,my kids at all</p>

																<p>Hi everyone I was very interested in ALL of your comments. Maybe you can help me&#8230; Just remarried. My first husband and I had a daughter together we are civil and she decides to live with him. As long as my daughter is happy I&#8217;m happy I have her every Friday, Saturday and Sunday and ALL school breaks and 3 day weekends and we have holidays figured out. We also agreed I don&#8217;t pay him CS due to providing everything she needs here and for school and a lot of times at his house too. That&#8217;s great, right?? Well here&#8217;s the other half of my SITUATION. My new husband has 3 children with his ex. These numbers might seem ridiculous to you but New Mexico is a very low paying state&#8230; $7.50 minimum wage. So while he was in school for his associate&#8217;s degree they went to court and divorced. He is ordered to pay $280 CS and all daycare costs for his youngest. Daycare started at $290 3 years ago cuz his ex was getting child care assistance from the state, each time she gets a raise daycare goes up and recently at $385. He just lost his job and she makes Excellent money, about 3x more per year than his and my income put together. She always asks for extra money for sports and gear and school supplies. We have them every Thursday, Friday and Saturday. All these days are practice and game days. It&#8217;s only us two and she always gets help from her parents and many family members. This takes all our time with the kids. I&#8217;m working, recently received our tax refund and had to get a loan from the bank. As I said earlier, he pays daycare every month, her income has gone up so much she no longer qualifies for child care assistance. We now have to fork out the $280 CS and $540 daycare expense. She still wants her daughter in daycare and wants him to pay even though he said he can just keep his daughter home with him until he finds a job to help with child care costs. Every time he tells her hes struggling, she quickly replies that I&#8217;m working. (As in me, new wife) Like if it&#8217;s my responsibility. I don&#8217;t mind but she automatically thinks I should take care of it. Financially, she is doing great. Her new fiance is a heart surgeon!!! She is always asking for more than what we can offer above what is already set. There are a lot of great Father&#8217;s out there trying to do what they can for their children and taking care of their new families while the mothers are with their new families or just staying home receiving state assistance and CS. There should be a law that says women have to work or go to school while receiving child support! There should be more resources and assistance for men dealing with this BS! Oh, we pick them up and drop them off every week also. I would love ANY comments or suggestions. Positive and negative.</p>

																<p>My husband was a stay at home dad during our marriage. I&#8217;m an R.N. We got divorced in NYS and because I was the breadwinner during our marriage he got full custody and I got every other weekend. (Ladies don&#8217;t marry stay at home fathers!) I have to pay him $1,300 a month for 1 child, alimony, 100% of all medical and he got the house. I divorced him because he cheated on me. He was also a neglectful parent and a slob so I would have to come home and clean up after him.</p>
<p>I have been having him followed by a private investigator and I got a better attorney. So far I have him on camera screaming at our son and threatening to beat him at a park and calling him a fat piece of shit, stupid and ugly, I have him on tape threatening to beat up his girlfriend too. I also have him on tape cheating on his girlfriend with a prostitute. One time the P.I called the cops on him after he drove away from a bar and he got a DUI. He doesn&#8217;t know that i&#8217;m having him followed and that i&#8217;m building a case against him. </p>
<p>Yesterday the P.I. caught him on camera smoking pot with his brother behind a shed and got him calling his 7 year old niece a f*cking c*nt and telling his brother that she needs to be slapped. If you have a sleazy ex have a P.I. tail his/her ass and document the sleaze bag.  Record all phone calls and wear a hidden camera. His other brother is on leave from the Army and when he gets together with my ex they like to go to the bars and get drunk together. My hired P.I. will be waiting :) Something tells me that my ex-hole will be getting another DUI :)</p>
<p>If your ex ruins your life take their ass out with you :) You can be even more creative if you have less to lose than I. Some people mostly men, have been so screwed that they are in tens of thousands of dollars in debt and have criminal records because of their ex. Its best to flee but if you are stuck with the crazy ex make their life miserable. Your life is already ruined and you have nothing to lose.</p>

																<p>I work a full time job and also i am in the National Guard. The CS takes money from both my full time job and my military job, I am supposed to pay 367 a month but instead they take 550 which is 180 dollars more than the amount set by the court. Does anybody know how to fix this, i have already called the CS and they said they had fixed it and that this taking away happens because i computer does the paperwork and basically takes everyones employment history including those who have 2 jobs but are in good standing and tries to take wages from their second job as well as their first. I believe this is unfair and that they should take responsibility for this, Also i dont know what happens to those extra 180 dollars that they take away since i never get the money back or see any changes on what the mother receives but they keep on taking it away month after month instead of rolling the 180 extra towards next months payment so that it will seem like i am paying the exact amount that i am supposed to pay. Any thoughts??</p>

																<p>I propose: Child Support is an obligation of the Parents. The obligation is the feed and shelter the child. The Government has determined the cost to feed and shelter children, which is the monies they help people on wellfare. Under penelty of jail, this should be the obligation of the parents. If a parent wishes to give additional monies for shoes, clothing, ext&#8230;, that parent can do so at her free will. The child support should be the same for all children as thier basic needs are the same and it is their basic needs which is the obligation of the parent. This would propmote marriage and family. Currently 30% of a parents income can be taken from them with no accountability to the receiver. Simply re-allocation of wealth in a broader view or communistic ideas being actively indorsed by the State.</p>

																<p>It&#8217;s been really interesting reading all of these comments.  I live in Canada and support comes no where near 60% here.  It&#8217;s usually around 12% of gross earnings.  I&#8217;m on my second marriage and we have a great blended family.  I pay support for my daughter from my first marriage.  I have no problem paying support and looking after my children.  My issue is with the amount of the payments.  It seems to me that paying 640$ a month for one child that is with me 25% of the time is a little much.  I spend way more on the child living with my wife then I ever would have if she was with me.  Having her live with me would cost about 40$  a month more in household bills, maybe 50$ a month in clothes, 150 in food, and maybe 100 in extra stuff.  It seems to me like I&#8217;m paying for my ex-wife to provide my daughter with a standard of living she would get if she lived with me yet when it comes to custody, as a dad, I wasn&#8217;t even a possibility unless my ex-wife was a crazy drug addict (which she wasn&#8217;t).  I just don&#8217;t understand the system.  I pay alot of money for her to have a good life with my ex and can&#8217;t afford to take her on my family vacations, buy her great clothes or do anything else really great with her when she comes to my place as I give all the money to her mom.  My ex now has three kids and is remarried herself to a fella that is great and does really well for himself.  If she ever left him she&#8217;d never have to work again.</p>

																<p>Mike, I&#8217;m not sure where in Canada you live but my fiance just got divorced after many years of separation.  The judge just ruled the other day that he is to pay $850 a month support for 3 kids, when his monthly net income is $3000 a month.  That is way more than 12%.  Now his ex gets to live off of more than $4000 a month while he lives off of $2150 per month, not including special expenses.  He&#8217;s on disability also which means some extra medical expenses for him which he can no longer afford after bills are paid. Her standard of living is now better than it has ever been. Doesn&#8217;t seem very fair does it?</p>

																<p>In the State of Pennsylvania, if the amount of money that you are earning increases, then the amount that the Child Support Services are taking could possibly increase as well. Just like taxes. If you get a second job, earnings from that second job will be taken into consideration as well too&#8230;and CSS will begin to pillage from there as well.</p>
<p>There is no was around it except for having the plaintiff withdraw their order of support against you if you are the defendant. But how likely is that? Most will be advised by CSS not to do that. and the worse part is that the amount that is being taken from the defendant, is more than what the plaintiff is receiving due to the fact that the State is factoring in its fees in the process.</p>
<p>I just had a hearing today where the plaintiff tried to have the amount that is already being taken from me increased&#8230;because she feels that &#8220;she&#8221; not our son (Jayson) needs more money. I explained to the District Attorney who was representing the State as well as the Judge who was hearing the case against me that after paying the bills which are listed as my basic necessities, it becomes difficult for me to provide things for my other son (QeShaun) who sill needs to have his needs met as well. (Don&#8217;t worry, names have been changed to protect the innocent).</p>
<p>If after paying bills for your necessities you find out that there is basically nothing left, then you can submit a PETITION FOR MODIFICATION OF AN EXISTING SUPPORT ORDER in the county and state where you live so that they can begin to take into consideration your income minus your expenses and their ability to lower your support amount based off of  your earning amounts.</p>
<p>One more thing, if you do work someplace else where you&#8217;re being paid under the table&#8230;in addition to where you&#8217;re currently working&#8230;don&#8217;t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Do you understand? It is not for you to tell the plaintiff who has filed a case of support against you that you&#8217;re working 2 or more jobs&#8230;you might as well shoot yourself in the foot for all of that! Loose lips sink ships! You will in no way be shorting the child who you are paying support to or that child&#8217;s parent&#8230;since most of those funds are going to try to replenish the amounts that are being lost to pay child support anyway.</p>

																<p>I am a step-parent married for 15 years, helped raise two wonderful children and fought tooth and nail to see that their father did not get walked on by their mother.  He  was being used by his ex and she accomplished that by using the children daily to make him pay dearly so I did all his grunt work.  In Illinois it is 20% first child and 5% more for each additional.  His heart was too close to it all so I stood ground for him.  Now she calls me for additional money if she needs it and I am glad that my husband can just be a DAD.  We complained from day 1 that we were just to pay the money without the decisions that what that money would be used for.  We can&#8217;t beat the system so we beat her.  Child Support began way back when abandoned mothers became a burden to the system and therefore the system enforced the law.  I agree with the premise but the system doesn&#8217;t always see that it is not black &amp; white, there is no standard when it comes to family.  You can&#8217;t rule on the heart and the courts putting a dollar value on your family is wrong.  It drives what is left of the very core of that family apart.  It goes so much deeper than a 1/2 hr in front of a judge.</p>

																<p>Oh boy, there&#8217;s a lot of anger on this thread. And it&#8217;s old, so I&#8217;ll talk to others in the same situation.</p>
<p>It looks to me like neither of them did their math before getting married. If he&#8217;s making $3K/mo, then takehome&#8217;s about $2200, maybe, after taxes and health insurance and the rest; so we&#8217;re talking about maybe $1200 c/s for two kids, or about 1/3 of his gross.</p>
<p>Which, I&#8217;m afraid, is about right. Kids are expensive. If you think about that from the other side, you&#8217;re looking at a mom housing and raising two kids on around $3400/month. That&#8217;s not a whole lot of money by the time you&#8217;re done with inexpensive everyday living. Dad&#8217;s also got a fair amount of time for himself, and I&#8217;m guessing Mom doesn&#8217;t see that till summer, when she&#8217;s also spending part of the time getting her house back in order, going through clothing, taking care of repairs she doesn&#8217;t have time for while she&#8217;s got the kids, planning out things for next year for them, doing kid-stuff shopping that&#8217;s easier when she hasn&#8217;t got the kids there, etc., etc. I bet she&#8217;s not &#8220;off-duty&#8221; more than a few weeks out of the year.</p>
<p>The real problem is that these aren&#8217;t the new wife&#8217;s kids, and she&#8217;s currently holding up the roof, and she doesn&#8217;t really want to be doing that. She&#8217;s finding out that obligations to children are serious. And she&#8217;s coming to resent them. </p>
<p>I would suggest she rethink carefully what she&#8217;s doing with her life. She&#8217;s not obliged to support this man or his children. It&#8217;s not a virtue to suffer angrily because she made a vow. This is a positive choice she&#8217;s making each month when she&#8217;s paying 2/3 of the bills for two people. I understand it&#8217;s easier and safer for her to blame the mom for her problems, but the actual problem is she&#8217;s got a man who has children. The real question for her is: does she want to pay to help raise someone else&#8217;s children. If the answer is no, then she needs to break it off.</p>

																<p>I think the whole point, though, is that if the custodial mom in the scenario has housing around $3400 a month, that isn&#8217;t dad&#8217;s problem. Why can&#8217;t dad have equal housing? My husband helped his ex-wife pay for property taxes on lots of land that her father left her while they were married. After they divorced, she sold the land and had enough cash to buy herself a house outright, and a car, and take a lot of vacations over the years [while we watched the kids.] I get that he is not entitled to her inheritance, but we now have a situation where he pays her a little under a grand a month for two kids. Yet, she has no house payment, no car payment, doesn&#8217;t have to pay their insurance, lets them walk home alone after school and be latchkey kids [which is also true for the summer,] so that she doesn&#8217;t have to pay child care expenses. Meanwhile, they&#8217;ve had the same school backpacks for like 3 years, we had to buy them new FLIP-FLOPS this summer because theirs were old and worn out, we also have to pay for their child care (in addition to that month and a half of child support) when we have them during the summer months (because we are not comfortable leaving them home alone- they&#8217;re both under the age of 12.)  We get them at least one week for fall or spring holiday, every other weekend, a week over Christmas, and one night every week- this is regardless of what school/sports activities they have planned, because we take them, and it&#8217;s also including whether or not they&#8217;re sick. This is in addition to the four weeks we had them a year ago so that she could go to another state for work training so that she could get a higher-paying job. Not to mention, we need to pay for a house so they get their own rooms, we have to buy them their own clothes to keep at our house, and we are not allowed to claim any child support exemptions on our taxes, regardless of the fact that we do have summer daycare expenses. When the dust settles, we barely have enough money to feed them when we have them, let alone take them anywhere fun. Their time with us is not equal because mommy makes over $40k a year on top of her paid-off assets and grand in child support.</p>
<p>I remember standing with her at a game once and we&#8217;d gotten into choppy waters about child support because she&#8217;s mad about how much her boyfriend has to pay for his three kids [which is about the same PER CHILD as what my husband has to pay to her. Ironic how her opinion of the matter changes based on who is getting the money&#8230;] And I commented that I hadn&#8217;t changed MY child support order in 8 years because I didn&#8217;t see the need in gouging my daughter&#8217;s father for everything he&#8217;s worth. Her response to me? &#8220;I have a friend who says the same thing- trying to keep her ex happy. It&#8217;s not about that. You should get that support fixed. You&#8217;re entitled to that money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, she doesn&#8217;t think her boyfriend&#8217;s ex wives are entitled to THEIR child support money. And really, all I heard while her mouth was flopping around was &#8220;Entitled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, that&#8217;s usually all it is.</p>

																<p>Why is it always the father&#8217;s responsibility to provide financial support? I think the mother should carry half of that responsibility. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair for the mother to get a raise in child support every time the father gets a raise. Let&#8217;s think about how much extra money is spent on these kids that no one knows about in court. How many times the kids run to daddy for money because mommy says she&#8217;s broke, even though she received her child support check on time this month. But mommy is walking around with a new hair do, nails, fake tan, and new clothes. He pays his child support on time every month regardless of what kind of month it&#8217;s been (some people do not have the same income every month). He is asked by his kids to pay half for all extracurricular activities because if they ask of course he can&#8217;t tell them no, he pays for cars, car insurance, and cell phones and plans. Oh, and here is another surprise, he has his kids half the time. But in order for the NC child support worksheet to work it out so he &#8220;owes&#8221; the mother they have to list it on the form that she has them 2 or 3 more nights than he does (which is a lie). This man has a wife and 2 kids that live in the home with him and according to the state of NC these kids only need $15 a piece per month. The mother gets government assistance, food stamps, medicaid, and anything else they will give her. The dad and his new family do not get any government assistance and he pays close to $500 per month for health insurance (wonderful Obamacare). We have used cars and the oldest kid is on her second car now because the first car was totaled, which this man pays for all the cars and insurance. While the mom somehow has bought a new car. So, explain to me how this is fair.</p>

																<p>What about that high school girl your husband hooked up with once, she gets pregnant, tells him he&#8217;s not the father even has other guys claim this unborn baby, her dad threatens him with a gun telling him to stay off their property so he moves on. We meet get married have six kids and when the child turns 13 Facebook messages him saying his son wants to meet him, and 17 years orders child support. How is that even legal. We&#8217;ve been married 16 1/2 years, boys 17 we&#8217;ve lived in the same town the whole 13 years before she contacted him, even next door to the house he grew up, but yet she waits 13 years to say&#8221; oh by the way this is your son&#8221; and then wants money. We have 6 girls of our own, I do not work. So we should be punished because he wasn&#8217;t good enough to be his dad 17 years ago but is now? Umm no I don&#8217;t think so. My oldest daughter is 11 months to the day younger than the said boy. I just don&#8217;t see how it can be legal to come after child support after said mom said it wasn&#8217;t his to begin with. Can I sue her for pain an suffering, and mental breakdown for throwing a wrecking ball into our lives,this has been really hard for me and my girls. It was her decision to keep him in the dark and lie to him, and have her daddy threaten him with a gun, why are we the ones suffering?</p>

																<p>I don&#8217;t get it. If you make less then 100k you should live close to your kids and get gets as much time share as you can. It&#8217;s not overly hard to have 30%. Adjust your life and make any accommodation to do this. If not you will live away from your kids with very little money. You are free game. I learned this the hard way and wish someone had explained it. Also, YOU DON&#8217;T need a lawyer..  Thankfully I did come to realize this in time and get paid by my ex. Only because I was around was I able to get cps involved and caught her in receiving massive gifts from her parents / ongoing income. Keep fighting, never give up, it is never to late to change. If you make 2000 and send 1200 to mom you DON&#8217;T have a choice!!!!</p>

																<p>I believe in child support. BUT&#8230;.. Why do I have to pay taxes on it. I make 1100 a week. A good wage, I pay about 310 in federal state social security Medicare and insurance for my self and my two children then 275 for support. That leaves me 515 a week and I have my children every weekend. That&#8217;s screwed up. I think it should be 25% of bring home after taxes and insurance. Not 25% of gross. Plus there should be consideration of why the marriage ended. If your wife wants you to move out so her boyfriend can move in she should struggle not you. Final thing teach your kids to never get married and never have kids this country is to screwed up in its laws to do either.</p>

																<p>FWIW: According to the federal law, if your husband is supporting another family (spouse or children), the maximum percentage that should be taken from his disposable income is 50%, not 60%. Unless there are arrears, it increases to 55%. Only if he was not supporting another family should it be at 60%, or 65% if there are arrears.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s not much, but ten percent is ten percent.</p>

																<p>This is NET income she&#8217;s talking about, not gross. Courts base child support off gross income so they can screw you over even more by not taking into account that the government is going to take 20% or more of your paycheck before you even see the money.<br>
To the lady who asked the question in the first place:<br>
Get a divorce and have kids by this man you&#8217;re married to. Sue him for CS. Then the ex won&#8217;t be able to constantly get more money from him. It&#8217;s a first-come, first-served system. So if you sue him for more CS every time that he gets a raise or anytime BEFORE hex (his ex) is about to sue him, then there won&#8217;t be any more raises in CS. In the meantime, have him write that he&#8217;s living with his parents for his address and you live elsewhere (while you&#8217;re really living together). File for Section 8 and get free housing, get Welfare, food stamps etc. (Of course you would have to quit working so I don&#8217;t know if you really want to do all that&#8230;.or screw the free handouts from the govt by continuing to work and paying for your place-my husband&#8217;s ex quit working did drugs came back got her 3 kids by 3 different dads and got welfare food stamps CS and SSI and a free house and car from her rich parents).<br>
Then just continue to sue to increase CS forever so Hex can&#8217;t get any more money until his kids by her are 18 and out of school.<br>
OR get a second job yourself. Do keep your money and whatnot separate as joint accounts can be counted against CS even though half of it is yours&#8230;perhaps even have his money go into accounts solely in your name. Any jobs he gets can be used for CS. It&#8217;s a supposed increase in income according to the courts if HE gets a second job. Your money is not counted towards it, so if you got a second job and kept the money in a separate account, then it wouldn&#8217;t go to CS.<br>
Unfortunately, if you take the second option, you&#8217;ll still be screwed over financially until the kids are 18 and out of school or if he signed that he agreed to pay for college, until they&#8217;re out of the first 4 years of college. (Definitely do NOT say that he agrees to pay for college or they&#8217;ll add that to the CS and add even more years of poverty to you!)<br>
The courts ALWAYS favor the mother, no matter what. (Like I said, my husband&#8217;s ex took off and abandoned her kids to do heroin then came back pregnant and got custody of them&#8230;but she did get clean before she got them but also got bipolar disorder from drug and alcohol use.)<br>
You should also think about writing wills. I don&#8217;t know if he was court ordered to have a life insurance policy payable to his kids, but some states do that. Since my husband had custody of his daughter when hex took off they didn&#8217;t put that in the divorce decree.<br>
If he doesn&#8217;t have a will and he dies, then you&#8217;ll get 1/3 to 1/2 the estate and his kids (ex) will get everything else, so you&#8217;ll be stuck trying to pay off bills and everything with no money or anything.</p>

																<p>Checking back in after a while here.</p>
<p>Folks, this is difficult only if you&#8217;re really avoidant about math, allergic to planning, and assume you will never have to think about laws. But you live in a society with other people, so yeah, the math, planning, and thinking about laws is all mandatory.</p>
<p>Once you have a child, control of your life is largely out of your hands until &#8212; if you&#8217;re lucky &#8212; the kid is 18. Until then, your days are about that child, even if the kid is good and rotten to you that day. And even if your kid isn&#8217;t in your house that day.</p>
<p>A while back, I thought it&#8217;d be really nice to date again, so I tried it. And I found that every guy I met, no matter how nice in other ways, was kind of a jerk to my kid, and treated her like she was an inconvenience. So that&#8217;s it for men until she&#8217;s grown; I don&#8217;t need to keep exposing her to that. Her dad doesn&#8217;t feel the same way: he&#8217;s started seeing some flaky woman, and doesn&#8217;t like the woman&#8217;s kid. He tries to force the woman and our daughter together, which doesn&#8217;t make D happy and probably isn&#8217;t a ton of fun for the woman, either, and there he is being bad for the woman&#8217;s daughter. Because he doesn&#8217;t want to acknowledge that his turn doesn&#8217;t come again for several years. He wants to believe this time is about his maximum happiness, but it&#8217;s eroding his relationship with his daughter and probably hurting the other girl, too.</p>
<p>Children, as I mentioned, are expensive. If you&#8217;re avoidant about the math, the court will do it for you. The court is not being unreasonable. If you make a ton, you can afford to share with your kid; if you don&#8217;t make a ton, you still have obligations to what&#8217;s a very large expense, whether or not it&#8217;s convenient for you, and whether or not it stops you from doing other things you want right then to do. These are things you need to be thinking about before you make the babies. And if you love a man who has expensive children, then you have a decision to make about how much you want to spend supporting him and his expensive children, and doing the difficult work of stepmothering. But it is very much your decision. Don&#8217;t go blaming the mom for it.</p>
<p>I can tell you that children have eyes and ears and they know when one parent is ripping off another, or when one parent is enjoying themselves and hanging them, the kid, out to dry. Don&#8217;t think they don&#8217;t see it. And they&#8217;ll remember it for the rest of their lives. So &#8212; do the right thing. Not in whatever way is convenient to what you want, but the actual right thing. Yes, it may mean you don&#8217;t marry that nice person who wants to have a baby when the reality is that neither of you can afford it. Because you already have a kid you&#8217;re obliged to, and that was your choice when you took those pants off.</p>
<p>And the reality is you&#8217;re lucky. If your kid(s) had disabilities, that&#8217;d lock down the rest of your life. The rest of your life would be about looking after your disabled kids and their care. I have friends like that and you probably do too. </p>
<p>As for not having custody: most states now favor shared care if it&#8217;s a reasonable thing to do and the parents want it. If it&#8217;s not reasonable, it&#8217;s usually because the parents live far apart or because they can&#8217;t get along well enough to coordinate that far. (Sometimes one parent&#8217;s a criminal.) If that&#8217;s the case, then that&#8217;s the case. But before you marry the man and hook up to his finances, take a careful look at why he doesn&#8217;t have custody. He probably didn&#8217;t get tricked. And if he really did get tricked, then take an even harder look, because this is a man who doesn&#8217;t take care of important legal business the way he should, even when it has to do with his children. </p>
<p>So before you complain more, back up, take a look at what homework you failed to do before getting yourself into high-stakes situations, and then don&#8217;t do that again.</p>

																<p>It really upsets me when I hear the word cheater or cheated.   For example I  was married for 23 years had  for children and lived with a man that was verbally abusive towards the children and towards myself.  All those years since my babies were born I did everything for them while he did nothing for example wouldn&#8217;t help feed them when help change your diapers wouldn&#8217;t help bathe them,  all he did as they got older was take them to baseball and thought that he was the best father for doing that.  As the boys got older I still continue doing everything taking them to school showing up for teacher. Conferences by myself dealing with teachers dealing with school projects while he sat  at his computer chair surfing the Internet.  I continue to care for them doctors appointments dentist appointments staying up late with them at night when I had fevers and were crying why he stayed in bed,  OK we both have full-time jobs the whole time except for when he was laid off four times for calling in sick too many times .  Continued working and supporting the family and continued doing everything for my  children .   Over the years everything became a challenge I had to cook dinner and think what are we going to eat every night when I got to feed my family every night after working eight hours ,  and you think he would help out no he did not .  I had to make his lunches every night for work if I didn&#8217;t he would threaten that he would quit his job.  He never helped with laundry he never help do the dishes ,  when the household was noisy he would stomp his feet upstairs  for me to keep the boys quiet.  He was very controlling and demanding and quite difficult to deal with .  I tried to leave him once after  five years but he begged for me to come back and he would  help me with  i&#8217;ll kids and just be part of the family .  He never like to go anywhere with this all rather just stay home .<br>
 So you could see how over the years I would become resentful of him and started falling out of love with him .<br>
 Now I&#8217;m not bashing man but I think there are some wonderful  Caring  Men  out there .  That want a family and wouldn&#8217;t take them for granted .<br>
 The most disturbing part is his belittling the kids even when they became teenagers.  I argued with him so many times to stop  belittling  our kids .  I know he loves them all but he doesn&#8217;t know how to treat them .  He was just an angry   Person that just hates everyone .  And your pie wonder why I stayed so long well that was because I couldn&#8217;t get out he brought my self-esteem down so low that I became depressed .<br>
 I&#8217;m 52 years old now and on my boys are range from 15 to 23 ,  when I turned 50 something happened to me  I started menopause and I grew a pair of balls and I family found the strength to leave him .<br>
 Now remember  our kids are  teenagers and older and I can&#8217;t just take them with me because they have their own minds but they&#8217;ve been so used to this way of living that they do not know any better .  Cussing was part of their everyday life being talked to was part of their normal  verbage.   The day I left that day I found the street to leave and when I left I knew I was never going back to him .  I felt the relief from my back instantly lift off that I didn&#8217;t have to   We in the same home as him .  But the worst thing that happened after all this was that my boys   Thought that I left them because I never came back home I&#8217;m still in the same town actually couple miles away that&#8217;s it at my parents home because I had  nowhere else to go .  He begged me to come back home but I did not I could not .   So he began building is thawed up in our kids his head that I left them but I left them all to go be with another man ,  which in this case I did meet someone else .  But I tell you the marriage was over for years and he knew it .  He has  put in our boys his mind that I left them and him for another man that I cheated .  So my boys think I&#8217;m a cheater well this is what I explain to them .  That I did not leave them I only left their father which I didn&#8217;t expect them to understand because they don&#8217;t know anything about relationship .  I also explained them that  I left their father if I cheated I would&#8217;ve went back  to the father then they get all call me a cheater .  But when someone leaves and never comes back that&#8217;s called  your mom left your father and is never coming back to him .<br>
 So  six months after I left him he filed for legal separation so we can collect child support that&#8217;s what he said .  So I had a good job making more money than him I end up having to pay him $1035 every month for two teenage boys .  I don&#8217;t have a problem paying for them that amount of money definitely changed my financial situation .  I could pay the bills anymore he couldn&#8217;t pay the bills anymore I had no choice but to file bankruptcy to clear myself from debt  that was my only relief since my income changed .<br>
  I do have  20% custody of the two  teenage boys but with their father&#8217;s influence they don&#8217;t want to see me at all .  Like I said he has them convinced that I left them know matter how many times I&#8217;ve told them that I did not leave them I&#8217;m right here and always will be right here he has influence them to hate me .  I understand this is all hard for them and they see their father  sad and I want to protect him .  But for me raising them since the day they were born all the way up to teenagers and doing everything for them has been very difficult for me living without them .  They don&#8217;t understand and everyone keeps telling me to let them be and when they grow up and have relationships of their own they will understand but in the meantime I&#8217;m losing years with them that is very painful .  I know they&#8217;re in pain for not having me with them every day but again they are taking their dad&#8217;s influence and staying away from me .  Over the year and a half things changed at my job my  Pay became less and so I took him to court to do a child support modification ,  yes I pay less support now but at the same time I don&#8217;t have enough money to live on my own so I&#8217;m still at my parents house at 52 years old .  Feels pretty sad .  He does not want to give me the divorce so he&#8217;s dragging things on I had to get rid of my attorney and hire a new one to make something happen .<br>
 We own a home and we&#8217;re still paying on and just waiting to move forward with that process .<br>
 Every day I wonder if I should&#8217;ve went back to him just for the sake of the kids no matter how unhappy I was with him .  I did seek some counseling and every time was told that this was a controlling  person and I would just do more harm to myself to go back to him.  My boys they just want me back home with them but for me to do that I would have to have a relationship  their father which of course  we would expect a sexual relationship and I can  not put myself  with him anymore as  my love for their father does not exist any longer .  He wants me to suffer and have nothing from the house but I know California is a no-fault state and I did respond to his legal separation with a divorce  irreconcilable differences .<br>
 I feel marriage is a one time thing but when there  is belittling in the home year after year after year after year and there is no acception .  My biggest mistake was not to leave when the kids were younger it would&#8217;ve been less painful on them and everyone .  I think it&#8217;s easy if your kids are older to divorce but it&#8217;s not it&#8217;s worse .  I don&#8217;t wish divorce or separation on anyone but to live unhappy for so long for so many reasons that&#8217;s why there  is divorce .   Once you start paying child support never get married again until your obligations are over  because it will eat you up.  Or stay married  make the best of it until those kids are over 18.   You only have one life if you&#8217;re not happ change it and make it happy.<br>
 In my story I&#8217;m not putting any  Man or woman down.  I&#8217;m just  sharing from my experience .<br>
 Please excuse any typos and if I&#8217;ve said too much I apologize.<br>
Ty</p>

																<p>This is a very sensitive subject, but we are all just trying to get by the best way possible. What else is there to do? It is not easy, and emotions can run high. It happens in our household everyday&#8230;<br>
My boyfriend has 5 children with 2 other women. He makes a good living, but we are struggling to pay rent, feed OUR family, put gas in the cars, pay bills and just plain exist without killing each other.<br>
I am a full time student, raising our 5 month old son, and my daughter and son from my first marriage. Taking care of the house, cooking, cleaning, laundry etc.<br>
He pays $1500 every month in child support! His 2 youngest get $800 and the older 3 $700.<br>
I get child support as well, but a measly $400/ month for both of my children.<br>
He literally pays rent and half our bills (I help with the other half) and we are broke for the month. Left with nothing but a lot of stress. I can&#8217;t help but have a little resentment pent up inside. Especially when the other moms are smoking, drinking, eating out, and buying things for themselves. I buy my kids nice clothes and will hand them down to his kids because they come over wearing Walmart clothes with holes in them! Goodness it upsets me!<br>
I&#8217;m going back to school to get my degree and a better paying career. If I work on top of this, the crazy daycare costs will end up settling us back even further! Not to mention the gas to get me there and back.<br>
Our relationship is hurting because of all this financial stress. My kids see and hear our arguments. We both are trying so hard and want to raise our son under the same roof and eventually get our heads above water. When is that though, 13 years from now?<br>
It&#8217;s awful of me to say this, but at times I consider the fact my kids and I would be better off on our own instead of picking up the pieces of his past. the system has it so a single mom with kids can live more comfortably than we are now. I already know this because before meeting him I worked full time and the state helped me out with everything! Food, medical insurance, childcare. It&#8217;s just sad we are at the point we are, and stressing out so much we can&#8217;t even enjoy each other.</p>

																<p>Amazing article Sherry!  Thank God there are people who know what is really going on.  </p>
<p>Always thought that child support was for deadbeat dad&#8217;s that want nothing to do with the child.   </p>
<p>Have seen that almost every person I have know that got a divorce had to get attorneys and always one got the kids and one paid child support even though both were good parents. </p>
<p>It would seem that the best interest of the child would be that they get to see their mother and father as equal as possible.   </p>
<p>After seeing how the federal government matches the funds that the States collects it is pretty easy to see why one parent gets the kids and the other parent pays child support.  My father told me to always follow the money. </p>
<p>I hope the work you and others are doing will eventually have an impact on this terrible scheme that is tearing kids away from one of  their parents for the profit of the State.</p>
<p>When I divorced my first wife she was vindictive and hired an attorney and said she would take me for everything I had.  She did get most everything including child support, health insurance, tax write-off and my son.  </p>
<p>Every time my son comes over he says that he wishes he could see me more or he wishes he could live with me.  When is is 14 I am going to petition the court for him to move in with me.</p>
<p>My second wife and I divorced and we worked together so our son would have equal time with each other and no child support through the State.  I can say that our son seems more secure than mine son with the first wife.  </p>
<p>I do not make a lot of money and pay 20% pre tax of my salary for child support which is really like 25% plus pay health insurance.  If my second wife went and got a attorney then I might be paying another 25% of my salary.  That would leave me with 50% of my salary which would be $25,000 a year.  And if either wife lost their jobs the state would step in and help them with food stamps or housing but if I lost my job and could not pay health care or child support the State would first drain my retirement and then put me in prison. It just seems wrong to me, I would never take the kids away from their mothers and then ontop of that force them to pay me money.  The whole system just seems so unfair and sad to me.  I cannot see any reason a young man would ever want to have kids because the whole system is stacked against him.</p>

																<p>My husband was paying CS to the state of PA because his special needs child was in a therapeutic foster home , he was paying 150 a month . He went to court with his ex wife who just got custody of his son ( she hasn&#8217;t had custody since he was 3 years old ) , she asked for 500 a month , they gave her 400 a month . Mind you this was a woman when we had custody , she went to her doctor and had him write her a note because she couldn&#8217;t work because she is bipolar and has ADHD . My husband filed bankruptcy a few years ago , we lost our house and one of cars because when we had custody I couldn&#8217;t work because of all the appts I had to attend for him , and she paid us nothing , she also didn&#8217;t have to pay anything to the state either when he was in their care . Luckily I live in a state that does not count my income as his income . The bad thing , they stated my husband will be paying support indefinitely since his son is special needs . So once he retires and gets a pension from the Army she will get some of that too even though his son will be over 18 at the time . Our only saving grace is that she probably won&#8217;t be able to handle him and he will end up going back in state custody (  I know this sounds awful, but he flourished in therapeutic foster care , and moving in with her is a step backwards ) He will also be getting SSI , so between her income , his SSI check , and CS she is actually bringing in more money a month than my husband . I call her CS the Nike and Newport fund !</p>

																<p>To be honest, the court system is bias toward men. There are some many odds against men which is why most women take advantage of their ex&#8217;s. In the end, it is the kids that really suffer. Some women don&#8217;t want to work. They want to sit down and depend on the support from their baby dads.  What a shame. Instead of improving your life, you sit down to depend on child support, it&#8217;s a disgrace. It is the court system that is encouraging this bad behavior. My friend&#8217;s husband is going through the same bullshit with his ex. He continues to be responsible, but his ex-wife is always whining and complaining and asking for more. Every time they got to court, the court will side with his ex-wife. What a shame! There are many responsible fathers, but the court system is  unfair to them. I am a woman and I can see what some fathers are going through with their ex-wives. No man should be punish for having kid(s). They Court system need to do more to protect both parents equally.</p>

																<p>I sat here and fell down the rabbit hole of these comments and nearly 400 comments later&#8230;I have questions.</p>
<p>1. Many of these complaints from new wives/stepmothers/dads mention the child&#8217;s mother&#8217;s new husband/boyfriend having a certain job or income. If you don&#8217;t think the step mom&#8217;s income should factor in, then why should the step dad (the child&#8217;s mother&#8217;s partner) be an issue. So what if he has a 200k job and moved them in his penthouse? That was his choice. And if he thinks baby mama shouldn&#8217;t work, that&#8217;s between the two of them and the Lord. But if you don&#8217;t want your coins counted, you can&#8217;t count his. What if he&#8217;s keeping his assets separate, just like you are?</p>
<p>2. Among the ridiculous things I&#8217;ve read, the idea that you get some choices about things like extracurricular activities and braces are the weirdest. No, our child doesn&#8217;t have to pick and choose because we couldn&#8217;t work our adult issues out. If she needs braces, pony up your half; she&#8217;s not going to be bucktoothed because you don&#8217;t agree she&#8217;s bucktoothed. Yes, our child still plays sports. If we were married, you&#8217;d be running up and down the damn sideline and the court, but now it&#8217;s basketball OR football OR soccer? Nope. It&#8217;s all of them.</p>
<p>3. Many women sought to pit their husbands first children against the second children. If you know good and damn well your boyfriend/husband already has an astronomical child support responsibility, why, praytell, did ya&#8217;ll have more children? He&#8217;s barely able to finance the ones he has, but you thought it was smart to have&#8230;more? No, my child doesn&#8217;t have to suffer because you and him are making poor choices. My child&#8217;s costs didn&#8217;t evaporate because you had more kids. </p>
<p>The idea that a man would not spend 60% of his income on his child if they were together is sad. Like&#8230;would he really be spending 10% and going on a monthly Tahitian vacation? Probably not. My parents spent nearly all of their take home pay of their children, in theory. Their housing costs would&#8217;ve been smaller without us, so we cost more there. Food costs more because of us. And insurance and clothing and&#8230;everything. When you&#8217;re a parent, the bulk of your income goes to children. So yes, your child support helps pay rent and lights and gas and car notes. Because the custodial parent would have cheaper rent, less electricity, less gas and would have less wear and tear on the car were it not for your kids. You have to pay your share of that too. The custodial parent has less opportunity for overtime and extra income because they&#8217;re taking care of kids. So that&#8217;s a loss of potential wages. They leave work and stay home with sick children, also affecting wages. They have less physical freedom. Say you have the kids 2 days a week, you have 5 to be leisurely, work more hours, explore hobbies, gain more training. The custodial parent has 2 days.<br>
If the mother was out of the workforce, at your request or agreement, she&#8217;s now missed on years for SSI and is generally less employable than a woman with no lapses in her resume. So having primary custody in general, but in some cases, more so for a woman, isn&#8217;t financially advantageous. But your kids are more than dollars and cents. That said, struggle isn&#8217;t a badge of honor. If you&#8217;re proud that you never made the custodial parent pay their portion of the responsibility you BOTH took on at conception, I&#8217;m not sure what to say there. You </p>
<p>If she doesn&#8217;t work or you feel like she&#8217;s underemployed, she&#8217;s a gold digger. But if she makes a good living, she doesn&#8217;t need child support. If she remarries, she and her new spouse should be able to take care of your children. But if he takes too good care of them, they don&#8217;t need child support. They went on a cruise! They have iPhones! But if you remarry, your new wife shouldn&#8217;t be part of the equation. You don&#8217;t think you should have to pay insurance, though someone probably did when you were with the mother and it probably was you. I don&#8217;t get it. Many of the men who responded make it seem as though they didn&#8217;t pay bills at all when they were with their children&#8217;s mother. You didn&#8217;t pay rent/housing then? Utilities?Transportation? Taxes? Childcare? I&#8217;ll bet the rest went to expenses for your kids. WELL GUESS WHAT&#8230;same thing buddy! </p>
<p>There was even a primer on how to be a scofflaw and evade arrest and child support! But the thing is, if one were clever enough to pull of such a ruse..they&#8217;d have figured out how to use a condom.</p>

																<p>OMG, i almost thought i was the only one going through this situation. I just recently got married December last year the money hungry junky my husband was with before me got pregnant the first time they messed around I February, she only let him sleep with her unprotected that one time, lol 8 months later or close to 8 months later she had the baby. I had told him not to sign that birth certificate because some shit wasn&#8217;t sounding right about the whole situation, but like a ass he signed it. However since he&#8217;s left her alone she&#8217;s done dumb ass spiteful stuff went too his job stole his car, stole my mail with my information out of the car, called my phone 125 times in one night, her &amp; her friend called his phone playing over 67 times in one night, stealing money out of our account, etc etc however she got it to the point he don&#8217;t want any dealings with her. So now she&#8217;s went &amp; took out child support on him he&#8217;s retired from the marine corp plus he work. He don&#8217;t even know if that baby is really hisbut by him signing the birth certificate they&#8217;re going to hold him responsible until DNA proves otherwise. She work at a hair salon but 9 times out of 10 she&#8217;ll lie &amp; say she doesn&#8217;t work &amp; we already know when they do give her child support she&#8217;s not going to do nothing but snort that money up. Honestly she only use that child to get money because shegag sent him a text threatening to kill the baby &amp; the state didn&#8217;t do anything about that. My question is isn&#8217;t it something we can do to prove she work because she has it posted all over the internet she&#8217;s working at a new salon &amp; by her being a drug addict would the judge look at that as well?</p>

																<p>Texas hates divorced fathers and their children. Texas&#8217; obligor only formula punishes middle income earners. I get to keep charge of my son 50% of the time, yet I am required to pay over 16000 a year to his mother. That leaves me in dire straights just trying to provide food and shelter for him. My son gets very little after his mother is done gambling it away. The State is happy to fork over the money and all the while she still gets all of the tax benefits and low income assistance because her and her new husband run an illegal gambling operation and make their money under the table. Fathers pay attention ! if you live in Texas and you love your kids and you want the best for them, Do Not Get Divorced in Texas. Grab your kids and go somewhere else.</p>

																<p>I don&#8217;t even know where to begin. My husband has an ex wife AND ex fiance. His ex wife of 10 years has 2 kids with him and his ex fiance of like 5 minutes has 1 child with him; both in different counties but both in California. I have busted my ass to go to school FAR beyond meeting my husband and he is still in school. His ex wife literally makes twice his income and the ex fiance lives off the 4 kids with 4 different fathers that she has (all child support). The whole thing is disgusting but I knew when I married him so I suppose I can&#8217;t say much&#8230;.or can I? I have to say that California is fucked up and LA County, San Bernardino County, and Riverside County are ridiculous! I have done my homework and found out that my income SHOULD be included for tax purposes but realized it wasn&#8217;t happening therefore the amount my husband is ordered to pay is HIGHER because it looks like he&#8217;s a single man with no responsibilities. I don&#8217;t understand how they (the counties) can get away with whatever?! Even the &#8220;child support handbook,&#8221; indicates they must add my income to calculate tax bracket. Something is NOT right! </p>
<p>So each time either of these women need a &#8220;raise&#8221; they go straight for my husband. I need to mention that at one point I was the RECEIVER of support. I was married 11 years and awarded over $3000 in support/alimony. I waived the alimony and asked for $400 per month so I could maintain my child&#8217;s schooling. I did not go back to court until my ex failed to pay the 400. I made 20k per year and he made over 80k per year. </p>
<p>I had no choice but to fight and got $1000 when my kid was 9. I never went back to court. Why? I didn&#8217;t want to live off or rely on him. Why does our county, state, government, etc make it a society where women rely on men or others rely on others for support? I chose to support myself. I call weak on those who want to sit at home or rely on the ex&#8217;s money for extras or vacations. Shame on you for creating this disgusting society of entitlement. Shame on you.</p>

																<p>My family court judge disagrees with me, but since it takes two people to create a child, providing for that child&#8217;s NEEDS should be a shared responsibility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Her Honor (sarcasm intended) feels that the children (and by inference, the custodial parent and their &#8230;paramour) are entitled to a government mandated LIFESTYLE.</p>
<p>The other problem are the financial incentives in the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act that reward states with kickbacks for collecting the maximum amount of child support possible. This creates financial incentives to both order sole custody with the lower earning parent and to restrict the children&#8217;s access to the non-custodial parent. Both of these actions increase the amount of direct (cash) child support collected.</p>
<p>And since Her Honor does not have the &#8230;political courage to enforce my access to my children, I feel like my ex-wife&#8217;s indentured servant who is damned lucky to be allowed to visit with my children at my ex-wife&#8217;s whim.</p>

																<p>Im happy that you were brave enough to waive what you and your child were entitled to by law.   However, other women do not have to do this.  So don&#8217;t judge them because you chose to take less than what you deserved and what was awarded to you. You now husband created these lives and responsbility before you, therefore you need to sit down and shut up  and let him take care of his children according to the law. Stop crying, because you knew this B4 you married him. I&#8217;m happy you chose to support yourself on your own without full support and help from your ex husband, that&#8217;s your dumb choice.  You&#8217;re bitter because you feel like your entitled to more of you husband&#8217;s income.  Yes, AFTER he takes care of his children.  His ex wife and fiance are entitled to a review of his finances every three years, its not called a raise.  So, what you did&#8217;nt review your ex husband&#8217;s finances and took only $400 a month for years.  That&#8217;s your  fault and dumb idea, but nobody has to make that &#8220;sacrifice&#8221;&#8230;be bitter and &#8220;brave&#8221; with your choices but not bitter bc someone chooses to excersie their rights within the law in order to support their children.</p>

																<p>I have a nightmare on my hands. Out of the blue, I was summoned to court for child support. My problem/issue is that I don&#8217;t remember meeting this person. I was in the military for a while and could have met her on a one night stand&#8230;I really don&#8217;t remember. She is asking for child support after 16 years. That&#8217;s right the child is 16 years old and I never seen the mother nor the child. Plus she lives in another state. I have asked for pictures but never receive them. When I asked the courts to explain they just told me to get a DNA test&#8230;cookie cutter statements. We have had 2 court dates and she has never showed up for any of them. The courts simply say they will go off written statements and written proof of income from her&#8230;yes she don&#8217;t have to show proof of income&#8230;but I DO. Not only that but the child has the last name of her ex&#8230;that&#8217;s right not mine and not hers but the child has the last name of her ex. To top it all off&#8230;my wife of 30 years and I have cut out a nice life for ourselves. So when I put my income into the child support  calculator and man my jaw dropped&#8230;.$1100 per month&#8230;please give me some advise.</p>

																<p>In Indiana, I make 13.5 an hour on a strict no more than 40 per week. I had watched my son for a year while I paid for his currently non-working mom to go to school, which we agreed I can go after she finished. She was 19, I was 20. She initially had left due to &#8220;an abusive environment&#8221; due to strict Islamic beliefs, by the book Islamic practices. She would so far as decline my physical money order payments (100 per week out of 415) and sought contempt, luckily I had saved every week and was able to pay in full at the court hearing. She allows me the most minimal time allowed on the parenting guidelines for a fit non custodial parent even though I at least want like a weekend or longer days on the weekend. Since having access to my online information I never miss a payment. Upon finding out my fiancé is pregnant, my ex is now asking for retroactive payment, since 4 months prior to her even filing. Might I mention, the same house she &#8220;ran away from&#8221;, she brought our child back to. The house is worth 1.6 million dollars, she lives for free off of her &#8220;abusive fathers&#8221; lush 5k a week salary. I can hardly buy food, skimp on gas, and keep up with mine, and her attorney fees.<br>
Prior to giving birth, she was institutionalize at a Psychiatric Hospital for attempted suicide/self mutilation, bi polar and depression, and either antisocial or borderline personality disorder, which she was medicated for. She now claims, surprisingingly with full backing from her parents, she has always been 100 percent okay. I have a better chance of my landlord lowering my rent (he will not lower from 700 out of the 1400 I make after rent. To support another family&#8230; I&#8217;m to spent more than half my check just to have a place to live? Shit, gas is 200 a month almost, food about 160, car payments about 200, insurance runs me 90&#8230; I mean seriously?<br>
If you &#8220;women&#8221; want more money, you should have to at least have to decency to let your child&#8217;s father have him reasonably, as opposed to throwing the guidelines in his lap and saying &#8220;this will be the amount of time you will have with your child for the rest of your life. She works a day a week to be able to file taxes. Fix the system</p>

																<p>I understand it&#8217;s frustrating to pay child support when it feels as if &#8220;she&#8221; is taking &#8220;his&#8221; hard earned money. That kind of mentality will always leave you feeling angry and victimized. Here&#8217;s the reframe from a custodial parent&#8217;s perspective. </p>
<p>As a custodial parent, child support doesn&#8217;t even come close to paying for the actual cost of raising a child. When my ex and I were married 100% of both our incomes went to our kids. We lived in a dual income household and did everything in their best interest. We never argued about splitting the costs for our family 50-50. We were in it together. Then we got divorced. That 100% he used to contribute is now 25%, significantly less. Guess whose percentage didn&#8217;t change &#8211; mine. Because I&#8217;m the custodial parent. 100% of my time, energy, mental effort and income still go to my kids. Let&#8217;s do some theoretical math to highlight the energy expenditures here and monetize time to see how valuable it is and where &#8220;mom&#8221; and &#8220;dad&#8221; might stand. </p>
<p>He sees our boys every other weekend; he&#8217;s bummed to not be a part of their daily life but happy with the arrangement thus far. Let&#8217;s say he got them every weekend, just for the sake of argument &#8211; we&#8217;ll be generous with dad and say he has more hands on time.</p>
<p>Where he used to have to parent with mom 100% of the time, now he parents only 30% of the time. Mind you this is weekend time. It&#8217;s the best shift. It&#8217;s not during the week when all the work has to be done, all the school work, extracurriculars, dr&#8217;s appts, etc &#8230; you get the picture.</p>
<p>Mom on the otherhand must parent 70% of my time. </p>
<p>According to salary.com a mom is worth $143k in labor. Let&#8217;s say a dad is worth just as much as it relates to labor. </p>
<p>If we divide $143k by 12 to get a monthly figure and then multiply it by .3, we find that dad&#8217;s  contribution is worth $3.5k in labor per month parenting on the weekend (lol &#8211; the easiest time to parent &#8211; it should be worth less, that&#8217;s when all the fun happens). </p>
<p>By the same formula, Mom contributes $8.3K in labor per month, parenting 70% of the time. </p>
<p>So mom contributes in this scenario, more than twice as much labor and 100% of her actual income. Dad contributes 30% of the parenting labor and has downgraded from 100% of actual earned income to only whatever percentage the state mandates (significantly less than 100%).</p>
<p>Do you see why counting numbers is a bad practice; it puts everyone in the victim box depending on where you stand. Worst of all it treats the children as objects of resentment. </p>
<p>Parenting is tough when you&#8217;re married. It&#8217;s a fuck load tougher when you divorce. </p>
<p>Divorce sucks for everyone, it&#8217;s financially stressful to split a household in two. Being resentful about percentages and money &#8211; solves absolutely nothing. Your partner had a life before you that he still needs to take care of. It&#8217;s complicated but it&#8217;s the fact of the matter. And you chose to be married to him knowing this full well. Every situation is unique but for the most part &#8211; both parents are hustling to just provide for their children. As a woman standing on the opposite end of the stick &#8211; I can promise you, most of us are not living a lavish life funded by our ex husbands. We&#8217;re just trying to fill the gap when he once stood.</p>
<p>We all have to remind ourselves that conscious choices were made and for each of those choices comes a responsibility. It is not an &#8220;us&#8221; v &#8220;them&#8221; thing and if it is you&#8217;re doing it wrong. It&#8217;s an &#8220;us&#8221; for &#8220;them&#8221; &#8211; us being the parents, them being our kids. The ones who never asked to be brought into this, the ones who still deserve to be provided for. </p>
<p>When you can start to see that your husband is not a victim and that this situation is of his own doing and that the support is paid for the kids &#8211; you&#8217;ll start to see things with less anger, resentment, and victimization and more for what they are &#8211; two people just trying to take care of their kids in a complicated situation.</p>

																<p>Woh woh woh hold up a minute are you people really complaining that your partner is paying for his kids. How much the custodial parent pays is irrelevant just like your income is too. The non custodial parent shouldnt be limited to what needs to be paid just because the other parent who mind you is also physical and mentally caring or there child makes. Now i will agree 60 percent is steep but i see people complaining about 30 percent. He would be paying for his kids if he was still with the other parent so just becuase they are no longer together that shouldnt change anything . I make decent money and i will be making the ex pay for at least 40 percent since im not only paying the other half but it isnt easy to care for kids as a single parent picking up and dropping off at school. Doctors, sick time, and all that other emotional stuff is super draining</p>

																<p>Well&#8230;I speak from experience.  The Weld County Court in Colorado reduced me to a second class citizen and effectively circumvented the Constitution and made me a wage slave.  I dared to divorce my abusive ex wife.  She filed false charges against me in response, admitted to lying about it in court, and the judge let her take my daughter out of state.  I was ordered to pay child support, or else I would lose my license, lose my professional certifications, and go to jail.  </p>
<p>This is slavery.  Pure and simple.  Either you work and give us your money, or we subject you to cruel and unusual punishments (a violation of the 17th amendment, and the 6th amendment).  If you don&#8217;t pay, they will deprive you of your property and this can happen whether you are actually notified or not (Violation of the 4th and 5th amendments).  </p>
<p>Now, I work a job that pays 14 an hour.  I got a 2% raise back in July.  Last week, the company jacked up my insurance rates by 33%.  I already paid 300 a month in child support.  Combine that with the insurance for my daughter, I am paying 500 a month.  Then add in my monthly medication costs of 200 dollars.  For the bills?  Well, I pay 80 a month for phone/internet service, 500 a month for housing, 150 a month for utilities (gas, water, electric), 105 a month for vehicle Insurance, 200 a month in fuel to get to and from work.  I limit my monthly food allowance to 250 dollars.  I end up rationing for half of every month.  I have only 255 dollars to get by, and if an emergency vehicle repair or medical issue comes up, I am completely fucked.  And there is nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>This is the grim reality of it all.  Nothing will change until the men that are being subjected to this form of legalized slavery revolt against the system that allows it to continue.  I am also a veteran.  This is not what I swore to defend&#8230;putting a stop to tyrannical regimes is what I signed up for, and now, I live every day with the boot of the tyrants on my neck. </p>
<p>A lot of men in my position are killing themselves.  I mean that literally.  Their blood is on the broken child support system&#8217;s hands.  Everyone who is involved with the operations of these programs nation wide is directly responsible for the deaths of these father&#8217;s that were crushed by the weight of a system that was built specifically to destroy them.  I hold the state governments and the courts responsible for their deaths.  But, they won&#8217;t kill me.  I am gonna do whatever I can to absolutely destroy the system that is in place.  This system does nothing but hurt the children, and destroys any relationship they may have with their fathers.</p>

																<p>Hi I was reading your comment and I’m a little bit irritated. I’m the second wife and we have two kids. He has two kids from his first marriage. I know he has a responsibility to them and I don’t interfere with their child support and alimony.. to the point I don’t even ask how muc they are getting. But sometimes I feel he is neglecting OUR kids financially. I spend 80% of the things at home ( food, kids clothing, furnitures, toiletries etc)  they are even planning to lease an FRS car for his 17 yr old daughter who is still a student!! And yet he can’t buy even his own toothbrush.. I don’t demand money from him but right ow i think I ought too. Just because we are second family doesn’t mean we are second in everything else in life!</p>

																<p>You want to know how much child support we pay a month for two kids 4K. Yup you read that right 4K. That was about 50% of his income when we lived in NY. He left her the car , house, everything. She ruined his credit by maxing all his credit cards and she spent money from his pension and screwed him over big time tax wise. When my husband lost his job the mafia, aka Child Support NY continued to bill him 4K a month. He got 1500 in unemployment they left him with 500. He moved states made way less money and he still had to pay the same amount came up to 70% of his salary, once we got legally married it was lowered to 60%. We couldnt afford rent, food nothing we had to borrow to stay afloat. Nobody would rent us an apt because she ruined his credit. He got a bonus for work at the end of the year , the mafia took it all because he was unemployed for 3 months and had arrears of 12K so they took it all without letting us know. He couldnt put anything in his name anymore everything had to be put in my name so they wouldn&#8217;t steal his money like thieves in  the night. Because she took all his money he couldnt even afford to see his own kids! We cant go to court cause she has a free lawyer and we cant afford one. She is unappreciative and greedy greedy greedy, can&#8217;t stand her. Her picture should be in Mirriam Webster under money hungry, cause thats ALL she cares about. And get this Child support NY charges us 120 a month to send money to her thats 1440 dollars a year!!!!!! disgusting system , disgusting human beings they should be ashamed of themselves. They dont care if the father is homeless just as long as he is making his payments, they will take his license, passport, empty his bank account just to intimidate and the mother can NEVER do wrong&#8230;disgusting.</p>

																<p>It&#8217;s really simple.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to be involved with child support, do not, repeat, do not have children, and do not hook up with a man who owes child support.</p>
<p>Do not play the game of trying to get custody so you can evade c/s, either. It&#8217;s unlikely to work, but it is likely to be expensive and destructive all around. And don&#8217;t take it out on the kid, either, or talk down the mom because the dad has a responsibility. All you&#8217;ll do is screw that child up and make things harder for her at home. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to tell you. Kids cost money to raise. A kid in modest circumstances will cost about a quarter-million by the time she&#8217;s 18, and that doesn&#8217;t even touch college. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just say it again: if you cannot accept the realities of child support and college payments with good grace, do not tangle with a divorced dad of a minor child. No, don&#8217;t tell me about your right to love. That&#8217;s not going to change anything up there.</p>
<p>You should however consider that if *he* is complaining about the ex and the support, and talking like it&#8217;s not fair, you should imagine your own name instead of the ex&#8217;s in that conversation. Because someday he&#8217;ll talk about you that way, too. That&#8217;s a man looking to blame people for problems he made for himself.</p>

																<p>Child support is such a touchy subject and normally I keep out of it, but I&#8217;m now having to deal with it myself&#8230; I never thought I&#8217;d ever file for CS but when my son&#8217;s father couldn&#8217;t be reasoned with I realized that CS was the only way I could go. I understand that guys and their new family believe that CS is unfair and unreasonable but your not the one struggling to support a child that you thought you would be raising with their father. My son is only 20 months old and for 16 months of that I did it solely on my on own. I was doing really well until I had to quit my job do to not having someone to watch my son. I couldn&#8217;t afford child care and everyone I had lined up in case something happened with the previous babysitter all fell through. Yes I&#8217;m on FS, Medicaid, and living in government assistant housing but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can afford child care.. It&#8217;s super expensive and I was making 9$ a hour. So due to that I have been out of work for almost 4 months. I was able to make my savings last about a month 1/2, but my son&#8217;s needs don&#8217;t stop just cuz my income does.. So for the first time since he was born I had to ask his father to help.. Let&#8217;s just say he was as controlling as ever but at that point I really didn&#8217;t have a choice. I begged him to be reasonable about things but he wouldn&#8217;t have any of it. Well about a month or 2 ago I decided that enough was enough (with the talks from people telling me I should) I filed for child support. Man if he wasn&#8217;t pissed, telling me that it was BS, that he didn&#8217;t need this kinda added stress on him and that he would rather sign his rights away and never see his son again then deal with CS. I was blown away and in tears at hearing that. Like always it was all about him and what it was doing to him.. Nothing about his son and his needs. I have heard a number of reasons why I should drop it and each one let&#8217;s me know he was lying about the last reason. Every conversation he makes sure he brings up the CS. I&#8217;m trying to be nice but he&#8217;s starting to really piss me off with his selfishness. I know why he&#8217;s being this way and it&#8217;s cuz he has a new GF who is currently about 15 weeks pregnant with his child. He feels that he should be able to pay me what he feels is fare and have the rest for his new family, but I feel like that is messed up. He has only saw our son about 20 times since he was born and since I filed he has refused to see him to hurt me. It&#8217;s been over a month. I guess since he saw being cruel and mean to me wasn&#8217;t going to get me to drop it he is starting to be nice but that isn&#8217;t going to get me to do what he wants either. He just doesn&#8217;t get it it&#8217;s not about him or me, it&#8217;s about our son and what&#8217;s best for him. I have finally gotten the help I need with child care and have a great job that I most likely will get. I am very honest with him and told him it pays pretty well and his first response was &#8221; Well now you can drop CS &#8220;. WTH is wrong with him!!!!! No I will not be dropping it now or in the future. I have spent thousands of dollars on our son with him only giving me 200$ and that&#8217;s me being nice about it. I love spending money on my son but I&#8217;ll be damned if my son grows up seeing his father&#8217;s second child get everything while he gets only what his mother can afford being a single mom&#8230; It&#8217;s not always about how much but it sure as hell will be fair and if I have to go through the courts to get it then I damn sure will. I have no sympathy for a father having to pay any amount of child support. If you didn&#8217;t want to take care of a child fairly then make sure you take precautions to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen. The next women that comes into the picture if you don&#8217;t like it then leave and if you don&#8217;t it&#8217;s not the ex&#8217;s or child&#8217;s  problem. As for my ex&#8217;s GF and unborn, well this is going to sound mean, but we don&#8217;t care about that either, it&#8217;s not our problem. So before people judge a mother for filing for CS get your facts straight and stop always listening and believing the father or his knew family&#8230; Sometimes they are just mad and resentful for having to pay what is owed to the child that came before!!!!</p>

																<p>There are 2 sides to every coin&#8230;<br>
First, I am a single mother who envies those women who actually receive any form of child support in helping to raise their child(ren) because children aren&#8217;t free and it takes a huge tole on one person&#8217;s finances to have to take on all the financial burden of raises a child on their own. But, that&#8217;s not how I go to this post, so let me flip the coin&#8230;</p>
<p>I have a boyfriend and we are madly in love with each other. The only thing standing in the way of me making a firm decision that there is a future with him is the fact that he owes a substantially amount of CS and as a result all of his paychecks are cut in half. He cannot live off of the remaining portion of his check, let alone to save for things like&#8230; a car, a home, etc. He basically HAS TO live with someone else because he cannot afford to get his own place. He was stable (holding it together) when we met, but when his roomy had issues, that&#8217;s when his personal financial status came to light. Prior to his roomy having issues, we had talking about getting a place together. But after his true financial situation got revealed, I am hesitant to combine our resources. Because, he basically has none. And on top of that, I am very careful with money. I don&#8217;t spend money that I do not have and I always pay my bills first. So, if money is tight and low, I adjust my lifestyle accordingly. He on the other hand is not very money conscious at all. And I don&#8217;t want to tell a man what to do with HIS money, but if you know that you have limited cash, it only seems logical to me that you have to cut the unimportant things out of your life, like cigarettes and marijuana. Yet, those are things which he buys on a regular basis_ like daily. Additionally, he drives across town when we (really me) are low on gas. And who is replacing the gas that he uses for unimportant trips? Me. </p>
<p>To the outsider, it looks like he is using me, but what you don&#8217;t realize is that he was stable when I met him. I also did not have a car when I met him. He spent money on me and never asked me for anything. I would have never known his financial status if his roomy hadn&#8217;t went south. Basically, he depended on his roomy paying their half of the bill. When the roomy became unstable then it drastically affected his life because due to his reduced check, he only makes enough to live at bare minimum.</p>
<p>I love him profusely but I feel that his money issue will always be the demise of our relationship if we take it to the next level (as in marriage). I wish that he did&#8217;t have this burden of paying child support, but I don&#8217;t feel sorry for or sympathize with him or any of the other men here on that face the same issue because&#8230;</p>
<p>On the flip side of the coin&#8230; I am a single mother (of 2) who has never received child support. What I do receive is a heavy financial burden of having to raise children on my own_ with no help from the other sexual participant of this ordeal. I feel (though I may be wrong) that garnishment is the result of a man ignoring his responsibility in the matter and needing the state to get involved is the reprecussuion. A simplier/more reasonible solution would be for the man (sometimes woman) to step up and help out voluntarily no matter what rift raft may or may not exist with the other parent. Bottom-line, children are not free. To think that you should continue to enjoy the freedom of keeping all of your income while the other parent forks the expenses of raising your offspring is simply selfish to me. It doesn&#8217;t stop me from loving the man who has put himself in this place. But I can&#8217;t feel sorry for him either because as a single parent baring all the weight/expenses_ living (3 bdr vs studio), eating ($200/week vs $50), transportation, education, clothes, misc house supplies x3, every regular expense X3&#8230; Not to mention the time you no longer have because your life outside work is taking care of your children. I simply can&#8217;t feel sorry for someone who does not  initiate support and as a result, has to be court-mandated. </p>
<p>I apologize for the brutal honesty but in many cases (as is with my boyfriend who owes $45K in CS), you brought this on yourself. I&#8217;m paying a chunk of my check every week to take care of my children and the expenses of having them, the only difference is that it is not court-mandated. It is just me being a parent and that means owning up to my responsibilities. I don&#8217;t have the luxury of putting myself first and ignoring the fact that I have children in this world. But many men (some women too) do it all the time and are upset when the state catches up with them and forces them to man-up.</p>

																<p>Lady, your husband does&#8217;nt make you do anything! YOU pay the mortgage because you want to. Nobody makes you write that check sweetie.  Yes, it will hurt your credit but his too. You knew he was paying child support of that amount when you hooked up with him twelve years ago, so now you want to flip. Leave him if that&#8217;s how you feel</p>

																<p>My ex husband pays 18% of his net income for our one child.  I quit school when we were together at his request to stay home and am only capable of making minimum wage.  Our child support stops on the 18th birthday.  (Or graduating high school, but she will be graduating early with a higher than 4.0 GPA.)</p>
<p>My husband pays 40% of his net income for their one child.  His ex moved their child to another state and we cannot afford to see her!  Even driving, it is many hundred dollars that we simply don&#8217;t have.  (He is a teacher.)  Meanwhile, the mom badmouths him and tries to make the child hate him.  I think this is incredibly unethical.  When they were married, he supported her completely through college- working and paying for it, and for her not working, so that she got a master&#8217;s degree and makes 20k more a year money than he does.  She moved to the beach with a very high cost of living (her own choice.) . That he doesn&#8217;t see her more and COL is so high &#8211; even though he had no choice in either- factors in. He only really gets her 6 weeks in the summer.   We would HAPPILY have joint custody (or full custody, though we would not want to limit a child&#8217;s exposure to the other parent the way his ex did.) .   His child support goes to graduating highschool or 21, which probably will be the latter because his ex barely supports education at all.  </p>
<p>We have a child, too. (My IUD was not as effective as we thought, though of course I&#8217;m happy to have him.) .  Our child has next to nothing. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s just not right.    It&#8217;s not about not wanting to support your kid. It&#8217;s about being screwed in every direction and paying more than you would if the child lived with you for a child that you don&#8217;t get to see and is being poisoned against you.</p>
<p>And when I met him and fell in love, I didn&#8217;t realize that his ex was such a monster.</p>

																<p>I find these stories interesting because I&#8217;ve had the opposite experience. There&#8217;s a lot of bitter people on here not looking at both sides. My ex, the father and non-custodial parent, pays next to nothing. His family owns a business and they hide his income easily. His new wife stays at home so they have no child care costs. My child care costs are twice what he pays in child support. He doesn&#8217;t help provide insurance yet the courts let him claim one of our children on his taxes. His exemption and credit equal more than he pays in child support for both. He owns his own home and she will babysit at home bringing in more income for them. I will be the one to buy their first car and put them through college and help them be successful, well educated productive members of society. I struggled with out his support for years putting myself through college because he would evade his responsibility. For all your bitter new wives, and non-custodial parents out there, for every one of you that are &#8220;burned&#8221; by the system there are dozens other custodial parents burned too.</p>

																<p>I am going thru the same thing right now with my husband and his ex.  He has 4 children by 2 different women.  We have no children together, but I do have one child of my own.  My husband has not seen two of his kids in 10 years.  Their mother will not allow him to see them or even talk to them.  They love in another state, he pays child support for them every week.  it&#8217;s court ordered and comes out of his check every week.  She will call him once or twice a month and demand more money for shoes or school supplies or whatever.  His other two kids live in the same state that we do and he sees them every other weekend.  Their mother makes nearly $200,000 a year.She calls constantly wanting medical bills paid and for him to pay for their clothes and shoes.  Again, child support from them gets taken out of his check every week.  Just today we found out that an additional $100 is going to be coming out every week for child support.  We didn&#8217;t get a letter or anything we just happened to see it when his check was deposited.  He will now be making $200 per week after child support and taxes.  He is not even going to make enough money to pay our rent.  We can&#8217;t buy a home because of his child support.  We have one car because that&#8217;s all that we can afford.  My daughter suffers every day because I constantly have to tell her that I can&#8217;t afford to get her the things that she asks for.  I have to use the child support that I get for her ($100 per week) to pay for groceries and other things just to put food on the table and keep a roof over our head.  Between both of us working full time we only bring home $2500 a month.  That has stretch to cover everything and get food.  I just don&#8217;t understand how in the world the state thinks that someone can live on $800 a month.  If my husband did not have my income to fall back on he would be homeless.  How is that better for the kids?  I&#8217;m sure if he was living in some hovel apartment because it&#8217;s all he could afford DFCS would make darn sure that he didn&#8217;t see his kids because his living situation would not be good for them.  I just don&#8217;t get it.  The men that are trying to do the right thing and actually take care of their kids and be a good dad are the ones that get screwed.  It&#8217;s the ones that are the dead beat dads that get away with everything.</p>

																<p>The nonsense here, is the argument that the child support amount is not sufficient to cover the expenses of the custodial parent. Referring specifically to &#8220;Amy&#8221; who seems to be really bitter and self righteous.   Consider a father who&#8217;s paying $800 a month in child support. Now, add to that the cost of medical insurance, so another $150-$250 a month and so now we&#8217;re up to roughly $1000 a month. Now assuming standard visitation of every other weekend, lets add another $100 a weekend for food and entertainment, now we&#8217;re up to $1300-$1500 a month realistically, on a child support order of $800 a month, and that doesn&#8217;t include other incidentals and what not. Yet, it some peoples minds that STILL not enough?  Instead of knocking good decent NCP&#8217;s who don&#8217;t think they should be footing the bill for the ex&#8217;s luxury car or new house, which we all know realistically is being paid for by the CS, maybe the CS should be treated just like public assistance, put it on a debit card that can ONLY be used for food and clothing, no cash withdraw option either, or make it one blanket system under federal guidelines instead of up to the states, because as it is, the CP&#8217;s are making out like bandits, and the NCP&#8217;s get the shaft.</p>

																<p>Having a fix d card for food/clothing only wont matter. The lady will budget her wages for that new car or what ever wants and the food comes from support check,</p>
<p>I have an 801 support payment to my ex 27% of my net who I had two kids with they are teenagers.  They don’t even notice I have moved out yet other than mom needs to work or lose her house. </p>
<p>My ex and kids are addicted to social media, internet and online games face time on phones, tablets and computers. The all hermit in a closed room no one talked or even noticed me the only one not addicted and working to provide for on one income.  My ex was online about 18 hours a day as a stay at home mom just boggles me and kids do the same thing! I had talks and no change so I moved out about a yeAr who now. Despite the ex getting 27% of my net take home until one child turns 18 on 11/11/22 I can’t wait 400 more I can save then all done on 2/5/24 then I can buy a home again. Sad thing is my ex will have nothing to show for the 801 a month tax free each month due to her addictions with online buying and such. </p>
<p>But anyways if you divorce right the guy does not get that screwed on child support , if you up and leave and don’t pay then the state gets involved then you got arrears and more trouble if the guy plans to not be a loser. My ex is s loser and all she is now is a mom making low income collecting money and still using me until kids turn 18. Fun part is I bet the kids stay at home beyond age 30 and mom will be making just a couple bucks more at a retail job. She can’t control spending or addiction so I’m so thankful I left I can now do things never  thought possible. For example I have a new sports car and I’m saving up for a home that I put a 100k plus down on and pay off quickly. Again not possible with my ex wife we had less that 100 in our account when the next check goes in. Even when I made over 100k she still spent it all, I have nothing to show all the years I was married and being her sugar daddy I guess. </p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

																<p>My husband had a child with his ex girlfriend who took off and left she did not allow him to see the child. He ended up fighting for the child and got shared parenting he was not ordered to pay support at that time.He has gone back to court numerous times and and was given full custody and supervised over night visits no child support ordered. My husband and I have been together for 5 years now, and have 2 children together. We recently just went back to court and now it is daily unspervised visit no overnight visits and he has to pick up after work from her. Lawyer mentioned someting about possibly paying child support for the child. Which he has no issues with. We were just trying to figure out how it would all work out since we got married 4 months ago. I am a stay at home mom now after we had our last child only my husband works now. Will they take in consideration of our 2 kids (ages1,3) and his child with his ex (age 6) and his support of me(I am disabled from a work injury as well so I can not work at a job at all and have no income)he supports our whole family and the house and everything is his name as well as the car. Just trying to figure it out a head of time just in case we should start saving some money if they end up requesting us to pay back pay.</p>

																<p>See if the judge will allow the parents to use a child support trust account in the form of a special purpose checking account like this (<a href="https://www.mediate.com/articles/if_they_can_do_parenting_plans.cfm" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.mediate.com/articles/if_they_can_do_parenting_plans.cfm</a>).</p>
<p>This would provide accountability and help make sure that the child support is actually being used to provide for the children instead of being treated as additional family income that the custodial parent can spend any way they damned well please.</p>
<p>In my state, parents are supposed to split the transportation costs for visitation. If my guess is correct, and you are paying all of the visitation costs, then I would ask the court to order the custodial parent to allow the noncustodial parent to claim the children as dependents for tax purposes in order to pay for the travel expenses associated with visitation.</p>
<p>If the noncustodial parent now has or has ever had a child support arrears, I would ask what interest rate the courts have ordered the noncustodial parent to pay on the child support arrears. Federal law [42 US Code 654(21)(a)] caps the amount of interest that states can charge on child support arrears at 6-percent simple interest. If the custodial parent was charged more than 6-percent interest on their child support arrears, then this may have made him overpay child support, and he may be due a refund.</p>
<p>The courts are also SUPPOSED to consider the paying parent&#8217;s ability to pay child support, but my experience has been that courts are more concerned with increasing the gross amount of child support collected, because that increases the federal kickbacks that states receive for collecting child support under the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act.</p>
<p>English judge Sir William Blackstone described child support as being for the care and maintenance of the children, but my experience has been that courts are more interested in treating custodial parents as indentured servants by forcing the paying parent to provide a government mandated lifestyle for the children, and by inference, the custodial parent. We also won&#8217;t get started on the lack of visitation enforcement by &#8216;family&#8217; courts. I&#8217;ve learned to consider myself to be damned lucky to be allowed to visit with my children at my ex-wife&#8217;s whim.</p>
<p>And yes, the contact information is fictitious because my family court judge is not happy with me. It has something to do with my having proven her wrong several times without my having a law degree. I also write my legislators regularly about these issues.</p>

																<p>60% is too much for 2 kids. Have it modified. Even if the mom don’t work 30% of his net should be the max being paid. If this went to csa for not paying and there are areers that’s your husbands fault. I spoke to many woman who get 0 support for kids and struggle. They claim he’s a drug addict and can’t be found etc. so that’s a way to get out of paying seems kind of stupid as a response I’ve received.  Child support comes Down to the woman going after it.</p>
<p>On my case I supported my ex as a stay at home mom for 12 years  on my salary alone. Since I was only s paycheck to my ex I asked her to get a job I was leaving.  2 Kids were teenagers at this point.  So my ex was being paid support by me for 6 months until she got on her feet. Remember I paid 100% of my net for what we had for 12 years she had no income. Same day she was to get a support payment I received divorce docs and child support prelight orders to pa 891 per month which is more than50% of her gross income. It’s lije 29% of my net income, so eh yes it ducks  but I see this as a debt that will end in 5 years. It’s for sure not fair as the prior 12 years was 100% me supporting a dream that was not mine. So I get 72% of my income saving the same 800 my ex gets and living off 1200 a month renting a room.  In the end I come out the winner my ex was and is a gold digger narcissistic woman. I’m happy I’m not with her I can imagine being in s bad marriage for 30-50 more years no thanks. </p>
<p>Pay your damn child support or it’s hoing to come back and make life harder., the gold digger woman will make sure you pay no doubt,. Dumb system that’s a reason to not bother wasting time with girls they are a money trap no matter what’s said.</p>

																<p>I cannot believe some responses from the women advocating child support. I&#8217;m a woman who left my kids&#8217; dad and Never went for child support! I have a job, he has a job! He has bills, I have bills! He buys them clothes, I buy them clothes! My fiance has 4 kids, he makes over 10k a month&#8230;works 70 hours a week if not more. His ex wife doesn&#8217;t work, neither does her husband. By time all her stuff is taken out of the check, health insurance, dental, her car payment, her insurance on the car and child support, his bring home is about 2800&#8230;he has kids 160 days a year! Tell me that&#8217;s okay? He works his ass off and her and her husband reap the benefits. Her nails are always done, the kids wouldn&#8217;t have anything nice if I didn&#8217;t buy it&#8230;she doesn&#8217;t spend that money on the kids..she gets food stamps and all that! They are children..not an income! It blows my mind that the state of OK is okay with that! I would never do that to my kids&#8217; dad. We didn&#8217;t work out, that&#8217;s fine our job is to work together to raise our kids, not for me to vengefully take his income toprove a point. Get your shit together!</p>

																<p>Woman like you deserve nothing but respect! some of the exes think that is the fathers responsibility to support them and their kids. It is not fair that child support can get so hight not caring about the expenses and necessities of the father working so hard for him and his new family not to have anything and top of that live in debt their lives because the other woman does not want to arrange anything and she decides that 1000 a month is just enough for one kid. I mean what type of kid spends 1000 dollars a month if she doesn&#8217;t have to pay anything not insurance not day care</p>

																<p>Some states have laws allowing courts to order an accounting to make sure that the child support is actually spent on the children. This may be worth investigating. Some states also have laws making misappropriation of child support a criminal offense, which you could use to get the court to give your husband custody of the children in exchange for not pressing criminal charges against the ex-wife and her &#8230;paramour.</p>
<p>If the court will allow you to use a Child Support Trust Account in the form of a shared checking account like this one (<a href="https://www.mediate.com/articles/if_they_can_do_parenting_plans.cfm" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.mediate.com/articles/if_they_can_do_parenting_plans.cfm</a>), it would also help keep your husband&#8217;s ex-wife from treating the child support as additional income that she can spend any way she damned well pleases. </p>
<p>As I stated in a previous post, Federal law [654(21)(a)] limits the amount of interest that states can charge on child support arrears. If your husband was ordered to pay more than 6-percent interest on any past child support arrears, you should ask the prosecutors office about any interest that your husband may have paid on his child support payments, and have the prosecutors office recalculate the interest charges using the rate specified by Federal law, not state law or local court rules. If the court charged less than 6-percent, I would not ask for a recalculation.</p>
<p>And no, I&#8217;m not a lawyer. I&#8217;ve just dealt with too many sleazy, unethical lawyers, and I&#8217;ve learned how they think.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

																<p>IF you did not go for child support that&#8217;s your fault and your decision.  Don&#8217;t expect another woman to forfit what their CHILDREN are entitled to because you feel like they should be like you. You got with a man with that amount of child support.  YOU made that choice. Now  live with it.</p>

																<p>My ex is a user. He is currently underpaying in child support and still giving me hell about it. It is not court ordered but what he agreed to give and I am trying to keep the peace while struggling and running through my savings to make up the difference. </p>
<p>BUT, he resents that he has to pay ANYTHING at all for his child and constantly reminds me of it and always uses it against me. He&#8217;s refused to put her on his health insurance and I&#8217;m not going to be able to much longer, so we&#8217;re probably going to have to get on assistance and he&#8217;ll be forced to pay it through the courts. I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re going to deal with him then.  </p>
<p>He makes almost 2.5X what I earn btw, but it goes through his hands like water because he never knew how to budget in the first place and priorities fishing and shopping trips over utility bills. </p>
<p>Last week, he tried to lower his support even more and bullied me about it and I told him that would leave me no choice but to put him on court ordered child support, and he told me I was threatening him. He doesn&#8217;t realize that a mother does not need to make threats, she can simply go file. He fails to see that the mere fact that I haven&#8217;t filed says a lot. But instead he twists my words as if I&#8217;m just some money-hungry woman looking to ruin him and his girlfriend. He&#8217;s a true narcissist who thinks the world owes him something for nothing. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure some of you dads who think you relate to him just because he&#8217;s a man paying child support probably think I&#8217;ve done something wrong. Nope. Never cheated, scammed, hit, abused, or remotely tried to hurt him. The most I&#8217;ve ever done to him was stand up to his abuse, which he would have none of. </p>
<p>But if you were smart, you would never compare yourself to this monster. I&#8217;m sure some of you new wives think that he should not have to pay anything but I find it ridiculous that a man wants to cut his $200/mo into half just because he can do it. </p>
<p>He is the worst but I still can&#8217;t hurt him. I see a lot comments about cutthroat ex wives ruining these guys and I wonder why he can&#8217;t count his blessings?</p>
<p>If I have to go on state assistance or if I run out of savings, I&#8217;m not going to have any choice but to get a support order. Then things will get even worse. I wish I had the cajones these ex wives have. </p>

																<p>All of you “step parents” complaining that your husband is paying so much support; I’m going to break it down for you so it’s simple to understand (as the ex receiving support).<br>
1) you knew when you chose to break up his family and marry him that he would have to pay support.<br>
2) kids are expensive and the custodial parent has a lot of weight on her shoulders. She has to work one or two jobs and still come home and help kids with homework, prepare meals, clean the house, do laundry, get 2-3 hours of sleep then wake up and do it all over again. She deserves some help!<br>
3) none of you complaining seem to comprehend that kids are expensive. I’m going to use my situation as an example; I receive 1090 child support for three kids, his wife complains he pays too much and they struggle. I work two full time jobs, so daycare is 45$ a day for 3 kids that’s 135$ per DAY! On daycare alone!!!!! 50% of that should be his responsibility to pay, half of the monthly costs of daycare is 2025$!!! I pay 4050 a month of daycare! Just daycare!!!!! His little 1090 he pays a month is NOT enough to even pay half the daycare!<br>
Now, let’s look at bills: at home it is me and 3 children a total of 4 people. He’s responsible for half the bills his 3 kids help create. The mortgage is 1000, 3/4 of that (the kids share since they live there) is 750$. Half of that 750 is HIS responsibility so that’s another 375 he should be paying in addition to his half of daycare of 2025, so now he is up to 2375$ he should pay but only pays 1090 and his ex is still complaining. Add another 250 for the kids share of the electric bill, water bill, cable bill, WiFi bill, another 600 a month for his half of the groceries they eat, none of that is factoring in clothes, shoes, extracurricular activities, medical care costs etc etc! Really he should be paying almost 5000 a month for 3 kids but court can only grant 1090 because his income is lower than mine. He refuses to get a better job or work 2 jobs like I am forced to do to pick up his slack, and the new wife doesn’t work at all yet wants to complain about him paying “sooooo much” </p>
<p>Please lol trust me the guys paying support are the ones getting off easy! The custodial parent typically is not getting 50% like she should!</p>

																<p>Here&#8217;s what people aren&#8217;t understanding.  YES a parent should be responsible and pay for their child/ren but it shouldn&#8217;t be all about one parent doing it all.  If it takes TWO to make a child it sure as hell should be TWO incomes (especially in today&#8217;s economy).  </p>
<p>My situation is this.  I pay over $700 a month in CS plus medical for 2 kids.  I have another child who lives with me and my husband.  My ex never uses the money he gets from me for the children.  They always have clothes that look disheveled or not the right size, never have winter coats or boots, barely keeps minimal food in the house etc. yet always seems to be driving a nice vehicle and is always going out on &#8220;dates&#8221; and treating his girlfriends.  That&#8217;s another issue is that he is NEVER home to be with the kids.  On top of my CS and medical that I pay I still go and buy them the essentials that he FAILS to provide even though as sole custodian receiving CS and working a full time job you should be providing.  Then on top of that I STILL have a third child to raise and a mortgage payment, and the same damn water, electric, internet, phone, gas, car payment, daycare etc. as he does yet none of that is taken into consideration when figuring out CS.</p>
<p>In my experience, there are losers who get out of taking care of their kids BUT there are also losers that are money hungry selfish assholes that think they shouldn&#8217;t be responsible for anything.  Either way the kids get the brunt of it and it sucks either way.</p>
<p>My advice.  Do what you should, pay what you should, handle everything legally, and let karma and God handle the rest ;)</p>

																<p>The only this you can do is get more time with the kids&#8230; unfortunately you guys live 9 hours away. My honest advice is to move closer to them. Move to the same city, even around d the damn corner. More time equals less money. Less time equals more money. And your ex should not be affecting your new life. But that’s how the system works. My right hand to God, I move!!!! I promise that’s the only way because the courts WILL NOT award you primary custody unless she’s on drugs.</p>

																<p>I have the same situation with my fiancé. Child support office increased the double of child support while the only thing we wanted to do was to lower it. it went up to 1000 dollars just for one kid, money that we already didn&#8217;t have. This is not fair that the &#8220;system&#8221; only cares for the first family and if the father decides to make a new life and have another child then this family has tu suffer and be burned out financially. Rights should be equal for both of the families not just one and there should be a way to impose the unlawful rights.</p>

																<p>To the original person with the boo-hoos about her &#8220;poor husband&#8221; having to pay so much child support&#8230;<br>
You yourself suggested the solution: pay for the next 13 years then double up saving then&#8230;you&#8217;ll be able to afford to save a lot by then.<br>
As a first wife with 2 kids I must say I&#8217;m sickened by people like you&#8230; by ANYONE who tries to rationalize keeping the money in your own pocket instead of giving it to the kids. You knew your hubby had 2 kids from a previous marraige, you knew he had to pay support and you are hear crying about how unfair it is. Unfair to whom? You and the life you COULD be having- if not for those 2 pesky kids he had before he met you? Him because he works so hard and has to pay for those 2 kids he had with his first wife? I notice you actually said that child support gets increased for things like ballet and piano lessons-so apparently the mom is using child support to support the children.<br>
Are you really so despicable that you&#8217;d lower the quality of those kids lives to better your own? Bc THAT, all bs aside, is the situation.<br>
I cannot believe someone here suggested getting a divorce &#8220;on paper&#8221; to get out of paying so much&#8230;what a degenerate. But go ahead and do it. It sounds like a ghetto situation you&#8217;d be totally comfortable with. The ONLY people who will ever have compassion for your pitiful whine are greedy self serving narcissists who can&#8217;t help but thinking about themselves, about what they could do or have if not for CHILDREN.<br>
Children are dependant, like 100% totally dependant- upon thier parents and what thier parents do for them. You dont seem to have any complaints about the mom&#8230;you didnt say that they go on vacations too often, that she parties all the time, that she drives an expensive flashy car, that she drinks or does drugs&#8230;just that she&#8217;s spending money to give the kids a life that according to calculators and the law the parents can afford. If you think those kids should not be able to learn piano and ballet so that you can &#8211; do whatever it is you want- then you should not have gotten involved with this man. Don&#8217;t give me that love crap either bc I&#8217;m POSITIVE first wife has a bunch of stories about what she endured &#8220;for love&#8221; whole she was married to your current husband. </p>
<p>If YOU want to get a second, cash only job ots and not report it to the irs, knock yourself out. You def sound like your unhappy with the life your living and need that money to make it better. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;d be &#8220;unethical&#8221;, certainly ILLEGAL. No quotations needed. But if you meant to make your husband get a second cash only job to improve your quality of life and not report that income..that&#8217;s definitely unethical, illegal, negligent, manipulative and disgraceful.<br>
Maybe you just made a mistake and married the wrong guy bc he has obligations to a family he is no longer with. You will NEVER stop thinking about all the money he has to pay. Even 13 years from now, when he&#8217;s no longer paying&#8230;bc then you&#8217;ll be thinking about how much further in life you COULD be, how much more STUFF you could have- if he didn&#8217;t have to pay ALL THAT CHILD SUPPORT FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.<br>
This is the life you CHOSE. don&#8217;t make your husbands children suffer bc you don&#8217;t like how it worked out</p>

																<p>I am in a similar situation. My husband does no work because he has mental health issues so I am our soul income.Bu he is sill required to pay child support. I have three kids of my own and see nothing from m ex because he is unemployed. the state we divorced in does nothing to enforce him to pay me. Meanwhile, I am paying my husband&#8217;s CS and we don&#8217;t even make it paycheck to paycheck. We can barely put food on the table. Life is really rough. I am at a lose to what I can do. I do not have the money like his ex has to fight. He doesn&#8217;t even get to see his kids, or talk to them. His ex doesn&#8217;t allow him any contact whatsoever.</p>

																<p>I receive $1300 for one child from her father. In court he claimed he had stepkids and he had just  had another child to support. The judge told him to send the kids mother to work just like I work to support my child. If she couldn’t support the kids she already had why would they stupidly have another kid just to try and lower my child support? She knew he had a kid when she married him and now she wants a pity party? No, stop having kids if you cannot support them especially if he already has an obligation to other children. The judge said “you need to accommodate your life to your first children not your children to your ‘new family” Amen to that. If I decide to have another child I will take into consideration I have one to support already.</p>

																<p>Well I’m from Canada hello to everyone above that I did and didn’t have time to read, long feed :)  Divorce is a huge racket that puts money in Lawyers,Judges,law makers pockets and professional X-wives. First they make it super beneficial to the woman to get rid of their husband.  Then they rake it in when the woman cashes in.  Why wouldn’t you? It’s too tempting to resist 1/2 of one guys money and all the next guys, what a deal! You would be crazy not to cash in the first chance you get when he’s too busy working to pay attention to you. Find the next guy and cash in again. “You go girl” Get started early so you can get lots on the hook. Hall the guy into court every time he gets a 5 cent raise so the lawyers and judges can get their $5000 a day.  I make 115k a year so like 85k American I take home 60k after deductions or 45k American so $3750 a month. We got this great chart up here you that a man hater invented that makes no sense. The Judge just runs his finger along it to 115k then across to 2900 a month and boom his 5k a day is a breeze no other considerations needed or f’s to give. So 3000 xwife and 2000 me Canadian. Then with my 1500 a month American I can pay for car rent a house big enough to house my kids I get  8 weeks out of the year. Then what really hurts is after my 3000 goes there and adds to her 2k she gets from being disabled from a bad weight reduction surgery she got and paid for with my buy out money I never got from house and her child benefits from government and her boyfriends money she doesn’t work but has 10,000 a month to my 2k. Oh 3 kids by the way. Then when I do have them they want things because they get nothing no activities, rags for close. You tell the judge about this and all you get is what did you make last year, ok let me pull my chart out&#8230;.  One judge even spent 20 minutes explaining that he didn’t have time to see us all and would we please take the time to petition the government to allow more 5k a day judges to come use this great chart.  It’s beyond rediculous!  I bet 90% of the time it’s the woman divorcing the man, even if a man wanted to he can’t afford it.  Imagine the unemployed judges and lawyers etc if it didn’t pay to get rid of the father of your children. What would they do? How would they eat? Who would play God and Tear all the homes apart. Maybe a quick reminder of vows and a solid $0 if you screw your husband over would fix our divorce numbers!! Boom!!</p>

																<p>I’ve been with my current boyfriend for 3 years now and we have two kids together he had 2 kids with one on the way when we first met.He wasn’t sure if the last baby was his DNA was taken came back his.I was pregnant he was already paying child support,buying things for the kids out of pocket him  and his mom.The mother is on section 8,food stamps,wic every free resource she could buy couldn’t get a job.On the other hand I don’t receive any type of benefits he did tell his caseworker he had kids in the home they didn’t care.He was paying 470 a month plus insurance that she never used or planned on using.She always needed help from his mother for diapers and etc these judges don’t know what’s in the best interest of the child due to most custodial parents living off the government.The more he made the more she wanted him to pay more when he couldn’t even get to spend time with his kids.There are other ways for the non custodial parent to help financially why should a parent basically have to pay the mother why not purchase what the kids needs and keep receipts.Let alone the judge never asks the mother how she provides for the kids outside of the free resources it’s not fair.A parent can’t work their butt off to stay out of jail and have time to spend with the kids too it’s designed for noncustodial parents to be absent you ask me.</p>

																<p>I have a headache&#8230;the kids come first. Who cares about fancy trips, and big house. In a blink the kids will be grown and gone, and all the joy, chances for fun family time will be over. Instead of counting pennies, how about holding the children a little longer. Take a trip with them, because trust me it&#8217;ll be over before you know it and all the child support won&#8217;t get this opportunity back.</p>

																<p>My advice: 60% is NOTHING. Children need all they can get and if the court has decided this is the number, well, perhaps the father should have REALLY REALLY REALLY CONSIDERED that before the 1st wife filed in court. </p>
<p>The problem here isn&#8217;t the scenario. The problem here isn&#8217;t the wife. The problem here isn&#8217;t the number, i.e. 60%; THE PROBLEM is that two people who had a child CANNOT agree on what to provide for that child so they rely on a fundamentally broken and actual patriarchal system to determine the numbers for them. And yes, I did say patriarchal because there are men who find LEGITIMATE and illegal ways to scheme this broken system and that&#8217;s even worse than this debate.</p>

																<p>It could be worse&#8230;  My daughter married a guy and they had a child. My granddaughter. After two years got a divorce&#8230; He paid $600 a month child support and everything was fine but that only lasted one and half years.  He got a DUI which was his third DUI total so he lost his license which in turn his employer fired him because he missed some work.  So we have a healthy 35 year old male with no job and no money and now he isn&#8217;t paying a dime in child support.  His car is repossessed which he couldn&#8217;t drive anyway and he was evicted from his apartment because he wasn&#8217;t paying the bills.  He ended up in a shelter.  Two months later he signs up for an EBT card and Government assistance and gets a Government assisted apartment that only cost $52.00 a month, $350.00 in free food and he also started a job getting paid cash that he doesn&#8217;t pay taxes on.  We reported him and they said they would investigate but that was six months ago.  To this day he still doesn&#8217;t report his income or pay child support.  How does the Government let this happen?  He&#8217;s living in a nice apartment and eating well for a single 35 year old male.  Ho owes my daughter $13,000 dollars and it keeps racking up.</p>

																<p>I would like to know when &#8220;Accountability for Child Support Payments&#8221; will began to take effect nationwide.</p>
<p>And yes, a child does not need $800.00 a month.</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>When is visitation for time with our children going to be enforced?</p>
<p>1 parent did not make the child, 2 did.</p>
<p>So why is the system so one sided?</p>
<p>Child Support back pay for the next 20 years!!! </p>
<p>Come on, seriously!!</p>
<p>Some people don&#8217;t need to hit the lottery, they will destroy themselves &amp; the kids immediately.</p>
<p>The system is broken &amp; needs to be fixed, not just for us, but for our children too..Mainly for our children.</p>
<p>Non-custodial fathers &amp; non-custodial mothers, have our rights too!!!</p>
<p>We have a life too.</p>
<p>There are many fathers imprisoned at this moment for back Child Support.</p>
<p>Are they rapist, drug dealers, &amp; murderers or something?</p>
<p>I say again, the custodial parent needs to be held accountable for every dime spent on the child, so that we will know for sure that our child is being taken care of for real.</p>
<p>We non-custodial parents have a right to have good credit &amp; be able to purchase a home for our children to come to.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t put all the pressure on a non-custodial parent, that is an unbalanced scale.</p>
<p>I know women who receive Child Support monthly, &amp; throw parties with the money, give it to their boyfriends, buy drugs &amp; alcohol, while the child is hungry, clothes are too small &amp; old.</p>
<p>In fact one woman is one of my own nephew&#8217;s mother.</p>
<p>But can we prove this, absolutely not. It&#8217;s not right at all.</p>
<p>When was the last time a custodial parent has had a drug evaluation, &amp; test?</p>
<p>When is there going to be more CPS involvement to check that the child lives in a clean, drug-free, hostility free,  safe environment?</p>
<p>When will social workers be hired to keep record of Child Support payment spending?</p>
<p>When will it all add up like it&#8217;s supposed to?</p>
<p>Never?</p>
<p>Right is right, &amp; wrong is wrong.</p>
<p>We demand justice!!!!</p>
<p>And we demand it now!!!</p>
<p>God bless our children, &amp; us as well.</p>

																<p>Its not step parents not wanting their partners to pay child support but within reason.And yeah the kids get the crappy deal in it all by not havi g both patents but for some it&#8217;s healthier to have two parents apart than two who can&#8217;t get along or don&#8217;t love each other anymore or constantly fighting.And you don&#8217;t know everyone&#8217;s situation so most of your statements are plain out stupid.</p>

																<p>My ex-wife and her new husband have a business together, but do not report their business income during court.  Two things:</p>
<p>1.  How can I get the information that her business makes?  I can not afford an attorney..</p>
<p>2.  Since her new husband and her are knowingly making money to support each other financially (They have separate jobs and a business together).  Can I now use his entire income included with hers (jointly) because he knowingly is making money together in their business.  In my logic, it doesn&#8217;t seem ok for them to acquire financial gain in one situation, but be omitted seperately in another.  Can his income be included together in child support now?</p>

																<p>My state requires both parents to provide copies of their tax returns to the court to verify the parents&#8217; income. If your ex-wife and her new husband aren&#8217;t reporting all of their income to the IRS, that creates another set of problems for them, which could cause the courts to give you custody if they are charged with tax fraud.</p>

																<p>I think its time everyone gets together and changes the law to put an end to this injustice.<br>
It turns my stomach to see some of these revenge orientated, petty, money hungry mothers out there that are just using the children against us. There are thousands of examples out there. There are thousands of abuses of the system being used against us. this all needs to end now. </p>
<p>We are not dead beats. We are trying to provide for our children, not our ex- spouses. We can&#8217;t do this if we are put in jail, have our drivers licences taken, and have all our disposable income taken from us. This needs to end now. We all need to organize and make a change. freedom to starve, is not freedom.</p>

																<p>Not too off the subject but has anyone heard of bonding time for siblings; being court order? My ex wife is pregnant with twins by her ex boyfriend and has demanded “bonding time”, without a time period, that I would be losing my parenting time so my kids can bond with there new siblings once there born. The problem I have with this besides not knowing the length of time she’s requesting is why is bonding time even necessary for her if she is the majority parent? I only get to have my kids two and a half days per week (116 days per year counting holidays and vacation times) My kids hate the idea as they are on continuous cleaning  duties on her time and thank me for giving them a break at my house.  For my kids sake I am really thinking about going to court and fighting not to have bonding time with the kids since she is majority parent already. My honest belief is that she is using my lost days to request additional child support as she has done in the past for a quite similar issue&#8230;. I am simply amazed how children have been made to become such “investments” that the court system is actually dictating this type of, in my eyes, scam&#8230; Between courts, attorneys, lost work for the past 5 years going back and forth through court, having to pay a mandatory 60% of everything outside of child support payments then to provide the same things at my household is ridiculous&#8230; I’d rather have been ordered to pay a full ride scholarship to Harvard; which would have been paid in full by the time we’re all done with court. At least I would honestly see my money being spent on my children and not the two coach purses she bought herself on mother’s day as my child support check was cleared&#8230;.</p>

																<p>You both chose or one chose to split the family and not give that child a family home. I feel each parent should be responsible for children on their OWN time with their OWN money. If one of the parents doesn&#8217;t want time with their kids, then slam that parent with child support. Too many of us suffer because of dead beat parents in the past. My case, I wanted the family, she wanted the single life. Now I suffer the financial consequence while she gets to pile up her money ($20k when we split), collect govt assistance and work under the table. Judge knows that and still hits me with hard pill to swallow. My incoming vs outgoing leaves me negative $125 a month but i was told, the law is the law. Not fair, makes it easy for a parent to live a good life for minimum 18 years. Why can&#8217;t I have extra cash to take my son to a amusement park but she can? I want that memory too your honor. I was also told by my lawyer this system is set so the child lives equally in both homes. Lol&#8230;yeah, we live equal. She has a 2 bedroom apt while I am forced to share a room with my son. I had a beautiful 2 bedroom condo for 8 years previous to making the wrong decision with this lady. No regrets though because she birthed me an amazing son. Guess I should of lived my life as the Bible preaches and perhaps I wouldn&#8217;t be in this mess at age 44. The system is failed and it&#8217;s time to be fair to the parents too. Not saying this is what all women do because there are many that deserve the support because Dad is a bum but I&#8217;m sure there are plenty that have multiple kids because how the system is set up which makes them a certified bum. Feel bad for a millionaire. Boy they get hustled. What&#8217;s fair is let the child see how a parent works hard to provide and not one suffer from the system. That&#8217;s living equal!!! If Mom or Dad isn&#8217;t motivated to do better in life, that&#8217;s their fault. For now my son will look at mom as the bread winner taking him out buying him clothes, prettying up herself, while Dad lives conservative until he&#8217;s nearly 60. If Dad makes more money, mom gets more? How is that fair? Now there are women on the opposite side of this argument that have to pay dad and it&#8217;s unfair to them too so don&#8217;t take this as a male chauvinist point of view. Bottom line is simple, you have a child and can&#8217;t be a grown up to stay together for the better of the family, then you pay for the care of the child on your time no excuses. Make the law like this and watch how many more families try to make it work things out instead of splitting up because they know the system has their back. Watch how families work together. Guess the system would rather benefit with court costs, monthly processing fees, mediation services, court paper document fees instead of seeing families together. That&#8217;s the America we live in. I think this topic needs revisited and hopefully a go fund me page will be created to buy the best attorney team to take this out of the states hands and squash that ridiculous percentage of your income rule and at least come with a fair weekly cost for all no matter of your status quo. God help us all!</p>
