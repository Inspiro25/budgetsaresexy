“ being broke should have worked your crap out and not broken up your child’s home” 

Wow someone got cheated on. I am very happy I am not as miserable as you sound. I happily paid for 2 of my husbands children and provided them food and shelter but it is not my obligation to provide for children when the mother uses them as a paycheck and them continued to have idk 9 more children she cannot provide for. I chose to be childless and I did chose to marry a good man with a lot of baggage and a crazy X. 

Not everyone can plan their life out to be a cold heartless person but you seem like you’re doing a great job.]]></description>

This is what I&#039;m thinking, too. I know my daughter&#039;s ex owes around 30K at the moment. He only paid support for two months when it was time for him to go to criminal court to try to argue he had children relying on him for support and couldn&#039;t go to jail. Not that they ever send them anyway no matter how evil they are toward multiple women.]]></description>

I agree, if a man wants to complain about child support then be with the mother so that raising the child is cheaper. That old saying is true, it is cheaper to keep her! Especially if the mother wants to work things out. It burns me up when a new woman comes along and gets angry at child support when they wrecked the family by not getting out of the way so that the father can work it out with the mother. I spent 6 years with my sons father and he cheated on me and got the new woman pregnant so I left and filed support on him. He got ordered 1400$ for our son and it is more than half his income. So now that new woman wants to complain about how he can’t afford to take care of her baby. I’m like well that’s karma! She shouldn’t have slept with a man who already had a family!]]></description>

First of all, your use of the word &quot;deadbeat&quot; mirrors my family court judge&#039;s attitude. Her Honor (sarcasm intended) does not differentiate between &quot;deadbroke&quot; and &quot;deadbeat&quot; parents. As far as Her Honor is concerned, any parent who does not pay child support for any reason is a &quot;deadbeat&quot;.

Now, let&#039;s do the math here.

Assume you now make $1000 a week after a long period of involuntary unemployment (such as the so-called &quot;Great Recession&quot;) and the court refused to change your child support obligation because &quot;you&#039;ll get another job that pays the same soon&quot;.

After taxes, your take-home pay will be about 750 a week. Now deduct 50% of your gross income from that $750 figure to pay a combination of current child support, a child support arrears, and more interest on the child support arrears than allowed by Federal law [42 US Code 654(21)(a)]. You are now down to about $250 a week take-home pay, which is just over minimum wage.

How are you supposed to support yourself and be more than a visitor in your life when &quot;our friends in government&quot; treat you as an indentured servant who should consider themselves to be damned lucky to be allowed to visit with their children at the custodial parents whim?

I&#039;m also going to ask you the same question that I asked Her Honor when she threatened to lock me up because I did not have the money to pay the retroactive &quot;child support&quot; that I was ordered to pay to my unfaithful ex-wife in a lump sum - how is a parent supposed to be able to work in order to earn the money to support themselves and their children while they are in debtor&#039;s prison?]]></description>

Sorry, but it&#039;s hard to concentrate on &quot;being there for his kids&quot; when Mom takes them to the movies every week and we&#039;re about to lose the roof over our heads. Why should I have to lose my house and savings while the kids go to the movies and get brand new cell phones and electronics every year, and go to the movies and participate in any extracurricular they want? The children don&#039;t NEED those things; they need food, shelter, clothing, etc.]]></description>

My state requires both parents to provide copies of their tax returns to the court to verify the parents&#039; income. If your ex-wife and her new husband aren&#039;t reporting all of their income to the IRS, that creates another set of problems for them, which could cause the courts to give you custody if they are charged with tax fraud.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You both chose or one chose to split the family and not give that child a family home. I feel each parent should be responsible for children on their OWN time with their OWN money. If one of the parents doesn&#039;t want time with their kids, then slam that parent with child support. Too many of us suffer because of dead beat parents in the past. My case, I wanted the family, she wanted the single life. Now I suffer the financial consequence while she gets to pile up her money ($20k when we split), collect govt assistance and work under the table. Judge knows that and still hits me with hard pill to swallow. My incoming vs outgoing leaves me negative $125 a month but i was told, the law is the law. Not fair, makes it easy for a parent to live a good life for minimum 18 years. Why can&#039;t I have extra cash to take my son to a amusement park but she can? I want that memory too your honor. I was also told by my lawyer this system is set so the child lives equally in both homes. Lol...yeah, we live equal. She has a 2 bedroom apt while I am forced to share a room with my son. I had a beautiful 2 bedroom condo for 8 years previous to making the wrong decision with this lady. No regrets though because she birthed me an amazing son. Guess I should of lived my life as the Bible preaches and perhaps I wouldn&#039;t be in this mess at age 44. The system is failed and it&#039;s time to be fair to the parents too. Not saying this is what all women do because there are many that deserve the support because Dad is a bum but I&#039;m sure there are plenty that have multiple kids because how the system is set up which makes them a certified bum. Feel bad for a millionaire. Boy they get hustled. What&#039;s fair is let the child see how a parent works hard to provide and not one suffer from the system. That&#039;s living equal!!! If Mom or Dad isn&#039;t motivated to do better in life, that&#039;s their fault. For now my son will look at mom as the bread winner taking him out buying him clothes, prettying up herself, while Dad lives conservative until he&#039;s nearly 60. If Dad makes more money, mom gets more? How is that fair? Now there are women on the opposite side of this argument that have to pay dad and it&#039;s unfair to them too so don&#039;t take this as a male chauvinist point of view. Bottom line is simple, you have a child and can&#039;t be a grown up to stay together for the better of the family, then you pay for the care of the child on your time no excuses. Make the law like this and watch how many more families try to make it work things out instead of splitting up because they know the system has their back. Watch how families work together. Guess the system would rather benefit with court costs, monthly processing fees, mediation services, court paper document fees instead of seeing families together. That&#039;s the America we live in. I think this topic needs revisited and hopefully a go fund me page will be created to buy the best attorney team to take this out of the states hands and squash that ridiculous percentage of your income rule and at least come with a fair weekly cost for all no matter of your status quo. God help us all!]]></description>
