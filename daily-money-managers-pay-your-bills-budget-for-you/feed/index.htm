					<description><![CDATA[I have such severe ADHD and an autoimmune disease and lifelong struggles with finances and homelessness. I&#039;m facing down eviction for the third time this year because I keep forgetting to get and turn in the money orders for rent. In June, it took me a week to get them from the bank and then they sat on my backpack for 2 weeks being invisible! I hate being like this. A DMM would do so much to bring me stability. Yes, I need an allowance. I can&#039;t be relied upon to remember bills and make sure there is money available when it&#039;s due. And I&#039;m sad there is so much shaming going on in the comments.]]></description>

This is excitedly what II am looking for.  I am sixty three, kinda late in life to learn how to budget and stick to it. I am a nurse and always had enough 
money to just pay cash for every thing. except car and house.. Now I am in trouble, I spend what I don&#039;t have and need to save enough for at least six months of bill payments in case something happens  I need to know that all my monthly bills are paid. And I what amount I have to spend each month and documentation on all of what i paid and bought. I would also need to need some way of not being able to go over my spending. Limit.  
. I would be happy to pay $100 to $200
For that service. Maybe an intial fee to set it all up and instructions on how to use the service.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have long wanted something like this! I am the worst and I definitely overspend. I did reach out to someone who I found locally on the AADMM website and was disappointed that all she did was create a budget and proceed to tell me where I overspend. Which I already know, but hello no self control!  I really want to hand over my $$ have them pay the bills and then give me an allowance. I know it sounds childish, but I really can&#039;t be trusted lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/daily-money-managers-pay-your-bills-budget-for-you/#comment-125036&quot;&gt;a terrible husband...&lt;/a&gt;.

With today&#039;s technology I would be happy to get $50 a month for managing the bills. Pretty easy when is set up and would take couple hours depending in the amount of accounts the customer has. I would add maybe a 10% extra of the total of the bill for emergency fund within the same clearance account, the goal would be to save up for at least a whole month of bills. Example, my mortgage is 1k a month, I have a specific account for the house mortgage automatically transfer weekly from my checking instead of transferring $250*week I do 280, that way at the end of the year there is $1560 extra on that account, yay!!! So, text message &quot;you have $1560 extra in your account&quot;]]></description>

Excellent!! You&#039;ll have to let me know if you end up trying it!! I bet you&#039;d learn a ton in the process whether it works out great or not :) Maybe there&#039;s some sort of *trial run* you can do to protect both sides? Like just setting up a budget or coming up with a bill schedule and then slowly adding from there if everyone&#039;s happy? I bet you can find a template of a contract too poking around you could adapt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting read.  I was approached by someone just today about doing this for them - a personal bookkeeper.  He gave me the run down about what he would like: someone (potentially me) managing his personal finances, paying his bills, etc. and then just telling him how much money he could spend that month. I was kind of surprised by it, but intrigued as well.  I have been thinking about how to do this but with proper safeguards in place for not only him by myself as well. And the big question - how much to charge. It was great to run across this post and have a proper name put to the service.  Thanks for all the links and for all the other comments as well.  Very helpful!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WOW, so this is something I would TOTALLY LOVE doing in my spare time, or even as a full time job!  My friends already have me helping them make budgets and get on track, and I&#039;m pretty good at it.  My husband and I stay on top of our bills and savings, etc.. so this is definitely something I&#039;m interested in!  Off to do more research now, thanks for this!]]></description>
