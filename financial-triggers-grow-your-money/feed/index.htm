					<description><![CDATA[This is really cool. I am a big advocate of vision boards. I have an annual vision board for my overall goals but then do a quarterly one to get more specific. I cut images up from magazines, draw graphs and motivational quotes. I really like the trigger examples you gave]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do the pillow thing too! Usually I throw the box of kleenex or book from on the nightstand onto the floor so that I trip over it in the morning - I started doing this as a variant on something my coworker did when she was interrupted in the middle of something - she would take her wedding ring off and put it on another finger.  

She said that she had noticed that after the interruption, she would find that she would end up either forgetting what she had been working on, or being derailed into starting a new task - and eventually she would notice that the ring was on the wrong finger, and be reminded of what she HAD been doing before she was interrupted.

The idea of &#039;something is out of place, why is that...&#039; triggering a memory, seems to work pretty well!]]></description>

sounds like you need sticky notes to put on those too:

&quot;Don&#039;t eat me or you&#039;ll get FAT!!!&quot;

&quot;Drink me and you&#039;re going to hell.&quot;

Haha... Done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got lists of food posted on my fridge that are helpful for different reasons--anti-inflammatory, good source of omega 3s, lowers cholesterol, etc. Definitely helps me eat more of the good stuff. Now I just gotta eat less of the bad stuff. :)]]></description>
