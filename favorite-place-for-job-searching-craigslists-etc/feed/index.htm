					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Gigs&quot; section is another great place to look. I created PowerPoint presentations for a high school history teacher for $60 a chapter. Made $300 in one month. I also laid a patio one summer when I first moved out here and didn&#039;t have a job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - I know! I really want to do it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Meredith&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yup - had to choose the more entertaining ones of course ;)  Can&#039;t wait to meet you too!  It&#039;s gonna be a great GREAT time.
@&lt;b&gt;Zero Passive Income&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, REAL good for college students - esp during the summer.  Sometimes they have gigs where you can play extras in movies too - those were always the favorites (though I never got to try it unfortunately, have always wanted to :))
@&lt;b&gt;Kody&lt;/b&gt; - Oh nice!!!  Way to take advantage of the perks!
@&lt;b&gt;bleu&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahaha... that is awesome.  And you&#039;re in the hub of the best Craigslist there is!! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;You Suck At Kijiji&lt;/b&gt; - I never got into that Kijiji site but I can see the appeal of it - esp in how you use it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;CrystalH&lt;/b&gt; - NICE!!! And oddly enought I JUST got off the phone on a research survey thingie!!  $150 for 1 hour of my time, best deal ever ;)  Will be blogging about it soon... though it didn&#039;t come from Craigslist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the etc section.  I always browse them in hopes of finding focus groups.  You just have to know how to look out for the ones that are scams.  I&#039;ll be in a focus group next week that pays $125 and we get free lunch!

					<description><![CDATA[Good tip! I&#039;m going to go cruise through now. Usually I browse just the category that most applies to my &quot;field&quot;, and it&#039;s usually miscategorized stuff. Dipping into the miscellaneous grab bag may turn up something just right.

Brian (and others): If you&#039;re in Canada, check Kijiji. (kijiji.ca) It&#039;s eBay&#039;s answer to Craigslist, and is the more popular of the two in most Canadian cities. As the username/web site suggests, I prowl the site for the worst/funniest of it. Don&#039;t let that scare you off from checking it out for work, though. Just keep your scam radar up and you&#039;ll be fine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love craigslist... been using it for over 10 years now out here in the Bay.  But yes, lots of scams on that site.  I just ran across a job in etc... where a guy was asking to pay people to pretend to be his family!  I was like, what the heck is that about!? LOL.]]></description>
