					<description><![CDATA[Subscribed!  I love your blog and found it through Republic Wireless.  My family is working toward F.I. and our primary motivation is so that we can be better stewards.  We just opened our &quot;freedom investment&quot; account on Black Friday(!), and we&#039;re pumped about growing the contributions.  Your work is an inspiration J. Money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can see where that unsubscriber may have been coming from, but you definitely hit the nail on the head.  &quot;Storing up treasures in heaven&quot; was said by Jesus in Matthew 6:20.  Since then, Christians have taken it too far to the point of being careless with their money and not planning for the future.  It&#039;s unfortunate that the unsubscriber left, as your mission to &quot;increase financial awareness and save dat money&quot; is a noble one and when done correctly, will allow people to give more generously then they ever could if they wasted it or stuck it under a mattress and never let it grow!

For any others thinking of unsubscribing in order to &quot;store up treasures in heaven&quot;, don&#039;t do it!  Stick with J Money and his budgeting ideas -- it&#039;s actually OK for Christians to think about money:

					<description><![CDATA[After reading the post and some comments a phrase I heard comes to mind.  &quot;Meaning is more important than the sounds and symbols we use to convey.&quot;

It&#039;s been awhile since I&#039;ve looked into the PF-sphere.  JMonsy and other bloggers definitely helped motivate me to get some sort of budget together.  I&#039;d say my current view of money is for it to be part of my life but not my life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm. I hope for this guy&#039;s sake he doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s putting all of his savings into one of the &quot;seed money&quot; scams that some megachurches run :-( 

John Oliver did a report on those a couple months ago:  https://youtu.be/7y1xJAVZxXg

I&#039;m not Christian myself, but plenty of the PF blogs I read seem to be good with teh Jesus. I don&#039;t see why being financially stable/practical isn&#039;t compatible with spiritual life.]]></description>
