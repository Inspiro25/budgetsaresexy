					<description><![CDATA[#6 Taylor Swift- I can say that I definitely agree that she is one amazing role model for the younger generation. When I was growing up in the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s we had bands like Spice Girls who were trying to target the younger generation but sometimes made me feel that I want to be older. Swift portrays a younger image and does not dress inappropriate like some other young artists do. Swift is very mature and a great role model for the younger generation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you enjoyed  :)  Ludacris surprised me!
@&lt;b&gt;eric&lt;/b&gt; - Oh $hit, are you serious?  That&#039;s pretty sucky if it&#039;s true.  I heard the same thing about Conan O&#039;brien actually.  A friend of mine tried asking him a question (like, what he wanted to eat or something) and according to her he jumped down her throat and said never to look him in the eye when she&#039;s speaking to him.  Unfortunately that&#039;s all I think about now when I see him on tv, even though I find him freakin&#039; hilarious! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Adrian @ PIN&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I love Luda anyways but this makes him even Pimper.
@&lt;b&gt;Carol Chretien&lt;/b&gt; - Haha I agree!  But I didn&#039;t make this list ;)  To 10 financial gurus would be kinda cool though, I might have to jot that one down for later researching.
@&lt;b&gt;finallygettingtoeven.com&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah you never do *really* know w/ some people.  I&#039;m not too familiar with him and what&#039;s true and false w/ Walmart, but as you mentioned as long as good comes out of it somewhere that&#039;s a positive thing :) Personally I much prefer Target.
@&lt;b&gt;Fontaine&lt;/b&gt; - Oh for sure, Oprah is QUEEN!  But I guess that&#039;s too obvious and boring to read ;)  Everyone already knows she&#039;s a rockstar in giving back.
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Hell yeah, Buffett is the man!  Him and Bill Gates are tearing it up on the charity scene.  Pretty big influences those ones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Michelle Obama in the #1 spot??
I don&#039;t think that&#039;s accurate.  Traditionally it has been, so maybe that&#039;s why the author puts her in the #1 spot..but she has not been around long enough to have more influence than, say, Oprah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great list of celebs but one that I still have to wonder about is Quinn of Wal-mart.  While Wallyworld always gets the bad rap (because it appears they deserve it most of the time) I just wonder if Quinn&#039;s heart is truly in it or if he is just doing it to help drive the customers to the stores thinking that walmart actually cares about being &#039;green&#039;.  I guess either way his motives should not matter even if purely selfish, it all helps in the end, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Ellen DeGeneres&#039; &quot;gracious attitude&quot; is just for the cameras. Behind the scenes she is very icy. She won&#039;t make eye contact with anyone below her important people and we were told never to come up and talk to her. I used to work on the show. Thank god I left that chilly place.  Its a bit sickening seeing her on-air persona and knowing the real hidden and true persona.]]></description>
