					<description><![CDATA[Ooooh congrats!!!!  410ks are my all-time favorite financial vehicle - that&#039;s exciting :)  And yeah, KBB is always a bit of a tricky one.  I&#039;ve been using it for so long though that it&#039;s still my #1 source whether I&#039;m buying or selling and so far seems to work out.  I need to spend some more time on Edmunds though, it&#039;s been a while.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit late to the party here, but I figured I&#039;d throw my hat into the ring.  

First: net worth is not happy after May, but June contains five paychecks, a bonus, and becoming fully vested in my 401(k) employer match!  I may have a positive net worth (not counting 401k) by the end of the month and with 401k it&#039;ll be nearing 20k!

Second: KBB is bizarre.  It says my car (2008 Mazda 3) is worth $1,000 _more_ than a year ago and has gained $2,000 in value in the last two months.  Edmunds TMV seems more reasonable, with the price dropping most months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; - My total cash up there is a combination of all my funds &amp; accounts we have all over. But most of it is just there for whatever we need, I don&#039;t break it up into &quot;travel&quot; or &quot;maintenance&quot; etc anymore, although that does work for a lot of people.  Now that we&#039;re financially secure and I understand how our money works each month, it&#039;s much easier for me to just lump it all in :)

And congrats on the engagement!!! And passing $200k net worth - that&#039;s hot!!!

@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Yes it does, Jen!  And it gets even more exciting every month as you continue to watch it grow :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[5.5% is a lot better than the previous term, but I was hoping you would get a better deal. The rates are unbelievable now. I guess it&#039;s tough for underwater properties though. 
We are refinancing our rental home too. :)
