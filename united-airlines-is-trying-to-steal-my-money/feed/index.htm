Ugh!!

That&#039;s probably not United&#039;s fault though - someone probably hacked your c/c info and just happened to purchase tickets with it through them...

Sucks either way though &#128579;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Did not use United Airlines service for years, maybe more than 10 years.
Today I found in the last credit card statement 4 transactions for United tickets purchasing for the total amount $3000+. 
Immediately disputed those transactions through the credit card service fraud department. 
Disrespectful business.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This happened to me today. I made a payment to change my flight and then was told I had not payed even though the united charge was in my bank account and and I had a receipt from United. They then proceeded to reimburse me the amount I payed and tried to charge me a higher amount. I insisted that charging more than advertised was unfair and they took back the original payment they had reimbursed (although they should have given a sort of compensation for the trouble).]]></description>

I&#039;m sorry to hear :( Best thing is to just keep on top of them and be persistent until you get the results you want. It&#039;s annoying as hell, but we&#039;ve gotta look out for ourselves, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

I&#039;m glad I came across this. I&#039;m currently dealing with United Airlines myself, here&#039;s what happened...
I paid for a flight to Australia February 26th and I guess this transaction was being authorized through all the airlines I am traveling through. Air Canada put the money back as United took it back out...only 2 days later they took an additional $1200 leaving me $-715. I only knew because my card was declined at the grocery store and when I looked at my online bank statements I saw it was United Airlines. Naturally I called them and they said they didn&#039;t see that in their system (lies). I call my bank and they investigated it and said I would have my money back in 2-5 business days (which would be 5-10 actual days). I still can&#039;t get a straight answer out of them of why it happened, I can&#039;t even get a formal apology. 
I wish there was more I could do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[oH YEA, THE MANAGER SAID, in my opinion, just my opinion, you should make alternate arrangements because that flight could be cancelled...this was like 3 or 4 PM....he gave out over 20 hotel tickets...

THEN, we find out why, their performance metric is how many flights get cancelled, does not matter if it is delayed...it&#039;s all bullshit as two other flights left on time to Houston and my flight was not listed on the board in the afternoon..why not tell people United Sucks...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[UNITED SUCKS...They delayed my flight from 8:01 to noon saying the plan should be here by 11:30, it might have been but it took the 11:37 flight to Houston, we were screwed...then, the plan should be here 1:15, 2:20, 3:24, then 6:54, then 7:54, then 8:09, then cancelled.  
Same experience with AMEX, they were awesome, she said the hold time is 20 min, will call back and at 12:37 PM she booked me on a US AIR flight whcih was awesome because by the time 5 PM came, nothing was left to get me to sooner to New Orleans...UNITED SUCKS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wowwwww that is horrible!!  And so frustrating, isn&#039;t it?  That not only did their system mess up all those times, but then that you have to go through SO MUCH hassle just to get it fixed!  Or in your case disconnected on, jeez.... messed up for sure, I&#039;m glad your bank got it all squared away for you though :)  At least they want to keep your business.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[United Airlines did the exact same thing to me. I was trying to by tickets to go on leave from Dallas to Minneapolis because my brother is returning from deployment and their website said the transaction wasn&#039;t going through and to try again so I tried again a couple more times. Nothing was working so I ended up getting my ticket from Cheepoair and I got a ticket no problem. I looked at my account later and I was charged every single time I tried and it said it couldn&#039;t go through. Called them up and after an hour of being on hold they had no prove of it and put me on hold again. As soon as they came back on the line they disconnected me. I called my bank and disputed all the charges and got my money back. United Airlines will never have me on their flights again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bet!  Did you get any compensation at all from them?  I know the odds are good that we&#039;ll lose bags at some point in our lives (no one&#039;s perfect) but I hope they at least do their best to make up for it.  And customer service agents are supposed to be working for US, the customers, moreso than their employer, but obviously that&#039;s gone out the window...]]></description>
