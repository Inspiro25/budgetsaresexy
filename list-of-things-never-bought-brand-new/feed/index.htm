$6,200 for a new car - wow!

I wonder what houses were going for back then?

And btw - if you were in Hawaii then we might have crossed paths, though I was just a baby ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love these bullet topics, J$. 

I bought a new car in 1981 (38 years ago) and I&#039;m never making that mistake again!  We got 13 years out of it, but we still wasted at least a thousand bucks of depreciation in the first year after that $6200 purchase.  Golly, if I&#039;d invested that savings in a total stock market index fund...

We&#039;ve never bought a new house.  We&#039;ve rented a 75-year-old house, and we won&#039;t make that mistake again either.  Fortunately the oldest we&#039;ve bought was 11 years, and that seems to be a sweet spot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just bought our first ever custom leather lazy boy sofa. We picked everything the color of the leather, the upgraded foam magic cushions. I was watching Downton Abbey and a character said &quot;We don&#039;t buy furniture we inherit it&quot;. I could relate, not really inherit but when parents on either side got new stuff we got the old stuff. We are not fussy, working our plan here!]]></description>

Haha, well done...

I&#039;ve bought one off eBay before and had to have it shipped, but fortunately was able to at leas see pics of inside and out and call to ask questions/etc which made me feel better :) And even more so when I learned it was a one-owner car by a grandma that rarely used it! One of my favorite cars I ever owned (&#039;93 Cadillac Deville).]]></description>

Interesting... I&#039;d think it would be *less* work since it&#039;s all brand new compared to used homes which are always breaking, but I guess that&#039;s only if you pick up a house that already has everything you want?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not only do I purchase used cars, but I also purchased a car off the internet, sight unseen, from a dealer in Texas (I live in Maryland) and had it shipped to me.  It was my dream car at a &quot;too good to be true&quot; price.  Admittedly, I was nervous that a totally different vehicle would show up...or the interior or the engine would be missing, etc. ;)  but it turned out for me and I&#039;d even take that chance again if presented with the opportunity.]]></description>
