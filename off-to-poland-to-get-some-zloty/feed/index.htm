					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, I think collecting foreign money is much more fun than souvenirs :)  nice &amp; easy to pack and not clutter up the house too! haha... of course, it is pretty nerdy.

And thx Jenna! I&#039;ll give a shout later, you&#039;re sweet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds interesting! Now, you gave me an idea to collect as well. I love to travel but never thought of collecting money currencies from which country I visited. Now, I am looking forward on my next travel collecting some of those dollars.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I thought you were quiet when I talked about all the green :)
Thanks for the mention and I&#039;m really excited to have been an inspiration of sorts.

Safe flight and have an amazing time.

And why am I not surprised you have a currency album?! It&#039;s all about the Moolah with you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also, just realized I have a 5 HOUR layover in Boston tonight!  D&#039;oh.  Guess that&#039;s what I get for finding the cheapest last minute flight I could find (remember that bitching and moaning i was doing on Twitter last week?  it was because a friend lied to me and never bought my tickets she had said she did.  so I had to book this flight 1 week out.  all 3 xfers &amp; layovers included ;()

So if anyone wants to meet at Boston Airport tonight let me know!  We can watch a movie, play chess, monopoly, go drinking, or all 4 ;) At least this time I&#039;m not stuck there &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/stuck-at-the-airport/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;because I&#039;m an idiot&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Tom&lt;/b&gt; - Na zdrowie my friend! (much easier to type than to say me thinks...)
@&lt;b&gt;Wojo&lt;/b&gt; - Do you want me to pour out any for your homies out there on the mother ground?
@&lt;b&gt;Curt&lt;/b&gt; - Sweet!  I collect all kinds, so that would be very exciting :)  I will email you on the side - thx bro! I&#039;ll take some pics of it in my album to show it&#039;s gone to good use, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - I mainly collect paper bills cuz they&#039;re really cool and crazy looking to me, but coins are def. being kept and displayed too (although I need to find a better book for the coins, having a hard time finding something decent-looking).  Everywhere I go I get the bills and all the coin denominations, but if you have any laying around you don&#039;t like give me a shout ;) maybe we can trade for the ones I have duplicates of?
@&lt;b&gt;Clare&lt;/b&gt; - I think they&#039;re set to convert down the road, but just haven&#039;t as yet.  Another reason I have to hurry up and get over there before they conform!]]></description>
