					<description><![CDATA[Good reminder- somehow we always forget about those giftcards! Many stores are cracking down on expiration dates, so hopefully everyone follows your example. Love the advice to leave all other forms of currency at home!

p.s. I think (think) the two cents thing comes from the British tuppence which was like our penny and was used as a way of being humble before giving advice... like self-deprecating... anyway, I could be wrong, but thats what was in my brain :)]]></description>
