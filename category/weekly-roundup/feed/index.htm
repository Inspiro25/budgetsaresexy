<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>Good morning!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Happy Halloween Weekend!!</strong></p>
<p>Y&#8217;all dressing up or hitting any wild parties??! I wish I could say I was, but unless you count chaperoning a thousand kids as they hit event after event after event all weekend as juicy, I most certainly will not be lol&#8230;</p>
<p>Though I did find these <em>killer</em> shoes a few days ago I&#8217;ll be celebrating with ;)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66833" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans.jpg" alt="bloody vans" width="529" height="356" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans-300x202.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans-550x370.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" /></p>
<p><strong>Aren&#8217;t they just perfect for Halloween???</strong> Super cheap too as they were &#8220;lightly used&#8221; (I love vintage stores so much&#8230;)</p>
<p>As for my costume, I&#8217;ll probably just go w/the tried and true &#8220;skeleton rock star.&#8221; Which consists of basically just wearing a black shirt with skeleton bones on it and rocking my &#8216;hawk. Though perhaps this year with the shoes addition I&#8217;ll call myself a &#8220;killer rock star&#8221;? Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still looking for some good &#8211; and frugal &#8211; costumes, here are a few of my favorites from an old blog post of mine: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/last-minute-cheap-halloween-costumes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16 Last-Last Minute Halloween Costume Ideas</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static Cling</strong> – Wear normal clothes and safety pin socks and lint to it!</li>
<li><b>Christmas Tree</b> – My all-time favorite costume ever: Wear all green, wrap yourself in Christmas lights, and then plug yourself into the wall :)</li>
<li><strong>Chick magnet – </strong>Tape a bunch of Barbie dolls to yourself. Or use pictures of hot girls!</li>
<li><strong>Smarty Pants</strong> – Tape smarties candies to your PANTS</li>
<li><strong>The Tanning Bed – </strong>Tape glow-sticks up and down your arms. Then go around the party, entrapping people in your embrace: Instant tanning bed.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest board!</strong> Dress in all white, then hang a cork board around your neck with pictures of cute houses, tattoos, book cases and whatever else people like to &#8220;pin&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Random Hook-up</strong> – Drape a lot of random colored extension cords around you, haha&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you end up going as though, I want pics please :)</p>
<p>Or you can just stay home and binge <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budgets Are Sexy</a> all night long &#8211; that&#8217;s probably the best *treat* for you&#8230; Less calories and not nearly as scary! Yum! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f383.png" alt="🎃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Posts on Budgets this week:</h3>
<p><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-gucci-mane-guide-to-greatness-book-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Gucci Mane Guide to Greatness</a> &#8212; A review of Gucci&#8217;s latest book on becoming better versions of ourselves&#8230; Not nearly as good as his <a href="https://amzn.to/3M9AfKi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autobiography</a> I devoured earlier, but still chalk full of great takeaways that I share here.</p>
<p><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-power-of-rewards-aka-in-which-i-bribe-my-kids-to-behave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Power of Rewards (AKA In Which I Bribe My Kids to Behave…)</a> &#8212; It may not be at the top of the Parenting 101 handbook, but boy does bribing sure work <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Here are a handful of examples I&#8217;ve incorporated into our household lately.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bitchesgetriches.com/early-retirement-6-month-check-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My First 6 Months of Early Retirement Sucked Shit: What They Don’t Tell You about FIRE</a> <b>@ Bitches Get Riches</b> – “My body and my subconsciousness understood exactly what was happening to me. “You are very, very depressed,” they told me with crystal clear enunciation. “Sleep ten hours a day, invest 200 hours into a video game you don’t particularly like, and put cheese on EVERYTHING until this passes.””</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wewantguac.com/lazy-financial-independence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Want to Be a Lazy Seeker of Financial Independence? Invest in Your 20s.</a> <strong>@ We Want Guac</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Almost all of today’s most famous investors are wrinkly old fartbags. This tends to give the impression that A. it’ll take you multiple decades and unfathomable luck ‘til you can enjoy wealth, B. all the good investing opportunities dried up decades ago, or C. young people just shouldn’t try to get ahead until they’re older and wiser. Not so! It’s actually the youngest investor in the room that’s the most powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tonyisola.com/2022/10/diversify-your-friends-and-financial-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diversify Your Friends And Financial Goals</a> <b>@ A Teachable Moment</b> – “Studies prove that having friends attracts more than good times. Good friends boost the immune system and help protect you from catching a common cold.  Different types of friends provide the most significant value add.”</p>
<p><a href="https://dariusforoux.com/waste-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waste a Few Hours, so You Don&#8217;t Waste Years</a> <b>@ Darius Foroux</b> &#8212; &#8220;Being productive doesn’t mean utilizing every waking minute to do productive things.  Sometimes, spending a day doing various things around the house, maybe taking a walk or doing some reading, can actually be more useful. These moments help us examine our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/expectations-and-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expectations and Reality</a> <strong>@ Collab Fund</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Imagine a life where almost everything gets better but you never appreciate it because your expectations rise as fast as your circumstances. It’s terrifying, and almost as bad a world where nothing gets better.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://apurplelife.com/2022/10/25/my-favorite-nomad-travel-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Favorite Nomad Travel Tools!</a> <strong>@ A Purple Life</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Somehow I’m going into the 3rd year of my retirement and my nomad travel life. During that time, I’ve amassed an arsenal of tools to help me on the road. Previously, I discussed general tools I love to use in my day-to-day life that help it seem like I have my shit together <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, but today I want to focus on things that help me be a more effective traveler.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/2022/08/15/ultimate-detailed-price-battle-is-shopping-at-a-warehouse-club-really-saving-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate Detailed Price Battle!!! Is Shopping At A Warehouse Club Really Saving Anything?</a> <strong>@ Chief Mom Officer</strong> &#8212; &#8220;When I remove all the items I couldn’t buy at Aldi’s because they didn’t have an equivalent or where I wouldn’t want the alternative option for my family, it’s clear that shopping at BJ’s is the winner for us. Those items would cost $285 at BJ’s compared with $333 at Aldi’s. The cost savings is over $100 when compared with Target, and almost $200 when compared with Price Chopper!&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">News &amp; Nuggets Around The Community:</h3>
<p>Interesting news and clips that caught my eye this week&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Ali from All Options Considered celebrates <a href="https://alloptionsconsidered.com/2022/10/21/life-after-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 years of being FI</a>&#8211; woo!</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">“It’s as hard to start and run a small business as it is to start a big one. You will suffer the same toll financially and psychologically as you bludgeon it into existence… So if you’re going to dedicate your life to a business, which is the only way it will ever work, you should choose one with the potential to be huge.” &#8211; Stephen Schwarzman via <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/counterintuitive-life-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darius Foroux</a></li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">“When you buy a home to live in with a plan to later rent it out, you’re doing two things at once. You have to consider the property more from an investment perspective and less from an emotional “I love this house” perspective. This isn’t always possible (or advisable), but, if you live in a hot rental market and have aspirations of building a passive income stream, buying a home that can be turned into a rental can be a great option.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.frugalwoods.com/2022/10/19/whats-happening-with-our-rental-property/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frugalwoods</a></li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">&#8220;I was at a gas station filling up when a man came up to me, excited to see the car I was driving. He gushed over how cool he thought the car was and asked how I could afford it. Embarrassed by the attention and eager to shift the focus to something else, I truthfully explained that I had eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every day for an entire year to pay for the car. Upon hearing that, his smile waned and I could tell that he doubted the sacrifice was worth it.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2022/10/just-another-car/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humble Dollar</a></li>
<li>&#8220;Decades ago, when I was in Sales, the top contact at my largest customer made a comment to me that I’ll never forget. I was moving on to a new job, and Fred gave me what turned out to be one of the biggest compliments of my life. “You’ve always looked me in the eyes,” he said. “If someone doesn’t make eye contact with me, my experience has taught me to not trust them. You make excellent eye contact, and you’ve been one of the people I’ve trusted most in my career.” When you’re talking with someone who matters in your life, look into their eyes.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/secrets-of-a-professional-negotiator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Retirement Manifesto</a></li>

<p><strong>For everyone else &#8211; enjoy these articles that got me thinking all month long! Some great tips and exercises in them!</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/2019/03/03/stocks-part-xxxv-investing-for-seven-generations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investing for Seven Generations</a> by JL Collins</strong> &#8212; &#8220;The story goes, this idea originated with the Iroquois and is based on creating sustainability over the generations. It is commonly applied to environmental stewardship today, but it occurs to me that it applies equally to matters financial.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/business/salary-transparency-ask-a-manager.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Should You Tell the World How Much Money You Make?</a> via NY Times</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Ms. Green recently asked readers of her “Ask A Manager” website to share their job title, where they live and how much they make each year&#8230; Within a half-hour, she had 1,000 responses. A day later, so many people posted their salaries her website froze. So far, three weeks later, she has more than 26,000 responses, everything from an accountant in Chicago who makes $90,000 to a librarian in Austin who earns $39,000.&#8221;</p>

This is the central tenant of David’s system, and in my opinion, this sticky idea is why his ideas have amassed such a large and loyal following. We have a limited amount of mental bandwidth to give to whatever we’re doing—and we shouldn’t waste any amount of this bandwidth on storing information and unresolved commitments in our head. We need to externalize those into some sort of system.&#8221;</p>

Is financial independence really your goal, or is your ultimate purpose something that lies beyond the dollars, something that wealth enables but doesn’t deliver on its own? &#8221;</p>

I want it to be as useful, and as boring, as I can make it. I want it to be attractive for intentional, practical uses, but not for a reflexive diversions—a Swiss Army knife, not a carnival, in my pocket. This is my latest lifestyle experiment. I will make my phone as utilitarian as possible, for 30 days, and see what I learn.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Some interesting facts:</h2>
<p>&#8220;San Francisco has the most billionaires per capita than any other city… For every 11,612 people in San Francisco, the study says, there’s one billionaire. And that’s a much smaller ratio than the second most billionaire-dense city. In New York City, there are 81,211 inhabitants for every one billionaire.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Within the next 50 years, Facebook could feel more like a place for the dead than the living. According to academics from the University of Oxford, by 2069, the dead could outnumber the living on the social network. The number of dead users on Facebook is growing at an unstoppable rate. In 2012, eight years after the platform launched, 30 million users had died. Today, it has over two billion users and an estimation of 8000 users die every day.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2019/04/29/dead-facebook-users-could-outnumber-the-living-by-2069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheNextWeb.com</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In northern Georgia sits Lake Lanier, a massive man-made lake with a dark history. In order to get it to the depth they wanted, the US Government bought or forced out over 250 families, 15 businesses, and 20 cemeteries so they could fill over 50,000 acres of prime farmland with water. At the bottom of Lake Lanier are entire intact ghost towns, left as they were when the government flooded them… Survivors of various accidents have reported feeling as if invisible hands were dragging them deep beneath the water.&#8221; &#8211;<a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/creepy-georgia-stories-legends/isadora-teich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ranker.com</a></p>

I just want to be a human&#8230; I want to go for long walks and spend time in nature, and not take pictures as proof. I want to get a good night of sleep and a bad night of sleep, and not turn it into a discussion on the internet&#8230; I want to make big financial decisions and small financial decisions, and not have to justify them or worry what people will think. I want to have regular days and big days and happy days and sad days. I want to go through an experience and not wonder which parts would fit best into a blog post. I want to live and not share every detail anymore. I just want to be a human in this world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.mslizmoneymatters.com/copy-this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy This</a> by Ms. Liz Money Matters</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Not long after we finished building our dream home, a gal who worked for me and her husband started building theirs not far away. They liked our home and they wanted to copy some things we did. No problem. We all drove around the community, walked through unfinished homes and stole ideas from others&#8230; When they were getting ready to move in, I realized there was one big thing they didn’t copy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wafflesonwednesday.com/decluttering-challenge-one-month-one-item-per-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decluttering Challenge: One Month, One Item Per Day</a> by Waffles On Wednesday</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Unless you are already a minimalist, finding one item to get rid of every day is actually very easy. Although we have already combed through our belongings many times before, somehow more and more stuff finds its way back into our humble abode. So I picked a strategy that made this decluttering goal even easier. I would pick one area: one cabinet, one drawer, one closet and start there. I would head to that spot every day and remove an item that I didn’t need/ use anymore and be on my way. It made it easy. Every day, I knew exactly where to go to accomplish my goal.&#8221;</p>

He also says that during the summer months, he and his wife live in his parents&#8217; basement. Then, for the first few months of the year, he says they spend time living in Georgia with his in-laws.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://dailyreckoning.com/the-middle-class-retirement-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Middle Class Retirement Nightmare</a> by Daily Reckoning</strong> &#8212; &#8220;In 1971, you could buy a new Ford F-150 for $2,500. At $4 an hour, it took 625 hours to buy the truck. Today’s model costs $30,000, and the average hourly wage is $26. So the wage earner has to work for 1,154 hours to get a standard F-150&#8230; You can do the same calculation for housing. An average man paid about $24,000 for the average house in 1971. Today, he pays $371,000. Priced in time, the house cost 6,000 hours in 1971 and 14,269 hours today.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.getrichslowly.org/financial-blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Thin Green Line: Why You Should Be Skeptical of Financial Blogs</a> by Get Rich Slowly</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Blogging has become more business-like and less personal. A decade ago, most blogs — even money blogs — were rooted in the author’s individual experience. Nowadays, most big financial blogs have a minimal editorial voice&#8230; The trouble with the rise of blogging as a business is that the business has become the focus for most financial blogs. Financial bloggers aren’t making decisions based on what’s best for their audience. They’re making decisions based on what’s likely to bring them the most income.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Got a bunch of fine reading material for ya today when you&#8217;re bored of relaxing and/or hanging out with your family (or both) ;)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m out at the beach all week soaking up some good family quality time myself, but sadly there&#8217;s no sleeping in or lounging when you&#8217;ve got a TWO-MONTH OLD on your hands! Womp womp&#8230;</p>
<p>Still &#8211; I&#8217;m making the best of it and keeping sane with <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/metal-detecting-is-cool-damn-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little metal detecting action</a> which only adds to my coolness ;) If anyone would like to sprinkle in a little treasure in the sands here though, I&#8217;d greatly appreciate it! A guy can only take so many bottle caps before he loses hope!</p>
<p><em><strong>To my favorite finds around the web lately&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">********</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Favorite Articles This Month:</h2>
<p><a href="http://happyinthehollow.com/ultimate-pantry-challenge-guide/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-56747" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pink-eggs-bowl.jpg" alt="ping eggs bowl" width="535" height="387" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pink-eggs-bowl.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pink-eggs-bowl-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://happyinthehollow.com/ultimate-pantry-challenge-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>The Ultimate Pantry Challenge Guide</b></a><strong> via Happy In The Hollow</strong> &#8211;&#8220;It’s happened again. Despite my best intentions, I’ve been finding myself playing pantry Tetris. The cupboards are almost full and yet we buy more and try to carefully navigate the latest cans into the tiny empty spaces. It’s time for another pantry challenge!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mrfreeat33.com/can-you-retire-in-thailand-with-200000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can You Retire In Thailand With $200,000?</a> via Free at 33</strong> &#8212; &#8220;After living in Chiang Mai, Thailand for about four months now, I’ve had an opportunity to get a good sense of costs in one of the best cities in the world for value-minded people who also appreciate a relatively high quality of life. It’s been a tremendous experience for me thus far, exceeding my expectations in just about every manner conceivable.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://diamondssuck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DiamondsSuck.com</a></strong> &#8212; &#8220;I recently got engaged, and found myself in the market for a suitable engagement ring. Over the past few months, I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of research on diamonds and the diamond industry. What I learned, quite frankly, pissed me off.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/05/20/what-im-teaching-my-son-about-money/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-56749" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/little-mm-bank-account.png" alt="little mm's bank account" width="521" height="348" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/little-mm-bank-account.png 928w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/little-mm-bank-account-300x201.png 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/little-mm-bank-account-768x514.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/05/20/what-im-teaching-my-son-about-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What I’m Teaching my Son about Money</a> via Mr. Money Mustache</strong> &#8212; &#8220;Instead of a physical piggy bank, my boy prefers to keep his money in the Bank of Mr. Money Mustache, a spreadsheet that contains every transaction he makes with money. To make a deposit, he just hands me some cash. To withdraw, he asks me for cash or has me buy something for him online. But for every dollar that remains in the account, he accrues interest at a 10% annual rate with monthly compounding. I’m excited about the teaching value of this&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sivers.org/unlearning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlearning</a> via Derek Sivers</strong> &#8212; &#8220;You learned things that were true back then, but now they’re false. You got successful doing things one way, but now that way is moot. You still consider yourself an expert, but that expertise has expired.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Life Is More Than Compounding Money via Intelligent Fanatics.com</strong> &#8212; &#8220;On January 9, 1995, 101 year-old Anne Scheiber left a $22 million fortune to Yeshiva University’s Stern College for Women. The school had never heard of Anne Scheiber before. Virtually nobody had heard of Scheiber before&#8230; It continues to draw attention, for the wrong reason.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Interesting Nuggets / Announcements:</h2>
<p><a href="https://crispycabbage.com/2018/05/05/the-half-hour-hank-productivity-app-is-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-56753" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/half-hour-hank-app.jpg" alt="half hour hank app" width="274" height="280" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/half-hour-hank-app.jpg 664w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/half-hour-hank-app-294x300.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Crispy Cabbage blogger</strong> came out with a productivity app &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://crispycabbage.com/2018/05/05/the-half-hour-hank-productivity-app-is-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half Hour Hank</a> ($0.99) // Get points for completing tasks, and use its &#8220;randomizer&#8221; to help you decide which to tackle first :)</p>
<p><strong>Harry Campbell</strong>, aka &#8220;the rideshare guy,&#8221; came out with a new book &#8211;&gt; &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/2trl5ZO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rideshare Guide: Everything You Need to Know about Driving for Uber, Lyft, and Other Ridesharing Companies</a>&#8221; ($10&#8217;ish)</p>
<p><strong>I found a FANTASTIC tool</strong> that helps you find your largest emails taking up space so you can nix them and keep your bandwidth low &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://www.findbigmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FindBigMail.com</a> (Free) // Got my inbox from 98% full to 44% within minutes!</p>
<p><a href="https://truebill.onelink.me/Ei83/34747ffd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-56783 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/truebill-app-screenshots.jpg" alt="truebill app screenshots" width="600" height="348" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/truebill-app-screenshots.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/truebill-app-screenshots-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I found another great bill-killing app</strong> that will analyze your expenses and help you cancel any unwanted/fraudulent billing right there from inside the app &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://truebill.onelink.me/Ei83/34747ffd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrueBill.com</a> (Free) // Also good for requesting overdraft/late bank fees, as well as negotiating cell phone and cable bills easier (Not free)</p>
<p><strong>You guys remember our &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/seeking-financial-stability-as-a-gay-non-white-man-of-muslim-faith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gay, Non-White, Man of Muslim Faith</a>&#8221; friend</strong> from last year who was having trouble seeking financial stability? Well, he stopped by the blog again this month &#8211; a year later! &#8211; to update us on how things are now going&#8230; Which I&#8217;m happy to say much better :) You can find his update in the comments section below JJNL&#8217;s comment towards the top.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 30px;">**Fun Bitcoin Facts**<br />
(via <a href="https://napkinfinance.com/napkin/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NapkinFinance.com</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="first">The first Bitcoin ATM was installed in October 2013 in Vancouver, Canada</li>
<li>You can use Bitcoin to pay for travel on Virgin Galactic to the moon, or for a Subway sandwich in Allentown, PA</li>
<li>One unlucky man from London lost $7.5 million in Bitcoins when he threw away his computer hard drive. The device is now buried in a landfill near his home.</li>
<li>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin Harvard graduates famous for their lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg are betting big on Bitcoin. They claim to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence.</li>
<li>Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer paid 10,000 Bitcoins (roughly $25) for two Papa John’s pizzas on May 22, 2010. He did not know that it would be worth around $150 million today. Since then, May 22 is celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day to celebrate the most expensive pizzas in history.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You might remember her as my <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2014/08/official-money-coach/" target="_blank">very 1st money coaching client</a></strong> and she&#8217;s still working hard to reach <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/03/financial-acronyms-dink-henry-sitcom/" target="_blank">FIGMY$HIT</a> status. Lately she&#8217;s taken a renewed interest in starting her own photography/art business up again so I&#8217;ve been giving her some homework assignments there. Mainly, &#8220;find a way to earn $100 this month with it!&#8221; And as that picture shows, mission completed :) (Go Kim!)</p>
<p>Anywho, was feeling like a proud papa so had to share&#8230; The hardest part with side hustles is getting your first client, so if you start with that out of the gate you&#8217;ll not only learn real fast if what you&#8217;re offering is good (the &#8220;real&#8221; world is a lot different than the textbook world!), but you&#8217;ll get in the habit of asking for money. After all, as they say on Shark Tank, a business that doesn&#8217;t make money isn&#8217;t a business &#8211; it&#8217;s a hobby. So be sure to ask for what you&#8217;re/your product is worth!</p>
<h2>Other Money <span style="color: #008000;">Wins</span> This Week:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>We turned in our two weeks notice to daycare!!!</strong> As soon as Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy is done defending her dissertation she&#8217;ll be defending our boys from getting into trouble all day long at the $ household ;) And we&#8217;re both excited and terrified at the same time, haha&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>I maxed out my SEP IRA to the tune of $11,000 and change.</strong> You might have seen this in our latest <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/04/net-worth-update-477k/" target="_blank">net worth update</a>, but we shot it straight into <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2014/06/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy/" target="_blank">VTSAX </a>with Vanguard which gave me a high stronger than Bob Marley on 4:20. (Was 4:20 a &#8220;thing&#8221; back in his day?)</li>
<li><strong>No Spend Month II is complete!</strong> <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/02/no-shopping-ban-reacht-app/" target="_blank">40 days of no spending</a> on anything outside needed expenses to survive &#8211; minus a few slip ups (mainly tip jar related). I wish I could say it was as enlightening as the first time we took this on 7 years ago, but the sad fact is I didn&#8217;t learn a thing. No epiphanies this time around, but at least it reaffirms that my spending habits are aligned with how I want them to be. Which of course is the point to it all :) (For those who joined me in this, how did your journey go??)</li>
<li><strong>I saved $237.96 more with <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/digit" target="_blank">Digit</a></strong>. I guess they forecasted my daycare savings? ;)</li>
<li><strong>I invested $10.35 more through <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/acorns" target="_blank">Acorns</a>.</strong> They round up your transactions and invest the pennies into a portfolio for you. You can see my full review of them <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/03/acorns-app-review/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stuff That <span style="color: #ff0000;">BLEW</span> in Money This Week:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital One is kicking me out of my business account. </strong>They didn&#8217;t say why (other than &#8220;restructuring&#8221; or something lame like that), but I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t pay them jack to use their accounts :) So now I&#8217;ve been downgraded to a different business account and if I deposit anything more than $5,000/mo they&#8217;re going to charge me $1.00 each additional $1,000. What the freak is that about?? Needless to say I&#8217;m on the hunt for a new business account&#8230; (which USAA doesn&#8217;t offer, arghh). What do you hustlers use?</li>
<li><strong>My wife has to spend $200+ for a graduation gown she doesn&#8217;t even get to keep.</strong> &#8220;I don&#8217;t even spend $200 on a dress that I DO get to keep &#8211; what the f*ck?&#8221; was her exact response. Followed by &#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll notice if I just show up in normal clothes?&#8221; Haha&#8230; Go for it mama!</li>
<li><strong>Some asshat stole my credit card info and tried buying something halfway across the country.</strong> Which USAA caught in a matter of seconds and shut it down &#8211; along with my credit card &#8211; and promptly re-issued us a new one. This was the 3rd time in a year it&#8217;s happened to us (they say they&#8217;ve seen an incredible upswing in hacks lately), but luckily the annoyance levels have been diminished since I&#8217;ve already made a list of all the places my credit card is attached to. So within minutes of receiving the new card all I had to do was log in to a few places and update the accounts. IF YOU HAVEN&#8217;T DONE THIS YOURSELF I HIGHLY ADVISE DOING SO! Saves you a butt ton of time and stress in the future.</li>

<p><strong>Our early retired friend Go Curry Cracker&#8217;s story went viral!</strong> He had a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2015/03/30/how-this-couple-retired-in-their-30s-to-travel-the-world/" target="_blank">great feature in Forbes</a> which then got picked up by Yahoo Finance and then shot across the front page of a half dozen other media sites back to back to back. They&#8217;re all a little slow since we  featured his kick-ass &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/02/early-retirement-series-jeremy-go-curry-cracker/" target="_blank">I quit to travel the world forever</a>&#8221; story here first on this blog (uh thank you), but super proud of him for all the coverage and fully taking advantage of this opportunity to grow his blog over night. He literally got more hits in 24 hours than I have in an entire month &#8211; hah! And I won&#8217;t be bashful and omit that he&#8217;s a blog coaching client of mine either ;) *tips hat*</p>
<p><em>[UPDATE: Jeremy tells me he&#8217;s at the hospital right now awaiting the birth of their first baby :) Send him good thoughts and prayers &#8211; it&#8217;s miracle time!!]</em></p>
<p><strong>Fellow blogger, and former Early Retirement chaser, Johnny Moneyseed launched a new coffee shop.</strong> Epic Bean Fair Trade &amp; Organic Coffee &#8211; a brick and mortar store which also offers subscription services to anyone who would like fresh coffee delivered right to their door. We&#8217;ll be featuring his journey on this blog here shortly, specifically because he dropped his race to early retirement to jump right into the coffee world!, but in the meantime check out his new shop: EpicBean.com. Congrats bud!</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of coffee, if you want to see how 32 of us entrepreneurs drink ours,</strong> check out this article from another blogger who&#8217;s getting into the coffee space online: <a href="http://www.roastycoffee.com/coffee-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">RoastyCoffee.com/coffee-entrepreneurs</a>. You might remember Matt as the former half of the <em>Listen Money Matters</em> crew.</p>
<p><strong>Life Comma Etc launched a new eBook on helping people get paid to freelance write.</strong> It&#8217;s called &#8220;<a href="https://fivefigurewriter.com/">Five Figure Writer</a>&#8221; and shows the email template and tips Sarah used to earn $59,000 her first year freelancing. You can pick it up for a cheap $19 bones. (Congrats Sarah!)</p>

<h2>Financial Companies That Came Across My Desk:</h2>
<p>As we did <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/04/money-business-overall-bad-assery/" target="_blank">last week</a>, I thought it would be helpful to feature some of the services and products that I came across in the $$ world this week. I haven&#8217;t poked around these guys in depth (so please be sure to do so yourself) but I wanted to highlight &#8217;em here vs keeping them hidden in my brain ;) Any I start using and fall in love with myself will get its own dedicated review in the future&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Achieve Lending</strong> &#8212; These guys might be worth looking into if you&#8217;re looking to condense/refinance or get new student loans (or any other *private* loans it looks like) They bill themselves as the &#8220;first ever search engine for student loans,&#8221; and a good blogging friend of mine started working for them which leads me to believe their legit :) You plug in what type of loan/refinancing you&#8217;re looking to get, along with the amounts and some other info, and then it pops out a list of options that match up. If you try it out let us know how it goes!</p>
<p><strong>CreateaMonthlyBudget.com</strong> &#8212; This is a pretty cool idea: &#8220;Work out your monthly budget using this free tool to download a useful spreadsheet. See how much you are spending and how much you can afford to save throughout the year.&#8221; Spits out a nifty pie chart at the end of it too.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.cinchfinancial.com/" target="_blank">Cinch Financial</a> </strong>&#8212;  These guys have been all over the place lately. In a nutshell they show you only &#8220;the best products&#8221; for what you&#8217;re looking for (credit cards, insurance, mortgages) and state they&#8217;re unbiased, but the part that really caught my eye was their <em>billsnap</em> feature: &#8220;Take a photo or upload an image of your mortgage, credit card, insurance, or other big bill. Our experts will tell you if you can pay less, and exactly how.&#8221; Not sure how that works with privacy stuff, but quite an interesting concept!</p>

<h3><strong>A Giveaway You&#8217;d Actually Want to Enter:</strong></h3>
<p>Lady Antebellum (the country group) and Quicken Loans are teaming up to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/get-there/willing-to-be-a-little-bit-country-to-get-your-mortgage-paid-for-a-year/2015/04/09/56ce312e-de16-11e4-a500-1c5bb1d8ff6a_story.html?postshare=2111428590844199" target="_blank">pay the mortgages for 7 lucky people</a> for an entire year as part of Lady&#8217;s <em>Wheels Up 2015 Tour</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;All you have to do is impress a panel of judges with your creativity, clarity and reasons for deserving a mortgage break. The mortgage prize is worth a minimum $12,000 to a maximum of $24,000 (principal and interest only)&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>Awesome New Music I&#8217;m Listening to&#8230;</strong></h3>
<p>This guy recently wrote a piece for Priceonomics on how much his musical duo makes <a href="http://priceonomics.com/the-economics-of-busking/" target="_blank">busking</a> (ie street performing), and I followed the rabbit hole down through his personal blog where he shares how much he made his first year blogging and onto his musical act: <em><strong>The Dirty Little Blondes</strong></em>. It&#8217;ll make you sick how cute and awesome these two are (bf/gf duo) but my damn is their music good.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my favorite of their songs so far:</p>
<p><center><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAPZtgmLCbo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>I also happened across this video of the prettier of the two which apparently went viral last year netting more views than any of their songs combined &#8211; hah! Not surprising though considering the title: &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVB8cp-t2ag" target="_blank">Bikini fail feat cute puppy</a>&#8221; ;)</p>
<p><em><strong>And that&#8217;s what went down in my hood this week&#8230; How about you?</strong> <strong>Anything juicy in your money or biz? Do you use any of the companies I featured above?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hope y&#8217;all have a great weekend&#8230; Don&#8217;t forget: Freedom &gt; Money &gt; Stuff!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<strong>PS:</strong> Let me know if any of you guys come across any cool $$$ companies too and I&#8217;ll consider featuring them here (as well as any of you bloggers doing big things!)</p>
<p><strong>PPS:</strong> Here&#8217;s last week&#8217;s recap if interested: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/04/money-business-overall-bad-assery/" target="_blank">Money, Business and Overall Bad-Assery</a></p>
