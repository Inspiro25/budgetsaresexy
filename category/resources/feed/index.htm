<p><strong>So I’ve been working on a new project lately, and it&#8217;s officially live :)</strong></p>
<p>It has nothing to do with personal finance (*gasp*), but it is something that could help save you a ton of money &#8211; and grow faster! &#8211; if you run a business. It also heavily relies on AI, so if you’ve been trying to figure out the best way to harness it in this brave new world this could be the trick.</p>
<p>Introducing&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5238" src="https://jmoney.biz/wp-content/uploads/youbots-logo.webp" alt="youbots logo" width="373" height="94" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>YouBots.ai</strong></a><strong> &#8211; A suite of <em>advanced, powerful marketing tools powered by AI!</em></strong></p>
<p>My partner in crime has been <em>obsessed</em> with AI this past year &#8211; to the point he even changed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natestpierre/" target="_blank">his entire career</a> around it! &#8211; and after watching him build out customized &#8220;bots&#8221; for companies and selling them for thousands of dollars a pop, I asked him why he doesn&#8217;t just package them all up under one roof and offer them up to *everybody*? Kinda like the world&#8217;s first AI marketing agency, but only at a fraction of the price?</p>
<p>He paused for a few seconds leading me to believe it was massively stupid, haha, but to my surprise he eventually shot back with, &#8220;this is the best idea you&#8217;ve ever had &#8211; we need to build it.&#8221; Lol&#8230; Okay!</p>
<p><strong>And just like that YouBots was born :)</strong></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t say I ever imagined myself doing anything around AI, but it was one of those instances where it just clicked and I knew I&#8217;d regret it if I didn&#8217;t go for it. So we&#8217;ll see what happens! We already have a number of paying clients, and it&#8217;s been fun as hell working on the branding and building out the site&#8230;</p>
<p>Just look at these cute little robots!!</p>
<p><a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5233 " style="border: 2px solid #CCCCCC;" src="https://jmoney.biz/wp-content/uploads/bots-1024x860.png" alt="youbots" width="700" height="588" /></a></p>
<p><strong>At any rate, if you run a business and wanna see if these bots can help YOU, check out <a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>our site</strong></a> and let me know what you think. It&#8217;s set up so that anyone on your team can use it without needing to know a thing about AI, prompt engineering, or even software development.</strong></p>
<p>Our target audience is small-medium businesses who wish they had a bigger budget for hiring (both people and marketing agencies), so we&#8217;ve priced it with that in mind and one of our clients is already saving $4,000/mo. It&#8217;s beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Check it out &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://youbots.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouBots.ai</a></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re currently offering a <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>one-week free trial</strong></span>, then <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>50% off the subscription cost </strong></span>while we&#8217;re in beta. No credit card required for the demo, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to over here! How about you? Anyone else dabbling in AI or working on a new project? Would love to learn all about it :)</p>
<p>Your long-time, non-AI powered, friend,</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I should note that while AI<em> can</em> do big huge amazing things to make your life and work better, I don&#8217;t believe it should be a substitute for YOU. To me it&#8217;s meant for *enhancing* your work, not replacing it.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://jordangrumet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogger friend</a> of mine recently came out with a new book, and it&#8217;s centered around one of the things that occupies my brain way more than I care to admit ;)</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of life.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>And apparently I&#8217;m not alone, as this &#8220;purpose anxiety&#8221; apparently affects 91% of people! Crazy!</p>
<p>So odds are you&#8217;ve struggled with this too, which makes this book a perfect read &#8211; and giveaway! &#8211; for everyone today. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Purpose Code</a>&#8220;, and here&#8217;s more about it via Amazon:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The Purpose Code&#8221;<br />
How to unlock meaning, maximize happiness, and leave a lasting legacy</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68352" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg" alt="the purpose code" width="426" height="658" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-194x300.jpg 194w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-550x850.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-324x500.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></a></p>
<p>Purpose can change your life.</p>
<p><strong>Having a sense of purpose has been scientifically proven to help people find happiness, longevity, and health.</strong></p>
<p>But lots of us are also worried about purpose―purpose anxiety has been estimated to affect as much as 91% of people.</p>
<p>What’s going on? And how do we do purpose the right way―to unlock all its many benefits, set goals in life, make a mark and journey from anxiety to legacy?</p>
<p>This question set hospice doctor and writer Jordan Grumet on a quest, and The Purpose Code shares his remarkable findings to help you change your future forever. The result is a self-development book like no other.</p>
<p><strong>It turns out that we fundamentally misunderstand purpose and the role it plays in our lives. In fact, there are two different types of purpose. One will lead to anxiety and disillusionment; the other will lead to connection and lasting legacy.</strong></p>
<p>In The Purpose Code, Jordan will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chart a course for you to reach happiness through understanding the deep human truths behind the concepts of Meaning and Purpose (including life review therapy and simple ways of healing generational trauma)</li>
<li>Equip you with a practical and proven framework for unlocking your real purpose, and show you the life-changingly enjoyable way to climb to goals, regardless of your situation in life</li>
<li>Arm you to differentiate between the two types of purpose when finding life purpose (and show you the hidden reasons why one is always more fulfilling than the other)</li>
<li>Set you on the way to building a genuinely lasting impact long after you’re gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding happiness has never been about creating big audacious goals that we may or may not be able to achieve. True contentment comes from filling our lives with enriching activities that lead to connection and, ultimately, legacy. Swap grand but ultimately empty success books for this small goals book, and begin creating your true purpose today.</p>

<blockquote><p>How close are you, do you think, to knowing your purpose on this Earth?</p></blockquote>
<p>Get your entries in by this Sunday at midnight, and I&#8217;ll randomly select the two winners the following day!</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I think I&#8217;m around 70% at the moment.</strong> The one thing I feel called to do, and enjoy!, is helping others in some form or fashion, and it seems the more I do that the happier I tend to get. Thus, why I made it this year&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-10-2-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-2 Challenge</a>! Maybe it&#8217;s not my <em>ultimate</em> purpose in life (if there even IS such a thing?) but it def. feels like I&#8217;m moving in the right direction, so I&#8217;m gonna keep on going until something stops me :)</p>
<p>How about you? What % do you think you&#8217;re at right now? Either way, keep waking up and doing your best to appreciate at least being alive!! It&#8217;s not always fun, but it sure beats the alternative&#8230;.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for some new reads to sink your teeth into, let me present 6 new ones from our community that have recently hit shelves, covering everything from stoicism, to money paths, to millionaire habits, to even something I bet you haven&#8217;t ever heard before: &#8220;the energetics of personal finance&#8221; ;)</p>
<p>Some of these are new-new, some are a few months old as I tagged them during my <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/no-coffee-challenge-mode-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accidental sabbatical</a> and missed the promo time, lol, and another won&#8217;t hit the shelves until two weeks so you&#8217;re gonna be one of the first to hear about it!</p>
<p>And the best part? <strong>We&#8217;re giving away TWO COPIES of each book here!</strong> So scroll to the end to see how to enter, and hopefully you&#8217;ll be one of the lucky winners to snag one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44a.png" alt="👊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Stoic Path to Wealth:<br />
Ancient Wisdom for Enduring Prosperity</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4cMfgc5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68087 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth.png" alt="stoic path to wealth book" width="400" height="571" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth.png 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth-210x300.png 210w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth-350x500.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darius&#8217; blog</a> for a number of years now,</strong> so was super stoked to learn his latest book focuses on the more <em>emotional</em> side to investing and growing wealth. Something most of us struggle hard with!</p>
<p>He has some <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other classics</a> too around productivity, forming better habits, and generally just living well, but this is the first book I believe to focus on *money* specifically. Even the OG Morgan Housel gave a testimonial on it!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a clip from its Amazon page:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The Stoics understood that if you can control your reactions and manage your emotions, you can achieve success. The same principles apply to our financial lives today. The greatest investors approach the markets with discipline, emotional distance, and self-mastery—lessons that the Stoics have been teaching us for thousands of years.</p>

<ul>
<li>cultivate an investing edge by managing your emotions and developing your unique skills and talents</li>
<li>develop the discipline to ignore short-term market fluctuations and avoid living in the future</li>
<li>foster a mindset that allows you to enjoy what you have and avoid greed</li>
<li>create a sustainable approach to trading&#8221;</li>

How to Achieve Financial Independence, Retire Early, and Make a Difference by Focusing on Yourself First</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3MwPFtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68104" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book.png" alt="millionaire habits" width="470" height="606" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book.png 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book-233x300.png 233w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book-550x709.png 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book-388x500.png 388w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This is the first book from long-time blogger, Steve Adcock, of <a href="https://millionairehabits.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Millionaire Habits</a></strong>, and while you&#8217;ll probably either love this one or hate it as Steve can get pretty feisty, lol, the overall message here will always remain true: when you become financially free you have more time, and energy, to give back to not only yourself but those around you too. But first you must focus on yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about the book per Amazon:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In Millionaire Habits, popular personal finance educator Steve Adcock delivers a fun, insightful, and hands-on discussion of how to build financial security, retire early, and give back to the community. You’ll learn to focus on yourself and your family first, creating personal wealth for the purpose of giving back to others.</p>
<p>In the book, the author explains that “saving money” isn’t a goal in and of itself, but rather the end product of the personal wealth equation: Wealth = Income + Investments – Lifestyle. You’ll discover how to pay yourself first with concrete guidance and practical advice drawn from people who built wealth on modest incomes.</p>
<p>You’ll also find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategies for maintaining your physical and financial fitness so you can maximize the value of your assets</li>
<li>Ways to turn your existing wealth into even more valuable investments that generate continued, passive income</li>
<li>Methods to help you retire early and enjoy your financial independence at a young age</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfect for young professionals, working families, self-employed people, and anyone else seeking to increase their net worth and get more out of life.&#8221;</p>

It was fun times, and I owe a lot of the success of the project to Steve.

<p><strong>This book comes from Tony Steuer who recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ZqM-OsraI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had me on his podcast</a>,</strong> and if the book is anything like the fun conversations we had there I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. I haven&#8217;t personally read it, but I&#8217;m always a fan of books that not only tell you the *why* behind stuff, but also the *how*. And this one seems from afar at least that it merges both of them nicely.</p>
<p>If you win it you&#8217;ll have to let me know if I was correct! ;)</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a clip from Amazon:</strong></p>

<p>You’ll begin by building useful habits, then put them to use in planning, calculating, and reviewing key financial information. With Tony Steuer’s proven “Get Ready Method,&#8221; you can</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Provider Money, Pleasure Money:<br />
The Energetics of Personal Finance</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3XsSb9Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68092" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money.png" alt="provider money pleasure money" width="376" height="602" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money.png 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money-188x300.png 188w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money-313x500.png 313w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Okay &#8211; now to the &#8220;energetics&#8221; one :)</strong> Which is brought to you by long-time blog reader, and blogger herself, <a href="https://www.christineluken.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine Luken</a>. Another book I have a feeling you&#8217;ll either love or hate, but even if you&#8217;re just a little into the energies of the world, or into yoga or reiki or any of those more &#8220;woo&#8221; practices on the fringes I think you&#8217;ll appreciate this one. At the very least to get a *different* perspective that you might not have otherwise considered. You never know what might click!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a snippet from Amazon:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We often think of money as bills and coins, checking and savings accounts, paychecks and passive income. Yet, at its essence, money is financial energy; that’s why it’s called “currency.”</p>
<p>There are two distinct and complementary energies, the yin and yang, in personal finance: Provider money and Pleasure money. Discover the nature of these two energic forces and how they overlay the entirety of your personal finances. Seeing your money through this energetic lens is a paradigm shift, a philosophy of money rather than a strict how-to guide.</p>
<p>After reading this book, you will have the knowledge and confidence to balance Provider and Pleasure energies, creating a financial life that supports your happiness and peace of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>This one comes from long-time reader and frequent publisher, <strong>Bill Hines,</strong> who&#8217;s always kind enough to offer up some free copies to us here. His last book you might recall was &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/4eaPcsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiss Your Money Hello!: (And Financial Stress Goodbye)</a>&#8221; and just an overall passionate and great guy.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about the book from Amazon:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine how well you’d sleep at night knowing your boxes are checked—everything the kids will need, all your dreams right on through early retirement, when you’re young enough to enjoy those dreams.</p>
<p>This book shows you how to take control and build your own financial plan, using high fidelity, inexpensive software, not the dumbed-down financial/retirement planning tools you find all over the internet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take you through some important general financial planning context, and then through the steps to building a financial plan for a sample family. Along the way, we&#8217;ll discuss the different inputs and assumptions required for any financial plan, as well as how to interpret the results and put your plan into action.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, a new book from Alain Guillot &#8211; a long-time friend of the blog!</strong> This one has only been released as a *Kindle* book, however Alain was kind enough to shoot me a PDF version of it so the two winners will receive that for easy access.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more about it per Amazon:</p>
<p>&#8220;This book is a culmination of years spent navigating the complex landscape of personal finance, entrepreneurship, and self-discovery. It’s about the lessons learned from both success and failure, and the lessons I learned from the experiences of others, including some of the most successful minds of our time.</p>
<p>The book is composed of 10 chapters in which I share my ideas on managing money, yourself—your mind, your habits, and your expectations. We’ll explore topics that challenge conventional wisdom, such as the role of gender in success, the myths surrounding investment choices, and the often-overlooked impact of childhood experiences on our adult lives.</p>
<p>As you turn the pages, you’ll move from basic financial knowledge to ideas of what it means to thrive in a world that often feels uncertain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/bingo-savings-sheet/" title="The Bingo Sheet &#x1f4b0;" rel="nofollow"><img width="640" height="360" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/half-court-shot-gif.gif" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="half court shot" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p><strong>It&#8217;s funny how you can make anything into a game.</strong></p>
<p>On <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gym days</a> I&#8217;ve started doing this thing where after our boot camp I reward myself by grabbing a basketball and shooting around for a while, patting myself on the back for making it. But then I started feeling guilty for having fun when I&#8217;m supposed to be &#8220;working out,&#8221; so I made this arbitrary rule that I can play for however long I want, but I&#8217;m not allowed to *leave* until I make a half-court shot :)</p>
<p>Which in itself is pretty hard of course, but then I added a twist where when I miss it I have to RUN AFTER THE BALL and try over and over and over again, running back and forth from opposite sides of the court, until finally making it. And when that got easier because I&#8217;m now better at making shots!, I upped the game to making THREE half-court shots before leaving, and then after each one I drop to the ground and do 15 pushups for good measure <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I often wonder what the people around me must think watching this lunatic running around launching balls into the air and then falling to the floor, but it&#8217;s made my gym days 3x more exciting while still accomplishing the mission.</p>
<p><strong>I thought of this when I got the following message, only instead of silly basketball games it&#8217;s a savings one!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Years ago you shared a simple grid which my husband and I call <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart.jpg">the bingo sheet</a> &#8211; each square contains a dollar amount to put away each week and at the end of the year, if done faithfully, results in saving an extra $1k.</p>
<p>I use this every year, but with a twist: I try to double or even triple the amount each week to save even more. This year I&#8217;m on track to hit $4k&#8230; it&#8217;s really a fun way to save, so thank you for sharing that!!</p>
<p>&#8211; Denise B.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beautiful!! She made savings fun by taking on the challenge, and then when she was ready to up the game she threw in a twist! Because why not?! Life is boring playing it straight&#8230; Sometimes you gotta shake it up!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s that &#8220;bingo sheet,&#8221; made by the fabulous Jamie from <a href="https://www.mediumsizedfamily.com/a-money-saving-chart-save-an-extra-1000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MediumSizedFamily.com</a>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-53343" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-791x1024.jpg" alt="money saving chart" width="614" height="795" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-232x300.jpg 232w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-768x994.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a><em>[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart.jpg">Click to download</a>]</em></p>
<p>As Denise mentioned, the game is pretty straightforward: each week just pick a new square, then throw in the corresponding amount right into savings &#8211; and BOOM! <strong>You&#8217;ll have an extra $1,000 by the end of the year,</strong> which just so happens to be the amount you should spend on me for Christmas ;)</p>
<p>And if you really want to *see* your results, open up a brand new savings account and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-new-challenge-everything-savings-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start saving fresh</a> so it doesn&#8217;t get muddled with all your other dollars! You want to SEE and FEEL your progress as much as you can so it continues to motivate you. Then when you&#8217;re done, empty it out and challenge yourself next year with a twist!</p>
<p><strong>It really can be as easy as that.</strong> This stuff isn&#8217;t complicated, but oftentimes our *emotions* can be. I don&#8217;t know why we&#8217;re wired like we are, but keep trying new ways to keep it fun and fresh, and with a little luck you&#8217;ll be FIREd in no time&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading today! Have a very merry holiday season, and we&#8217;ll see you out there on the courts (like a wild man) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f384.png" alt="🎄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3c0.png" alt="🏀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>JL is the author behind the uber popular book, and <a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>, <em>The Simple Path to Wealth</em>, which you&#8217;ll typically see pop up on peoples&#8217; Best Lists and which 100% needs to be on your bookshelf as it&#8217;s a classic.</p>
<p>In fact, hell, why not give a copy away of that one today too? I think it&#8217;s necessary <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>From JL <a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/2023/10/31/24-intriguing-quotes-from-pathfinders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">himself</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinders has been two years in the making and it is a book I have wanted to bring to you since 2016 after The Simple Path to Wealth was published.</strong></p>
<p>Within months of that book’s release I began to receive incredible stories from people all over the world telling me how they had taken the approach laid out and applied it to their own unique lives, location and circumstances.</p>
<p>Since contracting with Harriman House to publish Pathfinders, <strong>we’ve collected more of these stories and in these pages present ~100 of the very best.</strong></p>
<p>As the stories rolled in, they mostly self organized into these nine sections that make up the core of the book, along with my preface, introduction and commentary on each.</p>
<ol>
<li>Freedom</li>
<li>Debt</li>
<li>Saving</li>
<li>Lifestyle Inflation</li>
<li>Investing</li>
<li>F-You Money</li>
<li>Staying the Course</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Endgame</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the ultimate companion for your own journey to financial freedom―and the true and lasting wealth that lies at the end.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Simple Path to Wealth:<br />
Your Road Map to Financial Independence and a Rich, Free Life</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3SVIO0R" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67763" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book.jpg" alt="the simple path to wealth book" width="381" height="630" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book.jpg 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book-182x300.jpg 182w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book-303x500.jpg 303w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /></a></p>
<p>Again, from <a href="https://amzn.to/3SVIO0R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JL</a>:</p>
<p><strong>This book grew out of a series of letters to my daughter concerning various things—mostly about money and investing—she was not yet quite ready to hear.</strong></p>
<p>Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we’ve created, understanding it is critical.</p>
<p>“But Dad,” she once said, “I know money is important. I just don’t want to spend my life thinking about it.” This was eye-opening. I love this stuff. But most people have better things to do with their precious time. Bridges to build, diseases to cure, treaties to negotiate, mountains to climb, technologies to create, children to teach, businesses to run.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, benign neglect of things financial leaves you open to the charlatans of the financial world. The people who make investing endlessly complex, because if it can be made complex it becomes more profitable for them, more expensive for us, and we are forced into their waiting arms.</p>
<p>Here’s an important truth: Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them. Not only are they more costly to the investor, they are less effective.</p>
<p><strong>The simple approach I created for her and present now to you, is not only easy to understand and implement, it is more powerful than any other.</strong></p>
<p>Together we’ll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debt: Why you must avoid it and what to do if you have it.</li>
<li>The importance of having F-you Money.</li>
<li>How to think about money, and the unique way understanding this is key to building your wealth.</li>
<li>Where traditional investing advice goes wrong and what actually works.</li>
<li>What the stock market really is and how it really works.</li>
<li>Why the stock market always goes up and why most people still lose money investing in it.</li>
<li>How to invest in a raging bull, or bear, market.</li>
<li>Specific investments to implement these strategies.</li>
<li>The Wealth Building and Wealth Preservation phases of your investing life and why they are not always tied to your age.</li>
<li>How your asset allocation is tied to those phases and how to choose it.</li>
<li>How to simplify the sometimes confusing world of 401(k), 403(b), TSP, IRA and Roth accounts.</li>
<li>TRFs (Target Retirement Funds), HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) and RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions).</li>
<li>What investment firm to use and why the one I recommend is so far superior to the competition.</li>
<li>Why you should be very cautious when engaging an investment advisor and whether you need to at all.</li>
<li>Why and how you can be conned, and how to avoid becoming prey.</li>
<li>Why I don’t recommend dollar cost averaging.</li>
<li>What financial independence looks like and how to have your money support you.</li>
<li>What the 4% rule is and how to use it to safely spend your wealth.</li>
<li>The truth behind Social Security.</li>
<li>A Case Study on how this all can be implemented in real life.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been using your simplified early retirement spreadsheet now for the last 8 years. I have obviously tweaked it some to reflect our income and estimated expenses, but it still works great! I have also shared this with friends!</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes!! Brilliant! Especially that last part. As a good friend of mine likes to say, <strong>&#8220;never keep knowledge to yourself &#8211; share it!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I asked Kristy if she&#8217;d be willing to share her tweaked spreadsheet for us to gander, and she not only obliged but also gave us some juicy background on along with it :)</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find her spreadsheet here: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kristy-early-retirement-spreadsheet.xlsx">Kristy&#8217;s Early Retirement Spreadsheet</a></li>
<li>And my original one here if you want to compare: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/files/early-retirement.xlsx">J$ FIRE Spreadsheet</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> Her and her husband&#8217;s net worth is right around $1.5 Mil (nice!!) and looks like they&#8217;ll hit FIRE at 58 (they&#8217;re in their 40&#8217;s now).</p>
<p>Take it away Kristy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*********</p>
<p>I graduated college in 2000 and started working as a chemist making $36,000 per year. I had met my husband the year before, just a boyfriend at the time. <strong>We decided to quit the corporate world and move to the beach!</strong></p>
<p>He worked at a liquor store and I waited tables for a few months. Then I found an apprenticeship job, as a real estate appraiser trainee. I decided to go for it and become a real estate appraiser as I hated the chemistry field and there were no jobs at the beach for chemistry at that time. My husband ended up managing the liquor store where he was just an employee and has been doing that ever since!</p>
<p>I got the education, experience, etc working as an appraiser for two years. Then I decided to switch and start appraising commercial properties. I continued my education and eventually received my MAI designation. This is the highest designation for real estate appraisers. This was in 2009.</p>
<p>I stayed with my company for 11 more years. I made pretty good money for a commercial appraiser, though it varied from $90,000 to $120,000 per year. <strong>In 2020 I quit my job and started my own real estate appraiser firm. I make about the same and work half as much&#8230; it&#8217;s awesome!</strong></p>
<p>My husband went to college and obtained a finance degree. He worked at Vanguard for about a year (J$: Dream job!! :)). He started us investing in retirement at our first jobs. He taught me about finances, saving, investing, etc. over the years. Eventually we hired a financial planner. I know about the fees, but it has been worth it for us. We just don&#8217;t have the time anymore to handle our investments.</p>
<p><strong>Current age: 44, my husband is 46. We have two kids, 17 F and 14 M.</strong> We will not be paying for college for both kids, but have been saving money since they were babies for college. We were able to save roughly $50,000 per kid.</p>
<p>We do have a house within walking distance to the beach and it&#8217;s our only debt. No car payments, no CC debt, no other debt.</p>
<p>I have attached the spreadsheet I have been using. Have fun with it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kristy-early-retirement-spreadsheet.xlsx"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67600 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kristy-early-retirement-spreadsheet.png" alt="kristy's early retirement spreadsheet" width="700" height="483" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kristy-early-retirement-spreadsheet.png 700w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kristy-early-retirement-spreadsheet-300x207.png 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kristy-early-retirement-spreadsheet-550x380.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>What a journey!</strong> From chemist to beach to waiting tables to apprenticeship to business owner! Not to mention a hearty mix of liquor and finances in there from her hunky husband, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>Always interesting what life has in store for us despite our own plans :) And of course, as they show, <strong>how much power WE have to change <em>our own direction </em>as well!</strong> Nothing stopping us from making big moves TODAY if we really want something. And it doesn&#8217;t even have to be something major either like a move to the beach or cross-country trip or whatever&#8230; Sometimes just taking that first step to *anything* feels good. And the flow might take you exactly where you need to go from there!</p>
<p>Awesome story, and awesome spreadsheet. Thanks so much for sharing with us, Kristy. And again, you can find her spreadsheet here if you want to download and tweak it yourself: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/kristy-early-retirement-spreadsheet.xlsx">Kristy&#8217;s Early Retirement Spreadsheet</a></p>
<p>To first steps!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64642" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-signature.jpg" alt="j. money signature" width="186" height="75" /></p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> Here&#8217;s the original article if you missed it years ago &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/early-retirement-fi-spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Early Retirement / Financial Freedom Spreadsheet</a>. I created a *super* simple spreadsheet to tell me generally what I was looking at FIRE-wise, and then my man and fellow $$ blogger Go Curry Cracker got a hold of it and made some of his own tweaks which you can also find included there. Hope it helps!</p>

<p><strong>Just got this book in the mail from blogger/hustler/entrepreneur extraordinaire, Chris Guillebeau, and if it&#8217;s any indication of his past best-sellers this should be a good one too. </strong>You might remember Chris from the Art of Non-Conformity blog back in the day or his popular book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3E0t83M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The $100 Startup</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip about it from <a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his website</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;A fascinating tour of this brave new world where novelty and creativity are currency, and the creators are in control. From the community of gamers getting paid to play, to the armchair pundits beating the bookies in online prediction markets, to TikTok “Sleepfluencers,” AI artists, and the band of renegade investors upending the rules of finance, in the world of Gonzo Capitalism, anything goes.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>This one my best friend SWEARS BY, which is saying something since he *hates* money books, but in a way it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;business/hustling&#8221; book than it is money&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>I tried reading it after he gave me his copy, but my mind is no longer in the &#8220;get rich and powerful!&#8221; mentality so perhaps it&#8217;s better suited for someone else :) It <em>was</em> super interesting though which kept my attention for the first few chapters, so if you&#8217;re looking for some tough love motivation or just want something *different* to read (it really is different!) you&#8217;ll want to check it out&#8230;</p>

<p>PS: For those of you who don&#8217;t know who Felix Dennis is (I didn&#8217;t), he was the founder of Maxim Magazine and a bunch of other super popular computer mags back in the day&#8230; He also randomly loves poetry which he made sure to scatter all throughout it which makes for an interesting juxtaposition (I told you it was different!)</p>

<p><strong>Now this one was brought to my attention by Hal Hershfield himself looking to get the word out and just recently dropped this summer.</strong> I haven&#8217;t had the chance to skim it yet, but he does seem to be a legit dude and the topic very much applies to what we&#8217;re about here.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip from <a href="https://www.halhershfield.com/yourfutureself" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his website</a> to see if you like it:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all had the desire to travel through time and see what our lives will be like later in life. While we want the best possible future for ourselves, we often fail to make decisions that would truly make that a reality. Why do we choose steak over vegetables at dinner, waving off concerns about high cholesterol? Why do we splurge on luxury cars rather than save for retirement? Why can’t we stick to our exercise programs? Why are so many of us so disconnected from our future selves?</p>
<p>Based on over a decade of groundbreaking research, Your Future Self explains that, in our minds, our future selves often look like strangers. Many of us view the future as incredibly distant, making us more likely to opt for immediate gratification that disregards the health and wellbeing of ourselves in the years to come. People who are able to connect with their future selves, however, are better able to balance living for today and planning for tomorrow. Your Future Self presents the science, describes the mental mistakes we make in thinking about the future, and gives us practical advice for imagining our best future so that we can make that a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s another new book that just dropped in June, and similarly Bill Hines reached out to offer up a free copy.</strong> It&#8217;s already hit the top lists of Personal Money Management, Investing Basics, College Financing, and Home Buying/Selling so seems to be resonating with people!</p>
<p>More from <a href="https://amzn.to/47KTp3L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;This book is the way to financial peace, to relieving the number one stressor in our lives and relationships. It’s the guide to living every day on your own terms, and never having to go to a job you no longer love, of never having to miss those important life events. I’ll keep it simple—just the way your personal finances should be! The first word of the title is no coincidence. KISS means Keep It Simple Silly! Maybe I’ll even make you laugh. Your household should measure success in ‘happy’, not some corporate financial metric.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>I just wanted to take the time to thank you for the free template that I found on YouTube.</p>
<p>I think this will get me to value money a lot more and I really like how you used &#8220;sexy income&#8221; because I think it&#8217;s a great mindset shift to make when valuing money and finance.</p>
<p>Thanks again. I&#8217;m really looking forward to using this everyday! I think I might add-on a daily log of my expenses and also even enter notes as to why I decided to take on that expense.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>David</p></blockquote>
<p>Love it!</p>
<p>And as you can see from the snapshot up top <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budget-are-sexy-financial-snapshot-spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spreadsheet</a> is nothing fancy, but boy &#8211; look at all that color!! Literally and figuratively! Lol..</p>
<p>I remember seeing a similar one 15 years ago before I even started this blog and wow did it make all the difference in the world to me. Again, not because it was set up differently or better or anything, but just because it was so bold and happy and *inspiring* looking! It taught me you don&#8217;t always have to stick with the tried and true (and boring!) with this stuff. It&#8217;s fine and it&#8217;ll work, but you&#8217;ll have a MUCH better chance sticking with it if you have some fun along the way :)</p>
<p>And how cool this guy wants to take it a step further and add in expense logs* to it?! It&#8217;s all about adapting it to your <em>own</em> needs for better motivation&#8230; In fact, this entire spreadsheet was built out of that same one I found all those years ago, just tweaked more to my liking with the colorful words and addition of a built-in net worth tracker! Which was the element that REALLY kept me going year after year, until I eventually just focused on that part only and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/is-net-worth-tracking-the-new-budgeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got rid of my budget</a> altogether <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>At any rate, you can check out this spreadsheet, and download it (for free), below if you&#8217;re looking for a new one&#8230; I always recommend *manually* tracking your finances for at least 3 months until you get a good sense of it all before moving to more automation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budgets/j_budget_template.xls" rel="noopener">J&#8217;s Financial Snapshot Spreadsheet</a></p>
<p>And be sure to tweak it away! There are no rules with this stuff &#8211; it&#8217;s your world, baby!! Do what you need to do to stay motivated <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44a.png" alt="👊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>*The expense logging reminded me of another idea: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/cool-idea-adding-life-events-to-your-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding notes to your net worth timeline</a>! Here&#8217;s what mine looked like back in April of 2019 &#8211; it&#8217;s an interesting exercise to go down :)</p>
<p><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/cool-idea-adding-life-events-to-your-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-60447 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/net-worth-with-life-events.jpg" alt="net worth with life events" width="600" height="253" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/net-worth-with-life-events.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/net-worth-with-life-events-300x127.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>And here some other juicy extras you can track in your spreadsheet as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your FI date</li>
<li>Your credit score</li>
<li>Your <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/what-is-your-debt-to-income-ratio-dti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debt-to-income ratio</a></li>
<li>Your <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/total-lifetime-earnings-wealth-ratio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifetime Wealth Ratio<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> (Net Worth ÷ Total Lifetime Income Earned!)</li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-spreadsheet-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Net Worth forecasts</a></li>
<li>And my personal favorite –&gt; <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-you-can-retire-spreadsheet-and-when-youre-going-to-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the years left until your expected death</a> ;)</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>For every (clump) of dog poop you pick up from our yard, I will give you 50¢!</strong></p>
<p>BOOM! One less task for me, and more cash for them &#8211; which should literally only take like 15 seconds. And where can you find an hourly rate like that as a kid?! You&#8217;d think this would have motivated them, but no. After two weeks and approximately 0 scoops my genius idea was proven to be not that genius at all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So I did what any good problem solver would do &#8211; I upped it to $1.00 a clump (DOUBLE the reward!!!). But sadly that didn’t fair much better either, clocking in with a total of just *1* scoop out of about 130 opportunities given&#8230; And that was only after me <em>hinting</em> there was a golden prize right next to their feet where they were playing!</p>
<p><strong>So back to the beginning we were, with me in the fields again scooping away, and them very much still in want of money&#8230;</strong> Though if you ask me, if you can&#8217;t even bend over for a few seconds to earn some quick cash, do you actually really want it <em>that</em> bad? ;)</p>
<p>(As an aside, I’m writing all this on my phone right now in the middle of the gastrointestinal office awaiting my own colonoscopy results, haha… Poo is on the mind today!! UPDATE: I’m in the clear!  They found a polyp in there during the procedure, but apparently it was “the good kind” so I&#8217;m set to go for another 5 years &#8211; #Adulting)</p>
<p>After marinating on it for a while and trying to come up with a more enticing offer, we realized we&#8217;ve never officially implemented any type of &#8220;allowance&#8221; deal yet with our family. And perhaps now was just the time to enact one? <em><strong>Maybe the incorporation of  *timelines* and getting weekly paychecks would motivate them more?</strong></em></p>
<p>Or maybe they just really don&#8217;t like poop, I dunno, but either way at 10, 9 and 5 it was high-time they start appreciating where money came from more. Especially if they&#8217;re gonna take over this blog one day ;)</p>
<p>I remember how important allowances were for ME growing up, even if I was only getting paid $1.00/week and all my friends made fun of me (!!!), but it was enough to give me a little freedom and push in the right direction. So I dug up an old wipey board from the basement and got to work&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67432" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart.jpg" alt="chore chart" width="640" height="442" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart.jpg 640w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart-300x207.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart-550x380.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Each kid has one daily task to complete, and if they accomplish it &#8211; AND &#8211; keep up with their other general responsibilities like making their bed and cleaning up after themselves, they&#8217;ll be entitled to an allowance at the end of the week.</p>
<p>If, however, they only do a partial job in any area, they&#8217;ll then get a 1/2 check and too many 1/2 checks will result in <em>less</em> of an allowance at the week&#8217;s end. You&#8217;ll see Baby Dime up there already got one after a couple of days rockin&#8217; it.</p>
<p><strong>As for their pay? $3.00/week.</strong> BUT! This isn&#8217;t just any ordinary allowance, oh no. As recommended by my oldest son, Baby Penny, we&#8217;ll be following the concept from the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3r4rcnC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Cups</a> by Tony Townsley*. A fantastic read that surprisingly all three of my kids love! And one that recommends splitting allowances into 3 equal parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup for spending</li>
<li>1 cup for savings</li>
<li>and 1 cup for giving</li>
</ul>
<p>Thereby teaching kids the importance of all THREE, and getting those habits started early. <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/angelina-jolie-budget-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Even stars like Angeline Jolie does this</a>!! Though perhaps filling up their <em>houses</em> with cash instead of plastic cups <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And since my kids will be *manually* receiving and divvying up their cash each week vs digitally on a screen, hopefully it&#8217;ll all sink in even more too. I&#8217;ve already headed to the bank to get stacks of ones now that I&#8217;ll be turning into an ATM!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67418" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/cash-gif.gif" alt="cash gif" width="320" height="405" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[live shot of me flipping through a stack]</p>
<p><strong>I gotta give my oldest boy mad credit again for this.</strong> We were originally going to start their allowances at $2.00/week which they could do whatever they want with, but it was him who brought up the book and said he&#8217;d like to get a little more involved and give back. I almost cried and immediately changed it.</p>
<p>And as you can see, we&#8217;re off to a great start! Everyone is more or less doing their part each day, and I can already tell they&#8217;re taking it seriously and excited for what they can now do with their extra money. We&#8217;ll see how long it lasts, but for now I&#8217;m a proud dad, and I&#8217;d like to think a *smart* one too ;)</p>
<p><strong>Hopefully the $$$ teachings of your kids are going well for you over there! If any of them are interested in scooping up poop, my $1.00/offer is still on the table!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yours in daddying,</p>

<p>*I first read <a href="https://amzn.to/3r4rcnC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Cups</a> when we did a giveaway for it here on the blog over 13 years ago &#8211; way before any of my kids were born or I even had to think about allowances! Highly recommend checking out if you&#8217;re going down similar adventures right now.</p>

<p>A bunch of new money books have come out in our community recently, and I wanted to pass them along in case you find yourself in any of these particular situations&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>And they all are indeed pretty particular! </strong>Which is great &#8211; you need to dig in deep sometimes and focus instead of being hit with &#8220;generalities&#8221; all the time. And these books cover everything from death to consumerism to the service industry to financial feminism and even stripping ;) Never know what you&#8217;re gonna get these days from us!</p>
<p>Here they are below &#8211; I hope they help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">********</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Tipped&#8221;<br />
The Life Changing Guide to Financial Freedom for Waitresses, Bartenders, Strippers, and All Other Service Industry Professionals</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3WlSxwJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66918" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/tipped-book-barbara-sloan.jpg" alt="tipped book barbara sloan" width="333" height="511" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/tipped-book-barbara-sloan.jpg 326w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/tipped-book-barbara-sloan-196x300.jpg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></a></p>
<p>This one comes from an up and comer in the space, <strong>Barbara Sloan,</strong> who I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting in real life this year and thoroughly enjoyed hanging with her. She blogs/coaches over at <a href="https://www.tippedfinance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TippedFinance.com</a>, and here&#8217;s more about the book per her website and Amazon:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<div class="elementor-element elementor-element-fe68bd4 fd-addons-sticky-no elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor" data-id="fe68bd4" data-element_type="widget" data-settings="{&quot;fd_addons_sticky&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div class="elementor-widget-container">
<p>As I logged hundreds of hours of listening and reading, deep diving the world of personal finance, I kept coming across the same advice for corporate 9-5ers being doled out time and time again. Listeners or readers would write in, guests would come on, and the same information was recycled and the same jargon extensively used. I heard questions like how to ask for a raise, advice on talking to your HR rep about your 401k option, tips on how millennials should cut out their daily latte, and questions like how to ask your parents for help with your six figure student loans.</p>
<p><em><strong>At no point did I see myself in any of the readers or listeners’ questions, at no point did the guests offer actionable advice for someone like me, someone who had a career in the service industry.</strong> </em>At no point did a financial advisor ever give me their card and ask to sit down with me to discuss my investment strategy. Personal finance is personal, but in a space as large as this one, why wasn’t I seeing any persons like me? As people we connect to the stories of other, and we do better when we understand what is possible in the context of our own worlds.</p>
<p>Tipped, is my response to this void in the personal finance space – because your career is real, your money is real, and your future is real. Through real stories and service industry related analogies, Tipped will teach you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get started investing today—and actually understand the world of investing</li>
<li>Avoid industry specific pitfalls</li>
<li>Budget while on a fluctuating income</li>
<li>Develop creative ways to build an emergency fund</li>
<li>Take your financial temperature</li>
<li>Build your path to financial freedom</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;After the Death of Your Spouse&#8221;<br />
Next Financial Steps for Surviving Spouses</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3FMDshI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66915" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book.png" alt="after the death of your spouse" width="338" height="541" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book.png 398w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book-187x300.png 187w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/after-the-death-of-your-spouse-book-312x500.png 312w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></a></p>
<p>This book comes from <strong>Mike Piper</strong> over at the (incredibly helpful!) website, <a href="https://obliviousinvestor.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oblivious Investor</a>, and was brought to my attention by a fellow reader, KT. Here&#8217;s what she sent me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey there! Hope you are great :) Have you seen Mike Piper/Oblivious Investor&#8217;s new book &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3FMDshI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After the Death of Your Spouse</a>? It&#8217;s a really helpful, tactical guide for getting through all the estate stuff and seems like a great companion for a legacy binder &#8211; I feel like you posted about those at some point??? Anyway, morbid subject, but I thought you might find it interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Indeed I had, and indeed I agree!</strong> You knock out this book AND a legacy binder and you are straight <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Not to mention the blessing in everyone&#8217;s life whenever you finally retire from Earth! Nothing could be more helpful during times of crisis, so if not now, at least put it on your radar to start working on later&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where you can find a few of these Legacy Binders:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/ice-binder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Emergency Binder</a> ($39, robust, pretty)</li>
<li>Free Legacy Binder (FREE, simple)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.erikdewey.com/bigbookmkIV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Big Book of Everything</a> (FREE, simple)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>And then here&#8217;s more about the book itself, via Mike&#8217;s website:</strong></p>
<p>Many surviving spouses find themselves overwhelmed by all the administrative and financial to-do items that have to be handled in the months after their spouse’s death. There’s a lot to do, and they’re supposed to get it all done while grieving. And in many cases, the situation is made more difficult by the fact that the surviving spouse is not the one who regularly handled the household finances.</p>
<p>I wrote this book to walk people through it, in plain language. It’s the book I want my spouse to have, in case something happens to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3NweAN6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66916" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/buyer-beware-new-book.jpg" alt="buyer beware new book" width="419" height="538" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/buyer-beware-new-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/buyer-beware-new-book-234x300.jpg 234w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/buyer-beware-new-book-389x500.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /></a>Now this one comes from <strong>Marta Tellado</strong>, president and CEO of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a>, which was brought to my attention by <a href="https://boomersurvive-thriveguide.typepad.com/the_survive_and_thrive_bo/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rita R. Robison</a> who was kind enough to ship me a copy! Bless her heart&#8230;</p>
<p>I asked her what she thought of it so far as I&#8217;m in the middle of three other books and don&#8217;t dare crack open a fourth yet!, and here&#8217;s what she responded with:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>The book is fabulous, like I thought it would be.</strong> It’s also upsetting because the level of deceit and wrongdoing from corporations is staggering. The first section on the Big Four — Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple — is particularly disturbing. How much they control our data is deeply troubling.</p>
<p>In terms of what your FIRE readers might be interested in, Tellado gives information on how to protect yourself and your data. On the Financial Fairness chapter, your readers might be interested in hidden fees. They already know about avoiding payday loans, keeping up with student debt payments, and checking their credit report.</p>
<p>Then, there’s consumer action. Not normally in your wheelhouse, but, I’d argue, something your readers need to know more about and participate in. The book also has something I’ve never seen before: QR codes that take you to web pages. Amazing. Consumer Reports is such a large organization they can develop web materials based on her book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>And then here&#8217;s more about the book from Amazon:</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been getting ripped off.</p>
<p>The rules that have protected consumers for decades are failing. Companies are spying on us. Many of the products we once trusted are dangerous and failing at alarming rates. Whether we are buying a crib, a small appliance, an iPhone app, or shopping for car insurance, it&#8217;s become harder than ever to know whether the choices we make in the marketplace are putting us at risk-either from physical harm or the abuse of our personal data by hackers or corporations.</p>
<p>This is intolerable. It&#8217;s wrong. And we don&#8217;t have to put up with it anymore. Marta L. Tellado, the president and CEO of Consumer Reports, has been an advocate for consumers for decades. In Buyer Aware, Tellado shows you the steps you can take to protect yourself from predatory business practices, and how to exert your inherent power as a consumer to spur politicians and businesses to clean up their act. Only then can we ensure that we have an economy that is fair, safe, and transparent for all, and puts consumers first.</p>

Overcome the Patriarchy&#8217;s Bullsh*t to Master Your Money and Build a Life You Love</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3DTqUDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66917" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/financial-feminist-book.jpg" alt="financial feminist book" width="361" height="539" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/financial-feminist-book.jpg 410w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/financial-feminist-book-201x300.jpg 201w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/financial-feminist-book-335x500.jpg 335w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, we got <a href="https://amzn.to/3DTqUDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Feminism</a> from <strong>Tori Dunlap</strong> who&#8217;s freakin&#8217; EXPLODED on the scene these days and will probably not be slowing down anytime soon&#8230; (her company just crossed 7 figures in revenue &#8211; <a href="https://x.com/herfirst100K/status/1588288389304168448" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in one month</a>!!). She&#8217;s a polarizing figure in our community, but ultimately is on a mission to help every last person on this earth get their $$$ right.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about her book, which comes out on December 27th (but you can <a href="https://amzn.to/3DTqUDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order</a> now):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>Tori Dunlap was always good with money. As a kid, she watched her prudent parents balance their checkbook every month and learned to save for musical tickets by gathering pennies in an Altoids tin. But she quickly discovered that her experience with money was pretty unusual, especially among her female friends.</p>
<p>It wasn’t our fault. Investigating this financial literacy and wealth gap, Tori found that girls are significantly less likely to receive a holistic financial education; we’re taught to restrain our spending, while boys are taught about investing and rewarded for pursuing wealth. In adulthood, women are hounded by the unfounded stereotype of the frivolous spenders whose lattes are to blame for the wealth gap. And when something like, say, a global pandemic happens, we’re the first to have jobs cut and the last to re-enter the workforce. It&#8217;s no wonder money is a source of anxiety and a barrier to equality for so many of us.</p>
<p><em><strong>But what if money didn&#8217;t mean restriction, and instead, choice? The ability to luxuriously travel, quit toxic jobs, donate to important organizations, retire early? The freedom to live the life you want, and change the world while you do it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Tori founded <a href="https://herfirst100k.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Her First $100K</a> to teach women to overcome the unique obstacles standing in the way of their financial freedom. In <span class="a-text-italic">Financial Feminist</span>, she distills the principles of her shame- and judgment-free approach to paying off debt, figuring out your value categories to spend mindfully, saving money without monk-like deprivation, and investing in order to spend your retirement tanning in Tulum.</p>
<p>Featuring journaling prompts, deep-dives into the invisible aspects of the financial landscape, and interviews with experts on everything money—from predatory credit card companies to the racial wealth gap and voting with your dollars—<span class="a-text-italic">Financial Feminist</span> is the ultimate guide to making your money work harder for you (rather than the other way around.)</p>
