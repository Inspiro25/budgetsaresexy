<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>I’m about to introduce you to a frugal living rule I started using almost a decade ago.</strong></p>
<p>It’s saved me untold amounts of money.</p>
<p>And to be honest, it’s without much sacrifice at all (none, in some circumstances).</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">It’s called <em><strong>The Half Rule</strong>.</em></p>
<p>I only wish I&#8217;d discovered it back in my early 20s when I could’ve really used it!</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;ll help you fight inflation. It&#8217;ll cut your grocery bill down without having to stop buying the products that you like.</strong></p>
<p>And you&#8217;ll start to have some money left at the end of the month.</p>
<p>While it can’t be used on everything, it can be used in more cases than you think.</p>
<p>Ready for it?</p>
<h2>What is the Half Rule?</h2>
<p>The Half Rule means cutting the amount of product you use <em>in half</em>, and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>Does it still perform like it should? Then keep it at the new, half-level. Do you need to add a bit more to it? Go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll likely always end up using less than you were before, causing you to have to buy a replacement product less (and saving you money).</p>
<p>I started playing around with this over a decade ago. and I can&#8217;t tell you how much money it&#8217;s saved me (without having to buy generics or go without).</p>
<p>You see, I&#8217;m going out on a limb here, but I think we all use too much product.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">And there are three main reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturer Recommendations are Inflated</strong>: Manufacturer recommendations are often asking us to use more of the product than necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Habits are Hard to Break</strong>: We have developed a habit of using a certain amount of a product, and it&#8217;s hard to change habits. (J$: This is me!! I need to work on this!)</li>
<li><strong>Product Inflation is a Real Thing</strong>: We&#8217;re experiencing product inflation, where we think to get the same amount of pleasure out of something, we need to use more of it (has anyone increased their Starbucks size to grande, for example, to get the same degree of pleasure they used to get from a tall?).</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested this rule out by cutting in half my use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shampoo</li>
<li>Laundry detergent</li>
<li>Dryer sheets (I’ve cut them in half to no bad effect for <em>decades</em> now)</li>
<li>Cooking oil (started <a href="https://amzn.to/4hJ0VR3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using an oil mister</a> instead of pouring it)</li>
<li>Restaurant meals (I typically take 1/3 to ½ home for lunch)</li>
<li>Bagels for breakfast (I started eating half a bagel at home, instead of a whole one)</li>
<li>Starbucks order size</li>
<li>Glass stovetop cleaner</li>
<li>Tape (when wrapping gifts)</li>
</ul>
<p>And those are just the easy ones you can start with.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>TIP:</strong> to save even more money, pair this Half Rule with my <a id="m_-6435506520908895220OWAf7e429eb-2fb4-4fe2-a6d1-8f2f80e12fe0" href="https://www.frugalconfessions.com/save-me-money/mini-savings-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.frugalconfessions.com/save-me-money/mini-savings-challenges/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1739979841816000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FLxE70T3VjL55zgZ_CKfx">Bank It! Saving Money Challenge</a>.]</em></p>
<h2>Why is the Half Rule So Effective?</h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">When you change a few things here and there, or something by a <em>little</em> amount, it’s not really noticeable to your bank account.</p>
<p>Not enough to make you want to keep doing it.</p>
<p>By cutting your use of many things in HALF, you quickly see the change to your money.</p>
<p>Imagine having to buy 10 products <em>half</em> as often – that&#8217;s a significant change to your spending.</p>
<p>And with these current prices?</p>
<p>Yeah… you’re going to notice.</p>
<p>It starts a ripple effect of savings – one that you can control.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>TIP:</strong> you could then use your extra savings to <a href="https://www.frugalconfessions.com/budgets/how-to-get-one-month-ahead-on-bills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get one month ahead on your bills</a>!]</em></p>
<h2>A Specific Example of Where This Paid Off</h2>
<p>Most of us don’t want to take a close look at how we’re using products, because it&#8217;s become a habit.</p>
<p>And habits can be hard to break.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no different from you in this.</p>
<p>But many times, the money we need to actually increase savings is being <a href="https://www.frugalconfessions.com/spend-less/list-of-spending-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent on our habits</a>.</p>
<p>For example, I love <a href="https://amzn.to/3X4NUsK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint soap</a>. I use it to create foam hand soaps for each of our bathrooms.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">I was filling up half the bottle with the semi-expensive peppermint soap, and then the other half with water.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even blame this one on a bloated manufacturer recommendation; when I finally looked at the instructions, I noticed that I was only supposed to use 1 part soap to 3 parts water.</p>
<p>It was all me (product inflation? Habit? Not really sure).</p>
<p>I changed. Now, I’m buying Dr. Bronner’s refills less often.</p>
<p><em>Ka-ching</em>!</p>
<p>When you bring awareness to how you’re using a product, then you can make a change.</p>
<h2>Is The Half Rule for Everything?</h2>
<p>Again, this rule does not work for everything.</p>
<p>But I would argue it works for MUCH more than you will initially think.</p>
<p>For example, you can’t fill up your gas tank halfway and still commute the same number of times to work.</p>
<p>Never, <em>EVER</em>, cut a prescription in half.</p>
<p>And you won’t catch me eating ½ of a single serving size of yogurt.</p>
<p>But why waste your money on a daily, caterpillar-sized amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush when a dentist-recommended pea-size will do just fine?</p>
<p><em><strong>Take a handful of products, cut your use in half, and see if anything changes. You might be surprised. I know I was.</strong></em></p>

<p>Just had a randomly refreshing chat with a fellow coffee shop goer, and as things tend to go we ventured into finances and the words that came out of his mouth were outstanding, lol&#8230; So much so I had to stop him mid-sentence a couple of times to make sure I got his phrases right! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here were some of the highlights from our convo, in *his own words* as best as I can remember&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h3>&#8220;I would rather play chicken with my bills than with my savings&#8221;</h3>
<p>Instead of spending on &#8220;wants&#8221; first like I&#8217;ve done all my life, I flipped it around and now SAVE first and pay bills second. Then if there happens to be anything left over, I use that to buy any &#8220;extras&#8221; I might want.</p>
<p>I went from not being able to save $1,000 and a credit score of 580, to having over $13,000 in the bank and a score of 730 within one year!</p>
<p>There were a handful of things that led to this, but it was mainly <em>re-ordering my priorities</em> and paying myself first that got me going in the right direction.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system of managing my cash flow&#8221;</h3>
<p>Another reason I was able to save so much this year was because I drastically changed my management system. Instead of having everything in 1-2 accounts, I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is I spread my accounts across multiple banks that all serve a specific purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have one account for my short-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my long-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my bills</li>
<li>And then one account for my spending/wants.</li>
</ol>
<p>My business banking looks similar: one account for savings, one account for bills, and another account for taxes (I pay quarterly). It&#8217;s a lot to manage, but it&#8217;s brought so much peace and savings.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I threw away my debit cards&#8221;</h3>
<p>The first thing I did when I started re-arranging everything was to move all my savings into a brick and mortar bank that had no online access. This way the only way I could access my money was by going there in person. I did get debit cards, but I immediately cut them up and threw them away.</p>
<p>This has immensely strengthened my discipline, and partly why I was able to go from $1,000 to $13,000 so fast. It took me over 30 years to save my first $10,000 and now the hardest part is over!</p>
<h3>&#8220;I spend a lot of money looking for women&#8221;</h3>
<p>Over the course of 3-4 years I&#8217;ve spent $40,000+ looking for love, or about $1,200/mo.</p>
<p>Part of that goes to dating apps like eHarmony (which I initially balked at as it cost me $300!), but most of it comes from just doing my best to be &#8220;visible.&#8221; So lots of eating out and hanging with friends, visiting bars/community events/etc. You have to put yourself out there if you truly want to meet people.</p>
<p>I initially felt bad about spending all this money with no savings in the bank, but later I realized I was prioritizing what I wanted and I became okay with it. Now I could have been more *efficient* with the way I went about it, but I am proud to say it worked out in the end and I will be getting married at the end of this month! Ironically, to a woman I found on eHarmony!!</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This was the most interesting part of the whole conversation, haha&#8230; As someone who met their partner years before online dating and apps came around, I&#8217;m always fascinated by the mixture of tech and love. And really how much dating seems to cost in general??! And I&#8217;ve surely never met anyone who has TRACKED IT ALL, lol&#8230; Probably exactly what I would do if ever back in that situation <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-68221 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/serial-killer-dating-gif.gif" alt="dating gif" width="328" height="328" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>So basically, yeah &#8211; most stuff we&#8217;ve heard before, but in much more entertaining ways ;)</p>
<p><strong>1) Save first, spend later</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Build a system that works for you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Make yourself more &#8220;visible&#8221; when you want something. </strong>Whether it be love, business, career, you name it. If you&#8217;re not putting yourself into the position to *receive,* you&#8217;re limiting yourself! Nothing great has happened sitting on your couch &#8211; you have to put yourself out there and tell the world what you are looking for!</p>
<p>(This is exactly, btw, why I choose to do my projects out of coffee shops. I never know who I&#8217;ll run into or what type of magic might happen! And surely this blog post would have never been created, so who knows what you would be reading right now??! Lolol&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>At any rate, all good things to think about as we head into the new year here :) </strong> Will you consciously place yourself in situations which allow you to get closer to your goals or farther away from them? Are your management systems still serving you okay, or is it time to blow them up and start from scratch? Where will you be putting that first dollar from your next paycheck? If it isn&#8217;t to YOU, you need to re-read this whole blog post! ;)</p>
<p>Your F.G.A. (Financial Guardian Angel),</p>

<p>On <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gym days</a> I&#8217;ve started doing this thing where after our boot camp I reward myself by grabbing a basketball and shooting around for a while, patting myself on the back for making it. But then I started feeling guilty for having fun when I&#8217;m supposed to be &#8220;working out,&#8221; so I made this arbitrary rule that I can play for however long I want, but I&#8217;m not allowed to *leave* until I make a half-court shot :)</p>
<p>Which in itself is pretty hard of course, but then I added a twist where when I miss it I have to RUN AFTER THE BALL and try over and over and over again, running back and forth from opposite sides of the court, until finally making it. And when that got easier because I&#8217;m now better at making shots!, I upped the game to making THREE half-court shots before leaving, and then after each one I drop to the ground and do 15 pushups for good measure <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I often wonder what the people around me must think watching this lunatic running around launching balls into the air and then falling to the floor, but it&#8217;s made my gym days 3x more exciting while still accomplishing the mission.</p>
<p><strong>I thought of this when I got the following message, only instead of silly basketball games it&#8217;s a savings one!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Years ago you shared a simple grid which my husband and I call <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart.jpg">the bingo sheet</a> &#8211; each square contains a dollar amount to put away each week and at the end of the year, if done faithfully, results in saving an extra $1k.</p>
<p>I use this every year, but with a twist: I try to double or even triple the amount each week to save even more. This year I&#8217;m on track to hit $4k&#8230; it&#8217;s really a fun way to save, so thank you for sharing that!!</p>
<p>&#8211; Denise B.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beautiful!! She made savings fun by taking on the challenge, and then when she was ready to up the game she threw in a twist! Because why not?! Life is boring playing it straight&#8230; Sometimes you gotta shake it up!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s that &#8220;bingo sheet,&#8221; made by the fabulous Jamie from <a href="https://www.mediumsizedfamily.com/a-money-saving-chart-save-an-extra-1000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MediumSizedFamily.com</a>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-53343" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-791x1024.jpg" alt="money saving chart" width="614" height="795" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-232x300.jpg 232w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart-768x994.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a><em>[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-saving-chart.jpg">Click to download</a>]</em></p>
<p>As Denise mentioned, the game is pretty straightforward: each week just pick a new square, then throw in the corresponding amount right into savings &#8211; and BOOM! <strong>You&#8217;ll have an extra $1,000 by the end of the year,</strong> which just so happens to be the amount you should spend on me for Christmas ;)</p>
<p>And if you really want to *see* your results, open up a brand new savings account and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-new-challenge-everything-savings-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start saving fresh</a> so it doesn&#8217;t get muddled with all your other dollars! You want to SEE and FEEL your progress as much as you can so it continues to motivate you. Then when you&#8217;re done, empty it out and challenge yourself next year with a twist!</p>
<p><strong>It really can be as easy as that.</strong> This stuff isn&#8217;t complicated, but oftentimes our *emotions* can be. I don&#8217;t know why we&#8217;re wired like we are, but keep trying new ways to keep it fun and fresh, and with a little luck you&#8217;ll be FIREd in no time&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading today! Have a very merry holiday season, and we&#8217;ll see you out there on the courts (like a wild man) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f384.png" alt="🎄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3c0.png" alt="🏀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>THERE&#8217;S JUST SO MANY GREAT VIDEOS THERE from our community!!  And much faster/fun to digest too &#8211; I feel like a dinosaur still just blogging away my thoughts here <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Anyways, see which ones you can adapt to your own life!</strong></p>
<p>And hopefully it at least includes the first one (hubba hubba)&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Click <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClCkhcSApNf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the video</a> to watch it on Insta (the dancing is spectacular! ;)), or peruse below for their write up + my two cents&#8230; If it reads weird it&#8217;s because it was shortened for Instagram.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>We’re always looking for ways to cut expenses so we can put the extra into investing to build cash flow.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Here are 10 crazy ways we’ve saved money over the years:</h3>
<p><strong>#1. Naked Sundays in the summer.</strong> Stay home vs. spend on expensive brunches and entertainment. Stock up on food and drinks, plan fun things to do. [Reminds me of <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/introducing-strip-budgeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strip budgeting</a>, lol&#8230; everything is more fun without clothes on!]</p>
<p><strong>#2. Do a dry month.</strong> Cut as much as $400 from spending (less likely to dine out). Opportunity to connect with sober friends. [YES! Plus it&#8217;s a great break for your <em>health</em> too and shows you can really accomplish hard things if you need to&#8230; I&#8217;m currently in week #4 without a sip of alcohol and it&#8217;s not as bad now that I&#8217;ve gotten past that first week of hell! Lol&#8230; (but will probably stop at the end of the month as I enjoy it too much :)]</p>
<p><strong>#3. Keep our phones for 5+ years.</strong> $25 to $35/month to rent = $1,500 to $2,100/year. Put on rewards credit card to earn free travel. [I&#8217;m still an old school Android Galaxy user myself, going on 8 years now, and only paying <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30/mo</a>&#8230; Sometimes I do need to shell out an extra $5 to bump up my bandwidth with all this new Instagram watching I&#8217;m doing, haha, but by and large it&#8217;s saved me thousands over the years and don&#8217;t have any plans on going back&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>#4. Choose a limited data plan.</strong> Use Wi-Fi instead. Saves $80/month. [Yup, see note above!]</p>
<p><strong>#5. Stick to the same simple menu and grocery list.</strong> Planning meals makes shopping easier. Splurge from time to time (keeps it special). [Agreed! Mrs. BudgetsAreSexy does most of our cooking/shopping, but it&#8217;s usually the same core meals each week with one or two swapped around to keep it interesting&#8230; In fact, she just started writing out the week&#8217;s meals on a wipey board in our kitchen too so everyone knows what we&#8217;ll be having each day now. Which is great as it lessens the barrage of questions from our kids!]</p>
<p><strong>#6. Grocery shop every 7 to 10 days.</strong> Less time in-store = less money spent. Build a menu around foods already at home or on sale. [I don&#8217;t think this is possible with a million kids, but yes &#8211; less trips is preferable :)]</p>
<p><strong>#7. Semi-annual spending analysis.</strong> Opens eyes to unconscious spending/budget creep. Reminds us of goals and keeps us on track. [And if you really want to impress the pants off your significant other, put together a <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/a-financial-powerpoint-presentation-that-screams-i-love-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nerdy powerpoint</a> on everything!]</p>
<p><strong>#8. Make our own iced coffee daily in the summer.</strong> Up to $12 for iced coffee x 4 visits/week = $3K/year. Save by using a French press, storing in reused spaghetti jars. [Not here, lol&#8230; I do make my first cup of coffee at home while I&#8217;m doing &#8220;me&#8221; time in the mornings, but once the kids are out the door IT&#8217;S COFFEE SHOP TIME FOR ME!!!! Mainly for the ambiance and people and easier motivation to work though vs the coffee itself as it basically doubles as my &#8220;office space&#8221;. (And is significantly cheaper &#8211; just costs a cup of coffee!)]</p>
<p><strong>#9. Bought/rented housing with 1 salary.</strong> Doesn’t mean can’t have a beautiful home. Allowed us to put away hundreds of thousands of $ in 401(k)s. [Yes yes yes! Living off 50% of your income does wonders for your flexibility and goals&#8230; You could even take it as far as stopping work altogether if you wanted to and just coast right into <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/wifefi-status-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WifeFI</a>! ;)]</p>
<p><strong>#10. Drove a 2006 MINI Cooper for 15 years.</strong> $100/month car maintenance vs. $500/month car payment. Saved $50K (including the $8K spent on maintenance). [Makes me miss Frankencaddy so bad, ugh&#8230; No monthly payments is nice, but it&#8217;s even better when your car actually <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/franken-caddy-car-keeps-making-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAKES you money</a> &#8211; heyo!!!]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/franken-caddy-car-keeps-making-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-50991 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/frankencaddy.jpg" alt="frankencaddy" width="550" height="386" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/frankencaddy.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/frankencaddy-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Good morning!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Happy Halloween Weekend!!</strong></p>
<p>Y&#8217;all dressing up or hitting any wild parties??! I wish I could say I was, but unless you count chaperoning a thousand kids as they hit event after event after event all weekend as juicy, I most certainly will not be lol&#8230;</p>
<p>Though I did find these <em>killer</em> shoes a few days ago I&#8217;ll be celebrating with ;)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66833" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans.jpg" alt="bloody vans" width="529" height="356" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans-300x202.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bloody-vans-550x370.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" /></p>
<p><strong>Aren&#8217;t they just perfect for Halloween???</strong> Super cheap too as they were &#8220;lightly used&#8221; (I love vintage stores so much&#8230;)</p>
<p>As for my costume, I&#8217;ll probably just go w/the tried and true &#8220;skeleton rock star.&#8221; Which consists of basically just wearing a black shirt with skeleton bones on it and rocking my &#8216;hawk. Though perhaps this year with the shoes addition I&#8217;ll call myself a &#8220;killer rock star&#8221;? Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still looking for some good &#8211; and frugal &#8211; costumes, here are a few of my favorites from an old blog post of mine: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/last-minute-cheap-halloween-costumes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16 Last-Last Minute Halloween Costume Ideas</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static Cling</strong> – Wear normal clothes and safety pin socks and lint to it!</li>
<li><b>Christmas Tree</b> – My all-time favorite costume ever: Wear all green, wrap yourself in Christmas lights, and then plug yourself into the wall :)</li>
<li><strong>Chick magnet – </strong>Tape a bunch of Barbie dolls to yourself. Or use pictures of hot girls!</li>
<li><strong>Smarty Pants</strong> – Tape smarties candies to your PANTS</li>
<li><strong>The Tanning Bed – </strong>Tape glow-sticks up and down your arms. Then go around the party, entrapping people in your embrace: Instant tanning bed.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest board!</strong> Dress in all white, then hang a cork board around your neck with pictures of cute houses, tattoos, book cases and whatever else people like to &#8220;pin&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Random Hook-up</strong> – Drape a lot of random colored extension cords around you, haha&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you end up going as though, I want pics please :)</p>
<p>Or you can just stay home and binge <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budgets Are Sexy</a> all night long &#8211; that&#8217;s probably the best *treat* for you&#8230; Less calories and not nearly as scary! Yum! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f383.png" alt="🎃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">News &amp; Nuggets Around The Community:</h3>
<p>Interesting news and clips that caught my eye this week&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Ali from All Options Considered celebrates <a href="https://alloptionsconsidered.com/2022/10/21/life-after-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 years of being FI</a>&#8211; woo!</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">“It’s as hard to start and run a small business as it is to start a big one. You will suffer the same toll financially and psychologically as you bludgeon it into existence… So if you’re going to dedicate your life to a business, which is the only way it will ever work, you should choose one with the potential to be huge.” &#8211; Stephen Schwarzman via <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/counterintuitive-life-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darius Foroux</a></li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">“When you buy a home to live in with a plan to later rent it out, you’re doing two things at once. You have to consider the property more from an investment perspective and less from an emotional “I love this house” perspective. This isn’t always possible (or advisable), but, if you live in a hot rental market and have aspirations of building a passive income stream, buying a home that can be turned into a rental can be a great option.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.frugalwoods.com/2022/10/19/whats-happening-with-our-rental-property/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frugalwoods</a></li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 25px;">&#8220;I was at a gas station filling up when a man came up to me, excited to see the car I was driving. He gushed over how cool he thought the car was and asked how I could afford it. Embarrassed by the attention and eager to shift the focus to something else, I truthfully explained that I had eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every day for an entire year to pay for the car. Upon hearing that, his smile waned and I could tell that he doubted the sacrifice was worth it.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2022/10/just-another-car/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humble Dollar</a></li>
<li>&#8220;Decades ago, when I was in Sales, the top contact at my largest customer made a comment to me that I’ll never forget. I was moving on to a new job, and Fred gave me what turned out to be one of the biggest compliments of my life. “You’ve always looked me in the eyes,” he said. “If someone doesn’t make eye contact with me, my experience has taught me to not trust them. You make excellent eye contact, and you’ve been one of the people I’ve trusted most in my career.” When you’re talking with someone who matters in your life, look into their eyes.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/secrets-of-a-professional-negotiator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Retirement Manifesto</a></li>

<p>Here are a handful of things I do/did that&#8217;s really impacted our finances over the years&#8230;</p>
<p>Check &#8217;em out and see if any of them are worth testing out!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>Rounding up debt payments!</strong> &#8212; Whatever your monthly payment is, just roundup to the nearest $10th and kill off a little extra debt without even noticing it! This works sooo good for your credit cards, car loans, or even mortgages. Or if you really want to step up your game &#8211; round up to the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/debt-paying-tip-round-up-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearest $100th</a>! We&#8217;ve probably shaved off at least a year or two of payments doing this, and makes it a bit easier to budget too if you prefer using whole numbers vs exacts.</p>
<p><strong>Rounding up investments</strong> &#8212; Similar to the above, if you get into the habit of rounding up your <em>monthly investments</em> they&#8217;ll only compound that much faster. And if you really want to speed things up, use apps like <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/acorns-app-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acorns</a> which will *automatically* round up ALL YOUR TRANSACTIONS to the nearest $1.00 and drop the difference right into investments for you. So every time you swipe your card for coffee or groceries or even your 100th Amazon purchase of the week (hah), you&#8217;ll feel a tad less guilty knowing that you&#8217;re at least investing at the same time ;) I banked <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/acorns-app-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600.22</a> when I first tried Acorns without even noticing it &#8211; it was great.</p>
<p><strong>Actually SAVING your savings</strong>! &#8212; You know when people say they’ve “saved” money by using a coupon or getting something 10% off or buying one and getting another one for free? Well, you might not have paid full price for the item, but you&#8217;re still very much *spending* money vs *saving* since nothing actually went INTO your savings account!</p>
<p>With this spending/savings hack (dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/spavings-savings-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spavings</a>&#8220;) you&#8217;re actually doing just that: putting the money you&#8217;ve &#8220;saved&#8221; from discounts right into savings. So that 10% off becomes an extra $4.00 dropped into your account, and that coupon for buy one get one free becomes an extra $10.50 banked that you didn&#8217;t have to spend. You literally save every time you spend! And let me tell you &#8211; it adds up. When I experimented with this for 10 months back in 2018 I amassed <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-voyeur-time-894k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$4,040.50</a> &#8211; almost enough to fully fund a Roth IRA!* Try it out for a month and see how it goes!</p>
<p><strong>Asking for fees to be waved</strong> &#8212; Probably the easiest of all tricks. The next time you get a fee or penalty or any other of the sort, just pick up the phone, or email, and ask (politely) if it can be erased! I&#8217;d say over 50% of the time it works, especially if you&#8217;re a loyal customer and it&#8217;s the first time you&#8217;ve been hit. And often if you ask for a supervisor after getting rejected you&#8217;ll win a number of those battles as well.</p>
<p>I just did this with the $19.31 late fees <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/financial-dummy-of-the-week-award/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I stupidly acquired</a> on our water bill last month, and within minutes it was waived! 3 minutes and 4 seconds to be exact as I timed it ;) (Shout out to ZJ for reminding me to do this!!)</p>
<p><strong>Doing a &#8220;no spend&#8221; month </strong>&#8212; This was one of the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lent-time-to-give-something-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first challenges</a> I tackled as a nubile 20-something starting out my financial journey, and every month since I&#8217;ve &#8220;saved&#8221; at least $200 a month from being in more control.</p>
<p>The idea is to spend *only* on the necessities of life for a month (food, shelter, etc), and then resist from spending money on the &#8220;wants&#8221; (Starbucks, new clothes, new books, etc). Not only do you save a hefty amount for the month, but more importantly it forces you to STOP and face your embedded behaviors over the years! Where you learn quickly what triggers your desire to spend and how to curb it since you&#8217;re not allowed to for the month. And if you&#8217;re <em>really</em> smart about it, you&#8217;ll put in some barriers over this time so that when the month runs out you don&#8217;t go back to your freewheeling ways and erase all progress! Just be sure to *tell everyone* you&#8217;re on this mission so all your friends/family don&#8217;t hate you every time you have to say &#8220;no&#8221; to something ;)</p>
<p><strong>Waking up an hour+ earlier</strong> &#8212; Not a finance trick specifically, but slowing down your life and spending more quality time on yourself will definitely affect your money and mood (and confidence!) for the better. And certainly if you use this hour entirely on improving your finances every morning there&#8217;s no way for your wealth not to grow! Imagine spending a whole hour every single day on it?! For me these days though, I choose to use it for my *mental* health and guard this time pretty intensely. All other hours are dedicated to my kids or family or life/projects/yada yada but these 1-2 hours every morning are solely for ME where I sip my coffee, feed my brain (i.e. read), <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/16-good-and-bad-changes-since-my-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat my porridge</a>, and basically just reflect on life as the sun creeps up and brings about the new day. One of the best habits I&#8217;ve ever set up for myself, and I owe it entirely to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/learned-working-like-benjamin-franklin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Franklin</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to dig through my brain for more, but these are just some of the smaller things we&#8217;ve done over time to really help grow our wealth&#8230; Which may not look that impressive on their own, but combined can really pack a punch! Try one or two out over the week and see how you do!</p>
<p><strong>Any tricks you do yourself that&#8217;s worked out well too?</strong></p>

<p><em>*I included other &#8220;free&#8221; money in this account too, like birthday checks or found money on the ground, or any savings from cutting down bills over time, etc&#8230; That&#8217;s the real game changer right there &#8211; doing one-time work for <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything-total-savings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monthly passive savings</a>!</em></p>

<p>So a new <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/hire-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coaching</a> client of mine has a weekly newsletter on helpful tips for your money, and I liked her last one so much I had to steal it and share with everyone here :)</p>
<p><a href="https://boomersurvive-thriveguide.typepad.com/the_survive_and_thrive_bo/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rita&#8217;s</a> been a consumer advocate and personal finance journalist for the past 2 decades, and unlike some of us who tend to get a bit verbose with our tips (*ahem*), she&#8217;s great at condensing them into bite-sized nuggets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s her latest 10 tips &#8211; hope a few of them help!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rita R. Robison Newsletter</h2>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <a href="https://boomersurvive-thriveguide.typepad.com/the_survive_and_thrive_bo/2022/09/what-to-buy-and-not-buy-in-october.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Look for sales</a> on clothing, grills, and camping gear in October. Wait until November to buy TVs, iPhone 14s, laptops, and electronics. Get ready for the Black Friday sales by taking a look at this article on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best laptops</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#2.</strong> Save up to 50 percent off on <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/groceries-at-50-off-yes-but-its-timing-that-counts-092122.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groceries from Flashfoods</a>, an app that connects surplus food from grocery stores directly to consumers. The meat, produce, and other perishable items are near their “best-by date” and need to be picked up the same day. Some stores participating are Family Fare, BG’s, Meijer, and GIANT.</p>
<p><strong>#3.</strong> Take a look at this article on <a href="https://hermoney.com/enjoy/pulp-pantry-how-one-woman-is-minimizing-food-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to cut out food waste</a> and save money in the process.</p>
<p><strong>#4.</strong> <a href="https://boomersurvive-thriveguide.typepad.com/the_survive_and_thrive_bo/2022/09/watch-out-for-scams-if-you-want-to-donate-to-help-people-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-fiona.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch out for scams</a> if you want to donate to victims of Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p><strong>#5.</strong> Be aware when the Fed increases interest rates, like it did recently, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/17/credit-card-debt-fed-interest-rate-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rate goes up on your credit card balances</a> not just your new purchases. See the article linked for seven ways to lower your credit card debt.</p>
<p><strong>#6.</strong> Check out <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/shopping/online-shopping/605219/amazon-outlet-where-to-get-hot-and-cheap-overstock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Outlet</a>. The items are overstocks – Amazon bought too many of them – discontinued items, or clearance items. You’ll see clothing, kitchenware, home decor, electronics, and other categories discounted.</p>
<p><strong>#7.</strong> Tired of your wireless plan? Satisfaction with value <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/as-satisfaction-with-wireless-carriers-dips-are-budget-providers-overtaking-the-big-boys-092122.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile virtual network operators</a> or MVNOs, such as Boost Mobile, Consumer Cellular, and Mint, is increasing and they’re saving money for consumers. MVNOs buy minutes from the big mobile companies like T-Mobile and AT&amp;T. However, MVNOs have fewer features.</p>
<p><em>[Editor&#8217;s note: I&#8217;ve been using an MVNO for over 8 years now  &#8211; <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/republic-wireless-review-cell-phone-savings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republic Wireless</a>. Chopped down my cell bill by $100 every month adding up to over $10,000 now! From one simple move!]</em></p>
<p><strong>#8.</strong> Check out these tips for <a href="https://money.com/holiday-flight-deals-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding holiday flight deals</a> even as ticket prices spike. One is to get a ticket to fly on Monday, December 19. Flights are generally about $120 less costly that day.</p>
<p><strong>#9.</strong> Join financial blogger J. Money, of Budgets Are Sexy, and see how many of these <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/7-money-tips-from-mark-cuban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven financial tips from Mark Cuban</a> you can check off. <em>[Thx for the shout out!]</em></p>
<p><strong>#10.</strong> Read any papers carefully you’re asked sign when you take a friend or relative to live in a nursing home. Some <a href="https://boomersurvive-thriveguide.typepad.com/the_survive_and_thrive_bo/2022/09/cfpb-tells-nursing-homes-they-cant-try-to-collect-from-relatives-and-friends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facilities put illegal clauses into contracts</a> saying you’ll be on the hook for the bill. See the article linked for the stories about the troubles a daughter and a friend had.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ways-i-accidentally-save-money/" title="Ways I Accidentally Save Money&#8230;" rel="nofollow"><img width="500" height="507" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-profile.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="j. money" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-profile.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-profile-296x300.jpg 296w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-profile-493x500.jpg 493w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p><strong>&#8220;What do you put in your hair to keep it up?&#8221;</strong> &#8211; the barista asked after ordering my daily latte.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just hairspray! And then I twist to make the spikes.&#8221; &#8211; I excitedly retorted back, always up for a good chat about hair :)</p>
<p>&#8220;Awesome. I&#8217;m thinking of doing my hair like that next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;YES! You should!! You&#8217;ll save a bunch of money too as you can do it yourself.&#8221; &#8211; I replied back, which I think excited her more than the actual hair style, and rightfully so! Women&#8217;s hair is no joke to maintain. My wife drops $200-$300 every time, and she has to space it out more than she likes just so her frugal bones don&#8217;t snap in half!</p>
<p><strong>But rocking the &#8216;hawk? FREE. All you need is an electric razor, mirror, pair of scissors and the aforementioned hairspray. </strong></p>
<p>Once armed up with those you&#8217;re set for years to wow all future passersby <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Of course, I didn&#8217;t set out to save money by wearing my hair like this &#8211; I just dig it &#8211; but it&#8217;s been a nice accidental perk indeed&#8230; I reckon I&#8217;ve saved at least a couple of thousand over the past 15 years doing my hair this way, not to mention loads of time saved too since you don&#8217;t have to mess with scheduling and visiting appts every other month, etc&#8230; You just pick up the razor whenever you&#8217;re ready and knock it! Easiest hair cut ever &#8211; maybe outside of being bald ;)</p>
<p>This got me thinking of other ways I inadvertently save too, and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come up with so far&#8230; How about you?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">My clothes</h2>
<p>I feel like when your go-to outfit is jeans and a tee you&#8217;re doing pretty good, frugality wise. And minimalist-wise too, though again in both cases it&#8217;s pure accidental. The combo is just the most coziest/easiest to rock! And more often than not, you&#8217;ll find a number of holes in them too, all *earned* btw and not paid extra for, thank you very much <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also gotten better about <em>repurposing</em> old clothes I no longer wear anymore. Such as earlier this summer when I realized I needed some new shorts but didn&#8217;t have the time &#8211; or desire &#8211; to go shopping&#8230; Instead, I rummaged through the box of donations I had in my basement waiting to go out, and then <del>professionally and methodically</del> took sheers to a few pants hiding there and transformed them into shorts with a couple of snips!</p>
<p>And voila!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChFUasquFBF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66073" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/cropped-shorts.jpg" alt="cropped shorts" width="539" height="596" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/cropped-shorts.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/cropped-shorts-271x300.jpg 271w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/cropped-shorts-550x609.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/cropped-shorts-452x500.jpg 452w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></a></p>
<p>Similar to the &#8216;hawk it&#8217;s not everyone&#8217;s style, but for this homeboy it works perfectly. And now gives me <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/hack-always-have-a-back-up-plan-for-stuff-you-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an additional back up plan</a> for buying pants in the future too! &#8220;Jeans don&#8217;t fit as well as I&#8217;d hoped? Maybe they&#8217;d be better off as shorts! *Snip *snip *snip&#8230; DONE!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Food.</h2>
<p>If I could only pick one food item to survive on, it would be peanut butter. I swear, whoever invented it needs a Nobel prize as MY GAWD is it heaven&#8217;s fruit!! I would honestly pay $100 a jar if I had to for it, but thankfully inflation hasn&#8217;t strangled it just yet, so I can enjoy my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches without scaring my wallet too much.</p>
<p>And lately, I&#8217;ve been smearing it on another of nature&#8217;s dessert too for an afternoon snack: sliced apples! Not only does it rival the taste of chocolate or cookies [or enter any other types of junk food here], but it&#8217;s also HEALTHY so you get an additional jolt of feeling good about yourself on top of it! Cheap and tasty &#8211; highly recommend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChAtCk3vgSN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66077" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/apples-peanut-butter-snack.png" alt="apples &amp; peanut butter" width="551" height="578" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/apples-peanut-butter-snack.png 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/apples-peanut-butter-snack-286x300.png 286w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/apples-peanut-butter-snack-550x577.png 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/apples-peanut-butter-snack-477x500.png 477w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Transportation</h2>
<p>You know those times when friends ask &#8220;should we Uber or walk?&#8221;, well I choose walking 9 times out of 10 because walks are amazing&#8230; They also happen to cost $0.00, but the joy from fresh air and scenery tops the $$ all day every day, unless it&#8217;s pouring out or 150 degrees, in which case OK &#8211; roof over my head it is!</p>
<p>But if I could I&#8217;d use my feet to go everywhere and not even own any cars&#8230;. We do, because of kids and where we live and responsibilities blah blah blah, but even then at least we buy used. In fact, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever owned a brand new car before?! ***checks memories*** Nope! Never! Wow&#8230;</p>
<p>Now that one IS more price-based for me, but it&#8217;s also a &#8220;this thing is too shiny and I don&#8217;t want to stress out about scratching it every waking moment!&#8221; type deal. I swear when I hit that fire hydrant years ago w/ my new-to-me Lexus and dented the bumper I immediately sensed a sigh of relief&#8230; At least after making sure water wasn&#8217;t going to spray all over me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  But basically brand new things and me don&#8217;t mix well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66088" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/walking-path.jpg" alt="walking path" width="545" height="638" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/walking-path.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/walking-path-256x300.jpg 256w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/walking-path-550x644.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/walking-path-427x500.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Daily wants/entertainment</h2>
<p>And lastly, it fortunately doesn&#8217;t cost that much to keep me entertained in this world&#8230; While every now and then I do desire something that might be pricey, most of my daily &#8220;wants&#8221; are pretty cheap: trip to the coffee shop&#8230;. a new (used) book&#8230; a skate around town&#8230; a beer with my brother&#8230;</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://cointhrill.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coins I collect</a> are all &#8220;used&#8221; and look like they&#8217;ve been passed around a while! No perfect and shiny ones for me &#8211; even if they are more valuable.</p>
<p>Maybe all this makes me &#8220;simple&#8221;, I don&#8217;t know, haha, but either way I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s how I was made as the opposite would require more energy to maintain :)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Frugal reading, but not so frugal bookmark! Handy when you need one though :)]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>So lots of ways I unintentionally save! Of course, I also unintentionally <em>spend more</em> in other areas too I&#8217;m sure that may make up for it, haha, but we&#8217;ll save that list for another day :) Let&#8217;s keep today the day of winning!!</p>
<p><em><strong>What are some of the things you do that naturally saves you money? Are you the opposite of me with any of these above?<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to embrace such natural frugalness&#8230; Temptation kills us in so many other areas of life &#8211; gotta be thankful for the stuff it can&#8217;t touch!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll go first&#8230;</p>
<p>From The Man himself, <strong><em>Mark Cuban</em></strong>:</p>
<h2>#1. Live like a student</h2>
<p>Nope! I used to live like a student, but that was more out of necessity than desire lol&#8230;  I will say though that this mentality IS a good one to try and mimic though, at least in spirit, as <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lifestyle-creep-isnt-that-kind-of-the-point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifestyle inflation</a> is real and if you keep spending all the new money you earn you might as well still be a broke college student!</p>
<p>So a hearty yes to channeling this, but no to giving myself a point here as I def. live more lavishly than my 19 y/o self could ever stomach ;) That guy would never spend $6.00 on a latte!</p>
<h2>#2. Don&#8217;t use credit cards</h2>
<p>FAIL. We use one main &#8220;house&#8221; card for all bills to rack up cashback and keep things streamlined, <em>but</em> we also pay it off at the end of every month because we don&#8217;t like lighting our cash on fire&#8230; If you struggle with that 2nd part though, then a hell yes to whipping out those scissors and chopping them up!! The c/c perks will never outperform the loss of fees and stress from debt! Better to just avoid it altogether than play the devil&#8217;s game if you don&#8217;t trust yourself enough. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>(And as much as I don&#8217;t want to admit it, I&#8217;m 99% sure we overspend using plastic vs cash too&#8230; It&#8217;s a &#8220;convenience&#8221; fee I&#8217;m willing to pay though after decades of hustling ;))</p>
<h2>#3. Save 6 months income</h2>
<p>Next Level Activated! 3-6 months banked does wonders to your peace, and honestly even if you can just pull off ONE MONTH of savings it&#8217;s game changing..  And the beauty is that once you hit whatever level you&#8217;re going for, you don&#8217;t have to add any more to it and can divert all future $$$ elsewhere to more exciting things!! Like Pokémon and NFTs! ;)</p>
<p>And remember too, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/each-dollar-serves-a-purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not every dollar needs to be maximized</a>. Even though it looks like the money is just sitting there &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; and not earning anything, it&#8217;s still serving the magnificent purpose of giving you INNER PEACE. And I know a lot of people who would pay good money for that, so soak in as much of it as you can!</p>
<h2>#4. Put savings into SPX mutual fund</h2>
<p>YUP!!! Well, technically we&#8217;re invested in Vanguard&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/say-hello-to-vanguards-newest-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VTSAX</a> which tracks the TOTAL MARKET and not just the S&amp;P 500 stocks which is what SPX does (or VFIAX &#8211; another popular fund from Vanguard), but it&#8217;s all a similar concept. You&#8217;re betting on a giant portfolio of hundreds/thousands of stocks instead of trying your hand at picking out individual ones which is very (very) hard to do well, especially long-term. And a bonus perk &#8211; you can just set it and forget it! <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A lazy man&#8217;s dream</a>!</p>
<h2>#5. Invest a % of money into high risk</h2>
<p>Score here too! Always smart to have a &#8220;long shot&#8221; going on the side, though I can&#8217;t say it helps too well with that whole &#8220;inner peace&#8221; stuff as it&#8217;s amazing how much MENTAL bandwidth it can take up for being such a small sliver of your net worth, lol&#8230; You give me .0001 bitcoins and it&#8217;s all I can think about for the next year even though it&#8217;s so insignificant! So hopefully your brains work much better at keeping the overall perspective than mine, or at least betting on things that aren&#8217;t in the news 24/7 :)</p>
<p>I would also put starting your own business, or buying up other small businesses, in this department too btw&#8230; Stuff that has a higher rate of failure, but also a higher rate of rewards when they succeed! And notice Mark didn&#8217;t put a specific % amount there either, which I like since our risk tolerances are all different&#8230; Though typically you&#8217;ll see recommendations anywhere from 5%-10% of your overall net worth to play with which I tend to agree as a good starting point.</p>
<h2>#6. Buy consumables in bulk</h2>
<p>FAIL. This is kind of embarrassing as it&#8217;s such a core tenant of frugality &#8211; especially for a money blogger (!) &#8211; but for whatever reason we just don&#8217;t do much of it&#8230; Or I should say, my wife doesn&#8217;t do much of it, and ain&#8217;t no way I&#8217;m going to pipe up and ask her why to then have the task transferred over to me, haha&#8230; I let her run the show there, and I run the show here with our finances!</p>
<p>But yes. More bulk = more sex&#8230;y. So good on all you Costco and Sam&#8217;s Club shoppers banking those savings around the world&#8230; At least I think Costco is around the world?! (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I googled</a>: &#8220;Costco has 833 warehouses worldwide: 574 in the United States, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 31 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one in Iceland.&#8221;)</p>
<h2>#7. Negotiate with cash</h2>
<p>Do yard sales count? &#8216;Cuz if so I&#8217;m an undefeated champ there &#8211; BOOM! But can&#8217;t say I do much negotiating outside of that&#8230; Except for house buying times, but even then we always end up choosing <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/15-vs-30-year-mortgage-debate-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mortgage route</a> than cash money for ultimate flexibility&#8230; Not that we usually *have* the cash to pony up most times anyways, haha&#8230; do you know how expensive homes are these days??! It&#8217;s insane!</p>
<p>But overall, yeah &#8211; anything that tips your hands in negotiations is great, and if you have the cash to back up that fast-talking mouth of yours then you go with your bad self. Not many things feel better than pulling off a good deal!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>

<p>And those are his 7 tips!</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see here&#8230; Out of the 7 recommended it looks like I can confidently check off at least 3 of them, and then maybe partially 1 or 2 others.</p>
<p><strong>So I&#8217;m going to give myself a solid <span style="color: #339966;">4</span> out of <span style="color: #339966;">7</span> here which means I&#8217;m definitely no Mark Cuban, but something tells me Mark Cuban isn&#8217;t Mark Cuban either ;)</strong></p>
<p>No way he doesn&#8217;t use a credit card these days or leverage his millions of billions of dollars to strike deals&#8230; I&#8217;m sure he buys in bulk and lives like a college student at least in his mind, but obviously these tips are geared more for the general public than an entrepreneurial rock star like himself.</p>
<p>Still, a fun checklist to go down and always good to at least *consciously* be choosing to take one path or the other than living financially oblivious! So see how many you can check off too, and then share below so we can compare!</p>
<p>Your financially conscious friend,</p>
