<p>Just had a randomly refreshing chat with a fellow coffee shop goer, and as things tend to go we ventured into finances and the words that came out of his mouth were outstanding, lol&#8230; So much so I had to stop him mid-sentence a couple of times to make sure I got his phrases right! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here were some of the highlights from our convo, in *his own words* as best as I can remember&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h3>&#8220;I would rather play chicken with my bills than with my savings&#8221;</h3>
<p>Instead of spending on &#8220;wants&#8221; first like I&#8217;ve done all my life, I flipped it around and now SAVE first and pay bills second. Then if there happens to be anything left over, I use that to buy any &#8220;extras&#8221; I might want.</p>
<p>I went from not being able to save $1,000 and a credit score of 580, to having over $13,000 in the bank and a score of 730 within one year!</p>
<p>There were a handful of things that led to this, but it was mainly <em>re-ordering my priorities</em> and paying myself first that got me going in the right direction.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system of managing my cash flow&#8221;</h3>
<p>Another reason I was able to save so much this year was because I drastically changed my management system. Instead of having everything in 1-2 accounts, I&#8217;ve gone to a more &#8220;spatial&#8221; system.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is I spread my accounts across multiple banks that all serve a specific purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have one account for my short-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my long-term savings</li>
<li>One account for my bills</li>
<li>And then one account for my spending/wants.</li>
</ol>
<p>My business banking looks similar: one account for savings, one account for bills, and another account for taxes (I pay quarterly). It&#8217;s a lot to manage, but it&#8217;s brought so much peace and savings.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I threw away my debit cards&#8221;</h3>
<p>The first thing I did when I started re-arranging everything was to move all my savings into a brick and mortar bank that had no online access. This way the only way I could access my money was by going there in person. I did get debit cards, but I immediately cut them up and threw them away.</p>
<p>This has immensely strengthened my discipline, and partly why I was able to go from $1,000 to $13,000 so fast. It took me over 30 years to save my first $10,000 and now the hardest part is over!</p>
<h3>&#8220;I spend a lot of money looking for women&#8221;</h3>
<p>Over the course of 3-4 years I&#8217;ve spent $40,000+ looking for love, or about $1,200/mo.</p>
<p>Part of that goes to dating apps like eHarmony (which I initially balked at as it cost me $300!), but most of it comes from just doing my best to be &#8220;visible.&#8221; So lots of eating out and hanging with friends, visiting bars/community events/etc. You have to put yourself out there if you truly want to meet people.</p>
<p>I initially felt bad about spending all this money with no savings in the bank, but later I realized I was prioritizing what I wanted and I became okay with it. Now I could have been more *efficient* with the way I went about it, but I am proud to say it worked out in the end and I will be getting married at the end of this month! Ironically, to a woman I found on eHarmony!!</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This was the most interesting part of the whole conversation, haha&#8230; As someone who met their partner years before online dating and apps came around, I&#8217;m always fascinated by the mixture of tech and love. And really how much dating seems to cost in general??! And I&#8217;ve surely never met anyone who has TRACKED IT ALL, lol&#8230; Probably exactly what I would do if ever back in that situation <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-68221 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/serial-killer-dating-gif.gif" alt="dating gif" width="328" height="328" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>So basically, yeah &#8211; most stuff we&#8217;ve heard before, but in much more entertaining ways ;)</p>
<p><strong>1) Save first, spend later</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Build a system that works for you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Make yourself more &#8220;visible&#8221; when you want something. </strong>Whether it be love, business, career, you name it. If you&#8217;re not putting yourself into the position to *receive,* you&#8217;re limiting yourself! Nothing great has happened sitting on your couch &#8211; you have to put yourself out there and tell the world what you are looking for!</p>
<p>(This is exactly, btw, why I choose to do my projects out of coffee shops. I never know who I&#8217;ll run into or what type of magic might happen! And surely this blog post would have never been created, so who knows what you would be reading right now??! Lolol&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>At any rate, all good things to think about as we head into the new year here :) </strong> Will you consciously place yourself in situations which allow you to get closer to your goals or farther away from them? Are your management systems still serving you okay, or is it time to blow them up and start from scratch? Where will you be putting that first dollar from your next paycheck? If it isn&#8217;t to YOU, you need to re-read this whole blog post! ;)</p>
<p>Your F.G.A. (Financial Guardian Angel),</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>I just wanted to take the time to thank you for the free template that I found on YouTube.</p>
<p>I think this will get me to value money a lot more and I really like how you used &#8220;sexy income&#8221; because I think it&#8217;s a great mindset shift to make when valuing money and finance.</p>
<p>Thanks again. I&#8217;m really looking forward to using this everyday! I think I might add-on a daily log of my expenses and also even enter notes as to why I decided to take on that expense.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>David</p></blockquote>
<p>Love it!</p>
<p>And as you can see from the snapshot up top <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budget-are-sexy-financial-snapshot-spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spreadsheet</a> is nothing fancy, but boy &#8211; look at all that color!! Literally and figuratively! Lol..</p>
<p>I remember seeing a similar one 15 years ago before I even started this blog and wow did it make all the difference in the world to me. Again, not because it was set up differently or better or anything, but just because it was so bold and happy and *inspiring* looking! It taught me you don&#8217;t always have to stick with the tried and true (and boring!) with this stuff. It&#8217;s fine and it&#8217;ll work, but you&#8217;ll have a MUCH better chance sticking with it if you have some fun along the way :)</p>
<p>And how cool this guy wants to take it a step further and add in expense logs* to it?! It&#8217;s all about adapting it to your <em>own</em> needs for better motivation&#8230; In fact, this entire spreadsheet was built out of that same one I found all those years ago, just tweaked more to my liking with the colorful words and addition of a built-in net worth tracker! Which was the element that REALLY kept me going year after year, until I eventually just focused on that part only and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/is-net-worth-tracking-the-new-budgeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got rid of my budget</a> altogether <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>At any rate, you can check out this spreadsheet, and download it (for free), below if you&#8217;re looking for a new one&#8230; I always recommend *manually* tracking your finances for at least 3 months until you get a good sense of it all before moving to more automation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budgets/j_budget_template.xls" rel="noopener">J&#8217;s Financial Snapshot Spreadsheet</a></p>
<p>And be sure to tweak it away! There are no rules with this stuff &#8211; it&#8217;s your world, baby!! Do what you need to do to stay motivated <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44a.png" alt="👊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64642" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-signature.jpg" alt="j. money signature" width="186" height="75" /></p>
<p>*The expense logging reminded me of another idea: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/cool-idea-adding-life-events-to-your-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding notes to your net worth timeline</a>! Here&#8217;s what mine looked like back in April of 2019 &#8211; it&#8217;s an interesting exercise to go down :)</p>
<p><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/cool-idea-adding-life-events-to-your-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-60447 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/net-worth-with-life-events.jpg" alt="net worth with life events" width="600" height="253" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/net-worth-with-life-events.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/net-worth-with-life-events-300x127.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>And here some other juicy extras you can track in your spreadsheet as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your FI date</li>
<li>Your credit score</li>
<li>Your <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/what-is-your-debt-to-income-ratio-dti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debt-to-income ratio</a></li>
<li>Your <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/total-lifetime-earnings-wealth-ratio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifetime Wealth Ratio<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> (Net Worth ÷ Total Lifetime Income Earned!)</li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-spreadsheet-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Net Worth forecasts</a></li>
<li>And my personal favorite –&gt; <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-you-can-retire-spreadsheet-and-when-youre-going-to-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the years left until your expected death</a> ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy tracking!!</p>

<p><strong>I hope you&#8217;re in search of some eye candy today as I&#8217;m serving it up hot! ;)</strong></p>
<p>Stumbled across a bunch of ridiculously silly, yet somewhat helpful!, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/jmoney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a> we created for All-Star Money last year, and thought you might enjoy the change from my novels here lately&#8230;</p>
<p>These came about from pouring over 200 articles a day in the space, and then plucking out my favorites and doing a little skit around them. Which <em>looks</em> like they may have only taken about 17 minutes to produce, but oh no! These puppies took around 10 hours total EACH by the time we concepted them, wrote out the script, set up the camera (aka phone), did all that glorious (ly bad) acting, and then finally edited and compiled everything together (shout out to <a href="https://www.harryhunckenphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry</a> and <a href="https://www.zacktaylor.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zach</a> for taking on that role!).</p>
<p>My respect levels to all vloggers went up immensely after doing this, I&#8217;ll tell you what&#8230; And as you can imagine, it didn&#8217;t last long until we cut these from the schedule, haha&#8230; But not before we were left with a dozen or so gems to forever appreciate! Along with an <em>insane</em> amount of learning experience!</p>
<p><strong>Here were some of the more nugget-rich skits we put together, each with its own fun spin to it:</strong></p>

<p>As silly as some of these are though, I really am pretty proud of them. Especially for this being my first real foray into making videos! I’m certainly under no illusion of becoming a YouTube star anytime soon, haha, but I&#8217;d def. give it another go if anyone ever wants to employ me ;)</p>
<p>But you check them out and let me know what you think&#8230;. And if you&#8217;re a fan, be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/jmoney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow my YouTube channel</a> so you get alerted of any new stuff I create down the line!</p>
<p><strong>Oh, I&#8217;ll also drop some fun Q&amp;As at the end too we did earlier this year.</strong> Where people from the community shot over questions for me and I answered them via video (which was a LOT faster and easier to do! I think that took me approximately 30 minutes total, lol&#8230;)</p>
<p>Some of these questions are also pretty random (like my go-to choice in nail polish, or if I&#8217;d rather go into war with one horse-sized Chihuahua or 100 Chihuahua-sized horses?!), but there were were some good life and money pondering Qs too. As well as a clip where I read off <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ps-we-all-struggle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best hate mail</a> I&#8217;ve gotten over the years which I DIE laughing at every time cuz they&#8217;re so horrible!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m Bringing Budgets Back.&#8221; t-shirts are now available after 10 years<br />
of being sold out!! ZOMG!!!</strong></p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/im-bringing-budgets-back-t-shirt-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuting in 2012</a>, I had completely forgotten about them until I saw an old friend rocking one on a recent podcast and immediately knew we had to bring them back in celebration of <i>literally</i> bringing back the blog itself <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="😁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ordinarytimemag/status/1523762157300690944" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-65295" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budgets-t-shirt-sighting.jpg" alt="budgets t-shirt sighting" width="633" height="356" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budgets-t-shirt-sighting.jpg 800w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budgets-t-shirt-sighting-300x169.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budgets-t-shirt-sighting-768x432.jpg 768w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budgets-t-shirt-sighting-550x309.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></p>

<p>I quickly tapped Dave from <a href="https://accidentalfire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accidental FIRE</a> known for his fine line of <a href="https://accidentalfire.com/fire-lifestyle-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIRE merch</a>, and within days we had the original design uploaded to Amazon and ready to go, along with a couple of newer designs I just had to slip in to expand the fun :)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I’m Bringing Budgets Back.&#8221;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Mother Budgeter.&#8221;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I Like Big Budgets And Cannot Lie.&#8221;</h3>
<p>So <a href="https://amzn.to/3mxrYnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 styles to choose from</a>, in all different shapes and sizes and colors &#8211; all ready to please any fine appreciator of prudent financial management up in here ;)</p>
<p>And we’ve kept the prices as low as it can possibly go too, with only making a buck or two profit which I’ll be stashing into a <em><strong>Community Fund</strong></em> for later, so it all should relatively fit well within your *ahem* budget. Or even make for a nice gift to a fiscal friend of yours! (Or subtle nudge to them! Lol&#8230;)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Check &#8217;em!</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>*** <a href="https://amzn.to/3mxrYnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CHECK THEM OUT!</a> ***</strong></p>
<p>Big thanks again to <a href="https://accidentalfire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave</a> for partnering up with me on these and getting &#8217;em out the door in lightning speed… I get pretty particular with my ideas, so he also wins the Patience Award for putting up with me throughout the process too &#8211; thanks dude ;)</p>
<p>If you’d like to see any other designs or sayings we’ve said over the years here, or even any good ones of your own!, pass them over and we’ll add them to the Ideas List for the next run! Ironically I just realized we don’t even have a <em><strong>“Budgets Are Sexy”</strong> </em>design in here yet (oops), so that will have to go to the top of the list for sure&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>AND I WANT PICS OF YOU ROCKING THESE, PLEASE!</strong><em><strong><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>We’ll make a Hall of Fame page here or something so we can show off how sexy you are :) With bonus points for flashing them in public just to make sure everyone can see how important these sayings are!! Haha&#8230; Wear &#8217;em loud and proud, baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here’s the Amazon page again →</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3mxrYnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budgets Are Sexy Store</a></p>
<p>See you back soon! And thanks for all the kind words and wishes all week long! The best welcoming a blogger can get coming out of retirement ;) I appreciate each and everyone of you so much &#8211; thank you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64c.png" alt="🙌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

Woohoo!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After stacking about 15 into my shopping cart, I took a celebratory photo and sent it to my wife… She was very proud, having taught me most of the deal-hunting tricks I use today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but I think </span><b>being frugal is a cool thing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s something we should celebrate more and share more with the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s some cool stuff you may not know about why being frugal is awesome…</span></p>
<h2><strong>Being Frugal Makes You More “Attractive” <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f618.png" alt="😘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/92-percent-of-americans-consider-frugality-an-attractive-quality-according-to-new-survey-findings-from-slickdeals-300669928.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey done by Slickdeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a couple years ago, </span><b>92% of Americans consider frugality an attractive quality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a partner or potential partner. 92%, yo!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, 79% of people think it’s “perfectly acceptable&#8221; to use a coupon on a first date! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Woohoo! Keep on clippin’, you handsome couponers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also talks about the difference between being “frugal” and being “cheap”&#8230; While frugality is a turn-on, being cheap is a turn-off!</span></p>
<p><b>Being frugal: </b></p>
<ul>

<h2><strong>Frugal Habits = Comfortable (and Earlier) Retirement</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Personal Capital released a survey to find out “</span><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/what-does-it-mean-to-be-frugal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have Americans Become More Frugal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”? The short answer is YES! And for good reason…</span></p>
<p><b>Here are the key survey takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90.4% of respondents claim to have “frugal habits”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The No. 1 reason they adopt frugal habits is “to save for future investments”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those who have adopted frugal habits, 50.7% are now considering early retirement!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow. “Early” retirement is one the rise! It’s not just a pipe dream – more and more people are getting their financial lives together, using frugality as a cornerstone.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Mindful Spending Means More Value For Dollars</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine Joe and Steve each have $100 to spend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe buys tickets to a ball game ($50), hot dogs ($20) and some items at the stadium gift shop ($30) on the way out. In all, Joe spends $100 to experience a ball game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve is more mindful with spending… He buys tickets to the same ball game ($50), but eats food at home beforehand ($0) and doesn’t buy souvenirs ($0). Then, the following weekend, Steve buys tickets to another entire ball game ($50).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both friends spend the full $100, but Steve’s frugal habits allow him to experience 2 ball games where Joe can only experience 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spending less </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on things that don’t provide long-lasting value means you can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on things that do provide you value.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Frugal Humans Help the Environment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30e.png" alt="🌎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you buy less “stuff,” humans manufacture less “stuff.” When humans manufacture less, we use less of the Earth&#8217;s dwindling natural resources. Quite simply, really.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that humans use more natural resources each year than the Earth can actually generate within the year? Doesn’t take a genius to figure out that this is not sustainable, and one day, all the resources will be GONE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a frugal mind-set and lifestyle can help reduce your environmental footprint. Living in excess and consuming more than you need is the opposite. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f645.png" alt="🙅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h2><strong>DIY Projects Increase Your Resourcefulness</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can grow things yourself, make things yourself, and fix things yourself… you are less dependent on others. And isn’t that what we are all kind of shooting for — independence?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not talking about doing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yourself in life. There is a balance between DIY and outsourcing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But frugal people understand that the more problems they can solve with their own two hands makes them more resourceful and gives them more options and control.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Frugality Improves Social Connections</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes people are afraid to admit they are frugal… They’re worried others might shun them or cut them out of future invitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’ve experienced the opposite! The more open I am about my lifestyle, the more people I seem to connect with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s refreshing when other people admit they are trying to save money, get a good deal or waste less. Frugality actually brings people together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of being frugal is sharing, swapping, giving and receiving. All these activities improve social relationships. Think about Buy Nothing groups, co-op organizations, and even potluck meals. Sharing is caring!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you reckon? Do you think being frugal is cool? Or is my vision warped? (Could also be the cheap sunglasses I’m wearing, which I got for a bargain. Just sayin’ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you all an awesome Friday and great Super Bowl weekend!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning, money friends! Hope you had an awesome Christmas weekend!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today I’m gonna run through a quick overview of my annual and monthly budgeting process. It’s super simple and doesn’t take me much time — about an hour at the start of every year and 20-30 mins each month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe this will help some of you in your 2022 planning (or maybe you’ve already got a solid budget process nailed down? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). Either way, it never hurts to see how others do things and maybe borrow some tips/tricks to incorporate into your system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of this post, I’ve included a few budgeting tricks I use to save time, keep it fun, and make sure I stay consistent!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**And for those of you who really want to make budgeting SEXY… check out this old gem we published way back in the day… </span></i><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/introducing-strip-budgeting/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing </span></i><b><i>Strip Budgeting</i></b></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As J. Money would say&#8230; “Hubba hubba!” <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="😍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />**</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Start With a High-Level Budgeting Process</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like to think about budgeting as 3 separate activities that happen throughout the year:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>PREVIEW:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (annual, takes me about 1 hour) At the start of each year, I envision all my expenses and things I want to spend money on. The total $ is my annual budget.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>REVIEW:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (happens monthly, takes about 20-30 mins/mo) At the end of each month, I review our spending, compare it to the budget, and check to see if  things are on track.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>COURSE CORRECTIONS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (as needed along the way) Throughout the year, life changes. So I make modifications to either my numbers or my spending habits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t currently have a budget or are looking for a new template, here are a bunch of </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/free-budget-templates-sites/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free budget templates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and spreadsheets. Or, here is </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r7dEqK-McNoCvi6CG1ndcGqbjPAE2pArRhghz26SF3A/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the simple one I use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nothing fancy, I just created it in Google Docs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, here are my annual and monthly activities broken down:</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Set an Annual Budget (Your Year in Preview)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of each year, I try to set an annual budget number. This is a forecast of approximately how much my wife and I plan to spend in the upcoming year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have about 20 spending categories, and each one gets its own assigned budget. My basic template looks like this:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64377 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1-sample-blank-budget-e1640572900860.png" alt="" width="393" height="230" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I forecast all our </span><b>fixed expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These are the things I already know the exact cost of… Like rent, insurance, car registration, internet and phone, etc.  Since I already know how much they&#8217;ll cost, I just stick those numbers straight into the budget. Easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, I look at all my </span><b>variable expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These are things that can be high or low depending on the month. The best way I’ve found to forecast variable expenses is to look at how much I spent in total </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the prior year</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, I adjust a bit for inflation, or upcoming life changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in 2021, I spent $7,015 on groceries. Some months were low (in March we spent $331) and some were really high (July we spent $1,027). Since I can’t predict which will be the high and low months next year, I really only care about the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">average and total</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>As for inflation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if I were to buy the exact same groceries next year as I did last year, they might cost me ~5%+ more. So Instead of forecasting $7k for next year, maybe I want to make it $7,500 to be more realistic.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>As for life changes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, my wife and I might </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/our-foster-to-adoption-journey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a kiddo or two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next year&#8230; so maybe I want to add another $1k to cover them for food, too?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, you get the point… after thinking ahead a little bit, I assign an annual budget number for each category, and divide that by 12 for the monthly number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lasty, I try to plan for </span><b>large, isolated expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the upcoming year. I assign numbers to these based on how much I think they might cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, here are some isolated events that I need to budget for in 2022…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weddings: I’m invited to 3 weddings next year, and in one I’ll be a groomsman. So, I’m going to add a $2,000 budget line item for “weddings” to cover gifts and travel. Since I won’t have this expense every year, I keep it separate from my regular annual travel/gifts categories.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New (used) car: My wife and I might buy a minivan next year. Maybe I’ll add $20,000 as a budget placeholder. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Or maybe we’ll just make our kids suffer in the Prius – haven’t decided yet. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s numbers are different. Everybody’s life goals are different. It behooves you to make your budget as custom as possible to YOUR life, income level, and desires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful budget is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more about</span><b> knowing yourself </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">than it is about the actual numbers. If you build a budget based on what everyone else does, a) you won&#8217;t have any fun, and b) you’ll be living </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life goals, not yours!</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Do Budgeting Every Month (Month in Review)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After our annual budget is set, I do monthly check-ins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I use Mint.com to track all transactions. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I highly recommend others check out </span></i><a href="https://mint.intuit.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mint</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/personal-capital-review/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Capital</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/you-need-a-budget-ynab-review/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">YNAB</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or any automated software that tracks transactions.)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I download all our transactions from Mint and sort them by category. Then I total the categories and stick them in my budget spreadsheet. Each month has its own column in the sheet. Looks like this:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64376 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/3.-Monthly-budget-e1640572892187.png" alt="" width="600" height="212" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, I’m not really concerned about small variances in our spending vs. budget numbers. (We are not on a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tight</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> budget.) What does concern me, however, is a </span><b>trend of overspending.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I like having all of my numbers side by side in a budget spreadsheet. At a glance, I can quickly tell if we are slipping into bad spending habits that need correction.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Adjust Your Budget (Mid-Year Course Corrections)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unrealistic to think that we’ll spend exactly what we budgeted for every month and year. Budgets aren’t exact. </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/budget-unplanned-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They need wiggle room</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few adjustments and things my wife and I do mid-year…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, if we </span><b>under</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend consistently, this is AWESOME! It means we accidentally budgeted too much. Underspending in one category can sometimes cancel out overspending in another category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we notice consistent </span><b>overspending</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a category, before trying to correct it, we ask ourselves these 2 questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Is this spending in line with our values in life?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (My wife and I are trying our best to do </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/value-based-budgeting-more-happiness-for-your-dollars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">values based budgeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>If overspending continues, will it majorly derail our life goals or financial plans?</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we are overspending on stupid crap that doesn’t add value to our life, we try to cut it out ASAP. This requires being more mindful during the following months, checking in with each other more regularly, and perhaps even starting a savings challenge of some sort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if we are overspending on things that DO provide us a lot of value (and it’s not majorly derailing our wealth-building journey) we allow it to continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, I mentioned we spent ~$7k in groceries this year (but we only budgeted for $6k). I realized we were going to blow this budget a few months ago, so my wife and I sat down to discuss it&#8230; We agreed that groceries and food is what we LOVE spending our money on. (We host a lot and enjoy buying premium ingredients for special occasions). In this case, we agreed overspending was OK to continue, instead of switching to beans and rice for the rest of the year to cut costs.</span></p>
<p><b>To compensate for overspending,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we try these types of things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce spending in a different category. For example, we might cut back on mid-week drinking for a month or two. This could save us a few hundred dollars, and we could put that toward the overspend on groceries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick up a temporary </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustles-couples/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">side hustle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cover some costs. This year when Cooper had ~$400 in vet bills, I was able to cover those unexpected costs with additional contract hours at work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a last resort, we break into our emergency fund or pull from investments. We really haven’t ever had to do this, but it could happen if we hit large unplanned expenses (like our car completely dying or a medical emergency).</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Automation, Saving Time, and Keeping Budgeting FUN</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main objections I hear about budgeting is, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just don’t have the time!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe some of these things will help:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate your expense tracking! Sign up for Mint, Personal Capital or use your bank’s online app to categorize your transactions. It saves manual tracking.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit your cash transactions. Since you have to track cash purchases manually, instead try Venmo or PayPal, which can be tracked via automation software.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Round things to the nearest hundred dollars. Instead of calculating every single cent, try rounding numbers to save time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit how many categories you have. For example, I used to track hotels,flights, airport food, and Ubers all in separate categories&#8230; But that took too much time, so now I stuff all that type of spending into a single “travel” category. Much faster, and arguably the same thing!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget consistently. The more you do it, the faster you’ll get at it!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, you can make your budgeting process as complex or simple as you would like. Do yourself a favor and choose the latter. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for keeping things FUN, try some of these hacks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up monthly rewards for when you beat your budget in certain categories. Having a reward system will keep things enjoyable and make you want to track progress.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget over a date night (for couples). You don’t need to be hunched over a computer while budgeting… Get out of the house and have discussions while you walk, exercise, or over a delicious meal somewhere.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create colorful and engaging charts to attack debt, track savings goals and chart progress. Check out these </span><a href="https://thesavvycouple.com/budget-printables/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free budget printables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can woo your partner with a nerdy powerpoint presentation, </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/a-financial-powerpoint-presentation-that-screams-i-love-you/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like this guy does each year ;)</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes just calling it “budgeting” can set a negative tone. Sometimes when I want to talk about spending with my wife, I just say, “Babe!&#8230; I just reviewed our spending and let me tell you all the ways we kicked ass this past month!” This is how we have budgeting conversations without actually having budgeting conversations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier I mentioned </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/introducing-strip-budgeting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strip Budgeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">… I was kind of kidding… but maybe it’s worth trying anyway? Haha!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whelp, thanks for reading this long-ass post on my budgeting process. Hopefully you got something out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever your budget process is, I truly hope you are set up for success in 2022. Please let me know if you need any help, have any questions, or just want to geek out on spreadsheets. Personal finance isn’t just my job, I genuinely enjoy helping others save money, make money, and live more intentionally. Let’s chat!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a great last week of the year!!!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Joel, thanks for the nice stories and happy emails but please </span></i><b><i>give us some content that’s actually worthwhile in terms of making and saving money.”</i></b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ooops … I guess I’ve been a little sidetracked with random stories on the blog. I figured that most regular Budgets readers already know the basic “how to” stuff. But now that I think about it, maybe getting back to money basics is necessary sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, here’s a quick-and-dirty brain dump of money advice all in one post. This is the stuff I wish I had been told when I was younger. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Actually, maybe I *was* told this stuff when I was younger &#8211; I just was too dumb to listen at the time. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s split into three sections: making money, saving money, and investing money.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Make More Money</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to increase your income, do some (or try all) of these things &#8212; presented in no particular order:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Start a side hustle. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ways-to-make-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80+ side hustles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> listed in detail. Most require no money to start and little experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ask for a raise. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Careful here &#8212; you mostly deserve a raise if you are doing more work or providing more value than what you originally signed up for. If you’re giving your employer excess value, you are worth more. Create a win/win scenario. (Listen to these 2 ChooseFI podcast episodes: </span><a href="https://www.choosefi.com/how-to-negotiate-salary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ep.221 How to negotiate salary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.choosefi.com/negotiate-your-salary-with-tori-dunlap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ep.147 Negotiating salary with Tori Dunlap</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Change jobs or careers. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your current workplace doesn’t value you, another one might. NOW is a great time to explore opportunities! It’s never too late to change career paths and find a more lucrative industry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sell stuff around your house. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">OfferUp, Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are good places to start. You can also find free stuff on these same apps and resell them for a 100% profit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Rent out your stuff. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People pay for the most random things to rent. List your unused equipment/space/car/stuff online to see who wants it. Here’s a list of about 40 websites to </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/rent-your-stuff-for-extra-cash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list and rent out stuff for quick cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sign up for bank and credit card promotions. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finance companies will PAY YOU to try their services and meet certain transaction criteria. Some of these transactions you are doing anyway, so you may as well get paid for it. Personally I make about $2k per year from </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/churning-bank-accounts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bank account churning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you can handle credit and have excellent attention to detail, try </span><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/best-current-credit-card-sign-bonuses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit card churning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Start a business.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> My friend Alan Donegan co-founded the </span><a href="https://therebelschool.com/ondemand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebel Business School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a FREE resource with on-demand videos, blogs and podcasts full of practical information to help get your business idea up and running.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create art for the world.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Build, draw, type, sing, photograph, cook, repair, perform, teach, or do whatever you can dream up. Chances are you have a talent that many others don’t have. Figure out what it is, pursue it with passion, and monetize it. Here are a 41 other <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/make-money-fast-500-dollars/">ways to make money fast</a>!</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build financial independence, your income MUST be higher than your spending. The more you earn, the faster you can achieve independence.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Save More Money</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving money sometimes feels easier than increasing your income. But be careful not to reduce your expenses to the point where you’re not enjoying life!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, in no particular order, these things will reduce your cost of living:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aggressively</strong><b> pay down consumer debts.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having high interest loans is like running up an escalator that is cycling downwards. You need to </span><a href="https://financialbestlife.com/pay-off-debt-quickly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crush high interest debt ASAP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as it’s one of the biggest prohibitors in wealth-building.</span></li>
<li><strong>Get</strong><b> rid of unused vehicles.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cars/motorbikes/boats are silent money thieves. Even when they’re not in use, they erode your savings. I’m not saying to never drive or own a car… Just saying that it’s most people’s No. 1 money pit, so it’s worthwhile evaluating your vehicle situation.</span></li>
<li><b>Track your spending and challenge EVERYTHING. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For everything you buy, ask yourself these 2 questions:  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Do I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really need</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this?  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) <em>If yes, where can I buy it cheaper?    </em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(J. Money did this for years and wrote several posts about the money he saved. It’s all here on this page [</span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenge Everything</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">] as well as hundreds of reader comments and helpful examples. Tiny savings across many categories can add up to huge amounts.) One of the quickest ways to save money is getting a <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/best-alternatives-to-cable-tv/">cheaper alternative to Cable TV</a> and &#8220;cutting the cord&#8221;!</span></li>
<li><b>Use coupons</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, promotions, and bundled discounts where available. Most </span><a href="https://www.pennypinchinmom.com/the-7-best-stores-to-use-coupons/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grocery stores have a mobile app that has digital coupons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Every time I go to Vons, I use the $5 OFF coupon, which gives me instant savings for 10 seconds of work.</span></li>
<li><b>Do chores yourself.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cut your own hair. Clean your own house. Wash your own clothes. If you have the skills and time to do something yourself, do it yourself and save the cash.</span></li>
<li><b>Learn to cook.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Restaurants charge an average of ~300% markup for prepared food compared with the cost of ingredients. You can save money by purchasing groceries and cooking meals yourself. This includes packing your own lunches for work. It’s easier than you think, not to mention healthier.</span></li>
<li><b>Rent instead of buy.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Remember those websites to </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rent your stuff out online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Well you can use them to rent other people’s things occasionally instead of buying stuff. Instead of buying a $400 snowboard that you only use twice, rent one for $30 each time you go.</span></li>
<li><b>Move homes. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a lengthy commute to your workplace, consider moving closer to where you work and reducing transport costs.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you work remotely full-time, you could move to a lower cost of living area without harming your job status.<br />
</span></li>
<li><b>Learn to negotiate.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the most valuable skills in saving money is negotiation. Sometimes even just asking the awkward question “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have any discounts available?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” opens negotiations you wouldn’t have known about otherwise.</span></li>
<li><b>Travel like a local.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vacationing in your own city/state can be just as fun as luxurious destinations. But if you do decide to travel to faraway places, try to spend money like a local person would. Eat where locals eat, use public transportation, avoid tourist traps, etc.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing your cost of living not only increases your savings rate and shortens your FI timeline, it also lowers the amount of money you actually need to save for retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK&#8230; so you’re maximizing your income and reducing your costs… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now what do you do with the money you are saving?</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>How to Invest Your Money</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing isn’t optional. It is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your money will compound over time and ideally transform your retirement nest egg into a passive income stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone invests differently because of their knowledge, experience, and opportunities. I’ll focus on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplest and most proven investing methods</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most people can use to fast-track financial independence.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>First, increase your knowledge. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about investing for beginners and the FIRE movement. Read these 3 books: </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3muSe1x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Simple Path To Wealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3iAANev"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3af7DNO"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Money or Your Life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Listen to every episode of these FIRE podcasts: </span><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/moneyshow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BiggerPockets MONEY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.choosefi.com/listen/choose-fi-podcast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChooseFI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/podcast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mad FIentist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://affordanything.com/podcast/binge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afford Anything</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Yes, it might take a few years to get through all this information … That’s OK &#8212; learning takes time, and nobody is born an expert.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Max out your 401(k).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Or any employer-sponsored retirement programs you have available to you. If you are a contractor or business owner, consider opening a </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/solo-401k/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solo 401k</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s OK if you can’t contribute the maximum, just add as much as you can each year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Open a Roth IRA. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add as much money as you can each year. If you’re not eligible for a Roth, open a regular IRA.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Open an HSA. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a high-deductible health plan, you’re eligible for an HSA account. Try to max it out each year. This is the most tax-efficient investment vehicle available to Americans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Invest everything in broad, low-cost index funds.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Inside each retirement account, choose highly diversified funds that have low management fees. The FIRE crowd’s favorite is VTI or VTSAX.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Open an after-tax brokerage account.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After contributing the maximum to your pre-tax retirement accounts, put any excess money in a regular brokerage account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Automate contributions.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set all of your contributions to automatically transfer and invest so you don’t have to worry about it every month. Out of sight, out of mind.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dollar-cost average.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don’t try to time the market or “beat” the average. Even the smartest investors in the world can’t do this consistently. Don’t worry about how much stocks are going up or down each month, just keep investing on a regular basis regardless.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Limit your cash on hand.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apart from a small emergency fund, make sure all of your money is working for you, all of the time. (You could even opt to </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lowering-my-emergency-fund-to-0-00/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest your emergency fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.) The more cash you hoard, the more you lose value to inflation each year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Invest in real estate, if you must.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are a TON of opportunities investing in real estate. My only recommendation here is to learn and network as much as you can before jumping into anything you’re unfamiliar with. Listen to every episode of the </span><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BiggerPockets Podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and attend local meet-ups to network with successful investors. Avoid advice from people who don’t have a proven track record.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lastly, don’t gamble, break the law, or cheat anyone. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term costs of being a fraud outweigh any short-term benefits. It’s never worth it.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there you have it &#8230; my brain dump of advice for making, saving and investing money. You don’t have to do ALL of these to grow your wealth, doing just a handful is usually enough to ensure a comfortable retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My guess is that most of y’all knew this stuff already. But it never hurts reading again.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is this list missing? (Yeah yeah I know I didn’t mention cryptocurrency…)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a great day ahead! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4b2.png" alt="💲" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4b5.png" alt="💵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just got back from FinCon in Austin last week! For those of you who don’t know, FinCon began in 2011 as the Financial Blogger Conference, but now it’s a place for all types of digital content creators, money nerds and brands to get together and geek out on personal finance stuff.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64232 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Joel-at-FinCon-e1633316138501.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="680" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was my second time going to FinCon. I met 1000 cool bloggers there, learned 1000 new things, and drank 1000 beers. Very fun stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than doing a review of the event and name-dropping all the bloggy-celebs who were there, I wanted to share some of the neat brands and companies that surprised me. I love FinTech and want to spread the word about anything that can help people make/save money in smarter ways. Here are 3 cool FinTech companies and apps that I found interesting, and you might too&#8230;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**No, they didn’t pay me to write about them or sponsor this post. Just sharing stuff I think is good!**</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>LifeGoal Investments: ETFs for Various Life Goals</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64231 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Lifegoal-logo.png" alt="" width="500" height="200" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Lifegoal-logo.png 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Lifegoal-logo-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the first day of the conference my friend said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you checked out LifeGoal Investments yet? They are super interesting! They are a new company that created 5 different ETFs people can invest in.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my head I was thinking, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who cares? The only ETF I am interested in is VTI. Why would I invest in anything else?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then later I learned what these ETFs were created for and their purpose. The more I spoke with LifeGoal Investments, the more impressed I was with their mission! They are helping people store </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">less in cash positions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, 2 of their ETFs really struck a chord with me…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first ETF is called </span><b>LifeGoal Homeowner ETF (NYSE: HOM).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This ETF was specifically created for people who are saving up for a home down payment. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen an ETF address this problem (and they actually have a patent pending for this type of ETF).</span></p>
<p><b>Here is the problem it solves: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest hurdles for a homebuyer is saving up to make cash down payment. The average size of a down payment in America is ~$47,000, and the average time it takes to save is 6.5 years!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is, most people save their down payment </span><b>in cash</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They save cash in a regular checking account (earning $0 interest) or a savings account (earning a few pennies interest). Meanwhile, from the time they start saving until the time they are ready to purchase a home 6 years later, housing prices continue to rise and inflation eats away the buying power of their cash savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution is to convince people to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their housing down payment while they save up. BUT… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What average person trusts the “stock market” and knows how to invest conservatively!? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in 100% stocks can be “risky” for potential homeowners because if there’s a crash, they could lose a chunk of the down payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that’s what the HOM ETF was built for. It’s very conservative (~75% bonds, 25% stocks) and </span><b>the biggest stock holdings are directly tied to the housing market</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It holds stocks like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Zillow Group, etc. The idea is that as the housing market rises, a portion of the down payment savings also rises, helping people afford higher house prices when they’re ready to buy. REALLY innovative stuff! </span><a href="https://www.lifegoalinvestments.com/hom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more about HOM here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other ETF that impressed me was </span><b>General Conservative ETF (NYSE: SAVN).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is built to help people conservatively invest their savings or everyday emergency fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of you guys know that already I </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lowering-my-emergency-fund-to-0-00/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lowered my emergency fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> significantly, investing most of it in VTI. And many people shook their heads at me, thinking it was very risky! (It kind of is.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I still believe holding emergency fund cash in a checking/savings account hurts more than it helps in the long run. So this new ETF called SAVN is a different, very conservative way to invest emergency cash to make sure money is still working a little bit for you. </span><a href="https://www.lifegoalinvestments.com/savn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more about SAVN here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**This is probably a good time to remind you that I am not a financial advisor! Don’t invest in stuff just ‘cause I think it’s cool. Gotta do your own research. :)**</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Qube Money: A Budgeting App with “Envelopes”</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64233 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/qube-money-logo-1536x631-1-e1633316148484.png" alt="" width="600" height="246" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budgeting with physical envelopes is pretty common. Many people love it. You take your paycheck, turn it into cash, divide all the dollars up into different envelopes and spend only what’s inside each month.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://qubemoney.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the </span><b>digital version of cash envelope budgeting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The basic plan (free) lets you create 10 envelopes &#8212; called qubes &#8212; and spend money via a debit card. The big difference is that by default, the debit card holds a $0 balance. By this, I mean that the card can only be used after you assign it some money from one of the envelopes. All spending is controlled by the app, BEFORE a purchase is actually made on the debit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a quick video showing how it works: </span><a href="https://youtu.be/KybvSZ99Asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qube Money Video</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I love about this budgeting process is it encourages more intentional buying habits. It helps people stop and think before making purchases. The app is designed to not allow you to overspend in a category (just like you can’t take out more money from a physical envelope than what’s actually inside of it). You are not capable of overdrafting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was also pretty impressed with the company&#8217;s product roadmap. Their paid versions offer more features, and family/children features are coming soon. This will allow you to give kids debit cards, and load them up with an exact amount of money, instantly, from the mobile app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this seems cool and you’re looking to replace your physical cash envelope budgeting, check out Qube. Like I said, the </span><a href="https://qubemoney.com/pricing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">basic plan and sign-up is FREE!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**I also learned about a new app called </span><a href="https://www.withyotta.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yotta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has a similar “bucket” system for saving for money goals. They reward users with a lottery-like game and awards for meeting savings goals, encouraging good savings habits. Kind of cool!</span></p>
<h2><strong>RocketDollar: Self Directed IRAs</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64234 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rocketdollar-logoo.png" alt="" width="438" height="115" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rocketdollar-logoo.png 438w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/rocketdollar-logoo-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I liked learning about RocketDollar. They’ve been out for a few years already so maybe I’m late to the game here, but this was my first time really looking at their offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RocketDollar makes it easy to invest in almost anything inside your IRA account. Instead of the common stocks/bonds/REITS, you can buy a physical rental property, invest in precious metals, cryptocurrencies, or even a private start-up business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative investments can sometimes be risky. But, with higher risk can come higher returns. Making higher profits inside a tax advantaged account can be a huge advantage over long holding periods as opposed to buying with after-tax funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a little expensive ($15 per month with a $360 set-up fee), but all of the legal work and account structure is set up for you quickly, along with an LLC to hold investments. They also provide easy online tools to manage your stuff. Looking back, I wish I had used my IRA to invest in some of my real estate syndication deals. Instead, I used after-tax cash so I have to pay taxes on all gains the moment they are realized.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, before you get excited and gamble all your IRA funds away on crypto stuff… You’d better do your own due diligence on what you’re investing in. Just because you can do alternative investments with your IRA doesn’t mean it’s the best option for you.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whelp, I’ll share more stuff about FinCon over time and maybe talk about some of the interesting peeps I met there. (A lot of TikTok, YouTube and Instagram influencers… they made me feel so OLD!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope y’all have an awesome day ahead!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheers,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a teenager, my first jobs were hourly paid. The more hours I worked, the more money I made. If I didn’t work any hours, I didn’t get paid anything. Back then I took the phrase ‘time is money’ quite literally, and it motivated me to work harder and earn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today however, I am learning that the flipside of this phrase can be equally motivating. </span><b>Money is time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! By this I mean that if you’ve saved a lot of money, you can potentially buy hours of free time in your life. (Not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time &#8212; we all get the same 24 hours a day &#8212; I’m talking about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">free</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time, as in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">freedom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to choose how you live.)</span></p>
<h2><strong>“Remember That Time Is Money”</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently Ben Franklin said this first, way back in 1748 when he published a short essay called </span><a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0130"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advice to a Young Tradesman</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here’s a snip from the paper…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><b><i>Remember that Time is Money.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or sits idle one half of that day, tho’ he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon that the only expense; he has really spent or rather thrown away five shillings besides.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll admit I had to re-read that passage about 6 times to decipher Franklin’s old-school (and gender bias) writing style. But what I think he was trying to say is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you earn $10 dollars for each day of work, but choose to take a day off, then that day just “cost” you $10. (Opportunity cost)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you take the day off AND spend $5 buying something, in total, the day cost you $15. ($10 in opportunity cost + $5 in real cost)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, basically, we should all work 365 days out of every year, right? Every second we’re not working, we are wasting money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, probably not. Although it’s important to understand opportunity cost and make money while you can, it’s also important to find balance.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Taking the Concept Too Far</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when I was 20, I worked as an hourly paid employee at a cellphone store. I can’t remember my exact wage, but it was probably like ~$16 per hour (this is Australian Dollars, so maybe like $12/hr USD). I worked 5 days a week, so my take-home pay was about $130 each day before taxes. That’s about $33k per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I was a money-hungry little bugger, this wasn’t good enough for me. And since I didn’t yet understand the concept of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher value</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> labor, I decided to trade </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of my time for money at a second job, after hours. My mindset was simply, </span><b>more hours working = more money.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My after-hours job was at the Australian Post office, working 7pm to 12am sorting mail for $18 an hour. Daily, that was ~$90 before taxes, so $23k per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, with both jobs that’s $56k before taxes, working ~60 hours per week. Decent coin for a 20-year-old! At first I was loving it! Knowing that I was maximizing my time and not missing out on any opportunity to work felt great. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as you can imagine, it eventually led to burnout. Prioritizing money too much and giving all my time away was unhealthy. I learned a huge lesson during that time in my life → </span><b>Although time is money, sometimes the money isn’t worth trading the time for.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cool thing I learned during that time…</span></p>
<h2><strong>“Remember That Credit Is Money”</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This saying comes from Ben Franklin’s exact same essay, right after the “time is money” bit. He continues on to say:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><b><i>Remember that Credit is Money.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the interest, or so much as I can make of it during that time. This amounts to a considerable sum&#8230; Remember that money is of a prolific generating nature. </span></i><b><i>Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and so on. Five shillings turn’d, is six: Turn’d again, ’tis seven and three pence; and so on ’til it becomes an hundred pound.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, I had to re-read this a few times to decipher it… But I’m pretty sure that Franklin is talking about compound interest! His lessons here are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money can make more money, compounding over time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earlier in life you make money, the more compounding can happen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you miss work for your $10 of pay, it not only costs you $10… </span><b>It also costs you the potential compounding</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over and over again throughout life.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom line: Time is waaaay more money than most people think … because opportunity cost also has compounding value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was lucky to be exposed to investing at an early age. It took a good decade of saving and buying assets, but I was finally able to shift my mindset from trading time for money, to using my assets to generate money.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Money Can Buy Free Time</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I say you can “buy” time, what I really mean is that money can be used to remove regular obligations in life (work, chores, inconveniences), freeing up your time so it can be spent in more fulfilling ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend </span><a href="http://www.moneyisemotional.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine Luken</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropped a cool comment the other day on the blog. She said:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing I will add is something I do called “Buying Back My Time.” It’s the rule I use to figure out if I should do something myself or pay someone else to do it. Essentially, I calculate how much time something takes me versus how much it costs me to pay someone else to do it. For example, my cleaning person takes 10 hours of work off my plate per month for the low, low cost of $160. (She only needs 6 hours to get it done because she’s that good.) All I need to do is sell an online course or to book one 60-minute corporate money wellness webinar to pay for my house cleaner. </span></i><b><i>$160 to buy back 10 hours of my time is an amazing deal for me!”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing work gives you more free time. But in order to do that, you have to have money to pay for it. In Christine’s case, she can pay for 10 hours of free time for $160. (And she also worked out that she can make $160 in 1 hour, or by selling a book.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieving financial independence (especially at an early age) can give you HUGE amounts of free time in life. If you’ve saved up enough money to cover your bills and conveniences for the rest of your life, you’ve just “bought” free time for the rest of your life.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Time Is an Asset. And Money Is an Asset.</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, both time and money are assets. It’s up to you on how you want to use them in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I promise this is the last Ben Franklin quote I’ll use for a while! This is from the final paragraph in his essay…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In short, the Way to Wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, Industry and Frugality; i.e. </span></i><b><i>Waste neither Time nor Money, but make the best Use of both.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He that gets all he can honestly, and saves all he gets (necessary expenses accepted) will certainly become Rich.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agree? Disagree?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you all a lovely week ahead, spending your time and money in awesome ways!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d always been good about tracking our expenses and had a standard budgeting method for stuff, but since we discovered the FIRE movement we decided to change things up a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, around that same time we also read the book </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3nMzdbO" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Couples Finish Rich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It included a bunch of worksheets and questionnaires to help us identify our priorities in life, and then create specific actions to make sure we’re spending money intentionally on things we truly value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now refer to this as our <em><strong>“value based budget.”</strong></em></span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is a Value Based Budget?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value based budgeting is the simple process of right-sizing your budget categories so that they better align with your priorities and values in life. It can also be called value based spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means spending more money on the things that make your life richer and happier, and spending less money on things that don’t add true value to your life. If you do it correctly, you’ll feel much better about your money situation, where your money is going, and the lifestyle that you are living.</span></p>
<p><strong>For example, one of the things that brings me and my wife joy is <i>giving to others</i>. This is a priority for us in life. And one of the things that <i>doesn’t</i> really provide us joy is eating at dine-in restaurants&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years ago when we did traditional budgeting, we might have allocated $50 for a date night at a restaurant. This would be about $40 of food, and a $10 tip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now that we’ve got a values based budget, we might still spend $50 on a date night out&#8230; But $20 would be for food (2 x $10 burritos at a street meat stand) and a $30 tip to the guy who makes it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both budget cases, we spend the same amount of money &#8211; $50&#8230;  But, working with a value based budget and having intentional spending, we walk away happier because we’ve fulfilled a higher priority activity for us → giving.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Figure Out Your Values</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest key to a values based budget is establishing your personal values and priorities in life. This is way harder than it sounds! It requires some deep questioning of yourself!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Don’t be fooled into skipping this step… If your budget is based on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone else’s priorities</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (eg. what the Internet tells you to do, or tips from your extremely frugal friend) then you might be robbing yourself. The point is to match your spending habits to YOUR true joys in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has different values. To help figure out yours, answer some of these questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Who do you admire most? Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Generally, when we admire a quality in others, it’s something we value ourselves.</span></li>
<li><b>What are some of your proudest moments? Why were you so proud?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The feelings you identify here uncover true values in life.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Picture the 70-year-old YOU. What are the most important things in that person’s life? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps you determine what is most meaningful to you in the long term.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>If you were given only 48 hours to live, how would you spend your last few days? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a money question, this is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> question. It reveals who/what/where is most important to you.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Have a look at this </b><a href="https://jamesclear.com/core-values"><b>Core Values list</b></a><b>. Which ones stand out most to you? </b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now comes another hard part&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your list of core values, try to prioritize them. Try and cut the list down to about 5 or 6 &#8212; the values that are absolutely most important to you. (Another thing you could do is group them into similar categories).</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**A funny side note… My wife and I did this exercise separately and came out with slightly different lists. This is why it’s important to communicate and plan together as a couple. You need to make sure you are BOTH seeing value from your budget, so include what’s important to both of you.**</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>How to Merge Your Values With Your Budget</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I went through every single category in our budget and questioned what we were getting the most value from vs. things we didn’t really feel great about. We allocated more money to some categories and shrunk the budget for others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is kind of like J$’s “</span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenge everything</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” he wrote about years ago. But, instead of focusing on money savings, the goal is to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">question the value</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you are getting from things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we increased our grocery budget from $500 per month to $600 per month. This was based on our personal value of </span><b>community</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My wife and I love to host parties and cook for large groups, and many of our best memories in the past 10 years have been centered around meals with others. We also increased our </span><a href="https://5amjoel.com/alcohol-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alcohol budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending MORE on stuff like this feels great! It gives us room to spring for fancy or expensive meats once in a while, or perhaps send our guests home with delicious leftovers. We can do this without having to worry about “spending too much money on food” because there is extra room in our budget for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other areas, we decreased spending or removed expenses completely. One example of this was </span><a href="https://5amjoel.com/dumping-amazon-prime/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dumping Amazon Prime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We realized the value we got from a Prime subscription was very low. (Free/fast shipping is available from many retailers without a prime membership. TV streaming is a low priority for us, and so is buying books compared with borrowing from the library). Deleting our Amazon membership has saved us money while having zero effect on our happiness in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other categories we decreased our spending in were restaurants, car costs, clothing, and insurance. Our goal is to reduce costs down to our </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/i-found-3-cents-on-the-ground-woohoo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">happiness tipping point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If we can get the same amount of happiness for fewer dollars, that’s a win for us.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Values Change Over Time, and So Should Budgets</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we grow older and our lifestyle changes, so do our priorities in life. For this reason, value based budgeting isn’t a once-off activity. It’s more of an evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a home renter, I’ve never really prioritized home improvement or having nice furniture or appliances. Back in my 20’s, I couldn’t fathom spending $20-50k remodeling a kitchen or landscaping a backyard… But, as I grow older I’m realizing that my kitchen and backyard is where I spend 90% of my time. I would happily allocate larger amounts of money into these areas today, because I would reap more value from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the same with health care and family/child costs. These will most likely increase in time as my wife and I prioritize them more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think values change as your wealth grows, too&#8230; When I was younger I placed a high value on savings and investments. It was extremely important for me to build wealth early in life &#8212; I am reaping life-long value from dollars I saved 20 years ago. But today, I have reduced the importance of wealth building and would rather prioritize travel and experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Every person does it differently. I encourage you to make budgeting unique and custom to your life. Make it fun. Make it $exy!</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(And for those of you with no budget right now, here’s a bunch of </span></i><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/free-budget-templates-sites/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">free budget templates</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m curious… What do you spend money on that makes you happy? What budgeting tips do you use to get more value out of your money?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take care,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
