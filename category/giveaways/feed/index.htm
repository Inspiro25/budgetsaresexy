<p>A <a href="https://jordangrumet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogger friend</a> of mine recently came out with a new book, and it&#8217;s centered around one of the things that occupies my brain way more than I care to admit ;)</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of life.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>And apparently I&#8217;m not alone, as this &#8220;purpose anxiety&#8221; apparently affects 91% of people! Crazy!</p>
<p>So odds are you&#8217;ve struggled with this too, which makes this book a perfect read &#8211; and giveaway! &#8211; for everyone today. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Purpose Code</a>&#8220;, and here&#8217;s more about it via Amazon:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The Purpose Code&#8221;<br />
How to unlock meaning, maximize happiness, and leave a lasting legacy</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68352" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg" alt="the purpose code" width="426" height="658" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-194x300.jpg 194w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-550x850.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-324x500.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></a></p>
<p>Purpose can change your life.</p>
<p><strong>Having a sense of purpose has been scientifically proven to help people find happiness, longevity, and health.</strong></p>
<p>But lots of us are also worried about purpose―purpose anxiety has been estimated to affect as much as 91% of people.</p>
<p>What’s going on? And how do we do purpose the right way―to unlock all its many benefits, set goals in life, make a mark and journey from anxiety to legacy?</p>
<p>This question set hospice doctor and writer Jordan Grumet on a quest, and The Purpose Code shares his remarkable findings to help you change your future forever. The result is a self-development book like no other.</p>
<p><strong>It turns out that we fundamentally misunderstand purpose and the role it plays in our lives. In fact, there are two different types of purpose. One will lead to anxiety and disillusionment; the other will lead to connection and lasting legacy.</strong></p>
<p>In The Purpose Code, Jordan will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chart a course for you to reach happiness through understanding the deep human truths behind the concepts of Meaning and Purpose (including life review therapy and simple ways of healing generational trauma)</li>
<li>Equip you with a practical and proven framework for unlocking your real purpose, and show you the life-changingly enjoyable way to climb to goals, regardless of your situation in life</li>
<li>Arm you to differentiate between the two types of purpose when finding life purpose (and show you the hidden reasons why one is always more fulfilling than the other)</li>
<li>Set you on the way to building a genuinely lasting impact long after you’re gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding happiness has never been about creating big audacious goals that we may or may not be able to achieve. True contentment comes from filling our lives with enriching activities that lead to connection and, ultimately, legacy. Swap grand but ultimately empty success books for this small goals book, and begin creating your true purpose today.</p>

<p>Get your entries in by this Sunday at midnight, and I&#8217;ll randomly select the two winners the following day!</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I think I&#8217;m around 70% at the moment.</strong> The one thing I feel called to do, and enjoy!, is helping others in some form or fashion, and it seems the more I do that the happier I tend to get. Thus, why I made it this year&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-10-2-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-2 Challenge</a>!

<p>How about you? What % do you think you&#8217;re at right now? Either way, keep waking up and doing your best to appreciate at least being alive!! It&#8217;s not always fun, but it sure beats the alternative&#8230;.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Stoic Path to Wealth:<br />
Ancient Wisdom for Enduring Prosperity</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4cMfgc5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68087 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth.png" alt="stoic path to wealth book" width="400" height="571" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth.png 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth-210x300.png 210w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/stoic-path-to-wealth-350x500.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darius&#8217; blog</a> for a number of years now,</strong> so was super stoked to learn his latest book focuses on the more <em>emotional</em> side to investing and growing wealth. Something most of us struggle hard with!</p>
<p>He has some <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other classics</a> too around productivity, forming better habits, and generally just living well, but this is the first book I believe to focus on *money* specifically. Even the OG Morgan Housel gave a testimonial on it!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a clip from its Amazon page:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The Stoics understood that if you can control your reactions and manage your emotions, you can achieve success. The same principles apply to our financial lives today. The greatest investors approach the markets with discipline, emotional distance, and self-mastery—lessons that the Stoics have been teaching us for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Combining ancient wisdom with practical investment strategies drawn from analysis of the greatest investors of all time, The Stoic Path to Wealth will teach you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>cultivate an investing edge by managing your emotions and developing your unique skills and talents</li>
<li>develop the discipline to ignore short-term market fluctuations and avoid living in the future</li>
<li>foster a mindset that allows you to enjoy what you have and avoid greed</li>
<li>create a sustainable approach to trading&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Millionaire Habits:<br />
How to Achieve Financial Independence, Retire Early, and Make a Difference by Focusing on Yourself First</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3MwPFtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68104" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book.png" alt="millionaire habits" width="470" height="606" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book.png 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book-233x300.png 233w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book-550x709.png 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/millionaire-habits-book-388x500.png 388w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This is the first book from long-time blogger, Steve Adcock, of <a href="https://millionairehabits.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Millionaire Habits</a></strong>, and while you&#8217;ll probably either love this one or hate it as Steve can get pretty feisty, lol, the overall message here will always remain true: when you become financially free you have more time, and energy, to give back to not only yourself but those around you too. But first you must focus on yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about the book per Amazon:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In Millionaire Habits, popular personal finance educator Steve Adcock delivers a fun, insightful, and hands-on discussion of how to build financial security, retire early, and give back to the community. You’ll learn to focus on yourself and your family first, creating personal wealth for the purpose of giving back to others.</p>
<p>In the book, the author explains that “saving money” isn’t a goal in and of itself, but rather the end product of the personal wealth equation: Wealth = Income + Investments – Lifestyle. You’ll discover how to pay yourself first with concrete guidance and practical advice drawn from people who built wealth on modest incomes.</p>
<p>You’ll also find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategies for maintaining your physical and financial fitness so you can maximize the value of your assets</li>
<li>Ways to turn your existing wealth into even more valuable investments that generate continued, passive income</li>
<li>Methods to help you retire early and enjoy your financial independence at a young age</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfect for young professionals, working families, self-employed people, and anyone else seeking to increase their net worth and get more out of life.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>To learn more or purchase:</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3MwPFtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Millionaire Habits</a></p>
<p>[You might also recall Steve&#8217;s name from the <em>Rockstar Finance</em> days as he was the brains behind all of our tech, allowing us to expand and add features at lightning speed &#8211; at one point launching new endeavors with each passing month, whether it was the Blog Directory, the Forums, or the Feed Database where anyone could read any blog post being published across the world! It was fun times, and I owe a lot of the success of the project to Steve. So thanks for everything, buddy &#8211; always enjoy working with ya <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f919.png" alt="🤙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> Steve also has an FI Accelerator course if you learn better through action-oriented tasks: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/fi-accelerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FI/Accelerator: Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Financial Independence</a></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Get Ready Blueprint:<br />
A 52-Week Guide to Changing the Way You Think About Money</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4cLgEvK" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68095" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/get-ready-blueprint.png" alt="get ready blueprint" width="373" height="482" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/get-ready-blueprint.png 502w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/get-ready-blueprint-232x300.png 232w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/get-ready-blueprint-387x500.png 387w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This book comes from Tony Steuer who recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ZqM-OsraI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had me on his podcast</a>,</strong> and if the book is anything like the fun conversations we had there I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. I haven&#8217;t personally read it, but I&#8217;m always a fan of books that not only tell you the *why* behind stuff, but also the *how*. And this one seems from afar at least that it merges both of them nicely.</p>
<p>If you win it you&#8217;ll have to let me know if I was correct! ;)</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a clip from Amazon:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The Get Ready! Blueprint is an essential 52-week planner that helps you understand your financial goals and create and achieve your own strong financial decisions. With this easy-to-use road map and clear action steps, you’ll gain an overall view of how everything in your financial life fits together and how to maintain it.</p>
<p>You’ll begin by building useful habits, then put them to use in planning, calculating, and reviewing key financial information. With Tony Steuer’s proven “Get Ready Method,&#8221; you can</p>
<ul>
<li>understand your big financial picture</li>
<li>find clarity to evaluate whether financial products meet your goals</li>

<li>use the innovative calendar system to help you keep all areas of your financial life up to date and on track&#8221;</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Provider Money, Pleasure Money:<br />
The Energetics of Personal Finance</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3XsSb9Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68092" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money.png" alt="provider money pleasure money" width="376" height="602" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money.png 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money-188x300.png 188w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/provider-money-pleasure-money-313x500.png 313w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Okay &#8211; now to the &#8220;energetics&#8221; one :)</strong> Which is brought to you by long-time blog reader, and blogger herself, <a href="https://www.christineluken.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine Luken</a>. Another book I have a feeling you&#8217;ll either love or hate, but even if you&#8217;re just a little into the energies of the world, or into yoga or reiki or any of those more &#8220;woo&#8221; practices on the fringes I think you&#8217;ll appreciate this one. At the very least to get a *different* perspective that you might not have otherwise considered. You never know what might click!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a snippet from Amazon:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We often think of money as bills and coins, checking and savings accounts, paychecks and passive income. Yet, at its essence, money is financial energy; that’s why it’s called “currency.”</p>
<p>There are two distinct and complementary energies, the yin and yang, in personal finance: Provider money and Pleasure money. Discover the nature of these two energic forces and how they overlay the entirety of your personal finances. Seeing your money through this energetic lens is a paradigm shift, a philosophy of money rather than a strict how-to guide.</p>
<p>After reading this book, you will have the knowledge and confidence to balance Provider and Pleasure energies, creating a financial life that supports your happiness and peace of mind.&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Plan Your Money Path:<br />
A Guide to Create Your Own Financial Plan</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4gb30oA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68106" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/plan-your-money-path.png" alt="plan your money path" width="403" height="605" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/plan-your-money-path.png 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/plan-your-money-path-200x300.png 200w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/plan-your-money-path-333x500.png 333w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></a></p>
<p>This one comes from long-time reader and frequent publisher, <strong>Bill Hines,</strong> who&#8217;s always kind enough to offer up some free copies to us here. His last book you might recall was &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/4eaPcsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiss Your Money Hello!: (And Financial Stress Goodbye)</a>&#8221; and just an overall passionate and great guy.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about the book from Amazon:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine how well you’d sleep at night knowing your boxes are checked—everything the kids will need, all your dreams right on through early retirement, when you’re young enough to enjoy those dreams.</p>
<p>This book shows you how to take control and build your own financial plan, using high fidelity, inexpensive software, not the dumbed-down financial/retirement planning tools you find all over the internet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take you through some important general financial planning context, and then through the steps to building a financial plan for a sample family. Along the way, we&#8217;ll discuss the different inputs and assumptions required for any financial plan, as well as how to interpret the results and put your plan into action.&#8221;</p>

<p>[FYI: This one hasn&#8217;t hit the shelves yet, but we&#8217;ll get the winners a physical copy by the end of Sept!]</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Wealth Paradox:<br />
Navigating Money, Free will, and Success: How Unconventional Thinking Influences Your Financial And Personal Life</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://amzn.to/4eiSp9r" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68121" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-wealth-paradox-book.png" alt="the wealth paradox book" width="408" height="641" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-wealth-paradox-book.png 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-wealth-paradox-book-191x300.png 191w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-wealth-paradox-book-318x500.png 318w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Lastly, a new book from Alain Guillot &#8211; a long-time friend of the blog!</strong> This one has only been released as a *Kindle* book, however Alain was kind enough to shoot me a PDF version of it so the two winners will receive that for easy access.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more about it per Amazon:</p>
<p>&#8220;This book is a culmination of years spent navigating the complex landscape of personal finance, entrepreneurship, and self-discovery. It’s about the lessons learned from both success and failure, and the lessons I learned from the experiences of others, including some of the most successful minds of our time.</p>
<p>The book is composed of 10 chapters in which I share my ideas on managing money, yourself—your mind, your habits, and your expectations. We’ll explore topics that challenge conventional wisdom, such as the role of gender in success, the myths surrounding investment choices, and the often-overlooked impact of childhood experiences on our adult lives.</p>
<p>As you turn the pages, you’ll move from basic financial knowledge to ideas of what it means to thrive in a world that often feels uncertain.&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact, hell, why not give a copy away of that one today too? I think it&#8217;s necessary <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

Extraordinary Stories of People Like You on the Quest for Financial Independence―And How to Join Them</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3MP4FD2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67758 " src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pathfinders-book-jl-collins.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="600" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pathfinders-book-jl-collins.jpg 427w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pathfinders-book-jl-collins-197x300.jpg 197w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/pathfinders-book-jl-collins-328x500.jpg 328w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></a></p>
<p>From JL <a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/2023/10/31/24-intriguing-quotes-from-pathfinders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">himself</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinders has been two years in the making and it is a book I have wanted to bring to you since 2016 after The Simple Path to Wealth was published.</strong></p>
<p>Within months of that book’s release I began to receive incredible stories from people all over the world telling me how they had taken the approach laid out and applied it to their own unique lives, location and circumstances.</p>
<p>Since contracting with Harriman House to publish Pathfinders, <strong>we’ve collected more of these stories and in these pages present ~100 of the very best.</strong></p>
<p>As the stories rolled in, they mostly self organized into these nine sections that make up the core of the book, along with my preface, introduction and commentary on each.</p>
<ol>
<li>Freedom</li>
<li>Debt</li>
<li>Saving</li>
<li>Lifestyle Inflation</li>
<li>Investing</li>
<li>F-You Money</li>
<li>Staying the Course</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Endgame</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the ultimate companion for your own journey to financial freedom―and the true and lasting wealth that lies at the end.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Simple Path to Wealth:<br />
Your Road Map to Financial Independence and a Rich, Free Life</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3SVIO0R" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67763" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book.jpg" alt="the simple path to wealth book" width="381" height="630" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book.jpg 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book-182x300.jpg 182w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-simple-path-to-wealth-book-303x500.jpg 303w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /></a></p>
<p>Again, from <a href="https://amzn.to/3SVIO0R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JL</a>:</p>
<p><strong>This book grew out of a series of letters to my daughter concerning various things—mostly about money and investing—she was not yet quite ready to hear.</strong></p>
<p>Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we’ve created, understanding it is critical.</p>
<p>“But Dad,” she once said, “I know money is important. I just don’t want to spend my life thinking about it.” This was eye-opening. I love this stuff. But most people have better things to do with their precious time. Bridges to build, diseases to cure, treaties to negotiate, mountains to climb, technologies to create, children to teach, businesses to run.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, benign neglect of things financial leaves you open to the charlatans of the financial world. The people who make investing endlessly complex, because if it can be made complex it becomes more profitable for them, more expensive for us, and we are forced into their waiting arms.</p>
<p>Here’s an important truth: Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them. Not only are they more costly to the investor, they are less effective.</p>
<p><strong>The simple approach I created for her and present now to you, is not only easy to understand and implement, it is more powerful than any other.</strong></p>
<p>Together we’ll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debt: Why you must avoid it and what to do if you have it.</li>
<li>The importance of having F-you Money.</li>
<li>How to think about money, and the unique way understanding this is key to building your wealth.</li>
<li>Where traditional investing advice goes wrong and what actually works.</li>
<li>What the stock market really is and how it really works.</li>
<li>Why the stock market always goes up and why most people still lose money investing in it.</li>
<li>How to invest in a raging bull, or bear, market.</li>
<li>Specific investments to implement these strategies.</li>
<li>The Wealth Building and Wealth Preservation phases of your investing life and why they are not always tied to your age.</li>
<li>How your asset allocation is tied to those phases and how to choose it.</li>
<li>How to simplify the sometimes confusing world of 401(k), 403(b), TSP, IRA and Roth accounts.</li>
<li>TRFs (Target Retirement Funds), HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) and RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions).</li>
<li>What investment firm to use and why the one I recommend is so far superior to the competition.</li>
<li>Why you should be very cautious when engaging an investment advisor and whether you need to at all.</li>
<li>Why and how you can be conned, and how to avoid becoming prey.</li>
<li>Why I don’t recommend dollar cost averaging.</li>
<li>What financial independence looks like and how to have your money support you.</li>
<li>What the 4% rule is and how to use it to safely spend your wealth.</li>
<li>The truth behind Social Security.</li>
<li>A Case Study on how this all can be implemented in real life.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Just got this book in the mail from blogger/hustler/entrepreneur extraordinaire, Chris Guillebeau, and if it&#8217;s any indication of his past best-sellers this should be a good one too. </strong>You might remember Chris from the Art of Non-Conformity blog back in the day or his popular book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3E0t83M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The $100 Startup</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip about it from <a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his website</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;A fascinating tour of this brave new world where novelty and creativity are currency, and the creators are in control. From the community of gamers getting paid to play, to the armchair pundits beating the bookies in online prediction markets, to TikTok “Sleepfluencers,” AI artists, and the band of renegade investors upending the rules of finance, in the world of Gonzo Capitalism, anything goes.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>This one my best friend SWEARS BY, which is saying something since he *hates* money books, but in a way it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;business/hustling&#8221; book than it is money&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>I tried reading it after he gave me his copy, but my mind is no longer in the &#8220;get rich and powerful!&#8221; mentality so perhaps it&#8217;s better suited for someone else :) It <em>was</em> super interesting though which kept my attention for the first few chapters, so if you&#8217;re looking for some tough love motivation or just want something *different* to read (it really is different!) you&#8217;ll want to check it out&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Now this one was brought to my attention by Hal Hershfield himself looking to get the word out and just recently dropped this summer.</strong> I haven&#8217;t had the chance to skim it yet, but he does seem to be a legit dude and the topic very much applies to what we&#8217;re about here.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip from <a href="https://www.halhershfield.com/yourfutureself" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his website</a> to see if you like it:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all had the desire to travel through time and see what our lives will be like later in life. While we want the best possible future for ourselves, we often fail to make decisions that would truly make that a reality. Why do we choose steak over vegetables at dinner, waving off concerns about high cholesterol? Why do we splurge on luxury cars rather than save for retirement? Why can’t we stick to our exercise programs? Why are so many of us so disconnected from our future selves?</p>
<p>Based on over a decade of groundbreaking research, Your Future Self explains that, in our minds, our future selves often look like strangers. Many of us view the future as incredibly distant, making us more likely to opt for immediate gratification that disregards the health and wellbeing of ourselves in the years to come. People who are able to connect with their future selves, however, are better able to balance living for today and planning for tomorrow. Your Future Self presents the science, describes the mental mistakes we make in thinking about the future, and gives us practical advice for imagining our best future so that we can make that a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s another new book that just dropped in June, and similarly Bill Hines reached out to offer up a free copy.</strong> It&#8217;s already hit the top lists of Personal Money Management, Investing Basics, College Financing, and Home Buying/Selling so seems to be resonating with people!</p>
<p>More from <a href="https://amzn.to/47KTp3L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;This book is the way to financial peace, to relieving the number one stressor in our lives and relationships. It’s the guide to living every day on your own terms, and never having to go to a job you no longer love, of never having to miss those important life events. I’ll keep it simple—just the way your personal finances should be! The first word of the title is no coincidence. KISS means Keep It Simple Silly! Maybe I’ll even make you laugh. Your household should measure success in ‘happy’, not some corporate financial metric.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now for today&#8217;s goods&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">#1. Statement Cards</h2>
<p><a href="https://stefanieoconnell.com/statement-cards"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66411" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/statement-cards-1.jpg" alt="statement cards" width="500" height="492" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/statement-cards-1.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/statement-cards-1-300x295.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So we have millions of greeting cards for birthdays and holidays and graduations etc, but what about cards celebrating women’s ambitions and milestones &#8220;beyond marriage and motherhood&#8221;?!</strong></p>
<p>This was the inspiration behind these &#8220;<a href="https://stefanieoconnell.com/statement-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statement Cards</a>&#8221; created by <a href="https://stefanieoconnell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefanie O&#8217;Connell Rodriguez</a> who believes in &#8220;recognizing women, not only for their value in relation to others, but also, for their own achievements and successes.”</p>
<p>This package contains 6 unique Statement Cards, and are perfect for &#8220;supporting your sister as she starts her own business, congratulating your bestie when she scores a raise, or taking a moment to acknowledge yourself when you finish paying off your student loans. We’re here to help you celebrate &#8211; joyfully and unapologetically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pretty cool idea, and very much needed in our world :) Here&#8217;s more of the backstory on it from an interview we did a couple years ago: <a href="https://pfswagger.com/story-of-statement-cards-by-stefanie-oconnell-rodriguez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Story Behind &#8220;Statement Cards&#8221;</a></p>

<p><strong>My collection of beautiful clever coffee mugs!!</strong> Which I rarely use and thus why I&#8217;m giving them away, even though I really REALLY like them!! :) But maybe one of you can use them in your daily routines and make me feel better that they are going to a good home?! Or better yet &#8211; maybe you keep one and then pass on the others to keep spreading <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the love of index funds</a>?</p>
<p>However you play it, all 3 are up for grabs and sure to improve anyone&#8217;s morning <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2615.png" alt="☕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2615.png" alt="☕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">#3. Coin Collecting Package</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-66414" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coin-collecting-bundle.jpg" alt="coin collecting bundle" width="500" height="399" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coin-collecting-bundle.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coin-collecting-bundle-300x239.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><strong>This is for anyone who&#8217;s been thinking of collecting one day but doesn&#8217;t know where to start!</strong> Or who just loves learning about our nation&#8217;s currency.</p>
<p>The package includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 magazines</strong> from our hobby&#8217;s association, the American Numismatic Association (who also has one of the best DOMAINS online in the world: <a href="https://www.money.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money.org</a>!) &#8212; Great articles along with current price guides (though I never use those, and prefer the &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/3QI9oWy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Book</a>&#8220;)</li>
<li><strong>A copy of the Bank Note Reporter</strong> &#8212; which focuses more on paper money than coins, and also includes articles as well as a price guide (I *do* use this one for all my paper money valuing&#8230;)</li>
<li><strong>The &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/3QI9oWy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Book</a>&#8220;</strong> &#8212; our hobby&#8217;s most popular value guide for coins in the U.S., as well as from colonial times. This book alone will get you most of what you need when evaluating a coin collection, and also comes with some good history info in the beginning as well. If you ever need help deciphering it (it&#8217;s not too hard), or prefer having someone else value your coins for you, just give me a shout and I&#8217;d be happy to hook it up. I help <a href="https://jmoney.biz/coin-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evaluate, inventory, and sell collections</a> all the time &#8211; it&#8217;s super fun!</li>
</ul>

<p>Up today &#8211; a bunch of nerdy personal finance shirts and accessories &#8211; perfect for showing off your financial pride ;) I bought all these to support the hustlers in our community after loading them into <a href="http://pfswagger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PF Swagger</a> (where you can find a bunch more of this kinda stuff), but most I&#8217;ve never worn so I&#8217;m hoping we can change that today!</p>
<p>But first &#8211; the winners of yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/giveaway-day-2-more-great-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book giveaway</a>:</p>

<p><strong>A classic shirt by fellow blogger, <a href="http://accidentalfire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accidental FIRE</a>.</strong> And the guy behind the <a href="https://amzn.to/3mxrYnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budgets Are Sexy apparel line</a> too! (Thanks again, brother!). Now I did wear this shirt 2-3 times while blogging around town so it&#8217;s not new-new, but think of it as a &#8220;game worn&#8221; jersey, sure to be worth even more having been on the body of Sir J. Money, lol&#8230; Or just wash it 100 times first before wearing it if you&#8217;re afraid of my cooties ;)</p>
<p>At any rate, it&#8217;s FREE and up for grabs!! And you can find it here, as well as with a bunch of other FIRE-related shirts designed by Dave: <a href="https://amzn.to/3ASvFef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esskay Designs Financial Independence &amp; FIRE Tees</a></p>

<p><strong>A great shirt by Kevin L. Matthews II of <a href="https://www.buildingbread.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Bread</a>.</strong> It does seem to be a bit off-centered at least from the pic?, but it&#8217;s brand new and sure to impress all people you come across &#8211; friends and foes. Hard to go wrong with these 3 simple steps! Save. Invest. Protect. #BAM</p>

<p><strong>Another day, another giveaway!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Got three more books to give out today &#8211; two by good friends of mine in the community, and one by someone I WISH I could have been good friends with but who would have probably gotten me into way too much trouble, lol&#8230; Benjamin Franklin ;)</p>
<p>Before we get to that though &#8211; congrats to the winners of <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/week-of-giveaways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday&#8217;s</a> giveaways!</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic Habits &#8211; <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Nat Metz</strong></span></li>
<li>Broke Millennial Talks Money &#8211; <span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Sarah</strong></span></li>

</ul>
<p>Now here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got for you today&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book #1: &#8220;Adventures in Opting Out&#8221;<br />
by Cait Flanders</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3CBzO8V" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66383" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/adventures-opting-out-book.jpg" alt="adventures opting out book" width="424" height="573" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/adventures-opting-out-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/adventures-opting-out-book-222x300.jpg 222w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/adventures-opting-out-book-370x500.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>One of my favorite people in the space, and one of my favorite topics!</strong> Though Cait&#8217;s been opting out of so much we rarely get to hear from her anymore, lol&#8230;. so <em>not</em> a fan of that, but I am a fan of the book ;)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more about it below from <a href="https://amzn.to/3CBzO8V" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, and then here&#8217;s more about her at her website: <a href="https://www.caitflanders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CaitFlanders.com</a> (formerly &#8220;Blonde on a Budget&#8221; for long time purveyors in the space):</p>
<p>We all follow our own path in life. At least, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re told. In reality, many of us either do what is expected of us, or follow the invisible but well-worn paths that lead to what is culturally acceptable. For some, those paths are fine &#8212; even great. But they leave some of us feeling disconnected from ourselves and what we really want. When that discomfort finally outweighs the fear of trying something new, we&#8217;re ready to opt out.</p>
<p>After going through this process many times, Cait Flanders found there is an incredible parallel between taking a different path in life and the psychological work it takes to summit a mountain &#8212; especially when you decide to go solo. In Adventures in Opting Out, she offers a trail map to help you with both. As you&#8217;ll see, reaching the first viewpoint can be easy &#8212; and it offers a glimpse of what you&#8217;re walking toward. Climbing to the summit for the full view is worth it. But in the space between those two peaks you will enter a world completely unknown to you, and that is the most difficult part of the path to navigate.</p>
<p>With Flanders&#8217;s guidance and advice, drawn from her own journey and stories of others, you&#8217;ll have all the encouragement and insight you&#8217;ll need to take the path less traveled and create the life you want. Just step up to the trailhead and expect it to be an adventure.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book #2: &#8220;Fire the Haters&#8221;<br />
by Jillian Johnsrud</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://amzn.to/3AY91m8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-66384" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fire-the-haters-book.jpg" alt="fire the haters" width="416" height="550" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fire-the-haters-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fire-the-haters-book-227x300.jpg 227w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fire-the-haters-book-378x500.jpg 378w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Another book from a friend in the PF world &#8211; <a href="https://www.jillianjohnsrud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jillian Johnsrud</a>!</strong> Formerly of Montana Money Adventures, another great money blog from years of yore&#8230; I remember reading it for the first time and being absolutely blown away. She wrote with such rawness and vigor! And was super inspirational! In fact, she holds the title for having her very first blog post featured on Rockstar Finance &#8211; a quite impressive feat ;)</p>
<p>But today isn&#8217;t about her old blog, it&#8217;s about a new(ish) book of hers all around managing the haters in your life&#8230; So if you&#8217;ve been struggling with it, whether online or off, make sure to enter for this book and see if any of her tips help squash it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a testimonial I wrote for her that landed on the back cover of it &#8211; coincidentally next to a quote by Cait Flanders!</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Haters suck. But giving up on your dreams sucks more. Don&#8217;t let the haters win! Pick up this book and let Jillian help guide you through this beautifully messy place they call The Internet. It&#8217;ll be like having coffee with your best friend, only a best friend who also happens to know exactly what you need to succeed online.&#8221; &#8211; J.

<p>(I had put &#8220;Certified Hustler&#8221; there as my title, but I guess the editors didn&#8217;t like that one too much <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book #3: &#8220;Franklin&#8217;s Thrift&#8221;<br />
by David Blankenhorn, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and Sorcha Brophy-Warren</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://amzn.to/3pRjY2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-66385" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/franklins-thrift-book.jpg" alt="franklin's thrift" width="408" height="547" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/franklins-thrift-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/franklins-thrift-book-224x300.jpg 224w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/franklins-thrift-book-373x500.jpg 373w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>And lastly, we have a book inspired by the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ben-franklin-the-og-of-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OG of early retirement</a> himself, B. Franklin.</strong> Shipped to me a few years back by a reader of the blog (thanks Dave!) after seeing some of my posts on <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/thrift-lessons-samuel-smiles-1875/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thrift</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest and say I never did end up getting through to the end of it, but I do remember enjoying some of the stories from the beginning portions of the book. One I had on my night stand for a few months, but now time to go onto someone else&#8217;s!</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re a fan of the infamous B. Frank. too, or just enjoy history in general, this book&#8217;s for you&#8230; Here&#8217;s more from <a href="https://amzn.to/3pRjY2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>:</p>
<p>Americans today often think of thrift as a negative value—a miserly hoarding of resources and a denial of pleasure. Even more telling, many Americans don&#8217;t even think of thrift at all anymore. Franklin’s Thrift challenges this state of mind by recovering the rich history of thrift as a quintessentially American virtue.</p>
<p>The contributors to this volume trace how, from the eighteenth century on, the idea and practice of thrift has been a robust part of the American vision of economic freedom and social abundance. For Benjamin Franklin, who personified and promoted the idea, thrift meant working productively, consuming wisely, saving proportionally, and giving generously. Franklin&#8217;s thrift became the cornerstone of a new kind of secular faith in the ordinary person&#8217;s capacity to shape his lot and fortune in life.</p>
<p>Later chapters document how in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, thrift moved into new domains. It became the animating idea behind social movements to promote children&#8217;s school savings, create mutual savings banks and credit unions for working men and women, establish a federal savings bond program, and galvanize the nation to conserve resources during two world wars.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book #1: &#8220;Atomic Habits&#8221; by James Clear</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3TBbev0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66374" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/atomic-habits-book-james-clear.jpg" alt="atomic habits book" width="445" height="567" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/atomic-habits-book-james-clear.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/atomic-habits-book-james-clear-235x300.jpg 235w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/atomic-habits-book-james-clear-392x500.jpg 392w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></a></p>
<p>I finally finished this, and while it wasn&#8217;t *as*  incredible as I was expecting after the ENTIRE world was raving about it, I think that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;ve gotten a <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-magic-of-habit-stacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great handle over my habits</a> these past few years so a lot of the stuff wasn&#8217;t as new for me. Still, I came away more pumped and motivated and thoroughly enjoyed the stories shared throughout, so I do recommend it no matter your stage. It&#8217;ll just give you a bigger jolt I believe if you&#8217;re presently stuck or starting out in your habitual journey :)</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about it from <a href="https://amzn.to/3TBbev0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn&#8217;t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don&#8217;t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you&#8217;ll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p>
<p>Learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);</li>
<li>overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;</li>
<li>design your environment to make success easier;</li>
<li>get back on track when you fall off course;</li>
<li>&#8230;and much more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> do any of you remember PassivePanda.com from back in the day? Maybe around 2012 or 2013? That was one of James&#8217; first sites/projects and was really <em>really</em> good :) I remember face-timing with him a few times and he was always so nice and chill&#8230; (He was the one who introduced me to &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/physical-triggers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triggers</a>&#8221; btw that I blog about from time to time. Something I incorporate almost every single day!)</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book #2: &#8220;Broke Millennial Talks Money&#8221;<br />
by Erin Lowry</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3AuWC7y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66375" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/broke-millennial-talks-money-book.jpg" alt="broke millennial talks money" width="418" height="564" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/broke-millennial-talks-money-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/broke-millennial-talks-money-book-222x300.jpg 222w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/broke-millennial-talks-money-book-370x500.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /></a></p>
<p>This one I haven&#8217;t personally read, but that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;ve been on a &#8220;financial reads&#8221; hiatus since there&#8217;s only so much financial stuff you can take in each day :) Been a huge fan of Erin&#8217;s though from the beginning of her blogging days (<a href="https://brokemillennial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrokeMillennial.com</a>) so if you like her style you&#8217;ll probably enjoy this book too. This is the 3rd book in her &#8220;Broke Millennial&#8221; series, and covers &#8220;scripts, stories, and advice to navigate awkward financial conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more from <a href="https://amzn.to/3AuWC7y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s face it&#8211;talking about money is always awkward. In this user-friendly and approachable guide, finance writer Erin Lowry helps take the stress out of these tricky conversations. With scripts, tips, and troubleshooting advice, she takes you through every possible money talk scenario, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to tell your friends you can&#8217;t afford the same lifestyle they can</li>
<li>how to ask your parents if they can afford retirement and if they&#8217;ll need your support as they age</li>
<li>how to talk to your coworkers about your salary and negotiate with your boss</li>
<li>how to broach the subject of a prenup with your fiancé</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book #3: &#8220;Anything You Want&#8221; by Derek Sivers</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eatawk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66376 " src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/anything-you-want-book.jpg" alt="anything you want book" width="438" height="564" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/anything-you-want-book.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/anything-you-want-book-233x300.jpg 233w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/anything-you-want-book-388x500.jpg 388w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This is one of *many* killer books from <a href="https://sive.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derek Sivers</a> &#8211; one of my favorite &#8220;thinky&#8221; type people online&#8230;</strong> It&#8217;s basically his story of how he got started and what he&#8217;s famous for, and the book came out of a phone call he got from Seth Godin years ago asking him to write it down for his new publishing company. A few weeks later it was written, published, and then out the door! Pretty cool!</p>
<p>The only reason I&#8217;m giving it away is because he just came out with a new <em>revised</em> version that&#8217;s designed in the same size/format as his last few books so when you align them together in your library they all match perfectly <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Which I had to pick up as I can&#8217;t tell you how much that pleases me, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>This book actually comes without its cover because I tend to take them off since they look more classy that way&#8230; So the winner gets the book, but they have to be okay with its naked form since I can&#8217;t find where I stashed it now! ;)</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s more about it per <a href="https://amzn.to/3eatawk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When Derek Sivers started CD Baby, he wasn’t planning on building a major business. He was a successful independent musician who just wanted to sell his CDs online. When no one would help him do it, he set out on his own and built an online store from scratch.</p>
<p>He started in 1998 by helping his friends sell their CDs. In 2000, he hired his first employee. Eight years later, he sold CD Baby for $22 million.</p>
<p>Sivers didn’t need a business plan, and neither do you. You don’t need to think big; in fact, it’s better if you don’t. Start with what you have, care about your customers more than yourself, and run your business like you don’t need the money.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Derek&#8217;s books are the *only* ones I ever read more than once, and you can get through them in just about an hour or so as they&#8217;re super short, sweet, and succinct. If I ever cobble together a collection of my own essays from here, you can bet I&#8217;ll be copying his style :)</p>

<p>It comes from podcaster, and (early) retired hospice doctor, Dr. Jordan Grumet:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>&#8220;Taking Stock: </b><b>A Hospice Doctor’s Advice on Financial Independence, Building Wealth, and Living a Regret-Free Life&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t cracked it open yet but it&#8217;s already making some waves in our community, and from what I hear will be one of the next Big Ones people pass around similar to JL Collins’ <a href="https://amzn.to/3Pnbxq5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Simple Path to Wealth</a> and Morgan Housel’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3yzlmux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychology of Money</a>.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of being on Doc G&#8217;s podcast last summer and really liked him a lot. Super chill, super genuine and super <em>passionate</em>. You could tell he *really* cares about this stuff and comes from a pretty unique background &#8211; caring for people who are dying!!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the episode I hopped on if you want to check it out later:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll play along too: my worst financial regret was buying our first house back in 2008 with <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/my-worst-buyers-remorse-storythe-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0% down and no budget</a>&#8230; We were mentally and financially in no state to be buying a home back then, especially on a whim!, and a decade later when we sold we were <em>still</em> <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/we-sold-our-house-no-more-mortgages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15k underwater</a>, ugh&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course, it <em>did</em> lead to this blog and alter my life for the better <a href="https://jmoney.biz/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forever and ever and ever</a> so can&#8217;t hate on it too much, haha, but financially it was definitely the worst decision of my 42 years&#8230; Pending the verdict at least of my bitcoins <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
