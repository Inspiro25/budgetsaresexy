<p>And as we settle better into WifeFI here I&#8217;m realizing just how true this may be!</p>
<p>Earlier last month a good friend reached out and asked if I wanted to help him with some projects over at a new board game publishing company he just signed onto. He recently came on <em>board</em> as their Director of Marketing, and as usual we try to rope each other into our new endeavors to continue the fun ;) Even if we have no experience in the fields we get ourselves into! I couldn&#8217;t tell you jack about the gaming world except that of course Monopoly is the undisputed G.O.A.T of all time (don&#8217;t @ me!).</p>
<p><strong>But it&#8217;s been a blast so far, and true to that tidbit above, I&#8217;ve been very much enjoying the extra income as well.</strong> It&#8217;s hard to explain it exactly, but it&#8217;s a different <em>kind</em> of productiveness. One that feels distinct from a 9-5 or even a part-time job, but not nearly as rewarding as volunteering or being a Stay-At-Home Daddy (which ironically neither pays and one actually COSTS money, lol). But it does add a nice varied strand of productiveness that I didn&#8217;t notice was missing and will now have to incorporate it into my &#8220;ideal lifestyle.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, this new gig is a unicorn too and hits 3 out of 3 from the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-triad-of-hustling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Triad of Hustling</a>! My formula for knowing whether a project is worth taking on or not, or vice versa: deciding whether to KILL one or not.</p>
<p>The three variables of this triad are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of <strong>TIME</strong> the project requires</li>
<li>The amount of <strong>MONEY</strong> the project pays</li>
<li>And then, sometimes most importantly, the amount of <strong>FUN</strong> the project is</li>
</ol>
<p>Hit just <span style="color: #ff0000;">1 of the 3</span> favorably and it&#8217;s not worth pursuing at all. Hit <span style="color: #008000;">2 of the 3</span> and it&#8217;s a good possibility it&#8217;s worth it! But hit <span style="color: #008000;">3 of the 3</span> and it&#8217;s a guaranteed home run :) And, so far, this new board game gig has felt like an absolute home run. I get to work with my good friend and on *my own time*. It only requires about 5-10 hours/week. And, as we get farther and farther away from working full-time, it&#8217;s been nice dusting off my skills again and putting them back to use (I was brought on to help them build a community).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also admit I&#8217;m having a fantastic time learning about a whole other space out there that I didn&#8217;t even know existed! There&#8217;s soooooo many influencers in the gaming world just as there are in the PF space (maybe even more?), and again like the PF world they&#8217;re super inclusive and just trying to get people excited and learning *in real life*. From YouTubers to podcasters to TikTok&#8217;ers to bloggers it&#8217;s a pretty thriving community!</p>
<p><strong>And then of course it&#8217;s always nice to get paid fairly for helping out. </strong>Making me feel even more secure in my decision to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kinda-sorta-but-not-all-the-way retire</a>, lol&#8230;</p>
<p>I plan on using this money to cover all the <em>unexpected</em> parts of life, like flat tires and medical bills (I just had to get another round of infusions* for my disease &#8211; ugh!) as well as the GOOD unexpected parts like shiny new &#8220;wants&#8221; or books or new places to donate to. We haven&#8217;t tapped any of our investments during this semi-retirement (my wife&#8217;s income pays the bills, thus <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/wifefi-status-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wife-FI</a>!) but some months we do drain a little from our savings so this will be a nice way to stay topped off there too.</p>
<p><strong>So yeah, I&#8217;m a game board nerd now &#8211; watch out!</strong> Anyone else immersed in this booming community?? Or attend any of the millions of conferences all around the world??! (That&#8217;s right &#8211; there&#8217;s even BOARD GAME CONFERENCES!)</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t have ever forecasted this one, but you never know what&#8217;ll come out of the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year of The Flow</a>&#8230; Clear eyes, full hearts, baby! Anything can happen! :)</p>
<p>XOXO,</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> And now <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/did-i-just-get-laid-off-from-my-new-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I&#8217;ve been laid off</a> from said new board game gig!!! Lolol&#8230;.  53 days into it and the universe taketh away almost as fast as it giveth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Was fun while it lasted at least!</p>
<p><em>*Did I already tell you how much these infusions cost for my <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pemphigus-vulgaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pemphigus</a>? $20,000 a piece! And I always have to do a round of TWO! Thankfully insurance pays a bulk of it (my total comes down to $1,600 out of pocket from the $40k+) but man, medications these days are no joke&#8230; Don&#8217;t ever get sick, OK? ;)</em></p>

<p><strong>Found an intriguing note in my inbox this week and thought you&#8217;d enjoy it</strong> ;)</p>
<p>People are getting more and more creative with how they earn $$$ on the side!! File this one next to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/making-money-going-after-robocallers-side-hustle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing robocallers</a> for cash and uncovering hidden money as a <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-to-make-money-forensic-accounting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forensic accountant</a>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>Hi J Money,</p>
<p>I came across your blog post recently, and saw you describing how you won a lawsuit against your former employer, only to have them conveniently disappear. (Readers from 2011 will remember this! Where I got laid off but <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/taking-ex-employer-to-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never received my last paycheck</a>!)</p>
<p>Sadly this is all too common &#8211; in fact, only about <strong>20%</strong> of money judgments in the US ever get even partially collected on. Talk about ridiculous! I&#8217;m wondering if you might like to explore the possibility of actually collecting on that judgment?</p>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, it may be that the judgment is still enforceable. Many states stipulate that judgments expire after 10 years, but that&#8217;s not always true. If your judgment is still active (or even if you think it might be) I&#8217;d love to arrange a time for us to connect if you&#8217;re open to it.</p>
<p><strong>As far as who I am/why I&#8217;m interested &#8211; I am a private investor looking to add several uncollected judgments such as yours to my portfolio.</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, I am NOT an attorney, but I do have quite a bit of knowledge in this area. While I cannot provide legal counsel, what I can do is purchase and take assignment of judgments from those who have won them, and then proceed to pursue the debtor myself. So please let me know if you&#8217;d like to discuss this further, and I&#8217;ll be glad to give you more details at that point.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Mr. Investor</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>Fascinating right?! </strong>This guy is willing to do the dirty work for you so you can recover your long lost money!! Which is incredibly helpful as most people (like me) don&#8217;t know <em>jack</em> on how you&#8217;d go about chasing it down, or whether it&#8217;s even worth the time spent to spend on it or not&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course, you&#8217;d have to trust a guy enough to let him assume &#8220;ownership&#8221; of your judgment and act on your behalf, but if you can get past that it sounds like a helluva deal. Especially if you&#8217;re currently getting $0.00 of what you&#8217;re owed!</p>
<p>I told him thanks but no thanks in my particular case since I really don&#8217;t feel like opening up that can of worms again and plus the company has long been dissolved by now, but it did hit my curious spot so I wrote back:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>Hey dude! Bringing <span class="il">me</span> back a few years here! Haha&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not worth it to be honest as if I recall it was only a few thousand dollars which is less important to me today than it was back then, and unfortunately I don&#8217;t really keep in touch w/ the rest of the gang where we could all do a group thing or something to make it more worthwhile&#8230;</p>
<p>But I do appreciate the reach out and love the hustle! Do you do this stuff on the side or is it your main gig?</p>
<p>Reminds <span class="il">me</span> of <span class="il">the</span> latest installment of our Side Hustle Series: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/making-money-going-after-robocallers-side-hustle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;I’ve Made $40,000 going after illegal robocallers.&#8221; (Side Hustle #84)</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>His response:</strong></p>
<p>Totally understand, and thanks for getting back to me!</p>
<p>Just so you know, there&#8217;d be no out-of-pocket cost to you and very little effort required on your part if you wanted to pursue this further &#8211; basically what I&#8217;d do is take ownership* (officially called an &#8220;assignment&#8221;) of the judgment from the original creditor (you), which then enables me to pursue the debtor myself (I can&#8217;t represent you since I&#8217;m not a debt collector or attorney, so I have to essentially step into your place in order to do what I do).</p>
<p><strong>Then, I would split whatever I&#8217;m able to collect with you after accounting for any expenses I incur in the process.</strong></p>
<p>All I would ask is that you&#8217;re able to answer occasional questions to fill in any informational gaps I encounter. I would do all the legwork of enforcement such as post-judgment discovery subpoenas, levying bank accounts, asset seizure, placing of real estate liens, and so forth. There are even methods of pursuing debtors who have offshored their assets, though that likely wouldn&#8217;t apply in your case.</p>
<p>This is just a side gig for me at the moment, my primary expertise is in IT. I sort of fell into learning about judgment enforcement after suing a gym I used to belong to as a self-represented litigant after they refused to cancel my membership and stop billing me when they shut down for Covid. I had followed their instructions exactly, and they still refused to stop harassing me, even going as far as sending me to collections.</p>
<p><strong>As a matter of fact, it&#8217;s funny you mentioned robocall lawsuits, because the TCPA was actually one of the statutes I used to go after them since they were using an auto dialer to pester me about paying for the membership I had canceled months previously.</strong></p>
<p>In the end, I wound up withdrawing the lawsuit after they agreed to stop pursuing me and not muck up my credit score which was all I really wanted to begin with. So even though I didn&#8217;t end up winning a final judgment, I did a LOT of research and learning as the case progressed, which, among other things, led me to become pretty darn knowledgeable about how to enforce judgments.</p>
<p>As you and so many others have found out, it&#8217;s super common to have a debtor refuse to pay even after the judge bangs the gavel so to speak. I hadn&#8217;t done much with the knowledge I gained for a year and a half or so, but earlier this year shortly before my son was born, I decided to see if I could put my knowledge to use helping people like you who went through <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-court-has-spoken-j-money-wins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the trouble of seeing their cases through to the end</a>, only to be denied being paid a single cent of what they&#8217;re rightfully owed.</p>
<p><strong>I do try to be somewhat targeted with the judgments I purchase though &#8211; usually I&#8217;m looking for debtors that are businesses, and there are some states with stricter regulations that I steer clear of as well.</strong></p>
<p>Mr Investor</p>
<p><em>*The assignment of judgment to the enforcer is standard practice in most cases. If nothing else, just remember that I as the enforcer have every incentive to collect as much as they can from the debtor &#8211; if you don&#8217;t get paid, I don&#8217;t get paid! The only ways to have someone else collect on your judgment and avoid assignment are to either hire an attorney or work with a collections agency, and it&#8217;s rare that either of these options work in the creditor&#8217;s favor &#8211; attorneys of course will require substantial upfront and ongoing fees, and collections agencies will almost always just call people incessantly. Most attorneys receive almost no training in law school surrounding the enforcement of judgments, they are trained to litigate and bring a favorable resolution for their client but anything after that point is almost always up to the client to figure out for themselves.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>Gotta love the hustle!</strong></p>
<p>Sucks he had to go through all that nonsense, but now he&#8217;s armed and dangerous with all that knowledge &#8211; watch out future debtors!! Lol&#8230;</p>
<p>Or maybe even watch out <em>past</em> debtors of yours?? I asked him if it was cool to share our communication here and if he was open to hearing other cases that readers may be involved with, and he wrote back saying, &#8220;HELL NO &#8211; Are you an idiot! Don&#8217;t ever share this publicly, you turd!!!&#8221; J/K, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>He said sure &#8211; he&#8217;d be happy to help ;)</p>
<p>He has to be picky on which cases he takes on as he alluded to, but if you&#8217;ve got one you think could use some power behind to recover money legally owed to you, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/contact/">drop me a note</a> and I&#8217;ll forward it along to him.</p>
<p><strong>He also passed me this if you&#8217;re interested in digging deeper yourself:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone is considering going after a debtor on their own, or just wants to go a bit further down the rabbit hole and learn a bit more about some of the specifics involved in doing this, I highly recommend any content by <em>Joe Dickerson</em> of Financial Forensics LLC.</p>
<p>Here is one of my favorite videos featuring him: <a href="https://youtu.be/j34w1ZyVNSc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debt Collection: How To Locate Bank Accounts &amp; Other Assets To Enforce Judgments</a>. There are a few other videos of him I&#8217;ve found on YouTube, and he also did a limited podcast series a while back called &#8220;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-judgment-enforcement-hour/id1476093221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Judgment Enforcement Hour</a>&#8221; which was fantastic.  I found it on Apple Podcasts but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s available on other platforms too.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>Hope this helps!! </strong></p>
<p>In getting back some of your own money, or going down a new side gig path&#8230; It&#8217;s clearly not for everyone, but sounds pretty lucrative for all those bulldogs out there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/getting-paid-to-do-surveys/" title="I did surveys for money (and I liked it!)" rel="nofollow"><img width="550" height="330" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/typing-fast-jim-carrey.gif" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="jim carrey typing fast" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p>So this is cool &#8211;&gt; <strong>I&#8217;ve earned <span style="color: #008000;">$80.00</span> worth of Amazon credit! Woo!</strong></p>
<p>I started doing surveys for rewards last year when I was bored and trying to be more productive, haha, and then right before I was gonna quit &#8216;cuz I started getting busy again I decided to check and see what my points were worth&#8230;</p>
<p>And turns out, a lot more than nothing!</p>
<p><strong>So I quickly cashed them in and released my finger from the &#8220;delete my account&#8221; button, and then my kids blew through the $$$ in about 15 minutes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Still, worth the 5 hours total I probably spent on it over the months? And have actually come to enjoy giving my opinion over the money itself! The surveys are always so diverse and gets me to stop and *think* for a hot second which is great &#8211; at least after convincing my A.D.H.D. to pipe down, lol&#8230; (that&#8217;s probably the hardest part of all &#8211; sitting still for 15 mins straight and focusing!)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snapshot of my history so far from the year:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-65943" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-990x1024.jpg" alt="survey points rewards" width="620" height="641" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-990x1024.jpg 990w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-290x300.jpg 290w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-768x795.jpg 768w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-1060x1097.jpg 1060w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-550x569.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-483x500.jpg 483w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards-1044x1080.jpg 1044w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/survey-points-rewards.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p><strong>You can see how diverse the surveys are in that right-hand column&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve covered gaming, Covid, healthcare, climate issues, public affairs, financial items, and legal services. Pretty serious stuff, and all things most of us have opinions on! Or at least will LEARN you have opinions on after seeing the questions, lol&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually been *learning* a ton of stuff along the way too &#8211; namely that a lot of people have it much worse out there than I realized :( I like to think I have a good grasp on how &#8220;the other world&#8221; lives, but seeing some of the pointed questions asked throughout the surveys has def. helped put things in better perspective.</p>
<p>Here were some of the ones I copied down from the healthcare affordability survey, ugh&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever not seek treatment due to cost?</li>
<li>Ever not get medication because of cost?</li>
<li>Ever file bankruptcy or drop insurance or other equally as scary things because of not having money??</li>
<li>How confident are you that you could afford the health care you need if you, or a family member who is financially dependent on you, were to become seriously ill?</li>
<li>If you were to experience an unexpected medical event this year that left you with a bill for $1,000, how confident are you that you would have the money to pay the bill within 30 days?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can you imagine answering &#8220;yes&#8221; to those top ones? Or not being able to cover $1,000 just in general??! </strong></p>
<p>So heart wrenching, gosh&#8230; And perhaps there was a time I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to afford any of it myself, but no way I would have been left stranded with the family and support system I&#8217;ve been blessed with since birth. The biggest problem I had growing up was not being able to rock Nikes like all my friends <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But I digress&#8230;</p>
<p><strong> I&#8217;m now a survey monkey &#8211; did not see that coming!</strong> Haha&#8230;. especially since I&#8217;ve lasted over 14 years in this space without having been tempted! Just never assumed it was worth the trade off for time (and maybe it isn&#8217;t with other survey sites?!), but after being contacted by these guys and liking what they were about (seemed more serious and helpful than other silly surveys), I figured I&#8217;d give it a shot and see where I end up&#8230;</p>
<p>They are called <strong>AmeriSpeak</strong>, and even have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriSpeak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia page</a> so you know they&#8217;re legit <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Now unfortunately it looks like you have to be <em><strong>*invited*</strong> </em>to participate in their surveys (&#8220;to ensure that it represents a cross-section of U.S. households&#8221;), but if you wanna check them out in case one day you are, you can learn more here: <a href="https://www.amerispeak.org/">AmeriSpeak.org</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://amerispeak.norc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66093 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/amerispeak-logo.png" alt="amerispeak logo" width="398" height="127" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/amerispeak-logo.png 398w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/amerispeak-logo-300x96.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></a></p>
<p>They were created in 2014 by <a href="http://www.norc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NORC at the University of Chicago</a>, &#8220;whose studies inform government, business, and nonprofits to help them understand important topics related to society, education, employment, human development, and finance. Organizations such as Consumer Reports, the American Cancer Society, American Red Cross, Associated Press, Harvard University, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and many more, have asked NORC to conduct research for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>(And btw, I&#8217;m not getting compensated in the least to write about them&#8230; Though if I recall correctly, they did mail me a <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$5.00 bill</strong> </span>to get my attention in hopes I signed up, and it worked! Haha&#8230; Good job, marketing team <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</p>
<p><strong>While you can&#8217;t sign up to them though yet (maybe they&#8217;ll see this and let me invite some of you?!), here are other popular survey sites in the space in case you&#8217;re convinced to jump in and give it a shot too.</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t tested any of them yet, but if this itch continues I just may have to cheat on AmeriSpeak and hook up with others, haha&#8230; Would love to know which of these are worth it and which aren&#8217;t if you&#8217;ve tried any??!</p>
<p>Most popular sites:</p>

(<span style="color: #008000;">$10 bonus</span> when you first sign up)</li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> Forgot about <a href="https://www.mturk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Mechanicial Turk</a>! &#8212; another popular place to knock off some surveys. We did a side hustle post on it a few years back, check it out: <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/make-money-amazon-mechanical-turk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’ve Made $20,000 Through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other sites I hadn&#8217;t heard of before , but came up in my poking around:</p>

</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know if I end up deep diving into any of these later, but if you&#8217;re curious you can easily find reviews of them from other bloggers in the space. Taking surveys are always one of the top 3 &#8220;ways to make money&#8221; on peoples&#8217; lists. And if any of you are SUPER takers of them, lemme know as outside of Mechanical Turk I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve covered it much in our <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ways-to-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Side Hustle Series</a>? Would love to find someone who&#8217;s cracked the code and makes BANK!</p>
<p><strong>At any rate, there we have it&#8230; I now take surveys and I like it</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><strong>I have a story to share with you today that I stole from our good friend <a href="https://5amjoel.com/a-diamond-doesnt-shine-at-the-bottom-of-a-cave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joel</a> :)</strong></p>
<p>See if you can catch the lesson(s)!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>A father told his daughter, &#8220;Congrats on your graduation. I bought you a car a while ago. I want you to have it now. But before I give it to you, take it to a car dealer in the city. See how much they offer if you sell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl came back to her father and said: &#8220;They offered me $10,000 dollars because it looks very old.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father said: &#8220;Ok, now take it to the pawn shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl returns to her father and said: &#8220;The pawn shop offered $1,000 dollars because it’s a very old car and needs a lot of work done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next the father told her to join a passionate car club with experts and show them the car.</p>
<p>So the girl drove to the passionate car club. She returned to her father a few hours later and told him, &#8220;Some people in the club offered me $100,000 dollars because it&#8217;s a rare car in original condition!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the father said, “I wanted to let you know that you are not worth anything if you are not in the right place. If you are not appreciated, do not be angry, that just means you are in the wrong place. Don’t stay in a place where no one sees your value.”</p>
<p><strong>Know your worth and know where you are valued. A diamond doesn’t shine at the bottom of a cave.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Though I have to admit I was hoping for an even better lesson at the end, lol&#8230; Something along the lines of:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;You&#8217;re always worth a lot no matter where you are! Your worth is inside YOU &#8211;<br />
not what anyone says!&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>Or where I *actually* thought this was going because I&#8217;m a hustler:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;Always take the time to figure out the best place to maximize your profits!&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>Which I&#8217;ll admit isn&#8217;t as beautiful as the inner worth analogy, but still &#8211; just as true ;)</p>
<p>And I have the perfect example to show for it this week!</p>
<p>As I was heading out of an antiques store searching for <a href="https://jmoney.biz/bliss-consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more vintage rings</a>, I overheard a dealer offering a customer a price for his entire coin collection, to which the customer politely said thanks-but-no-thanks and went on his merry way.</p>
<p>As we crossed paths outside I asked him what he was trying to sell as I&#8217;m a curious little lad like that (and also smelled an opportunity!), and he then did what all collectors love to see&#8230; He opened up a binder full of 100 year old coins!! Which were obviously all for sale! *Drool&#8230;*</p>
<p><strong>He had recently inherited them from his grandfather, and not wanting to continue the family hobby at 20-something years old (weird?), he was looking to trade them for some cash money.</strong></p>
<p>We talked for a bit and I gave him my best advice on <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-to-sell-your-inherited-coin-collection-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to sell them for the most profit</a>, and in return he gave me a great price on one of them that I needed for my collection. (My ultimate goal is to get *one* of each major type of coin from the United States dating all the way back to the 1700s, and then display them at a local museum!)</p>
<p>Here she is in all her beauty:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-65888" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter-1024x514.jpg" alt="1914 barber quarter" width="678" height="340" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter-300x150.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter-768x385.jpg 768w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter-1060x532.jpg 1060w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter-550x276.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter-997x500.jpg 997w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1914-barber-quarter.jpg 1258w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[1914 &#8220;Barber&#8221; U.S. Quarter &#8211; the first coin I ever bought &#8220;on the streets!&#8221; Lol&#8230;]</em></p>
<p><strong>Now similar to the story above, this one also greatly hinges on *who* and *where* you&#8217;re trying to hawk your valuables to get the most value!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Taking them to a dealer will differ greatly than taking them to a pawn shop vs taking them to a collector friend you might know. Not only that, the <em>value</em> that&#8217;s assigned to them will vary wildly as well &#8211; even though it&#8217;s always exactly the SAME COIN!</p>
<p>For example, this quarter here can be valued in three unique ways:</p>
<p><strong>Face value</strong> &#8212; When the U.S. minted these from 1892-1916, they were assigned a face value of <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>25¢</strong></span>. And if you didn&#8217;t know anything about coins or collecting or anything, you&#8217;d at least be able to tell that since it literally states &#8220;quarter dollar&#8221; on the reverse of the coin :) So to all &#8220;normal&#8221; people, this coin is worth $0.25 and you can actually still spend it as it&#8217;s still considered legal tender!</p>
<p><strong>Silver value</strong> &#8212; Many don&#8217;t know this, but all U.S. dimes, quarters, half dollars, and dollars (coins) minted in 1964 and earlier <strong>contain 90% silver</strong>. And at a current rate of about $19.32/oz, that means each of these coins contain at least a few dollars worth of silver in them! This is why so many of us tell people to always check their change to see if they have anything good in there!</p>
<p>Now this Barber Quarter specifically (named so after the engraver, btw) contains approximately 0.18 oz of silver which equates to almost $3.50 (.18 x $19.32). So the &#8220;melt value&#8221; here is already <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>14x its face value</strong></span>!</p>
<p>And btw, this is the value that most pawn shops or jewelry stores give you where you see those &#8220;we pay cash for silver and gold&#8221; type signs posted. They don&#8217;t care about the type of coin or jewelry or silverware you bring in and will just weigh it, figure out the % of bullion each contains, and then spit you out a % of the total as your final &#8220;offer&#8221;. Which is usually 80-90% of the silver or gold value. From there they will bulk it all together with others they bought and cash it in for the full 100% value of the silver and gold &#8211; OR (if they&#8217;re smart and know what they&#8217;re doing) &#8211; they will sort through it all first and see if there&#8217;s anything valuable and rare and *then* ship it all off to be melted.</p>
<p>This was the case for my new friend here, who was offered probably around $3.00 per quarter which he (rightfully) turned down because each one was worth multitudes more than that, and some even in the <em>hundreds of dollars</em> due to collector value! But if you didn&#8217;t know about that third valuation, which we&#8217;re slowly getting to next, haha, you&#8217;d probably think this is a good deal and take it. So again the *place* matters where you go to sell this stuff!</p>
<p><strong>Collector value</strong> &#8212; Lastly, coins or other items that are collected are assigned a whole other set of values depending on its rarity and popularity and condition. Some cool old things aren&#8217;t worth jack, and some boring new things can be worth a killing &#8211; all depending on the hobby and trends and a number of other variables that come into play.</p>
<p>With this quarter in particular, it&#8217;s not very rare (over 6 million were produced!), but it <em>is</em> collected and in decent condition (grades conservatively as &#8220;Fine&#8221; and generously as &#8220;Very Fine&#8221;) and is worth around $35.00 according to our <a href="https://amzn.to/3PnYMMh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hobby&#8217;s price guide</a>. Which now puts its value as <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>140x face value</strong> </span>&#8211; a huge difference from $0.25! But again only matters if you&#8217;re talking to a *collector* as no normal person would ever pay such a premium ;)</p>
<p><strong>So TL;DR the 3 values that can be assigned to this coin are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Face value: <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$0.25</strong></span></li>
<li>Silver value: <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$3.50</strong></span></li>
<li>&#8220;Collector&#8221; value: <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$35.00</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>All drastically different values, and all for the exact same coin!</p>
<p>So again, *where* you take stuff to sell can matter greatly. If you have the time and energy to explore all the avenues, it&#8217;ll almost always net you more profit in the end. But if you&#8217;d rather unload them quickly for some fast cash, well, there are plenty of ways you can do that too, and which is why pawn shops are still all over the place! You&#8217;ll just have to be okay with getting substantially less in return going that route and more than likely getting ripped off.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how our friend here makes out in the long run, but it was a fun random bump in and love that it was a real life example of the cave story up there :)</p>

<p><strong>Huge thanks for taking the time to share your story with us, Steve!</strong> And FYI &#8211; Steve is not a lawyer or giving out any legal advice here or anything. He&#8217;s just outlining his story for us after I begged him to do it on Twitter because it was so fascinating ;) He&#8217;s made over $40,000 so far doing this &#8211; all in his spare time!!</p>
<p>Take it away, Steve!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">********</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How I Got Started</h2>
<p>More than 15 years ago a relative of mine was having an ongoing medical issue. I would get calls to my cell phone while at work, sometimes multiple a day, and they were never good news. Each time I heard my cell phone ring, it was like a mini heart attack.</p>
<p>About this same time frame I started getting robocalls, multiple times a day. When I would hear the robocall center start talking and realized the brief moment of panic I had just experienced was from someone I knew was breaking the law, the anger boiled over.</p>
<p>Fast forward to December 2020. At this point the relatives&#8217; medical issues had been long resolved but I was still getting the robocalls, often times 10 &#8211; 20 a day, every day. I would waste as much of the robocallers time as possible hoping at some point they would realize calling me was a waste of their time and would reduce the number of calls. The other hope was that if I was wasting their time, they would not be talking to a vulnerable senior citizen since they were talking to me instead.</p>
<p><strong>Long story short, they did not stop calling and I have not stopped wasting their time.</strong></p>
<p>One day, right around December 1st 2020, I get a call from an overseas call center and I play along as if I am interested and get to a US based insurance agent and I read him the riot act over the illegal robo call. He tells me to call their customer support which I did and I continued to read them the riot act.</p>
<p>About an hour later I get a call from the Philippines and the overseas caller says he is the one who called and asked if he could pay me instead of me suing his client and him losing the contract he has with them. I am thinking he is offering $20 or maybe $50.</p>
<p><strong>He says, is $1,000 enough?</strong></p>
<p>At this point I am thinking, this is not the first time this guy has paid for a violation. I do a little research and that is where I stumble upon the name <em><strong>Doc Compton</strong></em> and his <a href="https://www.robocalls.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turning Robocalls into Cash Kit</a>. (Not an affiliate link &#8211; just a super helpful resource)</p>
<p>Doc&#8217;s background is in consumer credit repair, and his kit sells for $47 which is packed full of valuable information and tells you how to go after these robo callers. He used to run a private Facebook group too where we would discuss tactics and exchange information on how best to get these guys which I received a lot of value from, but unfortunately it closed down due to FB group issues and the inability to keep things private (it turned out multiple people in the group were leaking information to call center / lead generators).</p>
<p>Doc now runs <a href="https://www.robocalls.cash/members-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a private forum</a> which costs about $200/year to be a member, but return on investment wise, both $ and time, it might be the best money I have ever spent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Process of Catching Robocallers</h2>
<p>Once I had more information, I started going through the process of figuring it all out&#8230; and it is a process.</p>
<p>You have to document calls, figure out the best tools to use to organize what you find, locate who is behind all the calls, find emails addresses, etc. There were multiple times where I thought this is just not going to happen. It&#8217;s like anything, starting a blog, a YouTube channel &#8211; you need to put in the effort, push past the frustration, and keep at it before it will pay off. Most people are not willing to put in the effort required to get to the pay off.</p>
<p>I keep at it and I get my first two checks within an hour of each other, one through Paypal from a call center in Pakistan and another from a local security system company delivered by UPS an hour later. Shortly after that I am on Twitter and a local reporter posts something about robocalls which leads to me becoming their featured story and news segment seen below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/investigations/robocalls/woodinville-steve-baus-robocall-revenge/281-f9d4564c-a98b-4219-9167-18250a680731/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-65791" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment-1024x572.png" alt="robocalls news segment" width="672" height="376" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment-1024x572.png 1024w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment-300x168.png 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment-768x429.png 768w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment-1060x593.png 1060w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment-550x307.png 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment-894x500.png 894w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/robocalls-news-segment.png 1492w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[<strong>King 5 News: </strong><a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/investigations/robocalls/woodinville-steve-baus-robocall-revenge/281-f9d4564c-a98b-4219-9167-18250a680731/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8216;It felt like a victory&#8217;: Woodinville man gets $3,100 in robocall revenge</a>]</em></p>
<p>Fast forward to today&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>With the settlements I should be receiving in the next couple of weeks, I will have put in my pocket, net of costs, about $40,000 chasing these callers down.</strong></p>
<p>I have settled about 15 total cases, only 1 of which I used an attorney which was settled before trial. One other case I filed a lawsuit on my own, which just settled this week before it went to trial.</p>
<p>But this is only the tip of the iceberg&#8230; I know many people who have made way more money than I have in a much shorter time frame. I only go after a small fraction of what I could, and if I were more organized the net profits in my pocket could easily be well over $100K.</p>
<p><strong>However the money is not the motivation for me. It&#8217;s about payback. It&#8217;s about getting these calls to stop.</strong></p>
<p>If you talk to the people in the Doc Compton group, the overwhelming majority are also more about getting these calls to stop than the money. Having a settlement agreement where it&#8217;s laid out how much more a call center / lead generator will pay you if they make the mistake of calling again is a real motivator for them to stop calling. That being said, I still get a similar number of calls each day, only with $40K more in my bank account now.</p>
<p>So here is a very high level overview of the process&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How to Get Paid by a Robocaller 101</h2>
<p>First: put your phone on the national do not call list &#8211; the &#8220;<strong>DNC</strong>&#8220;. Your phone must be listed for at least 30 days on the DNC before a call can potentially be a violation for it being on the DNC. Just do not think putting your phone on the list is going to in anyway reduce the number of calls you get because it won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Some people get paid through state laws. Those like me, whose state laws are weak or non existent, use the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, TCPA, which covers commercial telephone solicitations. Specifically sections 227b and 227c of TCPA which contain a private right of action. A private right of action simply means you can sue someone for money when they violate the law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 227b</strong> says a call can not be automated. For example, a call that is a recording that asks you to press 1 to speak to someone is in violation of 227b.</li>
<li><strong>Section 227c</strong> covers calls made to phones on the DNC. 227c specifically states you can not make more than 1 call to a DNC registered phone within a 12 month period. So a company can commercially solicit your DNC registered phone 1 time every 12 months if it is not using an automated telephone dialing system, ATDS. There is a lot of nuance in what is and is not an ATDS, however. The TCPA law dates back to the early 90s and could use some 30 year later updating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here is another important point to know: scam calls, those calls claiming to be Amazon support or the IRS or whatever is the latest scam, you will never get paid from.</strong> They are just criminals out to steal your money and are overseas outside of the reach of US law.</p>
<p>Anyone who calls you saying they are from the government, asking for your social security number, saying they are from Amazon or Apple, or Microsoft needing to access your computer, claiming to be from the cable company offering a deal to lower your bill, those are scams. Have some fun with them, waste as much of their time as possible so they are not stealing from Grandma, but don&#8217;t try to make money off them as you will fail.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Focus on US based companies attempting to solicit you</h2>
<p>To get paid, you need to get a call that is a violation of your state laws or either 227b and or 227c that ends in a <em>US based company attempting to solicit you.</em></p>
<p>This could be for health insurance, a security system, car warranty, internet services, or it could be a political action committee depending on their tax status, to give just a few examples. The key is to get past the call center who is almost certainly overseas, and who is almost certainly giving you a fake company name and spoofing the caller id &#8211; both violations of laws that do not have a private right of action.</p>
<p>Once you get past the call center to the US based company, you need proof of who they are. Get an address, an email, a valid call back number. That is the hard part and can take some time to learn the skills to do it. This almost always means you play along with the call until you have identified the US based company.</p>
<p>At times you may even need to purchase their product, as crazy as that sounds. My state has very specific laws regarding getting refunds from telephone solicitations. Buying the product is one way to 100% find out who was behind the call, then you simply cancel the purchase according to your state&#8217;s laws.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Demand Letter</h2>
<p>Once you have a case built up &#8211; you have 1 or more violations, you have proper identification &#8211; you send the US based company, who is equally liable for the TCPA violations as the call center they hired, what is called a <em><strong>demand letter</strong></em>. I like to email mine but some send the letter certified mail.</p>
<p>This letter outlines what happened, it explains the violation, the penalties they could face if you file a suit and they lose in court, and then you make an offer to settle.</p>
<p>TCPA specifies that each violation is <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$500</strong></span> but also states that if the violation is &#8220;willful&#8221;, that amount can triple. So the penalty for 2 violations is <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$1,000</strong></span> but would increase to <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$3,000</strong></span> if those violations are willful, that they knew they were violating the law and that they made no effort to avoid the violations.</p>
<p><strong>When the company gets your letter, they either respond or ignore. For me it&#8217;s about 50-50 if I get a response.</strong> Sometimes a response will say we disagree and then there is some back and forth communication. But it almost always ends in the company offering some sort of settlement which will almost always include a multiple page settlement agreement and will usually include a non disclosure section.</p>
<p>If the violator wants to include a non disclosure in the settlement, they need to pay extra, that is not part of the payment I am entitled for their violations. It is fairly standard for an NDA to increase the settlement amount by <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>$500</strong></span> or more. I know some who will not include an NDA unless they get a lot more than $500.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not get a response, it&#8217;s common to send what is called a final notice that states they ignored the first letter and the offer to settle so you will be filing a lawsuit as a result.</strong></p>
<p>Once again they may respond or they may ignore. If they ignore it, it&#8217;s now up to you if you file a lawsuit or not. If you are getting ignored and are not filing, the reason you are getting ignored might be the violator checked your local court system and found that you are not filing any suits.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">In Closing&#8230;</h3>
<p>I need to be very clear on something&#8230;</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. Laws also vary from state to state. I am just outlining what I do. What <em>you</em> can or should do might be completely different based on your location. The information I have provided here is just the tip of the iceberg. This is not for everyone. In fact, most people probably should not do this, going after robo callers for violating the law.</p>
<p>I would, however, encourage each and every person to waste as much of the robocallers&#8217; and scammers&#8217; time as possible. I would say if your motivation is making money and you do not get any satisfaction in any of the process, it&#8217;s probably not for you.</p>
<p><strong>I get extreme satisfaction knowing I am fighting back, that I am being a pain to those who caused me so much pain, and that by spending time with me means they are not trying to sell my elderly mom an incredibly poor product at an inflated price because that is why they are violating the law in making these calls &#8211; they are not able to legitimately sell their products using legal marketing.</strong></p>
<p>I would close by saying this is not free money, and is not for everyone. I just happen to have some of the skills that help me, and more importantly I have the motivation that they provided 15 years ago with my sick relative.</p>

This topic has been discussed over and over within the FI world, and with good reason: side hustles are both interesting and a chance to make some extra moolah!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I&#8217;ve always had a love/hate relationship with the idea of side hustles. Often I hear about someone&#8217;s side hustle and I think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;dude, that&#8217;s just a boring second job &#8211; who wants that!?&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other times I&#8217;m like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;yee-ha, that sounds cool! Even if it pays crap, I want to try it&#8221;.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why my hesitation? I think it&#8217;s because I see side-hustles as both a potential outlet for passion, and a potential trap for disappointment. Let me explain:</span></p>
<h2><strong>What I love about side hustles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s a chance to spend time doing something </span><b><i>you are good at and enjoy</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the primary benefit in my eyes, as hopefully money doesn’t dictate our lives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s a chance to make some extra $ in your life, potentially with tax benefits superior to employee compensation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having 2 sources of income adds a back-up in case your primary job slips. Or, your side hustle could potentially grow big enough to be your main gig. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What I don&#8217;t like about side hustles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often it&#8217;s just a second job. You end up </span><b><i>trading time for money doing something you dislike</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, I personally don&#8217;t enjoy cleaning floors, so I&#8217;d call a night-gig as a janitor a second job, not a fun side hustle. This wouldn’t add happiness to my life.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes turning your hobby into a ‘job’ can kill the passion. For example, if I sold my painted rocks on Etsy, it might bring a few hundred dollars a month in revenue, but it completely kills the joy I get from giving my art away for free.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why do I feel this way?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, I personally feel a potential trap to miss out on life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a real-life example: during college my brother worked a night gig at a bank, reviewing mortgage applications for a year. This was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tangentially</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> related to his college studies and he made a small fortune for a college kid. Cool, right? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, he tells me he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“missed every sunset of 2006 at the age of 23”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That supposed small fortune of money is now inconsequential to him, and he&#8217;s never going to be 23 again. In hindsight, he says the tradeoff wasn’t worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I </span><b><i>LOVE</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hearing about side gigs and second jobs that allow people to live more of life, not less. I do believe that side hustles can be a tradeoff worth making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a happy example: my friend works for a pharmaceutical company, and she can pick up work at CVS as a pharmacist on Sundays (earning double-time!). For a few years in her early career she worked on Sundays at CVS, even though her primary job paid well. She never relied on this job, and she eventually bought an investment property and left that side gig. She’s happy with the trade-off she made, and genuinely enjoys what she does. </span></p>
<h2><strong>So what’s a good side hustle?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my mind, the ideal side hustle would be </span><b>both</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highly enjoyable and lucrative for the time input. In reality, I think many side hustles end up being a tradeoff between one or the other, which is just part of life I guess. And since life is full of tradeoffs, let’s not get discouraged when searching for a great side gig.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Side hustles of my past – the good, the bad and the meh</strong></h2>
<p><b>GOOD: Freelance bartender:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I used to serve drinks at weddings when I was in my early 20’s, when my primary job was sales. I loved it! Pouring drinks, laughing, even dancing with people who were all celebrating – what’s not to love? But eventually I kind of grew out of it and focused on my sales career. I guess life moved on, but I have great memories from that time!</span></p>
<p><b>BAD: “Family conveyor belt”.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In hindsight, this is more funny than bad. As a young teenager I took on a paper route. Unlike the movies, where a cute kid rides a bike to deliver newspapers, this job was delivering junk mail and it wore out the whole family! Mum had to drive me to pick up thousands of flyers, my 3 siblings and I set up a conveyor belt system on the kitchen table, and then as a family we packaged hundreds of stacks of different junk mail for delivery. The job paid almost nothing, and it literally took all 6 of us (parents helping too) to achieve the crazy-high quota of junk mail delivery I had. We all laugh about it now.</span></p>
<p><b>MEH: Second job at Post Office</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I spent 6 months working nights doing postal sorting in my youth. Similar to my brother, I made what I thought was a buttload of money at the time. But I worked every night, ignored my friends, and missed out on some opportunities to enjoy life at that age. I have no regrets, but won&#8217;t be doing a hustle like that ever again.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Side hustles I wouldn’t mind trying</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Part time tax preparer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – I like this idea because by helping others file taxes, I can take on work seasonally as it suits me. It helps others and is a valuable, marketable skill. I’m a nerd and I find taxes kind of fun.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Nursing home assistant </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– a friend of mine picked up casual work caring for elderly during college while studying to be a Registered Nurse. Casual work paid well and the experience was valuable after she graduated. I do volunteering now, and can see myself stepping up to a caring role some day. Maybe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sports umpire </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– 2 different friends in my life have been football umpires, and both really enjoyed the job. In one case it was Australian football, where the umpires need to run A LOT! Not sure if I’d be fit enough.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Side hustles I probably will never try</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Medical experiments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A friend of mine took part in a few drug trials during their college years for a few dollars. She ended up getting a weird unexplainable rash from it. The compensation was small. I’m all for medical advancement, but not sure I’m ready to sacrifice my health.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MLM’s</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever had a call from a friend who wants you to try a new product, and then start selling it too? I can’t fathom selling to my friends and family, no matter how good the product or service is. I know MLM’s work for some people, but they’re not for me :)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>AirBnB my house or spare bedroom</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the reasons my wife and I are </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/selling-our-rental-properties-2-down-2-to-go/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling our rental properties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to get out of tenant management and dealing with renters. No matter how much we can make, renting out our home brings on too much stress for what it’s worth IMO.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What do a lot of successful side hustles have in common? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a few things. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucrative side gigs often exploit a unique skill or qualification a person might have, which usually allows them to offer services that demand a premium over minimum wage. Often that skill or qualification was gained from their primary job. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The side-gig often brings a benefit to a person’s primary job. This means that there are non-monetary benefits from the side-gig, like hands-on experience or widening your network, that are in turn leveraged by the primary job. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think side gigs are often temporary in nature, like my pharmacist friend who worked toward a goal with her second job, achieved it, and then moved on.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FI people love the book “</span><a href="https://amzn.to/3CKR4EY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Money or Your Life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” by Vicki Robin. Among other things, it discusses similarities between work and hobbies. One takeaway for me was that if you don’t consider getting paid, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can get from a job can also be found in a hobby. That means passion, achievement, teamwork, socializing and serving others – all of these things can be found when you’re working for free!</span></p>
<h2><strong>So, are side hustles worth it?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess at the end of the day it all depends on your “why”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side hustles are a great opportunity to learn, follow our passions, and hopefully earn some extra $ on the side! But also, I often suspect that if we put that extra effort into our primary job or career development, we might be able to increase our primary income without a side hustle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So personally, here’s my advice: if you need extra money and are looking for a side hustle, start by looking at your primary job. Can you put in the hours for a promotion or job change? Or is there a related service you can offer? Working in an area you already specialize in can lead to more income.</span></p>
<p><b>If not for money, think about your passions. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a way you can find casual work in this passion? If you never make any big money from your passion, will it still be time well spent? Probably!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget &#8211; the world always needs more volunteers, and trust me there will be a rewarding role you can fit that is always worth your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you all a great week ahead, doing what you love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Joel</span></p>

I just added it up and realized I’ve earned $9,114 in extra money this year, on top of my regular salary. Woohoo, gig economy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t a huge amount of extra cash, but it’s pretty dang good considering I haven’t been “hustling” that much this year. It’s been more of a collection of random gigs I’ve found or stumbled across in my spare time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a breakdown of earnings from side jobs, and more importantly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how I came across</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these opportunities in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$130 &lt;&#8212;- buying and selling stuff online</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$419 &lt;&#8212;- selling *my friend’s* stuff online</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$150 &lt;&#8212;- “consulting”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$400 &lt;&#8212;- modeling</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,000 &lt;&#8212;- new bank account bonuses</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,100 &lt;&#8212;- new credit card bonuses</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5,925 &lt;&#8212;- extra SEO work for my employer</span></p>
<p><b>$9,114 Total</b></p>
<h2><b>Make Extra Money by Asking for More Work From Your employer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By far my biggest extra bucks have come from additional contract work at my employer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically, I’m a freelance writing contractor, so I can work for multiple companies at the same time. But I’ve only ever had 1 client &#8212; and I’d prefer to keep it this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late December last year, I emailed my boss’s boss out of the blue and requested a 15-minute “catch up call.” It had been a while since we had spoken so I thought I’d say happy holidays and do a quick self-performance review.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**BTW &#8211; I encourage everyone to reach out to your senior management and request 15-minute calls once and a while. As long as you don’t waste their time, it helps you stay connected, front of mind, and it’s a great opportunity to share information with each other up and down the company food chain. This kind of initiative can boost your earning potential, too.**</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, right at the end of my call, I dropped this simple line:  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, by the way, I have some spare time up my sleeve and have an interest in SEO work. If there are any teams you know of that could use my help, I’m available &#8212; and keen.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lo and behold, 2 weeks later another team manager reached out to me requesting some help with random SEO (search engine optimization) tasks in addition to my &#8220;day job.&#8221; Although I don’t really have any experience with SEO as a technical skill, I’m an excellent out-of-the-box thinker and have unmatched enthusiasm for new challenges. They offered me a whopping $75 per hour, and so far this year I’ve worked 79 hours on this freelance job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part is that I can manage my own schedule, working a few hours here and there when I’m free. Since I get up at 5am every day, I can knock out a couple hours in the morning on Saturdays or Sundays without interfering much with my daily life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I definitely realize how lucky I am and that these types of high-paying hourly jobs don’t grow on trees. But whenever friends ask me how I found work like this, I tell them → </span><b>because I asked for it.</b></p>
<h2><b>Get Supplemental Income From Credit Card and Bank Account Bonuses</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I have signed up for 3 new bank accounts and 4 new credit cards so far in 2021. Here are the bonuses we’ve received:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 &#8212; PNC Bank checking account bonus</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$400 (x2) &#8212; Capital One 360 Checking account (me and wife)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$300 (x2) &#8212; AMEX Blue (me and wife)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 &#8212; BOA Cash back credit card</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$300 &#8212; Capital One SAVOR credit card</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I typically only recommend</span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/churning-bank-accounts/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bank account churning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or opening new credit cards if you are extremely detail oriented, are good at taking notes, and can handle credit responsibly!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these accounts take less than 15 minutes to set up, a little coordination to make sure you are hitting criteria to qualify for the bonus, then less than 15 minutes to shut down the account afterwards. Over the past 3-4 years my wife and I have opened 30+ accounts, and probably have earned close to $10k in extra cash. It’s not a huge amount, but for the time trade off, we think it’s always worth it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find the best current bank bonuses, I check</span><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/best-bank-account-bonuses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this Doctor of Credit website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regularly. And for credit card bonuses, here is</span><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/best-current-credit-card-sign-bonuses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the best page for that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you’re interested.</span></p>
<h2><b>Earn Extra Income With Consulting</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late last year, I met a guy while surfing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a calm day, we were both just sitting there on our boards &#8211; so I smiled, said hello, and struck up a random conversation. He worked at a bank, and I told him I write about finance. We exchanged emails in the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few months went by, then I received an email from him. He wanted to learn more about the FIRE movement, and get some feedback on a financial app he’s building&#8230; He asked for a phone call, and offered to pay me $150 for 30 minutes of my time. Whoa! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f633.png" alt="😳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never been a “consultant” before. But just by striking up random conversations, weird opportunities have started landing in my lap.</span></p>
<h2><b>Get Additional Income by Modeling</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the $400 my wife and I made modeling, we landed this by just staying in contact with old friends. About 10 years ago we did some small photo shoots for a gal here in LA, and she reached out to see if we were interested in a quick private gig. It took about an hour to shoot, and they came to our house so there was no traveling time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, the shoot was private so the photos will never be seen publicly. But, here’s an old one of me and my wife back in 2013 &#8212; someone spotted us on a marketing billboard at a real estate conference…</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64169 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Joel-realtor-photo-rotated-e1629085083200.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were posing as a new couple buying a house.</span></i></p>
<h2><b>Make Extra Money Buying and Selling Stuff Online</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding and selling stuff online is probably my lowest pay per hour hobby. But I love it! I don’t care if I only profit a few dollars&#8230; It amazes me that one person’s trash is another person’s treasure, and the lucky middleman can make a profit just by connecting people and negotiating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year I found a free surfboard, a compost tumbler, and an antique pocket watch at an</span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-to-find-estate-sale-deals-from-a-beverly-hills-bargain-hunter/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">estate sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearby. I made a little over $100 from selling these on Craigslist and OfferUp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my neighbors down the street caught wind that I liked selling stuff and asked me to help clear out some of his storage locker. He gave me a few boxes of stuff (mostly old Lladro figurines) and offered to split the profits with me if I sold them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far this year I’ve made $549 selling stuff online. Not a huge amount, but it pays for a month&#8217;s worth of groceries for us. :)</span></p>
<h2><b>Work That I *didn’t* take = $4,000+?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a fun email I got from a buddy a few months ago…</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64170 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Friend-Job-Opp-e1629085091701.png" alt="" width="600" height="288" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(If you can’t read it, the offer was to get paid to go buy buckets of pool chlorine at Costcos.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as I’d love to make quick cash for a few days, I cannot think of a more horrible second job than shopping at Costco. I turned this down and referred some other friends to help out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another opportunity I got was to work as a personal assistant (PA) on some photo shoots for a production company here in Los Angeles. I used to work odd jobs for a friend a few years ago and the pay was quite good! $350 per day, and the job of a PA is to just drive people around, get coffees on set, order lunches and run general errands. I really liked being a PA, but the timing didn’t work out for this particular gig.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there you have it. That’s how I made an extra $9,114 with side jobs so far this year &#8230; by asking for work, striking up conversations with strangers, keeping up with old friends, taking advantage of bonuses and just generally keeping my eyes open for opportunities.</span></p>

If you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">own something</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can rent it out to others when you’re not using it and make some spare cash. And if you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to use something</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can rent stuff instead of buying stuff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owners make money. Renters save money. Sharing stuff = less waste. It’s a win/win/win!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re all familiar with AirBnB, VRBO and house-swapping platforms. But did you know you can rent out your stand-up paddle board when you&#8217;re not using it? Maybe you’ve got spare tools in your shed you rarely use or a closet full of nice dresses that you barely wear&#8230; Peer to peer sharing platforms let you rent them out for extra cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recently went down an Internet rabbit-hole and found a whole bunch of apps and sites I didn’t know existed. So I thought I’d make a list and share them with you all in case you can make some extra money renting out your stuff this summer (or save money by renting other people’s stuff!)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Fair warning: Not every site or app is available in every country/city. Also make sure you check out and are comfortable with all the terms and conditions before signing up for anything!**</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>How to Rent Out Your Garage, Back Yard, or Swimming Pool</strong></h2>
<p><b>Swimming pool (~$50 per hour):</b> <a href="https://swimply.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is for neighborhood pools and hot tubs! If you’ve got a pool at home that you’re not using much this summer, consider renting it out hourly on the days you’re not using it.</span></p>
<p><b>Backyard doggy play area (~$15 per hour):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have a large backyard that could make a good doggy play area, you can list it for rent on </span><a href="https://www.sniffspot.com/host"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SniffSpot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are a ton of pet owners that live in apartment complexes who would love to bring their pet to your place. (Just make sure they clean up the poop &#8211; or maybe you can charge extra for </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-pet-waste-removal-aka-pooper-scooper/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pooper scooper service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?)</span></p>
<p><b>Home storage space or yard space ($$ varies per size &#8212; monthly income): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Have spare room in your basement? Maybe an extra large driveway? Or perhaps you have extra space in your closet? Rent it out on one of these sites so people can pay you instead of buying a storage unit.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.neighbor.com/host"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lets you list your available home storage to locals. Car/boat storage, closet storage or just empty rooms. Like being a landlord at a storage facility, but for people’s random belongings at your home.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.storeatmyhouse.com/list-your-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store At My House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps you list your empty space, book and accept payments via their site, and start making monthly income quickly. :)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Rent Out Your Garden</strong></h2>
<p><b>Backyard meditation space ($20 &#8211; $50 per hour):</b> <a href="https://start.healinggardens.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healing Gardens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the coolest platforms I found! If you own a beautiful garden or outside deck area, you can rent it out to people who can work remotely there, host a yoga class, or just sit in silence and meditate. People in busy cities LOVE to relax in quiet and hidden yards, so let them pay you to sit in yours!!</span></p>
<p><b>Planting or growing space ($$ varies per yard size): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The site </span><a href="https://sharedearth.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shared Earth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lets you list your unused residential garden space to people who want to grow veggies, flowers, etc. (Just make sure they’re not growing anything that’s illegal in your area.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another platform for gardens is </span><a href="https://yardyum.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YardYum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They connect landowners with gardeners who pay monthly to rent out gardening space. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Ways to Rent Out Your Land for Camping</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought my advice on </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/raw-land-investing-bill-gates-and-the-stock-market-scaries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investing in raw land</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was crap and you went ahead and bought some anyway… I have good news! Here are a few websites that will help you list your land to campers and RV-ers so you can generate some rental income:</span></p>
<p><b>Land for camping ($20-$100+ per night):</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US/host"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HipCamp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a growing community of nature lovers who camp and “glamp” on private land. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone with a property that helps people connect with nature can be a Hipcamp Host!”</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.tentrr.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tentrr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a newer platform and is growing in popularity now that the pandemic is letting up. Many public campsites are already full this summer so campers might love to check out your land instead!</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.homecamper.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeCamper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> covers a handful of U.S. states, and some international locations, such as Spain, Scotland, Wales and Australia. They also facilitate gardens, pools, and camper rentals.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://campspace.com/en/host"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campspace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seems to be primarily for the UK, Germany and Netherlands. Anyone own camp land out there?</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Rent Out Your Car, Motorbike, Boat or RV</strong></h2>
<p><b>Boats and watercrafts (~$500+ per day, or ~$1000+ with a captain):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With the site </span><a href="https://www.boatsetter.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BoatSetter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can rent out your boat of any size when you’re not using it. You can also include yourself as a private captain and charge a whole lot more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, </span><a href="https://www.getmyboat.com/boat-rental/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetMyBoat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a popular peer to peer rental site with ability to list worldwide.

<p><b>Rent out your motorbike (~$60+ per day):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here are a few apps and websites that let you rent out your motorbike for extra money.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.riders-share.com/list-your-bike"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RidersShare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Apparently some of the top hosts make more than $6k per month renting out their bikes to private riders!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.twistedroad.com/list-your-motorcycle"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TwistedRoad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It takes about 5 minutes to sign up and list your bike and then you can start accepting rentals and earning extra cash.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.eaglerider.com/rent-my-motorcycle"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EagleShare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The parent organization here is Eagle Rider (I’ve personally rented from them before), but EagleShare is for people listing their own and unique bikes for rent. The rental platform handles both company owned and privately owned bikes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Rent out your car (~$80 &#8211; $200+ per day): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Car sharing is becoming incredibly popular. For people who don’t drive their car much, or have a second car sitting around, consider renting it out on one of these sites…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://turo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is probably the most popular site for car rentals. Doesn’t matter if you have an old shitty Volkswagen Beetle or a fancy new Audi… Someone will probably want to rent it for the right price!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.getaround.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getaround</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has more than 2 million users in the U.S.!

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.hyrecar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HyreCar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is interesting because they seem to be specific to Uber and Lyft rentals. So you could purchase a fleet of cars and rent them out to Uber and Lyft drivers. Kind of like setting up your own business!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Rent out your RV (~$100 &#8211; $200+ per night):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you own a camper van, motorhome, or a fancy tricked-out RV you can list it for rent on one of these awesome RV rental platforms…</span></p>

<h2><strong>How to Rent Out a Parking Space</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s amazing how much parking costs these days. If you own a parking spot in a desirable work location, or even if you live close to a sporting stadium and have spare car spots, you can rent them out daily or monthly for extra money with these sites:</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Rent Out Your Friendship?</strong></h2>

</span></p>
<p>Lastly, instead of renting out your stuff, you might just consider getting rid of it completely using <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/selling-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling apps</a>. That way you can pocket a larger amount of cash upfront, and not have to deal with people!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Friday and have fun whatever you get up to this summer!</span></p>

Top o’ the morning to ya! (Not sure why I just wrote that &#8211; I definitely don’t speak this way in real life.)</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest post is from Gary at </span></i><a href="https://www.financialfives.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial Fives</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sharing about his side hustle of renting out moving boxes! What I love about Gary’s story is that he’s truly proud of the value he’s providing to the world. Starting any business is difficult, but it’s 100X easier if you have a passion for the industry you’re in! (Not to mention, if you love what you do, you can continue your fun work even after reaching <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>How I Started a Side Hustle That Connected My Passion to My Skills</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably had enough about “hustle culture” and videos or podcasts about “maximum productivity” and waking up at 4 am to meditate. Don’t worry, that’s not the point of this post! I myself have garnered an aversion to those who advocate acting like a machine and accounting for every waking minute on your calendar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know about you, but I like to enjoy life and live in the present, and if that takes me longer to reach FI, I’m 100% fine with that. Tomorrow is never guaranteed, so if we don’t take the time to bask in the sun or bike through a trail, what’s the point of all of that hustle? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that being said, I think having a side hustle, as humble or lucrative as it might be, is a strategic way to reach FI. As you’ve surely heard, you can only cut your expenses so much, but your earning potential is virtually unlimited. Since I was a little late to the party being a millennial who graduated college the same year Instagram was born, </span><b>my side hustle came out of a need to feel like I am doing something to fix one of the biggest problems in my view: trash.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I read that the</span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/united-states-most-wasteful-country-world"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">United States is the #1 trash-producing country in the world!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f92e.png" alt="🤮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> That’s something I’m certainly not proud to be #1 in.  I wish I had the mind of an engineer to create compostable snack wrappers or start the company that came up with the coveted Hydroflask. Luckily though, I did have a knack for sales and negotiation, so that worked in my favor. </span></p>
<h2><strong>My Side Hustle: Renting Moving Boxes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My side hustle is a moving box rental company called</span><a href="https://www.calboxrental.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">California Box Rental</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was born after seeing the heaps of cardboard boxes piled next to dumpsters next to apartments and dorms by UCLA, where I went to college. I found that there were other companies that offered this concept in Canada, so I figured since there was nothing like that in my hometown of Sacramento, CA, that I would start one! </span></p>
<h2><strong>How a Moving Box Rental Company Works</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My business works like this: A customer contacts us looking for boxes to move or</span><a href="https://www.financialfives.com/post/5-ways-being-organized-will-save-you-money"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to organize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we help them create a rental package, we deliver the boxes and other equipment to their doorstep, they keep them for up to 4 weeks, then we pick them back up! No waste, no building up boxes or packing tape, no damaged items from overstacking or soggy cardboard after a rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what the boxes look like:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-64029 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/moving-box-e1623399235296.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="449" /> <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-64028 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/box-w-dolly.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="550" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These boxes are incredibly durable. We&#8217;ve had maybe 10 boxes break or become damaged out of our entire inventory over the last 8 years, and that&#8217;s usually due to mishandling. They are made from commercial grade recycled plastic, and the biggest issue if they&#8217;re used too heavily is the hinges or top flaps can become damaged. I&#8217;d say they have a life of 8-10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as rental rates, we don&#8217;t rent per box, rather per &#8220;bundles&#8221; catering to how big the client’s job is. The most popular package we rent is our House Bundle, which is 50 boxes, a few rolling dollies, a wardrobe box, etc and that rents for $189 per week. We also charge $100 for round trip delivery within 25 miles of our storage facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the boxes aren’t in use, we store them in a storage unit at a self-storage facility. We&#8217;re still pretty small, and my business partner owns a moving company, so it made sense to save money to store them there rather than rent a warehouse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since sustainability and zero waste is a huge passion of mine, and this kind of business requires little startup capital (It cost me less than $2,500 to get up and running) I figured I’d give it a go, and we’ve been going strong for 8 years!</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Start-Up Challenges for a Side Hustle</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hardest part of a business is just getting started. I would say the biggest challenges we had to overcome when we started was convincing people that this model was the new way to move. The idea of renting reusable boxes rather than buying cardboard ones was new to virtually everyone in town, even though it was flourishing in other cities. Even if people see our reviews or are contacted by us, we used to be easily dismissed. Now, the sustainability movement is really helping us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hardest part of </span><b>growing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the business is customer acquisition, but also managing and cleaning inventory. When you are not a high-volume business, you can&#8217;t pay someone by the hour to clean boxes or deliver them. Also, when a customer orders 100 boxes, they don&#8217;t always check to make sure all the inventory is there, so it becomes a &#8220;he said she said&#8221; situation if things aren’t accounted for properly. Other times, we might miss a box that is stacked to be cleaned and sanitized, and if a customer gets a dirty box they are not too happy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing I wish we did differently was having a better marketing plan in place so word of mouth spreads quicker. I always thought that the best brands don&#8217;t advertise, their quality speaks for itself and their customers are their biggest fans. We have 5-star reviews across the board, so our customers do love us, but I think </span><b>limiting our marketing budget is also limiting our revenue.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s just a side hustle to me though, I don&#8217;t think I have the capacity for running it full time!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Starting a Passive vs. Active Side Hustle</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I went with starting a business from scratch was partially for bucket list reasons, but also for control. When you start your own business, you control the price, who your target market is, how to market your product/service, and so on. I knew that if I put substantial effort upfront, it could turn into more of a passive income stream for me, rather than exchanging my time for money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is key; you want to decide if your side hustle should be trading your time directly for income, or if you want to put a little more effort upfront so that it’s more of a passive income stream, allowing you to focus on other projects (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXQGV75"><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as writing a book!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It’s not a bad thing if you don&#8217;t want to go the passive income route, in fact, it’s very noble! If you have a passion or knack for writing, designing websites, or interviewing people, there is plenty of money to be made by doing that. Some people, including myself, also get satisfaction out of doing something productive in our off hours to earn an income, which we can then use to reward ourselves or motivate ourselves that we can in fact reach FI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For</span><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-box-rental-rocklin"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">California Box Rental</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I figured if I put in effort upfront to create preferred vendor incentives with realtors, mortgage brokers, moving companies, and property management firms, that I would have to put in less effort later on. We are primarily a referral focused business, we don&#8217;t really advertise at all. While I’m sure we could earn more if we advertise more, my goal is to invest in an amazing customer experience so they act like our biggest promoters. So far it’s working, and we have a 5-star rating on both Google and Yelp! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This business model has also allowed me to live across the country and not be tied to our physical service area. I handle all customer inquiries, invoices, and marketing, and I have a business partner who is local that coordinates deliveries and cleaning of the inventory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My business is not 100% passive, but it requires very little work outside of marketing to draw up a rental agreement and send it to the customer. Any time our boxes are in the customer’s possession, we are earning money. Whether they rent for 1 week or 4 weeks adds no more work on my end, yet we charge them more. </span></p>
<h2><strong>The Future of Moving Boxes, and Life After FI..</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My goal with California Box Rental is to continue to grow it because we are the only show in town for now, and the sustainability movement is catching on quickly. Hopefully, in a few years, we’ll either triple in size or be acquired, so that there is a lot more capital to focus more on commercial and multifamily residential markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after achieving FI, I’m still planning to stay busy and work on things that interest me. I would like to become more involved in local policies and also philanthropy/advocacy around my passions of conservation, sustainability, and multimodal transit. Another goal of mine down the road is to create a coworking/entrepreneurial food hall in my hometown to foster innovation and also have a cool place to hang out!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My advice to you if you want to start a side hustle business is (1) find something you’re passionate about and that you’d do for free (2) find a way to monetize it and (3) don’t get in over yourself or risk your all of your hard-earned money in something that may not work out. Start small, do your research, watch and listen to others who have come before you, and have fun! If it doesn’t work, it’s not the end of the world. It’s a lesson to do better in the future, not a failure.</span></p>

HAPPY FRIDAY!!!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Got a fun story for y’all today&#8230; My buddy </span></i><a href="http://moneyselfmade.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alise</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, aka the &#8220;Pandemic Gift Fairy,&#8221; is sharing how she started a quarantini business last year  &#8212; it’s called </span></i><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">StirCrazi</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I love most about Alise’s story is the combination of </span></i><b><i>GRIT + trial and error</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you&#8217;re interested in starting an online business or want to jump on a growing trend, check out how it&#8217;s done below. ]</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*******</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember in-person parties? Well, that is where this story begins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Way back in 2014, my pal </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/TillysTinyTreasures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brought her own homemade infused alcohol to a New Year’s Eve party I attended. It was a total hit! I immediately fell in love with her crazy and exotic flavors, like beet vodka and carrot tequila. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a health conscious person with a savory tooth, I was enthralled with a drink mixer that wouldn’t leave me with a sugar hangover the next day. And sure enough, I was able to start January 1 feeling more refreshed than I would have with a sugary champagne crash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that party, the idea of liquor infusion kits was always circling in my brain. But it would take many years and a few months in isolation before the concept began to blossom. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Fast Forward to Covid and 2020</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like millions of others, the pandemic left me jobless and with just a little bit of free time on my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly everyone I knew had a serious case of cabin fever (at best), or were completely panicking with stress (at worst). I wanted to find a way to reconnect from afar and cheer people up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to put together some care packages for friends, family, and first responders to send my loved ones a smile.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In them, I included a ‘Quarantini Kit’ of dried fruits and spices that could be enjoyed as tea or as a liquor infusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first infusion experiment was a hot toddy mix called </span><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/collections/stircrazi-infusion-cocktail-kits/products/applecinnamonpie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great Balls of Fire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I knew everyone would do well with an extra splash of power foods and vitamins in their nightcap or tea. That is why my ‘Quarantini’ starred a lineup of immunity-boosting ingredients that also happened to taste great, like cinnamon, lemon, and ginger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gift packages to first responders and close family were a huge hit across the board. Everyone who received a Quarantini kit responded with requests for more. The response was unanimous: This was a fantastic gesture to light up an otherwise dark moment. </span></p>
<h2><strong>That Was When I Suspected I Was on to Something </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of diving head first into a futile and competitive job search, why not make 2020 the year I would finally bootstrap my own e-commerce business? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Four Hour Work Week</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in college and had been attempting to start a business from scratch for nearly a decade. I can say from first-hand experience that starting a business is a lot trickier than those Tai Lopez’ “get rich quick” YouTube ads would like you to believe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the side of my day job, I’d dabbled in everything from fitness apps and wall tapestries to (more successfully) </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3dr3R6I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and party costumes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an always aspiring entrepreneur, I know how invaluable customer input is. To make sure I was on the right track, I texted every friend in my phone to ask if they would actually purchase a ‘Quarantini kit’ for themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer was a resounding ‘No’. Instead of getting discouraged, I listened to my gut. I had a feeling their disinterest was only because I hadn’t properly conveyed my vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, I dug deeper into the data of demand. Sure enough, Google trends for ‘tea’ and ‘liquor’ were spiking during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63876 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1-google-search-e1619150257345.png" alt="" width="600" height="314" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63873 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/2-search-e1619150272482.png" alt="" width="600" height="318" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data was undeniable. Stay-at-home orders had sent liquor sales skyrocketing. Clearly people were looking for ways to relax and stay calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why the second flavor I invented was </span><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/products/lavender-lemonade"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavender Lemonade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, known for its soothing aromatherapeutic scent and flavor. It is also just fun and exotic to drink lavender. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Making Prototypes During a Pandemic</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first batches, all of the materials &#8212; from the jars to the fruit &#8212; came from my local Trader’s Joes and Walmart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was during some of the strictest ‘shelter in place’ phases. Waiting in line for materials took me hours, and I was limited to the stores that were allowed to be open because they were selling necessities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I dried all of the fruit and vegetables in my oven myself. This resulted in lots of burned fruit and even more painful arm burns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, my husband and I were also responsible for the </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBV5EEPFndT/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavor testing and creation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Shots of lavender flavored vodka became a welcome distraction from the burn wounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent a day on my couch crafting up the label and packaging for my ‘Quarantinis’. The original design was inspired by old fashioned apothecary labeling from the 1800s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63877 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/3-Quarantini.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/3-Quarantini.jpg 512w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/3-Quarantini-300x300.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/3-Quarantini-125x125.jpg 125w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/3-Quarantini-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /> <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63875 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/4-quarantini.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/4-quarantini.jpg 512w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/4-quarantini-300x300.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/4-quarantini-125x125.jpg 125w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/4-quarantini-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /> <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63878 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/5-stircrazi.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/5-stircrazi.jpg 512w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/5-stircrazi-300x300.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/5-stircrazi-125x125.jpg 125w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/5-stircrazi-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(StirCrazi’s original label prototype)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put the photoshopped prototype on Etsy, and sent the link to all my friends again to see if they would purchase it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time the answer was a resounding ‘Yes.’ Everyone responded with texts and voicemails of enthusiasm and excitement. To my surprise and delight, one of my friends even </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_y4pMDBbh2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made a purchase &#8211; on his own free will!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My test subjects also responded with a rainbow of useful feedback in everything from what flavors they wanted to what a reasonable price range might be. I knew I was really on to something when people even wanted to pay more than I was asking. </span></p>
<h2><strong>This Was the Match That Lit the Dynamite</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing like the feeling of the first sale on your online store to make you swell with joy, pride, and endless excitement for the opportunity of what’s coming next. I might as well have just gotten a double deal from Mark Cuban and Lori Greiner on Shark Tank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wouldn’t be long before my elation would transform into … panic. </span></p>
<h2><strong>The Quarantini Craze</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow the Etsy algorithm overlords decided to shine their luck on me. Or I was featured in a newsletter or magazine somewhere. I’m still not certain of how or where this happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went from ecstatic to have two sales &#8230; to my entire store blowing up overnight. I used to love the ‘Cha-ching’ cash register noise my phone made when I had an Etsy order. That cha-ching sound was starting to induce panic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my husband and I arrived at Target to pick up more mason jars, my phone was buzzing with one order, then two, then five, then 10. My operation was barely a month old and I had to get to work fast.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Challenge of Scaling My Start-Up Business</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden demand meant I had to put a fulfillment process in place, get business insurance, file for an LLC, apply for my cottage license, and find a way to outsource production to a white label or co-manufacturer who could handle a higher level of demand (a challenge I am still navigating). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And meanwhile, I had orders to fulfill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I managed to outsource the actual production of my teas quickly enough to a local tea supplier at a commercial kitchen, but I was still responsible for the assembling, packaging, and shipping of every single order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is how my tiny apartment turned into a StirCrazi pick-and-pack headquarters. Every day in a sweltering heat wave I would pack and ship hundreds of boxes, slathering everything in industrial grade disinfectant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, Etsy has a feature where you can request a post office pickup, so our mail delivery person and I got to know each other really well. I eventually had to bake him a batch of cookies as a thank you for the hundreds of packages he was hauling back and forth from our door to his truck daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Mother’s Day and Cinco de Mayo approached, I invented new seasonal flavors including </span><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/collections/stircrazi-infusion-cocktail-kits/products/roseallmay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose All May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (rose hibiscus orange) and </span><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/collections/stircrazi-infusion-cocktail-kits/products/spicy-margarita"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cinco de Drinko</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (spicy margarita). Soon after, my </span><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/collections/gift-box-sets/products/diy-flower-gift-set"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bouquet inspired liquor infusion gift pack for Mother’s Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was blowing up.</span></p>
<h2><strong>A Bulk Order: My Next Big Break</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember driving to the post office higher than cloud nine &#8212; strangely over the moon to be delivering 20 packages to the post office. I had dreamed of starting an e-commerce business all my life. Now here it was becoming reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is when the big call came in. An event planner in Seattle had spotted </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/stircrazi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my Etsy store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and wanted to place a party order of 40 to arrive in time for Cinco de Mayo (in four days). A company team offsite event that she was planning had been cancelled because of COVID-19, and she was brainstorming an alternative Zoom party for the staff ‘pick me up’ instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was it! I had really made it to the big leagues now. We worked together to create a custom order. She was the best customer any new business owner could ask for, even talking me into charging more than I had originally quoted and requesting extra refill packs and </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_tj1C0BqH2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavored sugars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is what prompted me to expand into new product lines. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63874 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/6-Stircrazi-refill-packs.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/6-Stircrazi-refill-packs.jpg 512w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/6-Stircrazi-refill-packs-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(StirCrazi </span></i><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/collections/flavor-refills"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">refill packs</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/products/flavored-sugar"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavored sugar</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is born!)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was only the beginning of many bulk rush corporate orders. Each one often involved pulling late nights to package and ship. (All in the unbearable heat of my second-story unit with no air conditioning.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We began providing large orders for everything from Zoom bachelorette parties to </span><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/pages/large-orders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate client mailings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for sales teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first customers were my most incredible cheerleaders and advocates. Their enthusiastic reviews were the rocket fuel I needed to launch and keep going. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a partnerships manager in a past life, my corporate experience came in handy when it came time to assemble a team of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/stircrazi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">influencers who were true champions for the brand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, my product photos all shot on my iPhone were in desperate need of an upgrade, so I purchased a </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3py1NMs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">light box</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give them a clean, crisp background. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63879 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/IMG_0284-1-e1619150553451.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="474" /></p>
<h2><strong>StirCrazi 2.0</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I was bootstrapping, it was up to me to design everything myself, from the </span><a href="https://www.getstircrazi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the product labels. Meanwhile, I excavated the deepest depths of Google to find allies and advisors in the form of </span><a href="https://jenndavid.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packaging designers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, food lawyers, suppliers and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there was the great mason jar shortage of 2020. The pandemic spawned a mass food-canning frenzy and I found myself scouring the empty aisles of every convenience store at 9 pm in desperate search for a mason jar 12-pack.</span></p>
<h2><strong>And the Challenges of E-Commerce Didn’t Stop There</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is a mighty mountain to climb, full of beautiful views and treacherous obstacles, such as finding a reliable supplier, building out the supply chain, and the headache from hell that is Facebook ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of mountains, the excessive shipping demands caused me to start obsessively hoarding a pile of packing materials and boxes in a corner of my apartment. My spouse and I lovingly called it ‘Trash Mountain.’ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite everything, we launched our store in September 2020 to sales and rave reviews.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63872 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/7-stircrazi-jars-e1619150286859.png" alt="" width="600" height="328" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">StirCrazi is born!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as I would love to claim my glory for the whole sha-bang, the true credit goes to a dream team of pals who weren’t even on payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, I talked a </span><a href="https://www.joshuaapplegate.com/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brilliant videographer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> friend of mine from college into making the world’s best promo video for a price exceedingly beneath his talents. For this, I will be forever indebted and grateful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also couldn’t have done it without the many friends and mentors who did everything from help me brainstorm color-popping ingredients to nudge me to venture out of </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/stircrazi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etsy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into my own </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/?ref=calliopia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course I owe it all to my first customer, who even came back again and again to order quarantinis for his entire family. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What’s Next for StirCrazi?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to a series of fortunate events, my husband and I reached our financial independence goal early and plan to spend a solid year travelling the second this madness is all over!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’m looking for investors and partnerships to scale StirCrazi operations out of house. This experience has been a wonderful and wild ride, but StirCrazi has grown as far as I can take it. </span></p>

<h2><strong>How to Start Your Own e-Commerce Business </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you also dream of Four Hour Work Weeks and Shark Tank pitches? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be warned: Outliers like Suzy Batiz of PooPourri and Moiz Ali of Native Deodorant make e-commerce look glamorous and lucrative. Personally, I have found the online store business model to be one of the more labor-intensive adventures you can choose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking to start an e-commerce business yourself, I wrote a handy dandy guide about the exact process I followed. You can </span><a href="https://www.moneyselfmade.com/how-to-start-business-no-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read it here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to become the world’s greatest eCom entrepreneur, get ready to also become the world’s greatest package shipper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, starting StirCrazi was the experience of a lifetime. The most magical part (aside from writing off my vodka and wine tab as a business expense) was the opportunity to act as a conduit of love in a time of unrest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My customers entrusted me with the most important task of connecting with their loved ones when fear and social isolation was at its peak. </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_8VPBPjG-6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading the notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of hope and encouragement my customers sent to one another is still enough to give me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterall, what more important job can one ask for than ‘Pandemic Gift Fairy’?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">******</span></p>
