<p>A <a href="https://jordangrumet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogger friend</a> of mine recently came out with a new book, and it&#8217;s centered around one of the things that occupies my brain way more than I care to admit ;)</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of life.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>And apparently I&#8217;m not alone, as this &#8220;purpose anxiety&#8221; apparently affects 91% of people! Crazy!</p>
<p>So odds are you&#8217;ve struggled with this too, which makes this book a perfect read &#8211; and giveaway! &#8211; for everyone today. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Purpose Code</a>&#8220;, and here&#8217;s more about it via Amazon:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The Purpose Code&#8221;<br />
How to unlock meaning, maximize happiness, and leave a lasting legacy</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4ioZyI7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68352" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg" alt="the purpose code" width="426" height="658" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-194x300.jpg 194w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-550x850.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/the-purpose-code-book-324x500.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></a></p>
<p>Purpose can change your life.</p>
<p><strong>Having a sense of purpose has been scientifically proven to help people find happiness, longevity, and health.</strong></p>
<p>But lots of us are also worried about purpose―purpose anxiety has been estimated to affect as much as 91% of people.</p>
<p>What’s going on? And how do we do purpose the right way―to unlock all its many benefits, set goals in life, make a mark and journey from anxiety to legacy?</p>
<p>This question set hospice doctor and writer Jordan Grumet on a quest, and The Purpose Code shares his remarkable findings to help you change your future forever. The result is a self-development book like no other.</p>
<p><strong>It turns out that we fundamentally misunderstand purpose and the role it plays in our lives. In fact, there are two different types of purpose. One will lead to anxiety and disillusionment; the other will lead to connection and lasting legacy.</strong></p>
<p>In The Purpose Code, Jordan will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chart a course for you to reach happiness through understanding the deep human truths behind the concepts of Meaning and Purpose (including life review therapy and simple ways of healing generational trauma)</li>
<li>Equip you with a practical and proven framework for unlocking your real purpose, and show you the life-changingly enjoyable way to climb to goals, regardless of your situation in life</li>
<li>Arm you to differentiate between the two types of purpose when finding life purpose (and show you the hidden reasons why one is always more fulfilling than the other)</li>
<li>Set you on the way to building a genuinely lasting impact long after you’re gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding happiness has never been about creating big audacious goals that we may or may not be able to achieve. True contentment comes from filling our lives with enriching activities that lead to connection and, ultimately, legacy. Swap grand but ultimately empty success books for this small goals book, and begin creating your true purpose today.</p>

<h3>Here&#8217;s how to enter for your chance to win one of TWO (free) copies:</h3>
<p>Answer this question down below in the comments, or via email if you&#8217;re reading this there, and you&#8217;ll be automatically entered to win :)</p>
<blockquote><p>How close are you, do you think, to knowing your purpose on this Earth?</p></blockquote>
<p>Get your entries in by this Sunday at midnight, and I&#8217;ll randomly select the two winners the following day!</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I think I&#8217;m around 70% at the moment.</strong> The one thing I feel called to do, and enjoy!, is helping others in some form or fashion, and it seems the more I do that the happier I tend to get. Thus, why I made it this year&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-10-2-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-2 Challenge</a>! Maybe it&#8217;s not my <em>ultimate</em> purpose in life (if there even IS such a thing?) but it def. feels like I&#8217;m moving in the right direction, so I&#8217;m gonna keep on going until something stops me :)</p>
<p>How about you? What % do you think you&#8217;re at right now? Either way, keep waking up and doing your best to appreciate at least being alive!! It&#8217;s not always fun, but it sure beats the alternative&#8230;.</p>
<p>Your friend, now and forever &#8211; even in death,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>Not a new idea, but just another visualization and reminder.</p>
<p>Wealth, feeling like you have plenty, is an equation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wealth = Have ÷ Want</strong></p>
<p>If you have nothing, then focus on having some.</p>
<p>Once you have some, the easiest way to increase your wealth is to decrease your needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have 10 but want 100? You are poor.</li>
<li>Have 10 but only want 5? You are wealthy.</li>
<li>Have 10 but are happy with 1? You are <em>very</em> wealthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making money depends on other people, so it’s harder. It’s not entirely under your control. It’s an outer game.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing what you “need” to be happy is easier. It’s entirely under your control. It’s an inner game.</strong></p>
<p>I used to look for ways to make money, but I haven’t done that in years. Now I keep looking for ways to want less.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><em>Derek is one of my favorite thinkers and just came out with a new book full of short passages like this: <a href="https://sive.rs/u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Useful Not True</a>. He&#8217;s one of the only authors whose books I actually KEEP after reading!<br />

<p><strong>&#8220;I just wrapped up a 10 &#8211; 2 challenge. Here’s how it works &#8211; You work on a long term project for 10 minutes a day &#8211; every day &#8211; for approximately 2 years. The thing is, you have to work on the project every day. If you travel, you have to either improvise or do make up work for the days you missed. I even use a stopwatch to make sure I work on the project for a full <span class="il">10</span> minutes. You’ll be amazed at what you accomplish!”</strong></p>
<p>Love it! Super easy sounding, right?!</p>
<p>And if I whip out a calculator here, hold on one sec&#8230;  It looks like it actually adds up to&#8230; <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>7,300 minutes</strong></span>!! Or roughly <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>122 hours</strong></span>! WOW! Imagine dedicating that many hours to *one* single goal of yours? What would you be able to achieve?! How better off would you be? Physically/mentally/professionally?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to fathom the number of things we let fall by the wayside just because they&#8217;re &#8220;too big&#8221; to start, so let this be the kick in the ass you need to actually GET GOING on a dream that you may be putting off. Or even just something annoying that really needs to get done but you know will take forever! Lol&#8230; Literally stop reading this right now and get going if you already have it in your head &#8211; I promise it&#8217;ll be better than reading the rest of this post <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If nothing crosses your mind, let me throw out some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review your finances every day </strong>(expenses, credit cards, budget, net worth, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/stupid-subscription-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscriptions</a>, insurance, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/i-froze-my-credit-and-it-was-stupidly-easy-and-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit score,</a> credit <em>report</em> &#8211; plenty of things you could keep tabs on and improve)</li>
<li><strong>Declutter your entire house</strong> (each drawer, closet, *gasp* garage!)</li>
<li><strong>Get a new job/promoted</strong> (research, apply, improve skills)</li>
<li><strong>Get a new girlfriend/boyfriend/friend</strong> (same examples as above <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</li>
<li><strong>Write a book!</strong> (might feel choppy with only 10 mins applied, but you&#8217;ll probably find you&#8217;ll spend more time once you&#8217;re &#8220;in the flow&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>Start a passion project</strong> (blog, book, TikTok, <a href="https://cointhrill.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coin collection</a>!)</li>
<li><strong>Work out every day</strong> (go for a walk, go for a run!, lift some weights, do some yoga, play some basketball &#8211; you only have to do it for 10 mins!)</li>
<li><strong>Work out your <em>mind</em> every day</strong> (meditate, read, crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles! (Remember that time <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I got obsessed with them</a> for like two months??! Man I went bonkers&#8230;))</li>
<li><strong>Study the bible</strong> (my friend who came up with this 10-2 idea did exactly this &#8211; used his time for the past two years to devour the bible and create a &#8220;spiritual warfare database!&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>Weed/Garden/Landscape</strong> (after a month you&#8217;ll probably just be *maintaining* from that point on!)</li>
<li><strong>Learn a new language</strong> (Spanish? French? HTML?)</li>
<li><strong>Learn something else entirely new!</strong> (Programming, Video Editing, Baking)</li>
</ul>
<p>The options are endless&#8230;</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t care who you are, everyone can spare 10 mins a day towards something that&#8217;s important to them. <em><strong>The years are going to pass anyways,</strong><strong> why not get something extra out of it with minimal effort?!</strong></em></p>
<p>I found the perfect book too yesterday for tracking it all:</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4fTeWun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68291" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary.jpg" alt="one-line-a-day diary" width="500" height="649" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary-231x300.jpg 231w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary-550x714.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-line-a-day-diary-385x500.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I scooped it up at Goodwill as a future gift to my sister (it was only $2.99!), but now I&#8217;m thinking I need to keep it for myself, lol&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>But how perfect is this for tracking?! Each date has a small section to jot down quick notes, and they&#8217;re stacked on top of each other so every year going forward when you come back to the same date you can see the previous years&#8217; notes on it. Which hopefully will keep you motivated and inspired!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an inside page so you can see exactly what I&#8217;m talking about&#8230; And yes, I just wrote in it so it&#8217;s officially mine <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68292" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside.jpg" alt="one a day diary - inside" width="480" height="729" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside-197x300.jpg 197w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside-550x836.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/one-a-day-diary-inside-329x500.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>So you can see there&#8217;s a section there for each of the 5 years, so over time you&#8217;ll be able to reflect on the previous years&#8217; successes and notes and you don&#8217;t have to keep getting a new journal :) In fact, you could even turn this into a 10-5 Challenge if you <em>really</em> wanted to! Haha&#8230; And I just found it on Amazon too in case you want one for yourself (currently $15):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://amzn.to/4fTeWun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Line A Day: A Five-Year Memory Book</a></p>
<p>But really, you can use anything to track this &#8211; what&#8217;s important is just that you do! Use a Notes app, staple some blank papers together, or use a good old fashion Google Doc, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; just track it however is most natural to you.</p>
<p><strong>And as you&#8217;ll see, I&#8217;ve already started this challenge :) Which for me is to do *one thing a day* for someone, or some place, that helps them.</strong> I had been trying to get to a WEEK in a row of helping someone each day &#8211; and even pulled it off once (see the PS at the end!) &#8211; but if I could accomplish it for 2 YEARS straight that would be amazing.</p>
<p>And on Nov. 6th you&#8217;ll see Day #1 was completed! I gave a microwave to my friend Debbie whose old one just broke down (it had been sitting in my basement for 5 years!), and then I called my mother &#8220;just to check on her&#8221; and not to ask for something which is usually the case <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And since I had extra room there at the end, I made a note that we had won our league&#8217;s soccer championships (and I scored in it!), so that future me will be reminded of the feat a year from now.</p>
<p>Now some days I already know I&#8217;ll have trouble finding someone to help, or maybe not even be IN THE MOOD to help!, so on &#8220;off&#8221; days I&#8217;ll carve out the 10 minutes to simply strengthen my *mindset* overall, whether by reading or brainstorming or even by meditating &#8211; that way with each passing day I&#8217;m even more *conscious* about the mission. The more you practice doing something, the better you get at it right?! And we have 7,300 mins with this challenge so we&#8217;re gonna get GOOD!!</p>
<p><strong>So yeah &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty stoked about this, and hopefully you are too :)</strong> Spend a few minutes thinking it over today, and then tomorrow get right to it and start tracking it all. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s something big or small or somewhere in between &#8211; just get crackin&#8217; and feel good about it!</p>
<p>Remember &#8211; the time is going to pass anyways, so why not get something out of it? And I want to hear all about it!</p>

<p>PS: The one week I accomplished this!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1:</strong> helped serve a community dinner for our homeless friends</li>
<li><strong>Day 2:</strong> helped give out free food and veggies at our local food bank</li>
<li><strong>Day 3:</strong> gave a buddy of mine a haircut as he was low on funds, and also just really doesn&#8217;t like going to barbers! (And if you&#8217;re wondering, yes &#8211; I gave him a mohawk!! I can&#8217;t be trusted to cut anything else! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</li>
<li><strong>Day 4:</strong> helped my church archive old documents in their archives room &#8211; not only fascinating to hold and touch old artifacts, but to learn the overall process of *properly archiving* too!</li>
<li><strong>Day 5:</strong> helped a friend get a website off the ground and move her childhood dream further along</li>
<li><strong>Day 6:</strong> brainstormed marketing and fundraising ideas for a new garden opening up in our city</li>
<li><strong>Day 7:</strong> co-led an after church youth session &#8211; the scariest of all as a) I don&#8217;t know or fully understand the bible at all (!!), and b) pre-teen kids are so awkward and quiet and really don&#8217;t like to talk, haha&#8230; Though I did find a secret weapon: snacks!</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a pretty fantastic week, but also exhausting&#8230; I&#8217;ll have to be careful of my energy levels and find ways to self-care throughout the next two years so I don&#8217;t accidentally burn out.</p>

<p>What a perfect truth right there.</p>
<p>Where else could you even start? The past is gone no matter what you desire, and I suppose you could start in the future, but we all know that will never happen, lol, so you gotta start right now wherever you are ;) We&#8217;re only guaranteed THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE anyways, and what a gift it truly is!</p>
<p>Everything in life has brought you to this very exact article right here, and lucky for me you&#8217;re reading whatever I type right now&#8230;</p>
<p>I could say:</p>
<p><em><strong>I am a poopy head!<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>And you read it! Lol&#8230; Or even:</p>
<p><em><strong>Saving is so sexy that my life has changed forever and now all the ladies love me.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>BOOM! And now:</p>
<p><strong>The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance than dance.</strong></p>
<p>Okay I&#8217;ll stop <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But seriously. Everything has led you to this one point where you&#8217;re able to start anything new because of how life has unfolded. Maybe it&#8217;s a career choice. Maybe it&#8217;s a new relationship. Maybe it&#8217;s getting your finances together for the first time and this is the first blog you&#8217;ve ever stumbled onto (sorry about that!). Whatever the new journey is you can only start NOW as there&#8217;s no going backward, so please don&#8217;t beat yourself up over it.</p>
<p><strong>The important thing is that at least *the light bulb went off* in the first place!</strong> Do you know how many people wake up in their 50s or 60s and still haven&#8217;t paid attention to their debts or health or worse &#8211; their dreams?! I WISH I could have started saving in my teens vs my 20s or got excited about working out and yoga in my 20s vs my 40s, but thank God I started as soon as everything clicked.</p>
<p>You must begin where you are, there is no other way.</p>
<p>Now you might think this quote came from a philosophy book or maybe it was something Oprah once said, but it actually came from my favorite yoga book: &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z8zN7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoga Girl</a>&#8221; by Rachel Brathen:</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3Z8zN7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-68034" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book.jpg" alt="Yoga Girl - book" width="455" height="587" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book-233x300.jpg 233w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book-550x710.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-girl-book-388x500.jpg 388w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great read mixing in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yoga_girl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her story</a> along with killer yoga poses, and it&#8217;s chock full of epic one-liners that not only apply to yoga, but to life &#8211; and particularly money! &#8211; too. I re-stumbled across it again on my bookshelf and totally forgot I had dog-eared a bunch of these lines which I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading.</p>
<p><strong>And in the spirit of crossing my <a href="https://imetyoutoday.com/namaste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY</a> doing yoga (255 classes later &#8211; what!), I present them to you below in hopes they inspire you just as much as they did me :)</strong></p>
<p>Most are copied as-is, and others I&#8217;ve tweaked to better prove my financial hypothesis here, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">********</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to change anything about who you are to start <del>a yoga practice</del> paying attention to your money.&#8221;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yes! You simply <em>take notice</em> one day and actively start looking at where all your money is going. Your debts, your bills, your income &#8211; everything. You don&#8217;t need to *change* any of it right away, you just stop and start *noticing* and getting the lay of the land!</p>
<p>Once you know what you&#8217;re dealing with, then the game plan can be activated from there. But it doesn&#8217;t require changing who you are, and in fact, over time it should help you become a BETTER version of yourself! Because the more confident you get in your finances, <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/sexy-underwear-money-trick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the more confident</a> you get in all other areas of your life <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44a.png" alt="👊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Be the best you can be.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Most of the insecurities we struggle with come from thinking that things should be different from reality. But reality reflects exactly where we are right now, and all we can do is strive to improve!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to know every step ahead of you to be able to move forward.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>All you need to know is the general *direction* you want to go towards, and then you put one step in front of another and let <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/no-coffee-challenge-mode-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forward momentum</a> carry you from there. It&#8217;s not as complicated as we often make it out to be! Just do one little thing, and then another, and then another.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Much of what we <del>eat</del> spend in a day is simply a result of boredom!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Yup! You gotta do your best to not put yourself in situations where it&#8217;s easy to cave. And one of the best ways is by putting yourself into more positive situations than negatives. I remember when I first started blogging I immediately had less time to go to the mall and aimlessly shop, and BOOM &#8211; half the problem was immediately eliminated just because I kept myself busy! I replaced bad habits with good habits, and the same holds true with my time these days as well&#8230; Hitting the gym has replaced staring at a screen all morning, volunteering has replaced wasting time dawdling around, and finding more veggies and foods I equally enjoy has replaced more sugary ones. As the saying goes, idle hands are the devil&#8217;s workshop.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The thing that hurts us in the long run is our mind, not our body.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>So absolutely true&#8230; Our mind is the most dangerous thing there is. This quote by Marcus Aurelius sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.</p></blockquote>
<p>This has to be one of the biggest bugs in human development! We spend too much time caring about what others think about us!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Trust in your own ability to create magic.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>100%. Put those beautiful skills God gave you to work. No one else is going to do it for you!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Practicing naked is extremely liberating. Love your body. Think about all that it does for you every day.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Haha okay this one might be a stretch, but we all know budgeting naked does make it way more fun ;) I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Naked and Afraid episodes too here lately, and there&#8217;s something beautiful about going back to the basics of both nature and survival. Similar to loving ourselves just for who we are, we should be very much loving our bodies just the same!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Be kind to yourself!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>You will without a doubt make mistakes along your financial journey, so don&#8217;t even pretend you won&#8217;t. Just expect them and do your best to be patient with yourself! Treat yourself like you do a best friend or family member. Again, you are worth it!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The goal is serenity. Balance. Truly finding peace in your own skin.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The whole point of working so hard on your finances is to one day NOT have to work so hard on them! In fact, once you&#8217;re financially free you don&#8217;t even have to THINK ABOUT IT anymore! It&#8217;s ironic, yes, but also magical. Peace with your finances = peace in many other areas in life too.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Worrying is praying for what we don&#8217;t want to happen. Focus on what you want, not what you fear!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Positive thinking can go a looooooong way with this stuff! You&#8217;ll not only reach your goals faster, but you&#8217;ll feel better generally when you&#8217;re more optimistic! Most things we&#8217;re afraid of never even come true.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-55717 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/peaceful-dude.jpg" alt="peaceful dude" width="550" height="340" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/peaceful-dude.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/peaceful-dude-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Other great lines for life in general:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Life is not as serious as your mind makes it out to be.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Yup! Laugh a little!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Don&#8217;t judge your life as good or bad. Love what is.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Acceptance is an underrated super power. The moment you stop pretending or wishing, the better you&#8217;ll be able to see the beauty in what<em> is</em>. <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/no-coffee-challenge-mode-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meditation helps immensely</a> with this.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Remember that you are the only one suffering by clinging to the past.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>And you can&#8217;t change it no matter what you do!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The first thing you do in the morning should not include social media or e-mails!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Gosh I wish everyone realized this&#8230; And especially IN BED! A sacred space for you and anyone else laying there with you. Not only does it let *the outside world* set your tone for the day, but it doesn&#8217;t even let you fully wake up and process life before you get the day started :( You&#8217;re immediately blasted with the world&#8217;s problems before you even get out of bed!!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Allow yourself to feel.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a place for action and moving on, but first &#8211; just feel. The highs, the lows, and everything in between.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Do no harm, but take no shit.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>So good  :)</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The only thing that matters is how much you love&#8230; your purpose on this Earth is to love.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Gosh this one is just so beautiful&#8230;  What a world if we all focused more on this than ourselves. I think about this often, and is partially why my last tattoo was a heart where I constantly see it and get reminded to do exactly that: love.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-68036 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/heart-tattoo-hand.jpg" alt="heart tattoo on hand" width="404" height="437" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/heart-tattoo-hand.jpg 461w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/heart-tattoo-hand-277x300.jpg 277w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>I hope this has inspired you at least a little today :)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the book, you can usually find it at your local library (it&#8217;s a popular one!) or of course over at Amazon: &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z8zN7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoga Girl</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s one of the few books I keep on my bookshelf <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>See ya back here again soon.</p>
<p>Namaste,</p>

<p>I went <strong>123 days</strong> without a sip of coffee <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f631.png" alt="😱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f631.png" alt="😱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And also&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>101 days</strong> without a glass of whisky (or any alcohol for that matter)</p>
<p><strong>70 days</strong> without applying ChapStick to my lips</p>
<p>and <strong>43 days</strong> of not using the internet or any apps on my phone (!!!)</p>
<p>Challenge Mode activated, baby!! And it feels great! Also &#8211; kinda boring, lol, but super proud of myself for pulling it off so far and honestly can&#8217;t believe I even have. Who gives up all this stuff at the same time??!</p>
<p>But more on that in a bit&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>Hello!!! It&#8217;s been a while! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="😁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s completely my fault.</p>
<p><strong>I made it my mission this year to swap out &#8220;screen time&#8221; with more &#8220;real life&#8221; time, and I&#8217;ve gotten so good at it that I almost forgot the internet still exists, haha&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve missed you and I&#8217;m back now! And I hope your $$$ is still going strong! Anything juicy happen since I&#8217;ve been away?? Still saving and budgeting your hearts out? I just checked and it&#8217;s been exactly 6 months since my last post to y&#8217;all (!!!) which is way too long&#8230;</p>
<p>As for us, life continues to be good and our health and wealth are trucking along nicely. Definitely lower on the income side of things since that&#8217;s what happens when you unofficially retire, lol, but thankfully the decisions of younger J$ hooked us up to be just fine ;) Even without adding anything extra our net worth continues to grow! The power of <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/penny-compounding-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compounding</a> at its finest!</p>
<p><strong>But while I haven&#8217;t been &#8220;working&#8221; much, I<em> have</em> been channeling all that time and energy into somewhere else: myself.</strong></p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project of Me</a>&#8221; continues in full force, and now on top of the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ive-turned-into-a-juicing-freak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">juicing</a> and working out and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volunteering</a> and <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yoga&#8217;ing</a> every day, I&#8217;ve added a few more life improvements to the mix. Or rather, improved *habits*. Not that any of these were all too terrible really, but it&#8217;s always good to hit &#8220;reset&#8221; every now and then to see what you truly <em>need</em> in life, you know?</p>
<p>And I decided to hit the hardest, most trickiest, habit first: <strong>COFFEE!!</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-67971 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/coffee-gif.gif" alt="coffee gif" width="352" height="361" /></p>
<p>Something I love and devour every single day, but something I&#8217;m sure my body doesn&#8217;t exactly appreciate. I had been slowly trimming it down over the years, going from 3-4 cups/day to 2-3 cups and then most recently just 1 cup/day, but never in my 25 years of drinking it have I dared to go cold turkey. I mean, why would you do that to yourself??! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>But once the seed gets planted I can&#8217;t leave things alone until I go ALL IN, and one day I just woke up and thought, &#8220;Today is the day &#8211; no more coffee!&#8221; and that was that.</strong></p>
<p>The first week was a bitch, not gonna lie (those headaches are real! Especially when your life is full of rowdy little boys!) but eventually I stopped thinking about it and learned to live my life as I had the first 20 years of it :)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s had a <em>super</em> big impact on me, other than chilling me out more and maybe lessening some anxiety (I feel more &#8220;even&#8221; these days, like, no more huge HIGHS or LOWS, but just kinda sorta floating in the MIDDLE, if that makes sense?) but it is amazing how fast our bodies can adapt when given the chance. Life without coffee seems just as normal now as life was with it! And in the process I learned that I really enjoy decaf teas, such as lemon-ginger which I&#8217;m currently drinking as I type this, as well as the turmeric based, &#8220;Golden Latte&#8221; &#8211; a real treat if you&#8217;ve never tried!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been a great reminder of how powerful a force *momentum* can be. The beginning stages are always the hardest, but as time goes on you get better and better with less effort until the point of not even really paying attention anymore. Not unlike saving or investing really!</p>
<p><strong>Even more importantly &#8211; doing these little challenges helps prime you up for even MORE challenges in life.</strong> Momentum breeds momentum, and similar to what happened last year when I joined that soccer league, which then got me to start eating and drinking better, which then got me to start exercising more, <a href="https://jmoney.biz/cascading-actions-and-watching-for-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one positive act propels you to another</a> until you&#8217;re left with a string of better habits stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>30 days into the Coffee Challenge I then took on a 31 day Meditation Challenge, which then led to a 21-day Inversion Challenge, and then a random No ChapStick Challenge (??) and then finally a No Internet on Your Phone Challenge which is my present dare I&#8217;ve taken on&#8230; A dare, of course, I dared myself with ;)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more on each for those curious:</p>
<p><strong>31 Day Meditation Challenge &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve always wanted to try meditation but didn&#8217;t know how, this is an easy way to get started. You just set the timer for 5 minutes and then sit there and do nothing except try and focus on your breath. Which you can never do all the way, of course, but you still try and eventually get better at it. When the 5 mins are up you&#8217;re done and hopefully feel a bit more peaceful! Then you repeat for the next 30 days <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you crave a little harder challenge, which I was, you do the same 5 mins every day BUT you add 1 more minute on top of it with each passing day. So, day 1 is 5 mins, day 2 is 6 mins, day 3 is 7 etc etc until you realize you&#8217;re at 35 mins/day and feel like a monk! It&#8217;s a fabulous challenge if you&#8217;re into such things, and of course the hope is that you continue with it until it becomes a daily habit &#8211; even if not for long. (I&#8217;ve found the sweet spot for me is 7 minutes, which I can easily slip in any time of the day!)</p>

<p><strong>21 Day Inversion Challenge</strong> &#8211;This is a yoga challenge a friend of mine and I did together, but even if you&#8217;re not into yoga you could try it (just be careful!). With this challenge all you have to do is get *upside down* once a day which is supposedly really good for you (something about the blood rushing down and then back up to improve flow?). But &#8211; it&#8217;s also just plain FUN :)</p>
<p>You can do a hand stand up against the wall, or a head stand in the middle of the beach or even just have a friend dangle you at your ankles for a few seconds! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> As long as you get upside down every day you&#8217;ve accomplished the mission.</p>
<p><strong>No ChapStick Challenge</strong> &#8212; This is going to sound weird, but next to coffee this was probably the hardest challenge I&#8217;ve ever taken on, haha&#8230; I&#8217;d never realized how engrained of a habit this was until learning that my brother has only used it like once or twice in his entire life??! I was shocked! I told him I probably apply it at least 5-6x day automatically without even thinking about it, and that it&#8217;s one of the three things I *always* carry in my pocket:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Money clip</li>
<li>Chapstick (or a variation of &#8211; this isn&#8217;t to shame Chapstick the brand, I don&#8217;t have anything against them, lol&#8230; unless the rumors are true that they put *addictive* substances in it which would 100% explain my obsessive behavior with it!!!)</li>
</ol>
<p>He then told me I needed to take it on as my next challenge, and 70 days later I have still yet to apply a single swipe! :) Though I did early on have to apply some Vaseline as WOW were my lips not happy as they were adjusting!! And I couldn&#8217;t count the number of times I reached into my pockets to get the Chapstick only to remember it wasn&#8217;t there anymore, lol&#8230; So it&#8217;s kind of a minimalism and savings win too! One less thing to carry around, and one less thing to purchase too &#8211; woo!</p>
<p><strong>No Internet on Your Phone Challenge</strong> &#8212; This one came about after just being tired of being on my phone one day and seeing everyone else on theirs too. Which this challenge doesn&#8217;t exactly solve (if anything it gets you to realize how MUCH everyone else is on their phone!) but it is a good start to breaking your own scrolling habits.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, you just stop opening up any apps outside of those made for communication (like text, calling, etc) and then see if you can survive ;)</p>
<p>I started it on vacation which is probably the <em>worst time</em> to start since you usually have so much downtime!, but it did help re-focus my attention on real life and nature and has been great for my mental health too. I have since sneaked in the maps app and allowed for the camera and one or two other more *productive* apps too, but so far it looks like I&#8217;ve broken the habit of haphazard scrolling and getting lost to time. I&#8217;d bet I use the phone at least 50% less now!</p>
<p>(Another trick to not picking it up as much? <a href="https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/beware-the-dopamine-cartel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wearing a watch!</a> It can&#8217;t suck you in like when you go to your phone to check what time it is!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p><strong>And that&#8217;s where we are today :) Looking for the next good challenge!! lol&#8230; You have any for me? </strong></p>
<p>But while it may look like I&#8217;m trying to devoid myself of all the best things in life, the point as mentioned earlier is more to break myself out of my daily habits that have essentially been on auto-pilot for years and then reinstitute better ones. Some things like the coffee and alcohol I&#8217;ve slowly introduced back in again &#8211; having my first glass of whisky last week, and my first cup of coffee the week prior (it all tastes so much better in moderation!) &#8211; while the ChapStick and phone scrolling ban still remains fully in tact.</p>
<p><strong>And of course, you can do all this with your finances too!</strong> In fact, that&#8217;s where my love of pushing myself all started from &#8211; when I took on a &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/lent-time-to-give-something-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Spending Challenge</a>&#8221; back in 2008 and tried to get a handle on where all my money was going! The first week was the hardest (I kept forgetting and finding myself in stores!) but eventually the new habit kicked in long enough where I trusted myself to start spending again without overdoing it.</p>
<p>A few years later, I decided to up my game even further and go through *every last expense* I had and either nix them completely or lower them enough without affecting my quality of life. I dubbed this the &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Challenge Everything</a>&#8221; experiment, and at the end of 12 months I had saved <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5,484.07</a> and forever cut out $200/mo going forward! Half of it coming from swapping cell phone carriers alone which netted me $100+/mo (I swapped Verizon for Republic Wireless which no longer exists, and eventually landed at <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/mint-mobile">Mint Mobile</a> which I LOVE. Only $25/mo!*)</p>
<p><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/challenge-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-45618 " src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/challenge-savings-chart.gif" alt="challenge everything savings chart" width="548" height="714" /></a></p>
<p><strong>And then of course there&#8217;s getting into the habit of investing more and paying off debts and all other kinds of challenges you could take on to better improve your future.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the ones we&#8217;ve featured over the years if you&#8217;re pumped and ready to take some on!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/two-dollar-bills-savings-trick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The $2 Bill Challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/spavings-savings-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Spavings Challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/bingo-savings-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The $1,000 Savings Challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/gamify-your-money-goals-with-these-8-fun-saving-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamify Your Money Goals with These 8 Fun Saving Challenges!</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The trick is just starting with one area and then letting the momentum (and confidence!) keep building and propelling you further into others. And remember &#8211; it gets easier the more you flex that muscle!</p>
<p><strong>Anyways, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to these past 6 months :)</strong> Hope you&#8217;ve been learning and getting into some fun stuff too! I really thought this was going to be a steady normal year over here and then BAM &#8211; the fire was lit and the sparks started flying! Haha&#8230; But I love it&#8230; You gotta be constantly changing in order to grow and I welcome every last bit of it.</p>
<p>See you back here again soon! Thanks for reading :)</p>

Been a while! Jordan over at <a href="https://www.thewealthletters.com/p/029-the-wealthy-40-something-skateboarder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wealth Letters</a> prompted me to share my thoughts on &#8220;wealth&#8221; for an upcoming book of his (cool!), and what began as an outline for an article somehow managed to morph into a poem, lol&#8230; So please to enjoy today: a poem about wealth!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Wealth is freedom&#8221;</h2>
<p>Wealth is freedom.</p>
<p>Freedom to create.<br />
Freedom to live.<br />
Freedom to love!<br />
Freedom to sleep in, or hustle, or do whatever your spirit is moving you in the moment.</p>
<p>Wealth is freedom from worry of the things you have control over<br />
(and grace over the things you do not).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the ability to drop everything and help out a friend when they most need you,<br />
or jump on a project (or quit a project!), or re-arrange life whenever it gets too out of balance.</p>
<p>Wealth is health &#8211; in both body and mind.<br />
And being able to say &#8220;no&#8221; when you want to say no,<br />
and &#8220;yes&#8221; when you want to say yes!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s choosing love over hate,<br />
and recognizing what your gifts are as early as possible so you can give them back to the world.</p>
<p>Wealth is having enough money to not worry,<br />
but not too much where it <em>makes</em> you worry.<br />
It&#8217;s the stuff that brings you joy,<br />
but also the stuff that challenges you and makes you stronger.</p>
<p>Wealth is the ability to believe in yourself and know that you are &#8220;enough&#8221;,<br />
and also that you are loved and worthy and very much needed in our world.</p>
<p>Wealth is peace.<br />
Wealth is freedom.<br />
Wealth is contentment.<br />
Wealth is something we&#8217;re always striving for, but not everyday getting. (And that&#8217;s okay!)</p>
<p>Wealth is a state of mind, and it flourishes within each and every one of us.</p>
<p><strong>Wake up. Be You. Be thankful. Do your best. Be wealthy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">******</div>
<div></div>
<p>And how blessed are we ALL to have at least a little wealth within us? :)</p>
<p>Wealth is about being good stewards of our money, yes, but it&#8217;s also so much more than that. It&#8217;s how we live and think and shape our lives no matter what&#8217;s going on in our worlds. And the beautiful part is we ALL have the power to grow it! For ourselves, for our loved ones, for our community!</p>
<p>So thanks, Jordan! That was a fun exercise to go down, and hopefully y&#8217;all got something out of it too :) If you like this sorta stuff (<em>the meaning of wealth</em>, not poems lol), check out his site where he features dozens more from all walks of life &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://www.thewealthletters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TheWealthLetters.com</a></p>
<p>And he&#8217;s always looking to add more too! So if you have a few moments this weekend, maybe marinate on it yourself and then <a href="https://www.thewealthletters.com/p/be-featured-in-the-wealth-letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass your thoughts over to him</a> and perhaps you&#8217;ll be featured next?!</p>
<p>Until next time, stay wealthy amigos&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>PS:</strong> If you&#8217;re reading this on the blog today, did you notice anything different?! Like no ads?? ;) I officially got rid of them all so hopefully it makes it even smoother to read&#8230; Probably not the smartest decision business-wise, but hey &#8211; it just felt right <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f919.png" alt="🤙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Hope things are good in your world! I&#8217;ll be back again soon&#8217;ish hopefully!</p>

<p>Happy New Year!! It&#8217;s nice to see so many of you at the gyms and yoga studios and veggie aisles these days :) Everyone&#8217;s so energized and motivated &#8211; be sure to do whatever it takes to KEEP UP WITH IT!</p>
<p>Remember &#8211; even if you fail one day or two (or two hundred days), it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; it&#8217;s literally in the past. All that matters is what you do TODAY! So get back out there and try again!! A record of &#8220;1&#8221; in a row is better than a record of &#8220;none&#8221; in a row. #TRUTHBOMB</p>
<p>** Awkward transition **</p>
<p><strong>Did I tell you my best friend and I created a new project recently?</strong> And by <em>recently</em>, I mean almost a year ago but I keep forgetting to tell you about it because I just poured over my archives here and can&#8217;t find a mention of it anywhere?? ;)</p>
<p>Yup, my boy <a href="https://natestpierre.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate St. Pierre</a> and I devised it* late one night on a rare visit together (we&#8217;ve been internet besties for around 14 years now but only see each other in real life maybe once every few years!) and the very next morning we built it and put it out into the world.</p>
<p><strong>Though for once it&#8217;s a project not actually meant for the *world*, but for a specific <em>*person*</em> who made our day.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called, <a href="https://imetyoutoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Met You Today</a>, and the concept is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever one of us meets someone who blows us away with their kindness, genuineness, or brilliance, we hand them a card that says &#8220;I met you today. Check this site in 24 hours: IMetYouToday.com&#8221;</li>
<li>We then post up a note letting them know how much they impacted us!</li>
<li>They then (hopefully) remember to come back and visit the site to see what a difference they made to us :)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now some of us are better at remembering to pass out these cards than others**, but at the end of the day <strong>we show them some love</strong> and hopefully it brings them as much joy as they brought us. If nothing else, it gives us the chance to think through these encounters and put &#8217;em down on paper, that way when we&#8217;re feeling depressed about the state of the world we can look back at the archive of people who are actually cool! Lol&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done about 10 of these so far, and you can find them here if any in particular pique your interest. Some are short, some are long, some are random, but every single one is from our heart:</p>

</ul>
<p>(Can you guess which ones *I* wrote vs those from Nate? ;))</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a fun project and reminds me there&#8217;s still so much goodness in people if you pay attention enough. Anyone can <em>hate</em> on others (and we&#8217;re often quick to do so!), but it&#8217;s a lot harder to focus on the opposite. Maybe it&#8217;s time we change that this year? Feel free to steal this idea if you like it! You don&#8217;t need a website to do it &#8211; just open your heart and show them you care.</p>
<p><strong>See you back here again sometime soon!</strong> I&#8217;m continuing <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Year of The Flow</a> so who knows what will be occurring next ;) From <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeless shelters</a>, to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/did-i-just-get-myself-a-new-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">board games</a>, to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ive-turned-into-a-juicing-freak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">juicing</a>, to <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yoga</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s been a helluva unexpected year! And that&#8217;s just the way I like it!</p>
<p>You friend today, and always,</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64642" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/j-money-signature.jpg" alt="j. money signature" width="186" height="75" /></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><em>*Okay, so Nate actually came up with the main idea, but if it never gets fleshed out and put into the world does it really ever count?! ;)</em></p>
<p><em>**Hi, I&#8217;m the problem, it&#8217;s me&#8230; Nate is GREAT about handing out these cards the second he realizes he&#8217;s in the middle of a beautiful experience, but for me it usually takes a couple of days as I&#8217;m slow. It usually dawns on me when I catch myself telling loads of people about the experience later, and then I quickly hop onto the computer and write it up! Which of course is then way too late, lol, but often times I run into the person again so it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;I Met You A Few Weeks Ago Actually, But Still &#8211; Check Out This Nice Letter I Wrote To You on This Website &#8211; KTHXBYE!&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-new-soccer-yoga-gym-pokemon/" title="The Project of &#8220;Me&#8221;" rel="nofollow"><img width="382" height="480" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/namaste-gif.gif" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="namaste gif" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p>What&#8217;s up y&#8217;all!</p>
<p>Stealing this idea from <a href="https://www.thefrugalgirl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Frugal Girl</a> who free flows new things in her life every week, and thought I&#8217;d do the same as I&#8217;ve immersed myself into a LOT of things lately and kinda just want to blurt it out rather than neatly craft up individual posts&#8230; Unless you want a whole article on Pokemon?! Which I can certainly do for you!! ;)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been brewing lately&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) I joined a soccer league for the first time in 10 years!</strong> Except my friend who convinced me to join it didn&#8217;t tell me the games were at 10pm at night!! AT NIGHT! Can you imagine?! I didn&#8217;t think I could do it, but surprisingly once I hit the field I didn&#8217;t even notice and all my muscle memory came back and it WAS ON. We even played one game in the middle of a rain storm in the freezing cold! Haha&#8230; Of course, I&#8217;m one of the oldest ones out there at 43, but hey &#8211; It makes me feel younger just being surrounded by everyone ;)</p>
<p><strong>2) I&#8217;m a yoga addict now!</strong> A <a href="https://imetyoutoday.com/namaste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chance encounter</a> at a coffee shop led me to finally go for it after years of thinking about it, and now &#8211; four weeks in &#8211; I&#8217;ve already done around 25 classes! No joke.  I knew I would like it, but man &#8211; had no idea I would enjoy it THIS much, haha&#8230; I didn&#8217;t realize how powerful it would be for both my body AND my mind?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short video I did on it after hitting 3 weeks if you&#8217;d rather watch that than read ;)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy3pmWFO143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67730" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video.png" alt="yoga video" width="645" height="574" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video.png 700w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video-300x267.png 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video-550x490.png 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yoga-video-562x500.png 562w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I just love the culture around it, and all the people, and *especially* all the words that are used throughout.</strong> Like &#8220;gratitude&#8221;, &#8220;mindfulness&#8221;, &#8220;kindness&#8221;, &#8220;energy&#8221;. One of the teachers even ends each session with &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t been told lately that you&#8217;re loved, I love you.&#8221; That hit me hard the first time I heard it!! Everyone&#8217;s so welcoming there&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been experimenting with the different <em>types</em> of yoga too, like Restorative Yoga, Yin Yoga, Vinyasa Yoga, and most recently &#8211; Hot Yoga! Which is really something!! Haha&#8230; I almost passed out the first time I walked into the room, but my body has finally acclimated and it&#8217;s now one of my favorite ways to wake up in the morning. It&#8217;s so hard, and refreshing, at the same time!</p>
<p>(Also fun fact: my Wordle scores have been<em> off the chain</em> lately which I 100% attribute to yoga <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And now I can actually KEEP UP with all those young whippersnappers at my soccer games too! Lol&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>3) If all that exercise wasn&#8217;t enough, I also joined a Gym! </strong>Which was NOT something I ever would have guessed as I hate gyms, but as I mentioned in <a href="https://jmoney.biz/cascading-actions-and-watching-for-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my personal newsletter</a> last week when the world keeps hinting at stuff you have to listen&#8230; And for whatever reason, this voice keeps telling me to MOVE MY BODY more so for now at least I&#8217;m listening ;)</p>
<p>And it turns out gyms have other things than just weights too &#8211; like classes! So I&#8217;ve been very much enjoying their early morning Boot Camps which I alternate with the early morning Hot Yogas&#8230;. Apparently I thrive more in group sessions than being left to my own devices, lol&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>Quick aside:</p>
<p><strong>I was trying to explain all these recent events to a friend the other day, and it dawned on me that I&#8217;ve basically replaced spending time on &#8220;online projects&#8221; with spending more time on &#8220;the project of ME&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of hitting the laptop at 5 am I&#8217;m now hitting the gym and yoga studio, and instead of watching clicks and traffic every day I&#8217;m now watching my body and general mood! It&#8217;s quite a shift for someone who&#8217;s so used to being stationary and looking at screens all the time&#8230;.</p>
<p>And maybe something to consider yourself as well? When was the last time you worked on the <strong>Project of YOU?</strong>? Could you carve a little time away this week to build it out again?</p>
<p>It may not be soccer or yoga, but anything that improves your quality of life is worth spending time on. And I&#8217;ll tell you this much &#8211; <a href="https://jmoney.biz/cascading-actions-and-watching-for-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just starting somewhere</a>, *anywhere*, is enough to get the ball moving. As I recently read somewhere, &#8220;you must begin from where you are.&#8221; And I promise you it gets easier from there <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f5a4.png" alt="🖤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><strong>4) And lastly, the other new thing in my life lately is that I caved and I now collect Pokémon cards <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>Which I blame on my boys who insist on me taking them to the card store every other day (!!), eventually wearing me down as I was so tired of waiting around doing nothing while they peruse! Which, incidentally, is also what led me to skateboarding the other year after taking them to skate parks and waiting around, haha&#8230; So I guess I can&#8217;t hate on them too much ;) And now I actually know what they&#8217;re talking about whenever they discuss Pokemon which of course they love! So dad FTW!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <em><strong>Mimikyu</strong></em> btw, my favorite who&#8217;s as cute as he is scary (and the one main card I&#8217;ve chosen to collect so far):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67731" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mimikyu.png" alt="mimikyu" width="342" height="401" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mimikyu.png 342w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mimikyu-256x300.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[He&#8217;s shy and hides underneath an old rag pretending to be Pikachu, lol..]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<p>And then here are some updates on things that are OLD!</p>
<p><strong>Veggie Juicing</strong> &#8211; Still going strong!! Though my family has dropped off from joining me so now I only need to make it every <em>other</em> day as it makes enough for two glasses which cuts back on a LOT of time&#8230; All that cleaning and prepping gets old fast, not gonna lie, but man are <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/ive-turned-into-a-juicing-freak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the benefits</a> still worth it! My weight loss has stagnated, and actually started going back UP (I&#8217;m thinking maybe because of all the working out/yoga and building up more muscle?!) but the blood pressure is still low and I&#8217;m still avoiding most sugars and junk food too. So a great habit I plan on continuing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Volunteering</strong> &#8211; Dropped off a little since taking all those yoga classes, but just recently jumped back into it again and helping clean up/maintain our homeless shelter&#8217;s <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/whats-worse-job-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothing closet</a>. My fave! I haven&#8217;t seen <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/operation-give-back-in-real-life-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lizzy</a> in a while, but hopefully that&#8217;ll change now that I&#8217;m back, and meeting a ton of other new friends in the process. You always tend to focus on the job at hand and the &#8220;why&#8221; behind volunteering, but really the best part of it is just *being there* with people and talking with them! At the end of the day we&#8217;re all the same and very much need connection.</p>
<p><strong>Underwear Skipping</strong> &#8211; Remember when I tried going without underwear earlier this year???! Well, I&#8217;m happy/embarrassed to say that it&#8217;s stuck, haha&#8230; And usually only wear it now when I&#8217;m working out/yoga&#8217;ing because it&#8217;s just so much MORE comfortable without! I wish I&#8217;d done it my whole life! (And I KNOW some of you are doing it too because you&#8217;ve told me so, so don&#8217;t you give me that look ;))</p>
<p><strong>Jigsaw Puzzles</strong> &#8211; While I was hooked there for <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hot minute</a> over the holidays, I actually can&#8217;t even tell you the last time I broke one out&#8230; Probably January?! It was fun while it lasted, but then I got tired of feeling so lazy and had to join Real Life again, haha&#8230; And I&#8217;m glad I did. Else none of those new things up there would have come to pass! Cuz puzzles take so dang long!!! I&#8217;ll probably whip one out again this upcoming holiday season (why do puzzles feel so good at Xmas??!), but my obsession there has come to an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>So there you have it! I&#8217;ve turned from a coffee shop reader/lazy puzzle person earlier in the year, to a gym/yoga/soccer ACTIVE person now here towards the end of it! Wouldn&#8217;t have ever predicted that, but as the <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/year-of-the-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year of The Flow</a> continues, I&#8217;m constantly being surprised at what life puts in front of me, and even more excited to see what&#8217;s coming next&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>Now tell me what you&#8217;ve been up to! Any new and fun habits of your own forming? Has anything completely surprised you lately, for the better or the worse!? How are those finances going????</strong> </em></p>
<p>Probably good to at least talk about money for a second here since it&#8217;s still somewhat of a finance blog ;) As for me, the growth continues to climb with having <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so much invested in the stock market</a> these days, but recently we stopped contributing to the pot with me being out of work and not wanting to siphon away too much from our savings. So that&#8217;s the *bad* news.</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that we more or less break even every month which means I can continue with this <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/wifefi-status-activated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WifeFI</a> adventure for however long we like without tapping into investments! And right now, &#8220;we&#8221; most certainly like ;) I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll stumble into some money making venture at some point, but for now &#8211; Namaste! <em><strong><em>T</em>he Project of ME continues!</strong></em></p>
<p>Your friend in money and body (and soul),</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why some things just click and others don&#8217;t (I&#8217;ve never been a veggie man in my life!) but here we are going into our 5th straight week now and I have yet to miss a single day without my new favorite green cocktail.</p>
<p>IT FEELS SO GOOD!!! And I blame you, <em>Madiha</em>, for introducing me to it!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>She wrote me this note last month and it&#8217;s completely transformed my eating habits:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Hey! Please watch the documentary, <a href="https://youtu.be/q3I8hK3OqwY?si=nAsbynYStbc7K5i-&amp;t=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fat Sick and Nearly Dead</a>. Part 1 and 2 on youtube. The director, joe cross, did 40 days of green juicing exclusively to lose weight and cure himself of autoimmune skin diseases. It really works, God Willing. I hope and pray for your good health.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/q3I8hK3OqwY?si=nAsbynYStbc7K5i-&amp;t=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-67644 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster.jpg" alt="fat sick and nearly dead" width="361" height="558" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster.jpg 660w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster-194x300.jpg 194w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster-550x850.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/fat-sick-nearly-dead-poster-324x500.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Of course at first I rolled my eyes and was skeptic as hell, because come on &#8211; it screams scam!!</strong> And MLM! And any other &#8220;fast fixes&#8221; out there! But I also know that sometimes things <em>are</em> legit (like FIRE, Britney Spears), and if someone took the time to recommend something to me I&#8217;m at least going to check it out for a minute and not be a dick&#8230;.</p>
<p>So I loaded it up on YouTube and a few seconds turned into a few minutes, and a few minutes turned into 30 minutes, and before I knew it I had consumed the entire thing &#8211; and its counterpart, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDeTKomY4P8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fat Sick and Nearly Dead 2</a>! &#8211; and immediately knew it was for me. It just clicked. As if Jesus himself came down to me and proclaimed &#8220;The time has come!! Drink your veggies!!&#8221; Lol&#8230;</p>
<p>I figured there were no downsides in trying either. Worst case I eat a lot of vegetables (*gasp*), but best case I get healthier and happier and just better feeling all around! Which is really saying something since I&#8217;m<em> already</em> a pretty happy guy, but hey &#8211; you can always strive to be *better* right?</p>
<p><strong>Well, it&#8217;s now been over a whole month and I can confidently tell you this freakin&#8217; juice works :)</strong> And before you roll your eyes too, let me just show you what&#8217;s in it so you know it&#8217;s literally just veggies! No magic pills or powder or herbs or whatever else people are hawking these days. It&#8217;s as natural as it gets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-67654 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables.jpg" alt="mean green juice veggies" width="616" height="439" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables.jpg 700w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables-300x214.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/mean-green-juice-vegetables-550x392.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Kale, green apples, cucumber, lemon, celery, ginger root]</em></p>
<p>I just throw all this into the juicer &#8211; and voila &#8211; I&#8217;m sucking down more nutrients in this one helping that I normally would have in a month! And much more efficient than TRYING TO EAT ALL OF THIS too as a) there&#8217;s no way &#8211; bleh, and b) it hits your bloodstream much faster in juice form than chewing! (At least per the scientists in the doc).</p>
<p><strong>And that&#8217;s all there is to it. No magic sauce, no powders, nothing.</strong></p>
<p>I drink 1 of these every single afternoon, and then supplement it with a fruit/veggie/oats smoothie in the mornings and it&#8217;s completely revitalized me. I&#8217;m sleeping better. I&#8217;m feeling better. I haven&#8217;t had a headache in weeks (not that I got them too often, but usually after a coffee binge I would!! Lol) and so far not a single outbreak of my skin disease either (*knock on wood*).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe for it if you&#8217;re already sold  ;)</p>
<h2>&#8220;Mean Green Juice&#8221; Recipe:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cucumber</li>
<li>2 green apples</li>
<li>4 celery stalks</li>
<li>1 bunch of kale (if you can get it with stalks, get it! 8 stalks)</li>
<li>1 Lemon (or 1/2 a lemon, depending on your taste)</li>
<li>Ginger root (only one inch worth!! Do not burn your face off by putting an *entire* root in like I did at first and almost spraying it across my kitchen cabinets! Ginger is no joke!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The single best effect this has had so far though is that it&#8217;s completely infiltrated my *entire* habits around eating now.</strong></p>
<p>Similar to waking up about your personal finances or relationships/etc, you start to see the bigger picture and realize how all these little habits you&#8217;ve formed over your lifetime has been holding you back. Like the bagel I used to have every single morning, or all the late afternoon snacks I&#8217;d need to keep me energized and filled up on the daily.</p>
<p>The last time I had a bagel has now been over a month (!!) and the last time I had a bag of chips or cookie was&#8230;. well, yesterday! I&#8217;m not a masochist!! LOL&#8230; <em>But</em> it was only the 2nd time I allowed myself to indulge in such a treat since this &#8220;juice awakening&#8221; and let me tell you &#8211; it tastes soooo much better when it&#8217;s not a &#8220;habit treat!&#8221; And if you can believe it, I&#8217;ve even turned down big juicy pieces of Pizza too&#8230; PIZZA!!! Somebody stop me!!</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s like my eyes have finally been opened for the first time in 40 years, and I now realize how poorly I&#8217;ve been treating my body.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a handful of other interesting effects too:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I don&#8217;t eat as many helpings during dinner anymore</strong> (instead of 2-3 per usual, it&#8217;s down to 1-2)</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m accidentally losing a little weight!</strong> (Down 10 pounds and back to my usual &#8220;norm&#8221; before getting sick last year)</li>
<li><strong>My blood pressure has dropped significantly</strong> (I was hovering around &#8220;hypertension&#8221; at 140-something over 70-80, and the past two weeks now averaging 115-125ish over 60-70! A pretty big drop!)</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m finally using all those things in the kitchen I never use.</strong> (Minimalism win!! Lol) Like the blender and peelers and all those extra sets of drinking glasses we&#8217;ve gotten as gifts but had never really needed until now! We go through soooo many glasses now with all these extra drinks added on!</li>
<li><strong>That nagging thought of &#8220;needing to be healthier&#8221; is slowly fading&#8230;</strong> (I no longer have those pangs of regret/wishful thinking about eating better, very much like my new <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/when-youre-stuck-write/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volunteering efforts</a> because I&#8217;m finally DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT!)</li>
<li><strong>But probably the best side effect is how excited my kids are too :)</strong> Not only do most of them drink my concoctions every single day (even my 5 y/o!!) but one likes it so much that I told him he never has to eat veggies again if he continues it up, haha&#8230; Which is hilarious because a) there are SO MANY MORE VEGGIES in these drinks than the few we put on his table each day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, but also b) he cannot STAND spinach to the point he has to crumple it up and down it with a large glass of milk every night *while plugging his nose*, and yet he doesn&#8217;t even notice it at all in these cocktails&#8230; It&#8217;s the perfect kid hack!</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah. Super wild and random this whole juicing phenomenon in my household right now, but again, like other things in life when something just feels right and clicks you gotta run with it as far as you can!</p>
<p><strong>And if you&#8217;re wondering about the costs, yes &#8211; it <em>does</em> get pretty pricey as you&#8217;re just loading in sooooooo much food with every single drink.</strong> AND you constantly need to be buying more of it because only so much fits in your fridge and you want it to be as fresh as possible!! But &#8211; it also leads to less snacking and over-gorging yourself with food in general (at least if you have the same effects as I do), so that certainly defrays the costs. I may be spending loads more on vegetables every week, but I&#8217;ve also cut out 90% of the garbage!</p>
<p>The other pricey part can be getting your hands on the juicer itself. But until you&#8217;ve tried it and KNOW it will stick, just borrow one from your friends and family instead! I guarantee one of them has one stashed away in the back corner of their cabinets somewhere from failed attempts of their own, lol&#8230; Maybe even you too? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I borrowed one from my sister (pictured below) and will be forever grateful for it&#8230; Because unlike <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/money-experiments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other experiments</a>, you DO unfortunately need one of these guys to fully give it a go. A blender will get you partially the way there, but the juicer is where the magic lies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67626" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use.jpg" alt="bella juicier i use" width="400" height="531" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use.jpg 400w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use-226x300.jpg 226w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/bella-juicer-i-use-377x500.jpg 377w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><strong>I should also note that that&#8217;s exactly what this is here for me &#8211; an experiment.</strong> Something I&#8217;m trying out and hoping to do *more* of as time goes on, but for now just building up slowly and taking note of how it&#8217;s affecting me.</p>
<p>In the documentary the main subject (<a href="https://www.rebootwithjoe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Cross</a>) takes it to an extreme level because he found himself in a pretty extreme situation: fat, sick, and nearly dead as he puts it ;) So he decided to try out a 60 day &#8220;juice fast&#8221; drinking nothing but this Mean Green juice and that&#8217;s it. No snacks, no meals, no dinners &#8211; nothing! Which of course makes it a compelling documentary to watch, if only to see if he survives in the end, lol&#8230;</p>
<p>But for me it was more of a wake up call realizing just how little veggies (or thought, really) I put into my diet on a daily basis. So as the inspiration struck I decided to just go for it and start juicing as a &#8220;supplement&#8221; to see how it goes rather than any &#8220;meal replacements.&#8221; And as you can see it&#8217;s already had some quite profound effects! (If you are interested in going the &#8220;meal replacement&#8221;/fasting route fyi, then beware you need to float it by your doctor first to make sure it&#8217;s safe!)</p>
<p><strong>Oh, and the taste?! You would assume it&#8217;s gag worthy and anything but enticing, but it&#8217;s actually not that bad! </strong>It&#8217;s weird and *different* tasting, for sure, but it&#8217;s also oddly refreshing. And the bit of ginger you put in there gives it a nice little kick that you often don&#8217;t get with this &#8220;healthy&#8221; stuff. It literally feels like a shower for my insides every time I take a sip, haha&#8230; It cleans out all the dirt and bad stuff in there and makes it all clean and pretty again! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve started incorporating other juices in our household as well to spice things up. Namely a beet one, and you can probably guess why it&#8217;s now one of the kids&#8217; favorites ;)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-67614" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face.jpg" alt="beet red lips" width="502" height="318" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face-300x190.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/beet-juice-face-550x348.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[Recipe: 3 beets + 4 carrots + 2 oranges!]</p>
<p>All this to say that if any of this juicing stuff interests you here in the *slightest*, please please please AT LEAST watch <a href="https://youtu.be/x9SGWcZwk7c?si=BvCfVHIdDrvtEK4K" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the trailer</a> of the doc and see if it inspires you! If it&#8217;s boring and lame then of course go on your merry way, but if it sparks something like it did for me, then keep going and see where it takes you!</p>
<p><strong>Just adding one glass of green juice to your diet can be enough to improve your life!! You can never have too many veggies!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Big thanks again to Madiha who accidentally turned me into this freak, and big thanks to you all for reading as well ;)</strong></p>
<p>If any of you decide to give this a shot &#8211; please tell me how it all goes!! Friends who juice together, stay together!!</p>
<p>XOXO,</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I really liked this clip from someone who started juicing in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDeTKomY4P8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2nd documentary</a> &#8230; It really is the best part of it all:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize how bad I felt for so long, until I felt this good&#8230; And, in fact, losing weight is probably an important but small portion of the whole equation. Just the introduction to juice into our household has significantly increased the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables that the entire family eats.

<p>Anyone else do these??</p>
<h2>#1. The Trash Bag Hack</h2>
<p>You know how every time you have to change the kitchen trash bag it&#8217;s super annoying cuz you have to go digging under your sink for the box of them, and then a couple of days later you have to do it all over again?</p>
<p>Well, at first I thought I hacked it pretty well by just pulling out 6 or 7 bags at a time and throwing those at the bottom each time saving me a little grief, but even still I got annoyed so last month <strong>I put THE ENTIRE ROLL of bags at the bottom of the can</strong>, lol&#8230; I&#8217;m not gonna have to do it again now for at least a couple more months! BOOM!<br />
<img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-67539 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/trash-bag-hack.jpg" alt="trash bag hack" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/trash-bag-hack.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/trash-bag-hack-300x225.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/trash-bag-hack-550x413.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2>#2. The Water Bottle / Mowing Hack</h2>
<p>I thought of this over the weekend and it was a game changer :) Instead of keeping my water in the garage or somewhere else outside to trek to whenever I&#8217;m thirsty, I decided to just <strong>plop it right there ON TOP of the mower</strong> that way it&#8217;s only inches from my mouth instead of yards! Not only did it save me time and annoyance having to back track to it every time I needed to hydrate, but I actually drank MORE water since it was right there in front of me as a reminder! Triple win!<br />
<img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-67540 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/water-mowing-hack.jpg" alt="water mowing hack" width="440" height="565" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/water-mowing-hack.jpg 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/water-mowing-hack-234x300.jpg 234w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/water-mowing-hack-389x500.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>(<strong>THOUGH WARNING:</strong> This worked perfectly with my *electric* mower (see top pic), but when I switched to my gas one when the battery drained it did not prove as successful, haha&#8230; (see below pic). It not only burned a whole in the bottom draining out the water, but it was piping hot when I tried downing the remaining molecules!! Do NOT try at home, lol&#8230; (Though in my defense I put it far away from the engine, but it must have moved in transit and got way too close to the hot parts, womp womp&#8230;)</p>

<h2>#3. The &#8220;Throwing it on The Floor&#8221; Hack</h2>
<p>I stole this idea from my friend Travis Pizel, and it came in handy the other night when I was out of body wash in the shower&#8230;</p>
<p>It was the third time I meant to replace it when I was all done, but as usually happens I get caught up in my daydreams and completely forget once I&#8217;m out. So this time <strong>*I threw the empty bottle out of the shower*, </strong>and when I got out I saw it laying there on the floor there &#8211; and voila! It prompted* me to replace it right then and there!</p>
<p>Travis calls this the &#8220;<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/financial-triggers-grow-your-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reminder Pillow</a>&#8221; , and uses it all the time before drifting off to sleep:</p>
<p><em>For some reason it ALWAYS seems like I remember something that has to be done just as I climb into bed and get comfy. So, I reach down, grab one of the bazillion extra pillows scattered around our bed and chuck it across the room. Vonnie will ask, “What are you doing?” My response: “Reminder pillow.” The next morning when I get up, I’ll stumble across the pillow in the doorway and think to myself, “Hey, why is there a pillow laying….. ooooooh yeah, right” and I instantly remember what it was I had forgotten to do the night before. :)”</em></p>
<p>A quick easy hack that can be used anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>And that&#8217;s all I got for you today! Hope you can use one or two of these :) If you got any silly little tricks of your own, please do share them in the comments!</strong></p>
<p>Yours in better human&#8217;ing,</p>

<p>*<a href="http://jamesclear.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Clear</a> calls this whole idea of throwing stuff &#8220;triggers&#8221;&#8230; Where an object <em>triggers</em> your brain to do or think something and says it&#8217;s imperative when working on goals.
