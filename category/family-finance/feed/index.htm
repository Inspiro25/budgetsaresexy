<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>For every (clump) of dog poop you pick up from our yard, I will give you 50¬¢!</strong></p>
<p>BOOM! One less task for me, and more cash for them &#8211; which should literally only take like 15 seconds. And where can you find an hourly rate like that as a kid?! You&#8217;d think this would have motivated them, but no. After two weeks and approximately 0 scoops my genius idea was proven to be not that genius at all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f643.png" alt="üôÉ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So I did what any good problem solver would do &#8211; I upped it to $1.00 a clump (DOUBLE the reward!!!). But sadly that didn‚Äôt fair much better either, clocking in with a total of just *1* scoop out of about 130 opportunities given&#8230; And that was only after me <em>hinting</em> there was a golden prize right next to their feet where they were playing!</p>
<p><strong>So back to the beginning we were, with me in the fields again scooping away, and them very much still in want of money&#8230;</strong> Though if you ask me, if you can&#8217;t even bend over for a few seconds to earn some quick cash, do you actually really want it <em>that</em> bad? ;)</p>
<p>(As an aside, I‚Äôm writing all this on my phone right now in the middle of the gastrointestinal office awaiting my own colonoscopy results, haha‚Ä¶ Poo is on the mind today!! UPDATE: I‚Äôm in the clear!¬† They found a polyp in there during the procedure, but apparently it was ‚Äúthe good kind‚Äù so I&#8217;m set to go for another 5 years &#8211; #Adulting)</p>
<p>After marinating on it for a while and trying to come up with a more enticing offer, we realized we&#8217;ve never officially implemented any type of &#8220;allowance&#8221; deal yet with our family. And perhaps now was just the time to enact one? <em><strong>Maybe the incorporation of¬† *timelines* and getting weekly paychecks would motivate them more?</strong></em></p>
<p>Or maybe they just really don&#8217;t like poop, I dunno, but either way at 10, 9 and 5 it was high-time they start appreciating where money came from more. Especially if they&#8217;re gonna take over this blog one day ;)</p>
<p>I remember how important allowances were for ME growing up, even if I was only getting paid $1.00/week and all my friends made fun of me (!!!), but it was enough to give me a little freedom and push in the right direction. So I dug up an old wipey board from the basement and got to work&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67432" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart.jpg" alt="chore chart" width="640" height="442" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart.jpg 640w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart-300x207.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/chore-chart-550x380.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Each kid has one daily task to complete, and if they accomplish it &#8211; AND &#8211; keep up with their other general responsibilities like making their bed and cleaning up after themselves, they&#8217;ll be entitled to an allowance at the end of the week.</p>
<p>If, however, they only do a partial job in any area, they&#8217;ll then get a 1/2 check and too many 1/2 checks will result in <em>less</em> of an allowance at the week&#8217;s end. You&#8217;ll see Baby Dime up there already got one after a couple of days rockin&#8217; it.</p>
<p><strong>As for their pay? $3.00/week.</strong> BUT! This isn&#8217;t just any ordinary allowance, oh no. As recommended by my oldest son, Baby Penny, we&#8217;ll be following the concept from the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3r4rcnC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Cups</a> by Tony Townsley*. A fantastic read that surprisingly all three of my kids love! And one that recommends splitting allowances into 3 equal parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup for spending</li>
<li>1 cup for savings</li>
<li>and 1 cup for giving</li>
</ul>
<p>Thereby teaching kids the importance of all THREE, and getting those habits started early. <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/angelina-jolie-budget-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Even stars like Angeline Jolie does this</a>!! Though perhaps filling up their <em>houses</em> with cash instead of plastic cups <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And since my kids will be *manually* receiving and divvying up their cash each week vs digitally on a screen, hopefully it&#8217;ll all sink in even more too. I&#8217;ve already headed to the bank to get stacks of ones now that I&#8217;ll be turning into an ATM!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67418" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/cash-gif.gif" alt="cash gif" width="320" height="405" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[live shot of me flipping through a stack]</p>
<p><strong>I gotta give my oldest boy mad credit again for this.</strong> We were originally going to start their allowances at $2.00/week which they could do whatever they want with, but it was him who brought up the book and said he&#8217;d like to get a little more involved and give back. I almost cried and immediately changed it.</p>
<p>And as you can see, we&#8217;re off to a great start! Everyone is more or less doing their part each day, and I can already tell they&#8217;re taking it seriously and excited for what they can now do with their extra money. We&#8217;ll see how long it lasts, but for now I&#8217;m a proud dad, and I&#8217;d like to think a *smart* one too ;)</p>
<p><strong>Hopefully the $$$ teachings of your kids are going well for you over there! If any of them are interested in scooping up poop, my $1.00/offer is still on the table!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yours in daddying,</p>

<p>*I first read <a href="https://amzn.to/3r4rcnC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Cups</a> when we did a giveaway for it here on the blog over 13 years ago &#8211; way before any of my kids were born or I even had to think about allowances! Highly recommend checking out if you&#8217;re going down similar adventures right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/wifefi-status-activated/" title="WifeFI Status Activated &#x26a1;" rel="nofollow"><img width="700" height="442" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/wife-fi.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="wife-fi" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/wife-fi.jpg 700w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/wife-fi-300x189.jpg 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/wife-fi-550x347.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p>Good morning!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s something interesting &#8211; I haven&#8217;t made any real money for the past 6 months! And even wilder &#8211; I haven&#8217;t even noticed it much lately??! It&#8217;s the first time <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/all-30-jobs-ive-ever-done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since I started working</a> that I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;salary&#8221;, thereby officially entering me into the status of <em><strong>WifeFI</strong></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;Financially Independent, enabled by my wife who still works <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#8221;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I do make some money <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/hire-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consulting</a> each month, as well as some extra change typing away my thoughts here (and that&#8217;s literally all it is these days, as it turns out when you nix most of your ads you don&#8217;t get paid! lol), but by and large my income is inconsequential compared to my wife&#8217;s which is currently paying all the bills right now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting place to be. I&#8217;m not very motivated to chase money for some reason, but I&#8217;m also not satisfied just laying around and doing nothing either&#8230; Hence &#8211; <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/allow-me-to-re-introduce-myself-my-name-is-j-money-oh-j-to-the-moneyyy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why I&#8217;m back here at the blog</a>! But even more surprisingly &#8211; I haven&#8217;t really <em>missed</em> my paychecks since the Motley Fool gave me the boot earlier this year, which was no small amount at $10,000+ mo.</p>
<p>How a guy can go from obsessing over money to not even noticing he hasn&#8217;t got paid in a while is beyond me&#8230;¬† Though to be honest it actually makes me feel kinda proud of myself! :) It means I&#8217;m no longer a slave to the green as I once was, nor am I using up the bulk of my time chasing it all the time. I&#8217;m much more focused on *life* now and just &#8220;being&#8221;, and while I still have to pay attention to money of course, it&#8217;s no longer the top priority it once was.</p>
<p><strong>I think &#8220;peace&#8221; is the right word for it. Financial peace.</strong></p>
<p>And it was right around <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/7-perks-money-buys-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the $400k mark</a> when I first really started noticing this&#8230; Enough to feel secure and pay all the bills, but also still able to have a little extra for fun and flexibility. With each additional $100k just adding to the foundation and making money less and less important over time. (Or I should say, not as &#8220;life changing&#8221; &#8211; I still very much LIKE having money, lol, but it doesn&#8217;t drastically change my life anymore)</p>
<p>I should also note that this comes from a super privileged white dude who&#8217;s had fortune and luck on his side the entire time :) Sure I&#8217;ve worked my a$$ off over the years and proud of what I&#8217;ve built, but I&#8217;ve also had a leg up throughout it and need to keep reminding myself to appreciate it all which I oftentimes fail at more than I care to admit&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Still, I never saw this stage coming!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It actually marks the 6th one since starting the journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>1995-2008: I was a <strong>SINK</strong> (Single Income, No Kids)</li>
<li>2008 &#8211; 2010: We were <strong>DINKs</strong> (Dual Income, No Kids)</li>
<li>2010 &#8211; 2013:¬† Then <strong>SINKs</strong> (Single Income, No Kids)</li>
<li>2013 &#8211; 2016: Then the hairiest &#8211; <strong>SIKs</strong>! (Single Income, Kids)</li>
<li>2016 &#8211; 2022: Then back to the good life, <strong>DIKs</strong> (Double Income, Kids)</li>
<li>2022 &#8211; present: And now <strong>WIFEFI</strong> (Wife Enabled Financial Independence)</li>
</ul>
<p>Such drastic stages over the years. With the best ones outside of a $hit sandwich, haha&#8230; Those middle <strong>SIK</strong> years there were pretty rough for a while!! When <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-update-down-40k-10-percent-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a perfect storm</a> of events hit, and completely sucked our savings from <strong><em>$94,000</em></strong> down to a paltry <strong><em>$3,000</em></strong> in three short years&#8230; It was pretty embarrassing as a money blogger, but of course we continued <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/blogging-business-money-fails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to share it all</a> in the name of transparency! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44a.png" alt="üëä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Then the wife jumped back into the workforce after a 5+ year hiatus (she went back to school to get her Masters and PhD) and we were once again back to smooth sailing&#8230; Which is just one of the half dozen reasons she continues to work: she wants to use all those hard-earned degrees!, she genuinely enjoys what she does, the job is STABLE (a government one, which helps counter balance my very much non-solid one, haha&#8230;), and then of course there&#8217;s the benefits like retirement funds and pensions (remember those?) as well as a fantastic health insurance plan.</p>
<p><strong>So don&#8217;t think this is just me taking advantage of her! Which I am still a little, of course &#8211; who doesn&#8217;t want a Sugar Mama?! &#8211; but in reality it&#8217;s her not wanting to join me in the dark side yet, as well as reaping the rewards after years of hustling ;)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yet another benefit of paying attention to all this stuff!! So one day you don&#8217;t have to!</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens from here (do I go back and get a &#8220;job&#8221; later after missing money??? Do I go the opposite way and cut *everything* out to free up even more time? Do I forever remain Wife-Fi&#8217;d?) but as it stands today, I&#8217;m at peace&#8230; Another new life experience under the belt!</p>
<p><em><strong>What financial stage are you currently in? Are you content with it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Your fiscally sexy friend,</p>

<p>Three examples:</p>
<p><strong>#1. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t cry at drop off for a *month* I will buy you whatever you want!</strong>&#8221; &#8211; I blurted this out over dinner one night (one too many whiskeys), and my 4 year old&#8217;s eyes lit up like it was Xmas Eve&#8230; He&#8217;d been having trouble getting into preschool each morning (he LOVES it there but for some reason cries as soon as I&#8217;m about to leave him) and everything we&#8217;ve tried up to that point wasn&#8217;t working&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can get anyyyyyyything???&#8221; he says with a sly grin. &#8220;Yup, anything! Within reason!!&#8221; I start backpeddling, lol&#8230; &#8220;Okay, deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just like that it was on&#8230; Which a) surprised the crap out of me because it&#8217;s been such A THING lately and there&#8217;s no way this silly little trick was gonna work, right?, and b) I started to get nervous because all of a sudden I had promised him a big, probably expensive, prize, haha&#8230; But I knew he couldn&#8217;t ask for anything <em>too</em> crazy &#8216;cuz his imagination isn&#8217;t as developed as his older brothers&#8217;, and a few minutes later I was put to ease when he came back with, &#8220;I want a giant squishmallow.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-66773 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/squishmallow-unicorn.png" alt="squishmallow" width="431" height="479" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/squishmallow-unicorn.png 500w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/squishmallow-unicorn-270x300.png 270w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/squishmallow-unicorn-450x500.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[A giant squishmallow &#8211; adorable, cuddly, under $40!]</em></p>
<p><strong>Examples #2. and #3.</strong> Upon hearing this interaction and the joy emanating from little bro&#8217;s face, the two older bros wanted in on the action and promptly asked what challenge<em> they</em> can do too for a prize. I thought about the different areas they were currently struggling with, and came up with their respective challenges:</p>
<p><strong>For older bro #1 (8 y/o): He has to go an entire month eating whatever we serve up for dinner that night &#8211; and not complain about it. </strong>We&#8217;d gotten into the bad habit of preparing him something different on nights he didn&#8217;t like what we were serving (a major fail on OUR part, of course, probably due to bad memories of our own childhoods of &#8220;if you don&#8217;t like it, starve!&#8221; LOL) and before we could get into more of the details he quickly complied, &#8220;I&#8217;m in.&#8221; And deal #2 was made.</p>
<p>This time, however, I was smart enough to put a cap on the prize FIRST ($50), to which he said he&#8217;d let us know later what he wanted so he can enjoy all the possibilities first&#8230; Something his old man likes to do too ;) (So far he&#8217;s considered Pok√©mon cards, Robux credit, a music player he can have all to himself, and most recently a drone after a Target visit &#8211; the place where all dreams come true)</p>
<p>As for the oldest boy, 10 y/o Not-So-<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-much-babies-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baby Penny</a> who&#8217;s perfect in almost every single way (I&#8217;m allowed to say that because I&#8217;m his dad!) the challenge tailored to him was to go a whole month *<strong>without asking any questions he already knows the answers to*, or those he can easily figure out if he thinks hard enough.</strong></p>
<p>He&#8217;s currently at that stage of asking never ending questions, one after another after another &#8211; which is fine! We encourage curiosity in our house! &#8211; but many of them we&#8217;ve noticed don&#8217;t really need to be asked if he just took a few seconds to think about it first. And if he catches himself before we can answer his questions, it doesn&#8217;t count &#8211; that way he&#8217;s got some wiggle room since admittedly he&#8217;s got more opportunity to fail than his brothers who only have to overcome their bad habits *once* each day. We also put the cap at $50 for him too, though interestingly he hasn&#8217;t even so much as *hinted* to what he wants in the end so I&#8217;m super curious to what&#8217;s brewing in there!!</p>
<p><strong>But we&#8217;re now into week #4 of them all, and if you can believe it &#8211; everyone&#8217;s on track to get their prizes!! A fall miracle!!<br />
</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66789" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budget-boys.jpg" alt="budget boys" width="514" height="659" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budget-boys.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budget-boys-234x300.jpg 234w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budget-boys-550x705.jpg 550w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/budget-boys-390x500.jpg 390w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></p>
<p>Baby Dime hasn&#8217;t shed a single tear in three and a half weeks, much to the shock &#8211; and joy &#8211; of his teachers (they asked me what the trick was and thought it was hilarious when I told them I cheated and bribed him, lol&#8230;), Baby Nickel has eaten every single thing we&#8217;ve put on his plate so far, even if it takes him longer to finish than the rest of us, and Not-So-Baby Penny has since been learning how to answer his own questions in his head, saving everyone in the household major sanity ;)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how proud of them I am. And of myself for coming up with the genius plan, hahaha&#8230;</p>
<p>Really goes to show how powerful rewards can be, though, both mentally and physically. All three of them had said over and over again how <em>hard</em> it is to overcome this stuff and that they &#8220;just can&#8217;t do it&#8221; before the challenges, yet here we are weeks later and they&#8217;re just breezing through it!! It was all in their head!! And of course ultimately I&#8217;m hoping it sticks WELL AFTER the deadline which was my ultimate motive for it all. Outside of just having some peace and quite for a little bit ;)</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the key parts I think that have made this so successful &#8211; in case you want to try it out in your household ;)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pick things that can go on to become better *habits*</li>
<li>Pick things that are *doable* for each of them <em>specifically</em> (all 3 of my kids were saying &#8220;how easy&#8221; each others&#8217; missions were, but that&#8217;s only of course because they&#8217;ve mastered &#8217;em already! The point is to overcome their unique struggles, which will be different for each kid)</li>
<li>Pick things that really annoy you/the entire family! lol&#8230;</li>
<li>Put in the clause &#8211; &#8220;if you miss a day, the clock starts over&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how often that last one comes up in conversation ;) It serves as a perfect back up motivator on days when you think they may slip up!</p>
<p>We also incorporated some general leeway for each of them too, depending on the circumstance. For example, when my 8 y/o got sick he could &#8220;pause&#8221; the mission until he was feeling better, and for the oldest boy as I mentioned he was able to &#8220;take back&#8221; his question if he catches himself before we answer it. But for the most part this &#8220;clock starting over&#8221; clause has been enough to keep them all on track so far&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s also important to know *what* exactly motivates them too.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Some are excited over candy, others want cash, and then there&#8217;s the rare ones who just yearn for the inherent rewards of personal satisfaction ;) Candy and money bribes did *not* work in my case (nor the personal satisfaction &#8211; they laughed in my face when I brought that up!), but turns out the &#8220;world of possibilities&#8221; under a certain amount did motivate them enough to take action. All of which not being that different for us adults.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&#8217;s one more silly example of the power of rewards:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BudgetsAreSexy/status/1582810390823510016" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-66777" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/book-find-reward.png" alt="book find reward" width="640" height="192" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/book-find-reward.png 877w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/book-find-reward-300x90.png 300w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/book-find-reward-768x230.png 768w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/book-find-reward-550x165.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>So cash hasn&#8217;t lost its edge entirely! Lol&#8230; Different situations call for different rewards ;)</p>
<p><em><strong>What type of challenges are you currently working on? What are the rewards you have set up for yourself?<br />
</strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you set off on your fun-filled weekend of spoiling one another with presents and delicious meals‚Ä¶ check out this video about what kids </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want for Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 2-min video came out ~5 years ago, so some of you may have seen it already. It‚Äôs called ‚Äú</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3ePGr8Q7k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Other Letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù, made by IKEA Spain.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Fair warning: Get a box of tissues ready! I bawled my eyes out ‚Äì and I‚Äôm not even a parent yet!**</span></i></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="IKEA The Other Letter" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ3ePGr8Q7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3ePGr8Q7k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Other Letter</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video they used 10 families for an experiment‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, they asked the children to write a letter to Santa Claus listing all the things they wanted for Christmas. The kids listed big items like guitars, pianos, and toys‚Ä¶ typical big presents that most children want at Christmastime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the children were asked to write a second letter‚Ä¶ This time, to their parents. Same as the Santa letter, but this time they were asking what they would </span><b>want from their parents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Christmas. And this is where the kids‚Äô answers got really interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, kids just want love, time and attention. They want you to be there for them, experience things with them, and play with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presents are great. But</span><b> spending quality time with family is the most precious thing in the world.¬†</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs not forget that this weekend. :)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching this stuff a bit further, I wanted to share with you all what I‚Äôve been learning. At the top of my list has been figuring out some type of formal will(s) for me and my wife. Surprisingly, it doesn‚Äôt seem as difficult as I expected.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Also, because death is such a sad topic, I‚Äôm going to sporadically include pictures of Cooper as a puppy to lighten the mood. Everyone likes puppies, right!?**</span></i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was taken the day we picked him up at the shelter in 2013. We lucked out big time finding this lil guy!</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Defining All the Estate Planning Terms</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, here are some words that I had to google. You might know this stuff already but I thought I‚Äôd share anyway ‚Äòcause I found it helpful!</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Probate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a </span><b>legal process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where a court decides how a deceased person&#8217;s estate is going to be administered. If there is a will, the court decides whether the will is valid. If there is no will, the court will follow intestacy laws. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f447.png" alt="üëá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></li>
<li><b>Intestacy (or ‚Äúintestate‚Äù):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For people who </span><b>die without a will</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, each U.S. state has a set of laws that determine who inherits the assets. Usually this is heirs, relatives, descendants, etc., but it can get pretty complex if there are step-children, in-laws, undocumented partnerships and stuff like that. Many people get screwed by sucky state laws, so having a will is <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4af.png" alt="üíØ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> better!</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Last Will &amp; Testament:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a legal document with the wishes of the deceased person. It lists how they want their property to be divided, and also *who* they want to help manage the distribution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>‚ÄúLiving‚Äù Will:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is different from a will for when you die&#8230; A living will is for when you are still alive but are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incapacitated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or can‚Äôt handle your affairs. It‚Äôs also called an Advanced Healthcare Directive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Executor:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Person (or people) chosen to carry out the transfer of assets. If there is a will, the executor is usually named already and they follow whatever the will says. If there is no will, the court appoints an executor (usually a relative), and they have to follow whatever the court deems is the correct transfer for the assets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Beneficiary:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the person who will receive the benefit of stuff. They can be named inside the will, a trust, or with financial institutions directly designated within an account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Trust:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is kind of like a will, but it‚Äôs a more custom and hardcore legal document to pass assets between people. Having a trust can bypass probate, keep transfers private, and can have tax deferral/avoidance measures. **Note** A trust cannot decide who will be the guardian of children; only a will can name guardians for kids. Check out more </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/051315/will-vs-trust-difference-between-two.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will vs. trust stuff here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FYI: Many people choose to have *both* a will and a trust. Even though there‚Äôs a lot of overlap, one can provide a back-up for the other if something‚Äôs not executed properly.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64262 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Cooper-as-a-puppy-scaled-e1634859994889.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me and Coops, almost 9 years ago!</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>How to Avoid Probate</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, I‚Äôd like my wife to avoid probate court because it seems expensive and time-consuming. There are a couple of ways I can help do this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Listing beneficiaries directly at financial institutions:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If I can pass assets directly to my wife legally through bank accounts, retirement accounts, etc., then she can take ownership without going through probate court. (I‚Äôve already done this for our checking, savings accounts and retirement accounts.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Having joint ownership for assets and properties:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For our duplex, other rentals and joint brokerage account, my wife is already a co-owner. Owning assets jointly means if one of us dies, the other survivor takes ownership and in most cases doesn‚Äôt have to go through probate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Getting a living trust:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having a trust can avoid probate&#8230; But, ALL assets need to be transferred into the name of the trust for this to be applicable. This seems like a real pain in the ass to do, and might be more applicable if we had kids.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, I think the majority of our assets &#8212; and certainly the most valuable ones &#8212; are going to be easy to transfer without probate if one of us dies. I‚Äôm feeling MUCH BETTER knowing all this stuff.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**If you haven‚Äôt done this already, add it to your to-do list ASAP‚Ä¶ Go through ALL your accounts/assets and call the bank/broker/county to make sure your designated beneficiaries are up to date. Only takes a few minutes, and could save a HUGE amount of time for your loved one if you die.**</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64263 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/IMG_0320-e1634860003573.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="733" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooper and I took photos like this every couple weeks, but soon enough he couldn‚Äôt even fit on my lap anymore. :)</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Writing a Will</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I have already thought through the scenario if one of us dies, but </span><b>what will happen if BOTH of us die at the same time?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weird to think about, but this is actually a very possible scenario being that we travel together and do almost everything together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a basic will and testament would help whoever cleans up our financial mess and inherits our stuff. I certainly don‚Äôt want to leave it up to the government to decide!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is, writing a will doesn‚Äôt seem as hard or as scary as I thought it‚Äôd be. In fact, we could even write one ourselves pretty easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found this article helpful: </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/24/should-you-write-your-own-will.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you write your own will?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬† And also this </span><a href="https://statelaws.findlaw.com/estate-planning-laws/wills.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of basic will requirements per state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, the basic requirements for having a legal will are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) be 18 or older</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) not be drunk/on drugs when it‚Äôs written</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) signed by a couple of witnesses</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we could do it ourselves, given the size of our estate, it‚Äôs prolly a good idea to have some professional help. Also, it seems that estate planning software covers a handful of other scenarios if disaster strikes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/personal/estate-planning/estate-planning-bundle.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LegalZoom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one I‚Äôve been looking into. For their basic bundle it looks like I can get:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last will and testament &#8211; for me</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last will and testament &#8211; for wife</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power of attorney &#8211; for me</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power of attorney &#8211; for wife</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living will &#8211; for me</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living will &#8211; for wife</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bundle price for all these: $279</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I like about using professional software to prepare documents is they use all of the state-specific requirements and ask the right questions to produce a complete will. My biggest fear is that in a probate situation they might determine that a will is not valid, in which case I‚Äôll have done all this work for nothing. So having professional help is nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for a trust, I don‚Äôt think my wife and I really need one at this point. This might change as our family grows, but for now we‚Äôll just start with getting basic wills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read this if you‚Äôre wondering </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/revocablelivingtrust.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you should set up a trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64259 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Cooper-Mirror-scaled-e1634859970377.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out how mirrors work ;)</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>You‚Äôll Need to Have Hard Conversations About Inheritance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welp, here comes the hard part for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just about to start the LegalZoom process, but then it hit me‚Ä¶ </span><b>My wife and I still need to talk about who the heck inherits our mess if we die!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this &#8212; I think &#8212; is the hardest part of anyone‚Äôs planning process. Filling out forms is easy. But actually sitting down and having tough conversations is what most people avoid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since my wife is still touchy and crying about the last letter I wrote, I‚Äôll need to figure out a way to make this as unemotional and easy as possible. More to come on this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any of you done this already and have any tips?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay safe out there my friends,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, Joel</span></p>

I like to read boring terms and conditions, geek out on all our tax stuff, deal with real estate, etc.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a passion for personal finance, which helps! She does not &#8212; and I don‚Äôt blame her as most people find this shit boring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, this morbid thought came to mind ‚Ä¶</span><b> If I die before we‚Äôre financially independent, my wife might have a hard time converting our ‚Äúcouples FIRE plan‚Äù into a ‚Äúsingle person‚Äôs FIRE plan.‚Äù</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about death isn‚Äôt fun, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">planning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for it is even worse. But hey, we all die someday. And with the increased shark sightings at my local surf spot recently, maybe I‚Äôll be gone sooner rather than later. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Bad joke &#8212; sorry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, I haven‚Äôt done much estate planning. Since we don‚Äôt have kids yet and no big debts, I‚Äôve kind of just assumed that when I die, my wife would be fine financially. She‚Äôs certainly capable of figuring stuff out on her own (10x my smarts). But because our portfolio landscape is a little messy right now (various real estate investments, random bank/credit card churning, multiple retirement accounts, etc.), maybe it‚Äôs time I start documenting some of this stuff and coming up with a formal plan that would help her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I started writing down some changes my wife would want to make to streamline our (her) finances when I am no longer in the picture. Our overall FI strategy wouldn‚Äôt change that much (Coast FI), but having some written plans is never a bad idea &#8212; especially for someone dealing with grief of a lost loved one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a draft letter, which is just a starting-off point. This coming year I‚Äôm going to prioritize more official estate plans, including a will, proper records, and all that grow-up stuff I should have started years ago.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">***BTW‚Ä¶ As I was researching some of this estate planning stuff, I came across 2 much more thorough articles you might want to check out. </span></i><a href="https://www.lhlic.com/consumer-resources/what-to-do-when-someone-dies/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checklist for when a spouse dies</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><a href="https://www.fool.com/retirement/letter.aspx"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write this letter to your family before you‚Äôre gone.</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Things to Do With Our Money If I Die</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúDear beautiful wife,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So sorry I broke my promise to live until we‚Äôre both 100&#8230; And I‚Äôm even more sorry about the financial shitshow I‚Äôm leaving behind! Hopefully, this letter will help you clean up the mess, simplify our stuff, and help you create a new/clean plan moving forward.</span></p>
<h2><b>Things to Do Immediately</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing! Honestly, there‚Äôs nothing you need to worry about within the first few weeks of my death.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have enough cash in our checking accounts to live for a few months.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your name is on ALL our cash accounts as a joint owner.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALL our credit cards are on auto-pay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALL our bills and utilities are on auto-pay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALL our properties and syndications are cash flow positive with rent auto-deposited into our accounts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So don‚Äôt freak out or worry about money right away. Nothing needs to be handled urgently.</span></p>
<h2><b>Things to Do Within ~1 Month</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can do anything with our (your) accounts, you‚Äôll probably need to show the bank/brokerage/etc some paperwork, like official copies of my death certificate and our marriage certificate. A copy of our marriage certificate is with this letter! But you‚Äôll have to order my death certificate from the city or county. Order a few of them. You might be surprised how often you have to give someone this document.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start taking action, contact the </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Admin office and report my death. You can do this over the phone (1-800-772-1213) or in person at an office.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have a child, you are eligible for monthly survivor benefits of $2,132 per month starting right now, until the kid is 16! Also, the child gets $2,132 per month. </span><b>So in total, you‚Äôll receive $4,264 per month.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we don‚Äôt have children, you‚Äôll only get survivor benefits when you reach retirement age. ~It‚Äôs like $2,843 per month starting when you‚Äôre 67.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, (this is optional, totally up to you) </span><b>withdraw $20k &#8211; $50k in cash</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from our taxable brokerage account (TD). You will need to sell some stock to do this &#8212; just call the TD Ameritrade number and they will walk you through it. Transfer this cash into our checking account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this cash to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cover funeral costs (Don‚Äôt do anything fancy &#8211; just throw a massive party and invite all our friends! Maybe fly my fam out from Australia?)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take time off work, as much as you need. 6 months, 1 year, or longer, it‚Äôs up to you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This cash will cover living expenses (auto-pays the credit cards)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please don‚Äôt feel bad for taking time off work and spending our money. Spending $50k only puts a tiny dent in our overall net worth and won‚Äôt majorly derail any of your early retirement plans.</span></p>
<h2><b>Things to Do Within 1 &#8211; 3 Months</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log into our Mint.com account, and you‚Äôll see a list of all our assets, accounts, credit cards, etc. These are also all listed in our Net Worth spreadsheet. Here is what to do with each of them:</span></p>
<p><b>Checking Accounts: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you are listed as the primary beneficiary on all my accounts (100%), you don‚Äôt need to go through the probate process. Just call the bank directly and change them into your name. For any old account with a $0 balance, just close the account completely. You probably only need 1 main checking account going forward.</span></p>
<p><b>Credit Cards: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry we have so many, you really only need 1 going forward! Contact all of the banks and credit card companies and cancel the cards in my name with a $0 balance. These are old and no longer needed. You just need 1 main CC going forward ‚Üí whatever one you decide, just make sure bills are auto-paid from the main checking account each month.</span></p>
<p><b>Investment Accounts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Again, for the ones in my name, you are listed as the primary beneficiary (100%). You can deal with the banks/brokers directly to change the names without going through probate.</span></p>
<p><b>Joint brokerage:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Change this into your sole name. Should be easy-peasy.</span></p>
<p><b>My IRA:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They will convert this into an ‚Äúinherited IRA.‚Äù Don‚Äôt touch this account, just let it grow until the year 2045. (That‚Äôs when I would have turned 60). There will be about ~$1M in this account by then. You‚Äôll be taxed when you withdraw this later in life, so do it in small amounts annually as needed.</span></p>
<p><b>Roth:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As my spouse (and listed primary beneficiary) you can just change this account into your name, and it will be treated as if it was yours all along! (Ideally, try to consolidate my Roth with your existing Roth!) This is called a ‚Äú</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/roth-ira-beneficiary-rules-4770500"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spousal Transfer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù. Remember, Roths grow tax-free so leave the assets in this account alone as long as possible.</span></p>
<p><b>HSA: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same as the Roth ‚Üí do a ‚ÄúSpousal Transfer‚Äù and this now becomes your HSA account. Let it grow tax free as long as you can for future medical costs.</span></p>
<p><b>Gift accounts for nephews:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This money technically isn‚Äôt ours, it‚Äôs owned by our nephews. But since they are still minors, an adult custodian must be assigned (me currently). My advice would be to change the custodian to the kids‚Äô parents ‚Üí get the management off your plate.</span></p>
<p><b>Physical Rentals:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Contact xxxx at xxxx management company and she‚Äôll help you transfer the titles into your name. Since we have joint ownership, when I die, the ownership should revert to you as the sole survivor.</span></p>
<p><b>Syndications:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The full list of contacts is *here.* Notify everyone and ask them how to change the ownership into your name. The private partnership agreements make this pretty easy and your name is listed on most of the shares anyway.</span></p>
<h2><b>Things to Do Within 3 Months &#8211; 1 Year</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set an appointment with our tax guy, xxxxxx. Tell him everything that‚Äôs going on, the changes you‚Äôre making with our assets and ask him what forms to save and collect. He‚Äôll help file your taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">List and sell all the physical rental properties. Xxxxx will help you do this! Put all the sale proceeds into our TD brokerage account. Invest everything in VTI, just like all the other money in there. (This is optional, of course. But I think you‚Äôll be much better off owning no physical real estate.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out the DMV process to put the Prius in your name. Here‚Äôs a list of </span><a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/new-registration/special-circumstances/handling-a-deceased-persons-dmv-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forms and paperwork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you might need for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact my retirement broker in Australia. I have about $30k down there in a retirement account and you are the non-contingent beneficiary. I believe you are able to ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù these funds as a lump sum, being that you are not an Australian citizen. My parents can help you research and figure out that crap. If you‚Äôre able to get the funds out, move the money to the U.S., stick it in your brokerage and buy VTI.</span></p>
<h2><b>Things to Do Between Years 1 &#8211; 5</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve got some good news and bad news‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news is, we are not financially independent yet. So you‚Äôll have to continue working at some point, and growing our (your) retirement nest egg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is, you have a 1M+ net worth, which gives you considerable momentum! If you can cover your basic living expenses and leave all the investment accounts untouched, you will probably retire before your 45th birthday! We‚Äôve been on this train for a while already &#8212; </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/coast-financial-independence-building-wealth-even-if-youre-not-saving-any-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast FI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> baby!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some things to help you out‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a year to figure out your *new* approximate annual spending (without me in the picture). Continue to use Mint.com to track expenses and spending trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep using our budget template in *google docs* to make sure you‚Äôre on track each year.</span></p>
<p><b>If you overspend </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">a little within a year, no problem! It will just take you a tiny bit longer to reach FI. A $10-15k variance isn‚Äôt a huge deal at this point. Don‚Äôt stress.</span></p>
<p><b>If you underspend</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a little within a year, that‚Äôs great, too! Keep putting all excess savings into the brokerage account and buying VTI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track your net worth every few months to make sure things are trending upward. If the market crashes or has dips, don‚Äôt freak out. Just leave everything untouched and let it rebound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your net worth reaches 25 &#8211; 30x your annual spending, you‚Äôve reached FI and can do whatever you want for the rest of your life!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know most of this already, but I wanted to write it down anyway. It really is this simple, and you can do it.</span></p>
<h2><b>My Wishes for the Rest of Your Life</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get to design your own life after I die. So don‚Äôt feel compelled to follow any of the plans or advice that I give.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, I hope you find and pursue work that you truly enjoy and are passionate about. I know teaching is an underappreciated and underpaid profession, but you have a gift and I encourage you to continue sharing that with the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you spend and enjoy all of our money. Please don‚Äôt feel bad about treating yourself, living comfortably, and giving as much as you can to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love you so much,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PS: If and when you are ready to start dating again, there‚Äôs a dating app &#8212; </span><a href="https://firedating.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FireDating.Me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; where you might be able to find another personal finance nerd to date! Just don‚Äôt get remarried before you turn 60, or else you‚Äôll forfeit my Social Security survivor benefits! (Actually, never mind, you‚Äôll be FI long before then anyway and won‚Äôt need that money.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there you have it. That‚Äôs my starting point and I‚Äôll build from here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôm off to go cry my eyes out and hug my wifey for 100 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheers!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recently came across an old quiz from a post called </span><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/202646/money-questions-to-ask-your-romantic-partner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 Money Questions to Ask Your Significant Other</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These 20 questions are designed to bring couples financially closer together by understanding each other‚Äôs past, present, and future thoughts around money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not just for new couples. Even though my wife and I have been together for 10+ years, we went through these questions recently and found some new and fun things about each other! Having the same financial mindset is important to us because </span><b>we can achieve our goals faster as a team vs individually.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you‚Äôre up for the challenge, grab a bottle of wine one night this week and hit up your significant other with these questions.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(And just for fun, I‚Äôve included my wife‚Äôs answers. Gives you more insight into my </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> better half, plus you‚Äôve heard enough of my crap recently. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">******</span></p>
<h2><strong>1. What‚Äôs your first money memory?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the store one day when I was little I remember my older sister was asking mom to buy her new clothes. I was extremely nervous about my parents spending money, because growing up I believed that my family and I were on the verge of being homeless. (We weren‚Äôt at all!) I‚Äôm not sure if this was a cultural thing with my mom always penny pinching or just some weird kid stress.</span></p>
<h2><strong>2. Did you know how much your parents earned when you were a child?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, I thought that we were on the brink of homelessness growing up. I think I started to get the real picture in middle school when my dad brought home a big-screen TV one day. I rarely got new clothes or toys as kid, I always had hand-me-downs from my sister. So the fact that my dad could buy a brand new large TV had me thinking that we were doing better than just OK. I never knew my parents‚Äô salary and was taught it was rude to ask people.</span></p>
<h2><strong>3. Did your family have a budget? How did you feel about it?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, my family never had a budget. My mom just never spent any ‚Äúcareless‚Äù money. Any money that we did spend was seriously scrutinized. If I did want something like a toy or fancy outfit, my parents would tell me to ask for it for my birthday or Christmas. Probably about 50% of the time I would get it if it wasn‚Äôt too expensive.</span></p>
<h2><strong>4. Did you get an allowance as a child? What did you do with it?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I never got an allowance. I kind of wish that I had and was taught how to budget out what I needed. Instead I was taught just don‚Äôt spend any money &#8212; ever. And when you do ‚Ä¶ feel guilty. But, I was very fortunate. For example if I wanted to go to the movies as a kid with my friends, my parents would give me just enough to buy the ticket and I would be expected to give them back exact change.</span></p>
<h2><strong>5. Did your parents fight about money?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely, my dad would want to spend a lot of money on random things like toys, boats, cars etc. and my mom would be against all of it; she didn‚Äôt want any luxurious items.</span></p>
<h2><strong>6. What money habits did your parents practice? How did you feel about those habits?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic money habits of my parents was mom saving all the money and dad spending all the money. Seemed normal to me‚Ä¶ I guess I felt fine about it. Seems like a waste of energy now that I‚Äôm older, like wouldn‚Äôt it be easier just to get on the same page and not fight?</span></p>
<h2><strong>7. What drives your financial decisions?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our budget. All our wants and needs are budgeted for. And our lifestyle. ‚ÄúOur‚Äù as in my husband and I. We are fortunate enough to make decisions based on what we want in our life, not just what we need.¬†</span></p>
<h2><strong>8. If you won $1 million today, what would you do with the money?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably put whatever we need towards reaching our FI number early then give the rest of it toward clearing our families‚Äô mortgages and helping other people (family/friends/community) get to their FI-number faster.</span></p>
<h2><strong>9. What‚Äôs one money habit that you admire about me? (i.e. your significant other)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You taught me about investing. Before you, I was just a money saver‚Ä¶ I would‚Äôve been working for my entire life if I didn‚Äôt start investing.</span></p>
<h2><strong>10. If I (your significant other) lost $100 on something and didn‚Äôt tell you, would you be upset with me? How about $1,000?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes of course I‚Äôd be upset. We have a very open communication relationship so the fact that you wouldn‚Äôt tell me is the most hurtful. It doesn‚Äôt matter the money amount.</span></p>
<h2><strong>11. What scares you about money?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock market scares me. Mainly because it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs not tangible. I know it‚Äôs there, I know it‚Äôs growing, but I can‚Äôt physically see it. No matter how much my mind understands how it works, I always have a little bit of anxiety about is that money real? Where is it right now?</span></p>
<h2><strong>12. What do you wish you knew more about?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to learn more about budgeting with children. That is a very personal area though, and most of my friends that I‚Äôve asked have completely different views on how much children cost. For example, one of my friends said that it costs $40,000 a year to raise her child. Another of my friends (who lives on the same street) is raising three children on a teacher salary! Obviously people do it differently depending on their priorities and resources.</span></p>
<h2><strong>13. What would it take for you to feel happy about money?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do feel happy about money already. It‚Äôs the tool that is making my way of life doable.</span></p>
<h2><strong>14. What does having money mean to you?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having money means work/life balance. Working in a field of my choice, not for income.</span></p>
<h2><strong>15. What are you comfortable telling about your money? Any debts that are important to know?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was extremely spoiled growing up. I had college paid for and family that supported whatever field I wanted to go into. No debt :)</span></p>
<h2><strong>16. What are you working towards? What dreams do you have (1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years)?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I consider my job now as part-time. I absolutely love this work load. I enjoy my work days, I also enjoy my days off. If I continue to like this, I will keep going for probably the next five years. After that, who knows? We might be FI by then. Possibly go back to school, possibly stay at the job I have. Or go travel! My 5 &#8211; 10 year dreams change consistently, I have a long bucket list.</span></p>
<h2><strong>17. What do you want to leave behind (for kids or others)?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to have free education. Also, if we have kids I want them to have some travel experiences while we are a young family. Leaving money behind for them isn‚Äôt as important as teaching them life skills.</span></p>
<h2><strong>18. Do you expect to get any inheritance from your family?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely. But I‚Äôd really rather them spend it all.¬†</span></p>
<h2><strong>19. What would you want to happen to your money if you died?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôd like to donate most of it.</span></p>
<h2><strong>20. Do you expect to support your parents or other loved ones in the future?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. But most likely not financially. I expect to have my parents live with me at some point.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">******</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welp, there you have it. My wife is spoiled yet frugal, both a happy worker and freedom-focused, who wants to travel more and invite my in-laws to live with us one day. Lucky me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would love to hear some of your responses if you care to share ‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it a great day,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about personal finance &#8230; But, it does involve finding hidden treasure! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f48e.png" alt="üíé" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f451.png" alt="üëë" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f48d.png" alt="üíç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />!! And it could also be a cheap-ish adventure of a lifetime that you can plan for your kids! (Or in my case &#8212; future kids!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story starts about 30 years ago, back when my friend was ~10 years old‚Ä¶</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Backstory &#8230;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend‚Äôs Dad came home from work one day and said there was a rumor floating around town: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThere might be some old hidden treasure buried in this area from pirates way back in the day.‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was in rural Montana, so the idea of buried treasure isn‚Äôt that far-fetched. People find old weird stuff in the woods all the time up there. Plus, kids are excited to believe any fun story &#8212; especially if it involves pirates and treasure! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3f4.png" alt="üè¥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#x200d; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2620.png" alt="‚ò†" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, the Dad came back from the pub and said there was an old man there who had his tongue cut out! Apparently his tongue had been removed because he knew the location of the secret treasure, and the pirates didn‚Äôt want him running his mouth. My friend‚Äôs Dad warned his sons not to tell any of their school friends about the treasure, or their lives might be in danger, too‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few more days passed and the Dad laid on the story even thicker ‚Ä¶ He said he might have discovered the general location of the treasure! And that maybe he and the boys should go camping that weekend and search the area for any clues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend came and they went camping at a remote lake in the middle of nowhere. They brought flashlights, shovels, a compass ‚Ä¶ You know, all the tools they had seen people use in the movies when treasure hunting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After setting up camp and looking around, one of the boys found a large rock with some strange markings. The Dad told the kids to start digging, and lo and behold, there was a map hidden in the ground! (Actually, it was one-third of a treasure map, with clues to the other missing pieces.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took the entire weekend for the kids to decipher the clues, find the various map pieces, and finally locate and dig up the treasure. The treasure itself was a bunch of foreign coins, old jewelry, and other antique trinkets that you could imagine would be inside an old treasure chest.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was one of the most memorable weekends of my friend‚Äôs life. And the Dad never told the kids he had set the whole thing up. I think at some point in high school my friend figured out it was all rigged &#8212; but he didn‚Äôt care. It was still one of the best memories from his childhood.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Burying Treasure for Our Future Kids</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when my friend first told me this story, we started joking about doing something similar one day for our kids. We weren‚Äôt even married yet, but we always dreamed of giving our kids the same fun childhoods we had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then one of us came up with the idea to bury treasure *now,* even though we didn‚Äôt have kids yet. Also, since we had many years to plan, maybe we could set up a *global* treasure hunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little while later (this was back in early 2014), my wife and I got engaged and planned a trip down to Australia to visit my family. We invited a handful of friends to join us and thought this would be the perfect time to find a remote location, bury some treasure, and maybe return one day with our kids.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Treasure We Buried</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were about 8 of us, and we all chipped in various items. Coins, fool‚Äôs gold, gemstones and silver jewelry. Some of our parents threw in stuff like old rings, bracelets, watches &#8230; I specifically remember my Mum adding a special ring that her Grandma passed down. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth much, but kind of cool knowing that it&#8217;s there (and that maybe MY kid will dig it up one day).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a photo from the night before we buried the box. We were swapping stories, memories, and making sure all the items inside looked ‚Äúcool‚Äù for kids to find.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64174 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/IMG_1321-scaled-e1629426863736.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The box itself wasn‚Äôt too big. Maybe the size of a small shoe box. From memory, we wrapped it up in a garbage bag so the elements wouldn‚Äôt eat and rot the wood. Here‚Äôs a peek inside&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64173 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/IMG_1322-scaled-e1629426874764.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<h2><strong>Where We Buried the Treasure</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so fast! You didn‚Äôt think I was going to reveal the exact location of the treasure, did you? If I were to tell anyone, I think my friends would have my tongue cut out. :)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I can tell you is this: It is buried somewhere inside the state of South Australia. (Map below if you don‚Äôt know where that is.) We went hiking deep inside a nature reserve and buried the treasure off-trail, in the middle of nowhere.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64175 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Screen-Shot-2021-08-12-at-12.04.07-PM-e1629426853946.png" alt="" width="600" height="402" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, maybe it‚Äôs a little too well hidden. My friends and I joke about not being able to find it with the crappy notes and vague maps we have. I think one of us was smart enough to snap the GPS coordinates with our iPhone, but don‚Äôt know how accurate they are. There‚Äôs only one way to find out &#8212; to take the trip again with our kids one day.</span></p>
<h2><strong>So ‚Ä¶ When Are We Going to Dig It Up?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend has 2 kids, and the oldest one is 5. Our nephews are about that age too, so I think we‚Äôre about 5 years away from planning a big family trip to dig it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I still don‚Äôt have kids yet. We got introduced to our foster/adopt social worker this month and are in the matching process. We‚Äôre requesting kids in the 2-6 age range, so if this ends up happening, all our kids will be about the same age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, it looks like 2026 or so is when we‚Äôll head back down &#8212; when the older kids are 10ish. Until then, we are still coming up with a narrative for our treasure story to tell the kids. Also, we are thinking of burying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treasure &#8212; on another continent maybe &#8212; and making this truly a worldwide hunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty cool, hey?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have any of you done something like this? Time capsules or adventures you had growing up that you plan to relive with your kids?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a great weekend,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, Joel</span></p>

I won a free cruise!¬† All we need to do is take a phone survey and we get to go on a free cruise!‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bless my wife. She‚Äôs gullible. It‚Äôs one of her many adorable qualities (and also probably the reason she married a fool like me.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hated to burst her bubble, but I said something like ‚Ä¶</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a free cruise, babe. When something sounds too good to be true like that, it‚Äôs usually a scam. If you want to go on a cruise, we can just buy one.‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was heartbroken. She didn‚Äôt want to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a cruise, </span><b>she wanted a FREE one!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a couple of weeks passed, my wife ran to me again. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe free cruise people keep calling me! Are you sure it‚Äôs not a scam? I‚Äôve been ‚Äòespecially selected.‚Äô We could go to Mexico or the Caribbean!‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, I had to be the bearer of bad news: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a free cruise! I promise, it‚Äôs a scam.‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I recall, we went back and forth like this for a few months. She kept getting calls, I had to convince her they were fake, she‚Äôd get excited, then disappointed again, etc. Our frustrations continued to grow. I was mostly frustrated at the Do Not Call Registry because we somehow kept getting spam calls even though our numbers are private. My wife was mostly frustrated at ME, for being a big meanie and not letting her go on her free cruise.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fast forward 5 years‚Ä¶ It was now some time in 2017‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We received a random letter in the mail one day. It was from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúBirchmeier et al v. Caribbean Cruise Line Inc.‚Äù</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬† It took me a while to decipher the legal jargon, but it turned out the free cruise calls were definitely a scam. A pretty big scam! The marketing group was really just trying to sell time-share packages. They violated some privacy laws, and now they were being sued by a bunch of pissed off people who wanted free cruises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ran over to my wife. ‚Äú</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Babe! We‚Äôre part of a class action lawsuit. We‚Äôre gonna join in and sue those bastards who were trying to scam us years ago.‚Äù</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was pretty excited. Mostly because after 5 years, I was holding written proof that I was right: </span><b>There is no such thing as a free cruise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife got excited, too. She asked, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIf we win the lawsuit, does this mean they‚Äôll give everyone the free cruise?‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, I had to burst her bubble again. I explained that most class action lawsuits result in everyone receiving about $12.50 in compensation, and they take years &#8211; sometimes decades &#8211; to reach a settlement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, our excitement turned to frustration. I was frustrated with the lengthy claims process, which required us to dig up phone records from 5 years earlier. My wife was still mostly just frustrated at ME, for still being that asshole husband who never takes her on free cruises.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fast forward another 2 years‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs now the middle of 2019‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had almost forgotten about the whole free cruise saga. Then another letter arrived in the mail. This one had 2 big surprises inside‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-64099 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/200-check-scaled-e1625190493752.jpg" alt="free cruise lawsuit" width="600" height="313" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first surprise was a cashier&#8217;s check for $200! No questions asked, no forms to fill. Woohoo!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second surprise was the letter. It read: ‚Äú</span><b>This is your first of two installments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At a later date, you will receive your final installment.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was awesome news! Not only was $200 WAY more than we were ever expecting, but we were also told to expect more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was over the moon! But my wife was still a little sad &#8230; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWhat about the free cruise?&#8230; They promised me a free cruise!!!‚Äù</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Another 2 years went by‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs now mid-2021‚Ä¶</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just received the final letter in the mail. It‚Äôs been almost a decade since this all started, and now our payday has finally arrived&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs what I received&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-64100 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/575-check-scaled-e1644355162890.jpg" alt="free cruise scam settlement" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/575-check-scaled-e1644355162890.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/575-check-scaled-e1644355162890-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BOOM! Our final installment check is $575. Wow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 + $575 = </span><b>$775 total.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not bad at all! I guess sometimes these class action lawsuits really do work out well. Thank you, Caribbean Cruise Lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm pretty happy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Ä¶ but not as happy as my wife is going to be‚Ä¶</span></p>
<h2><strong>Maybe we can take a ‚Äúfree‚Äù cruise now?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I may not be the smartest husband in the world, but I‚Äôm not a complete dumbass. If there‚Äôs one thing my wife wants more than anything out of this lawsuit, it‚Äôs a free cruise. She doesn‚Äôt care about money, revenge, corporations paying fines ‚Ä¶ she just wants a free cruise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before telling my wife about the final check, I went on the Carnival Cruise website to look at some deals. Here‚Äôs what I found‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-64101 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/Cruise-snap-e1625190513404.png" alt="" width="600" height="477" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Mexican Riviera package will give us 5 days cruising from Los Angeles down to Cabo for $300 per person. Which with about $150 in fees and taxes, will equal about ~$750 total. Almost the exact same as the total settlement amount we received.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finding this, I quickly ran to my wife. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúBabe! We just got our final letter from the Free Cruise settlement! Guess what they‚Äôre giving us?‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúA free cruise?‚Äù</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she said sheepishly, fully expecting another let down ‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúYeah, babe. We got a 5-day cruise. Me and you, in Mexico. </span></i><b><i>You won us a free cruise.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, the story above is 100% true.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today I thought we could play a little game called</span><b> ‚ÄúHow do your finances compare to the average American‚Äôs?‚Äù</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below I‚Äôve gathered 10 money statistics about the average U.S. household‚Äôs finances. And while this data has no </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effect on your personal situation or trajectory, it‚Äôs still fun to see how you stack up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve also showed my own comps. Feel free to play along and drop any fun results in the comment section. Remember, it‚Äôs just a game. Don‚Äôt get too wrapped up in the numbers &#8212; everyone‚Äôs situation is different!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs get to it ‚Ä¶</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Average American Financial Profile: How Do You Compare?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of this data is pretty recent, but because 2020 was such a strange year, some data points are a few years old. There are also a ton of variables that we could pick apart in this data, but for now let‚Äôs just play along and take the figures at face value.</span></p>
<h2><strong>1. The average gross household income is $87,864</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I‚Äôm not off to a great start‚Ä¶ My wife and I are already </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>below average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this category. Our household income for 2021 will probably be between $70 &#8211; $75k, not including investment growth or rental income. Oh well, we‚Äôre committed to </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/slow-down-fire-is-not-a-race/#:~:text=Coast%20financial%20independence%3A%20What%20is,contribute%20to%20your%20retirement%20accounts."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast FI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so our income is intentionally low!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, we do earn more than the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">median</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> income in this study, which is ~$62k. You can check out all the study data here with categories and breakdowns: </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-us-income/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average U.S. Income</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)¬†</span></p>
<h2><strong>2. The average balance in a 401(k) is $106,478</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woohoo! I‚Äôm certainly </span><span style="color: #008000;"><b>above average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this category. Just checked my IRA balance (Don‚Äôt have a 401(k) from my employer any more) and it‚Äôs sitting at $175,684.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statistic comes from Vanguard‚Äôs 2020 </span><a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/ngiam/assets/pdf/has/how-america-saves-report-2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How America Saves Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here‚Äôs also a screenshot of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">average</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">median</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by age breakdown‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63918 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/1-Average-401k-balance-e1620618698729.png" alt="" width="600" height="403" /></p>
<h2><strong>3. The average American *retirement savings* is $407,490</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like this study a bit better than the last. It‚Äôs from Personal Capital, which as you guys know has a more complete overview of people‚Äôs entire net worth &#8212; not just their 401(k) balances. This data is as of April 3, so it‚Äôs hot off the press!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study also breaks down </span><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/retirement-savings-by-state/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average retirement savings by state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as age groups which are pasted below.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63917 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/2.-Average-American-Retirement-Savings-e1620618707994.png" alt="" width="600" height="378" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my wife and I, we rank </span><span style="color: #008000;"><b>above average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this category for our state, age group, and the general averages. We are on track to early retirement!</span></p>
<h2><strong>4. The average checking account balance is $10,618</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this writing, my wife and I have a little over $24,000 across our checking accounts. So we‚Äôll claim </span><span style="color: #008000;"><b>above average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this statistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-checking-account-balance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full report here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it also shows that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">median</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> checking account balance is only $2,000. Which means 50% of Americans have less than $2k in their checking accounts.</span></p>
<h2><strong>5. The average American spends $5,102 per month</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs a peek inside the </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-monthly-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average monthly expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans. The total is a little more than $61,000 each year. Keep in mind this is the </span><b>average</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and there‚Äôs a pretty huge difference between high/low cost of living areas, kids or no kids, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As frugal as my wife and I are, living in LA puts us in the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>above average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expenses group. At least for this year and next! Most of our income will go to rent and travel.</span></p>
<h2><strong>6. The average FICO credit score is 711</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some good news&#8230; The data shows that the national average credit score has increased every year over the past decade! If you want to see how you compare by the state you live in, </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-credit-score/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all the data is here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I regularly check my credit score with the Mint app. Right now I‚Äôm sitting on an 814, well </span><span style="color: #008000;"><b>above average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><strong>7. The average American has $6,194 in credit card debt</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like this statistic can be interpreted many ways. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/credit-card-debt-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the full report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that most people (52%) have a balance of less than $2,500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my wife and I, we keep a rolling credit card debt of about $2-3k, and our accounts are paid off in full every month. I‚Äôm gonna give us a </span><span style="color: #008000;"><b>below average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rating on this credit card debt category.</span></p>
<h2><strong>8. The average U.S. *total household* debt is $145,000</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-american-household-debt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">total household debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statistic covers a broad range of debts like auto loans, home mortgages, rental property loans, student loans, etc. So I guess the argument of ‚Äúgood debt‚Äù vs. ‚Äúbad debt‚Äù is open to interpretation here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since my wife and I currently have 9 real estate investments, all of which are leveraged with mortgages and loans, it‚Äôs safe to say we have </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>above average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> household debt compared with others. Except mortgages, we have no other loans or consumer debt. :)</span></p>
<h2><strong>9. The average U.S. savings rate is 13.7%</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a 2020 statistic, which could be an anomaly because a bunch of households cut down their spending last year in quarantine. The 2019 savings rate was just 7.6%. </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/246234/personal-savings-rate-in-the-united-states/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See all yearly data here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I are definitely </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>below average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this category. But, as I mentioned before, we are </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/coast-financial-independence-building-wealth-even-if-youre-not-saving-any-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coasting to early retirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as our existing assets are compounding quicker than we can save excess money ourselves.</span></p>
<h2><strong>10. The average Social Security retirement benefit is $1,514 per month</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security benefits are very modest. For a medium earner retiring at age 65, it‚Äôs predicted that Social Security income will replace only about 35% of their prior working income. Daaaang! A good reminder to take retirement into your own hands and build up your personal nest egg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I don‚Äôt include Social Security income in my retirement projections. I‚Äôm still 30+ years away from any benefits, and a lot can change in 30 years. I just logged into my </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it shows I‚Äôm on track for a $1,742 monthly payment. So I‚Äôll put myself as </span><span style="color: #008000;"><b>above average</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this data point, even though it‚Äôs kind of moot for me right now.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-63916 aligncenter" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/3.-Joel-Social-Security-Benefit-Age-67-e1620618716373.png" alt="" width="600" height="302" /></p>
<h2><strong>So there you have it!</strong></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do your finances stack up? Do you feel OK with your situation compared with to your fellow Americans? (Sorry to the international readers out there!)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My results are all over the place, in both good and bad ways. I have low income, high spending, larger than normal investments, a weird debt profile, etc. In general I feel good, but there are definitely some items I can improve on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, lastly, a quick note about comparisons&#8230; Usually </span><b>I don‚Äôt recommend comparing yourself to others</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; it can lead to unhappiness. So, keep the following in mind when you play games like this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just a game. Average stats don‚Äôt determine your personal success.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are </span><b>above average</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in something, take a second to count your blessings and practice appreciation.¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are </span><b>below average</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in something, use it as motivation to progress and get better. That‚Äôs what this blog is all about &#8212; helping improve your situation (and having fun along the way). Let me know if you need help in any specific area.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a great week,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Joel</span></p>
