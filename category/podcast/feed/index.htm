Who‚Äôs looking forward to an awesome weekend!? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64b-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64b-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today I‚Äôm gonna share something a little embarrassing‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the final report card from my graduating year at high school. Check this out:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-63316 size-full" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/yr-12-report-card-1-e1600370127370.jpeg" alt="A bad Math report card doesn't mean no early financial independence" width="600" height="454" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, Math was my worst subject. 29 out of 100&#8230; I‚Äôve never scored lower than 29% on anything in my entire life! This class was the rock bottom of my formal education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, before you label me a complete idiot, you should know a few things about Australian high school vs. American high school:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia has wicked high standards for curriculum. For example, this high school Math class ‚Äú1S PES‚Äù included Applied Calculus &#8211; stuff most Americans usually don‚Äôt get taught until later in college. No wonder I sucked at it, I was only 17!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.ozstudies.com/blog/study-australia/complete-guide-to-the-australian-grading-system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grading system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is wacky down under. For example, I received the highest Art Design score in the whole school (and still only got 87%). In the US, many schools give the highest person 100%, then </span><a href="https://tophat.com/glossary/g/grading-on-a-curve/#:~:text=Grading%20on%20a%20curve%20refers,grade%20average%20for%20a%20given"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grade the entire class based on a curve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the USA you must pass every class to graduate from high school. For AUS they go based on weighted averages. You can suck really bad in 1 subject and make it up by overachieving in others. This is how I passed high school.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, no matter which way you look at it, I was labelled ‚Äúbad at Math.‚Äù All my teachers, my peers, and my grades told me that I would never be a numbers expert. I received merits in every other subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report card is from 18 years ago. Today, I have a job writing about finances, of which some stuff has a heavy math focus. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can a guy who barely scraped through high school get a job writing about numbers? How can a guy like that become financially independent and be able retire early in life?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few things I‚Äôve realized about math and personal finance. I hope these insights encourage others who may have been (or currently are) a similar type of student as me.</span></p>
<h2><b>1. You don‚Äôt have to be good at math to be good with money</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people think becoming a millionaire is complicated and you have to have advanced knowledge in investing, economics and complex math. This simply isn‚Äôt true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kicking ass in personal finance is a simple and repeatable process, no matter your level of education. It‚Äôs based on proven principles and habits‚Ä¶</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work as hard and smart as you can</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earn as much money as you can</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spend less than you earn</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save and invest the difference</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat this for many years</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After high school I jumped straight into the workforce while my ‚Äòsmart‚Äô friends went to college. I always felt bad about this, like they were getting smarter and smarter, and I had given up on education. I hate to admit it, but I let my high school report card define who I was for a long time. Big mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then somewhere around my late 20‚Äôs, I looked around and realized I had more money than most other people my age. I realized that my growing wealth wasn‚Äôt because of my academics, or lack thereof‚Ä¶ It was due to my </span><b>subtle daily habits and following the basic money principles.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can be the smartest math genius in the world and still be flat broke later in life. And you can be a high school dropout and become financially independent in your 30s. Don‚Äôt ever let bad math grades convince you that you‚Äôre bad at money or will never be wealthy! If you‚Äôre not convinced, just read </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/book-review-millionaire-next-door/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Millionaire Next Door</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and learn what most true wealthy people are like. :)</span></p>
<h2><b>2. Formal education vs. self education</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School while you‚Äôre young is important. Your mind is a sponge, you have unlimited spare time, and education is packaged nicely into 1 hour classroom learning sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning as an adult is much harder. And inconvenient! It requires self motivation, discipline, and time to acquire knowledge. Many young kids think that when college is over, the learning stops. This isn‚Äôt the case at all!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I‚Äôm better at math today and can comprehend finance stuff is because I slowly built up knowledge over time. Books, podcasts, blogs, independent courses and asking good questions all contributed to my education. And, I‚Äôve still got a loooong way to go!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I could go back in time and give advice to my high school self, it would be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because you‚Äôre not great at something today, it doesn‚Äôt mean you will never be good at it. Learning never stops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you didn‚Äôt learn something in school, or </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/6-ways-my-parents-taught-me-financial-independence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from your parents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at home, that‚Äôs OK. There are a ton of places you can pick up knowledge and learn as an adult.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In school, a report card tells you how well you&#8217;re doing. In personal finance, your <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/what-is-net-worth-plus-how-to-calculate-yours/">net worth </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is your report card. It is the </span><b>single best tool</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tells you if you&#8217;re on the right track, or need to study harder! Your school report card goes away in your 20‚Äôs. Your <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth/">net worth report card never goes away</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>3. There‚Äôs a calculator for that!</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My grandpa once sat me down and said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúJoel, if you ever don‚Äôt know how to do something in life, that‚Äôs OK. Because there‚Äôs someone else out there who knows how to do it &#8211; and you can always hire them to do it for you.‚Äù¬†</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a kid I was self-conscious about my education (still am a bit I guess). But Grandpa helped me realize that it‚Äôs OK not knowing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As long as I know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">where</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find the information when I need it, I‚Äôll be fine.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don‚Äôt know how mortgages work?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That‚Äôs what mortgage brokers are for! They do it all day, every day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not good at spreadsheets or calculating formulas?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are a TON of </span><a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/free-budget-templates-sites/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online where people have created stuff and simplified it down for beginners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can‚Äôt calculate your effective tax rate based on your AGI or determine how much capital gains harvesting is best for your 2020 filing?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don‚Äôt stress! There are calculators to help you with all that stuff. CPAs, tax professionals, and random enthusiasts can point you in the right direction. It‚Äôs OK that you don‚Äôt know.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving up on improving your finances because ‚Äúmath is too confusing‚Äù is like slashing your other 3 tires because you have 1 flat. Just call in an expert for help and get back on the road :)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have an awesome weekend, all! Stay safe out there!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Joel</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/good-vs-bad-reasons-to-quit-something/" title="Good Reasons to Quit Something vs Bad Reasons to Quit Something (And Why I&#8217;m Retiring from Podcasting)" rel="nofollow"><img width="600" height="267" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-tear.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="money tear" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-tear.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-tear-300x134.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p>Oh man, this is a hard one for me to write today&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know exactly how to do it, so let me just come out and say it:</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m quitting our <a href="http://themoneyshow.co" target="_blank">M.O.N.E.Y.</a> podcast :(</strong></p>
<p>(Or as I like to put it &#8211; &#8220;retiring&#8221; from the podcast :))</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this which we&#8217;ll get to in a moment, but first I wanna say two quick things:</p>
<p><strong>#1. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to everyone who listens to it!!!!</strong></p>
<p>I cannot express the love and gratitude I have for y&#8217;all &#8211; many of whom I don&#8217;t even know and who came from <a href="http://affordanything.com/" target="_blank">Paula&#8217;s tribe</a>, but I can&#8217;t thank you enough and just want you to know that I&#8217;m beyond appreciative for all the support and encouragement since our launch. It&#8217;s one thing to stop a project that&#8217;s failed miserably, but a whole other when things are going strong and everyone&#8217;s so encouraging. So please &#8211; know that deep down I love and appreciate every¬† one of you who have supported us this year, and know that it&#8217;s been a helluva awesome experience!</p>
<p><strong>#2. The show will go on &#8211; so don&#8217;t go anywhere :)</strong></p>
<p>Paula is VERY much still as excited &#8211; if not more so &#8211; to continue on with the show (after all &#8211; one less entrepreneur in the mix means more control and freedom, haha&#8230;) and she plans to continue running it as-is, just minus one bumbling cohort trying to even out her smarts ;)</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll still be able to find the show at <a href="http://themoneyshow.co" target="_blank">themoneyshow.co</a>, as well as on <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/itunes" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/stitcher" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> and all that good stuff, and it will still be focused on reaching financial independence through entrepreneurship/hustling/ investing/killing off debt, and everything else we&#8217;ve been talking about throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;ve been a fan of the show, PLEASE keep checking it out and give M.O.N.E.Y. 2.0 a shot!</strong> Paula&#8217;s working really hard behind the scenes, and already lined up some great new guests and ideas for it, some of which I was holding her back on. And it won&#8217;t be the last time you hear from me either (quite literally) as I have already promised to come back as a special guest as a condition of me leaving the show ;) Which, btw, she&#8217;s been more than understanding and incredible about &#8211; which says a lot about her as a person and businesswoman. So please &#8211; give it a shot with her as the new captain and hopefully you&#8217;ll still like it just as much!</p>
<h2>Okay&#8230; So why retire now? When everything&#8217;s going well?</h2>
<p>If you have some time, you can listen to our full show on it which we just released today &#8211;&gt; <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/episode-26-last-episode-with-jay/" target="_blank">Jay&#8217;s last show</a> &#8211; but the short answer is that my heart just isn&#8217;t into it anymore :( And I also started getting <em>super</em> anxious and pulled away from projects &#8211; and personal time &#8211; I DO very much care for (like this blog!).</p>
<p>The one thing I told myself going into this was that I had to be <em>really excited</em> and passionate about it as it takes so much time and energy to do (way more than I thought &#8211; wow! I give you podcasters mad cred!), so once that started slipping away I knew I had to do something about it. I LOVE what the show&#8217;s about and the awesome community we&#8217;ve built around it (the best part!), but at the end of the day the cons started outweighing the pros and I eventually had to make sure that *I* was taken care of first :(</p>
<p><strong>In fact, I joked with Paula that it was very much like breaking up with a long-term girlfriend, only one that everyone likes and then hates you for breaking up with her! Haha&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to break up with someone that people hate and talk about behind your back, but a whole other when they thought you two were perfect together and were going to marry ;) So in that regard I kinda wish it <em>would have</em> failed only to make the decision easier, but of course I&#8217;m thrilled that people are enjoying it so much and cannot believe we just crossed <em><strong>200,000 downloads</strong></em> last week!! Crazy! And I&#8217;m gonna miss you so much <a href="http://affordanything.com/about" target="_blank">Paula</a>!!</p>
<p>So, new territory I&#8217;m crossing here for sure, but hopefully one that I made the right decision on and will look back later feeling glad I did so&#8230; Though Paula will have to bring me on once she crosses a MILLION listeners and see just how I feel about it then, haha&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Actually, <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/episode-26-last-episode-with-jay/" target="_blank">we go over it on the show</a>, but one thing that really helps me with decisions like this is trying to envision the <em>*perfect outcome*</em> with a project, and then seeing if I still feel the same way about it afterwards.</strong></p>
<p>For example, if M.O.N.E.Y. <em>did</em> hit millions of listeners and was making tons of money, would I have wished I stayed aboard? And if so, does it mean I should then keep with it and just work on overcoming these issues in order to eventually reach that major goal? Well, of course you know what the answer is to all this or else you wouldn&#8217;t be reading this right now ;), but if it <em>had</em> changed things I would have certainly stuck around and figured out how to make it work. This podcast has always been a passion project of mine over a business one, so when that core fails it&#8217;s hard to overcome&#8230;</p>
<h2>Good Quitting vs Bad Quitting</h2>
<p>Throughout this process of figuring out what the right move was here, I made a list of pros and cons which later turned into &#8220;good reasons&#8221; to quit something and &#8220;bad reasons&#8221; to quit something,&#8221; you know &#8211; since we like to turn all our life&#8217;s events into lessons as bloggers :)</p>
<p>I also thought it may help some of you going through tough decisions as well, since we can easily second guess ourselves and get so stuck in our own heads.</p>
<p>So below are the lists, along with some personal examples of how it affected my decision w/ the M.O.N.E.Y. show here. And again, this is something we get wayyy more into <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/episode-26-last-episode-with-jay/" target="_blank">on my last episode</a> too if you want to feel the emotions behind it which to me makes it the best one yet! Or at least our rawest!</p>
<p>Hope it helps&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>Good reasons to quit/retire:</strong></h3>
<div dir="ltr">
<ol>
<li><strong>Your heart&#8217;s not into it anymore / it no longer excites you</strong> &#8212; While not the #1 factor for everyone, it&#8217;s a substantial one for me as once my interest wanes, so does my work ethic and motivation. It doesn&#8217;t mean I have to enjoy <em>all</em> the parts to it since every gig has their annoying sides, but I DO have to immerse myself fully into it &#8211; whatever it is &#8211; or else it&#8217;ll end up a half-assed project&#8230; And really, who wants a half-assed project?</li>
<li><strong>It doesn&#8217;t line up with your goals anymore</strong> &#8212; For me, &#8220;fun&#8221; was the main point of doing M.O.N.E.Y., but the goals differ depending on the project or job you&#8217;re shooting for. Some are <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2016/04/job-is-means-to-end/" target="_blank">strictly money based</a>, while others are to help advance a career or brand or even merely for prestige. It doesn&#8217;t really matter what they are, just so long as you&#8217;re inching closer to them over time. One of my favorite quotes sums it up perfectly,<br />
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It‚Äôs always better to be at the bottom of a ladder you want to climb, than half way up one you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Your project fails!</strong> &#8212; While having heart and being aligned goal-wise is great, sometimes they just plain fail at the end. And I&#8217;ve had way more do that than the opposite over the years! :) As have most people who put things on the line&#8230; The trick is being able to tell <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2013/09/when-to-quit-side-hustle/" target="_blank">when to call it a day</a> and when to keep pouring in the energy (more on this below in the &#8220;bad reasons&#8221; section).</li>
<li><strong>You found a better/more efficient use of your time</strong> &#8211;¬† Sometimes you can really succeed with one area, but then find another where you could do even better and thus decide to swap your attention to. While I&#8217;m losing great marketing and potential income from the show, I&#8217;m also freeing up a TON of time to better focus on those projects I still do love very much, as well as freeing up some more for myself and my loved ones too. I struggle a lot with the work/life balancing act, so anytime you can give yourself more hours in the day it&#8217;s hard to not call it a win!</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s physically/emotionally harming :(</strong> &#8212; This is probably the hardest one to do something about &#8211; whether you&#8217;re successful at what you&#8217;re doing or not. I can&#8217;t even imagine how grueling some people have it, especially those in toxic environments!, but I do know that we&#8217;ve got to put our bodies and mind first any chance we get. The anxiety the podcast brought me was low on the grand scale of things, but I could easily see it creep higher and higher the bigger the show got. Maybe that&#8217;s an issue with me or a lack of confidence or something, but whatever the reason it was real and it wasn&#8217;t getting better. My heart <em>really</em> goes out to all those stuck in much worse &#8211; and complicated &#8211; positions out there as this stuff is no joke!</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Bad reasons to quit:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Being lazy / don&#8217;t want to do the hard work</strong> &#8211; This is probably the worst reason to quit, and probably one of the most common :) Lord knows it was my falling over the years! I&#8217;ve since learned, fortunately, that nothing worth fighting for comes easy, so gone are the days stopping at the first obstacle that may come its way&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Not letting enough time go by to see whether it&#8217;s going to take off or not</strong> &#8212; This is another biggie that plagues entrepreneurs, or really anyone seeking to accomplish something big. You never know when you can be right around the corner from a breakthrough, or if you&#8217;re setting yourself up for many more years of the same! And while every project/goal/person is different, I typically give myself a &#8220;1 year minimum&#8221; on any project I start just to make sure I see it through enough to tell whether it not only stands a chance, but that I&#8217;m also enjoying it too. The podcast was technically only live for a little under four months, but Paula and I worked on it for 7-8 months before hand which helped me to make the decision that much easier. Since most of what anyone sees &#8211; whether in podcasts or blogs or anything really &#8211; is only the finished product. Tons of time and energy go on behind the scenes leading up to that point, which gives you plenty of time to let it soak in and see if it&#8217;s something worth still pursuing or not. And after almost 12 months of working on it, I sadly realized it was not¬† :(</li>
<li><strong>Wanting to get successful super quick</strong> &#8212; Okay I lied, THIS is probably the main reason most projects/businesses/financial plans fail, haha.. Everyone wants to hurry up and be successful these days! Especially in the online world! And I have the perfect quote for this one too ;)<br />
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The harder you work, the luckier you get.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Moving to a shinier thing just because it&#8217;s shinier</strong> &#8212; This is pretty much a result of following all three areas above: not wanting to put in the time and the hard work, mixed in with trying to hit a home run at your first time at bat. It&#8217;s often hard to tell *which* ideas to follow and which not since you never really know until it&#8217;s put out into the world, but implementing rules such as the &#8220;must work on it for a year&#8221; one, as well as testing them out before jumping &#8220;all in&#8221; can certainly help determine its fate. Another thing that really helps &#8211; for all you business lovers &#8211; is the &#8220;<a href="https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas" target="_blank">lean canvas</a>&#8221; idea. Check it out later if you&#8217;re wondering (or stuck) on what to do about your own future or current product/service.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>And that pretty much sums it up :)</strong></h3>
<p>A bunch of things to think about before quitting a project, and hopefully gives you more insight as to my thoughts on retiring from the podcast as well&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an incredible learning experience over all, and one I&#8217;m always going to be proud of!, but my time has come and now we await the next journey ahead of us&#8230; while making sure to enjoy the nice silence in the mean time :)</p>
<p><strong>And again, I just have to thank you all SO SO MUCH from the bottom of my heart for all the encouragement you&#8217;ve given me!!!</strong></p>
<p>It was hard to put myself out there in launching it (audio is SO much more raw than print), and it&#8217;s been even harder to admit it&#8217;s not working now and to<em> move on from it</em> as well. So thank you so much for all the support &#8211; I can&#8217;t even tell you how much I appreciate it all. Just know that I do! And please continue to support Paula too as <a href="http://themoneyshow.co" target="_blank">the show goes on</a> &#8211; she&#8217;s amazing!</p>
<p>Thank you everyone!! Will see ya back here on Wed. for more of the good financial word&#8230; Hope your projects are going really well and that you have clarity too!</p>
<p>XOXO,</p>

<p><strong>I don&#8217;t even know what to make of it all to be honest with you, but I loved reading every second of this and thought you guys might too.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an email shot over by a listener of our new podcast &#8211; <a href="http://themoneyshow.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M.O.N.E.Y.</a> &#8211; and I find it all kinds of fascinating. Probably because it never ceases to amaze me just how different our lifestyles can be, yet still revolve around the almighty dollar whether we want it to or not! And Melanie here has been experimenting with it quite a bit lately, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>Please to enjoy &#8211; the most interesting email I&#8217;ve ever received!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*************</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Story for J. Money, a man who appreciates working less when it&#8217;s possible &amp; going with your feeling instead of all of the facts.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">*************</p>
<p>J, you talk about having been a workaholic and finally making peace with chilling the f*ck out.</p>
<p>That is ME!!</p>
<p><strong>Some background:</strong> I used to be a youthful anti-money anarchist. That mentality lead me to the notion that I needed to drop out of the money system. My plan to drop out of the system revolved around saving $$ (for the first time) so that my husband &amp; I could live in the woods &#8220;for free&#8221;. &lt; &#8212; my vague youthful thinking.</p>
<p>So when I was 26 (waitress) and my husband was 22 (grocery story worker) I came up with a plan for us. In the end <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk4f7Z7XGq0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saved $24,000 in 18 months</a> at our $hitty jobs. Saving money was a huge eye opener that money isn&#8217;t evil, I&#8217;m still me regardless of what the numbers say. It actually made me LOVE money but I couldn&#8217;t break the mental dogma so we kept with my original plan.</p>
<p>We bought land in another state and lived in a <a href="https://anarchistkitchen.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/ozark-tiny-house-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">150 sqft tiny house</a> with <a href="https://anarchistkitchen.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/no-plumbing-life-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no plumbing</a> for 1 year. During that time I was working at the best restaurant in the tourist town 15 minutes from our land. I was a major workaholic. I kept pushing myself to work more and often worked 50-70 high volume hours a week. I think a major reason why I worked so much was to avoid the new lifestyle that I signed up for.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtfK57ycIGE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video I made</a> of our tiny house right when we first moved into it:</p>
<p><center><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LtfK57ycIGE" width="600" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center></p>
<p>My husband has never been anti money and didn&#8217;t like living without plumbing. So when I completely burned out from overworking I looked at him and said, &#8220;Can we sell the tiny house and land?&#8221; He said YES! In that moment I knew I needed to wipe the slate clean on the anarchist bull$hit I was holding onto and the insane &#8220;clean eating&#8221; standards I&#8217;d been obsessed with for 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>It was pretty much me saying YES to the life I want instead of the life I thought was &#8220;right.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>So I quit my job, we put the tiny house on the market and moved back to Dallas. For the next 18 months we live almost jobless and on less that $10,000 a year. For 18 months we dumpster dived stuff and sold it on ebay (mostly clothes). For 9 months solid we ate trash, dumpstering 99.9% of everything we ate so we wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for food. PLUS it completely chilled me out with distorted identity around being &#8220;vegan&#8221; or &#8220;paleo&#8221; or &#8220;clean eating&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>We had almost no expenses except our cheap apartment and gas $. We had no bed time, no morning alarms, no restrictions, no stress. It was amazing, I&#8217;d never had so little while feeling so free.</strong></p>
<p>When being the dumpster diver became my identity I had to walk away from that too. At this same time I recovered from all of the pinned up stress and was ready to really make some money again. We changed our eBay business overnight and started making a real living wage without having to dumpster dive anymore. We buy stuff now but we&#8217;re making much better $$$.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not really a conclusion to this story. I&#8217;m just writing to say that I feel ya when you talk about re-calibrating <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/money-vs-moral-values-part-2/">your values</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*************</p>
<p><strong>She was right that I appreciate a good story!</strong> And that I&#8217;m all about <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2015/03/answer-financial-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going with your emotions</a> even if they tend to fluctuate over time (which of course they will as we&#8217;re constantly evolving as people).</p>
<p>This is the stuff that <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separates Paula and I</a> a lot on the show &#8211; where she&#8217;s the more analytical/ business type person and I&#8217;m the &#8220;do what feels good&#8221; type of guy. No one right way of doing things, but either can lead you to that ideal lifestyle, and even better if you can balance the two!</p>
<p>So thank you so much for the story, Melanie! Can&#8217;t say I woke up thinking I&#8217;d see that gem in my inbox, haha&#8230; Love the passion, and even more so that you changed it up when you realized it wasn&#8217;t working for you guys anymore. That&#8217;s hard to do &#8211; especially if you&#8217;ve been broadcasting it all over. For anyone wanting to follow Melanie&#8217;s journey, you can catch her on her blog @ <a href="https://anarchistkitchen.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anarchistkitchen.wordpress.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>And for those interested in rocking an eBay biz</strong> as she alluded to, check out our recent episode with Jay and Ryanne where they tell us <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/episode-11-make-money-ebay-airbnb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how they make $100k/year</a> flipping items and renting out their AirBnB on our podcast. Again &#8211; so cool how many different ways there are to make a living!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<strong>PS:</strong> Speaking of our show, thank you guys SO MUCH for all the support over the past two months! We recently crossed over 100,000 downloads and are learning a ton in the process&#8230; Both from our guests on the show, but also the uniquely different medium that is podcasting. Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m used to it yet, but it&#8217;s definitely been interesting :) If you like talking about money as much as you do earning it, might be something to look into yourself! (Or to discuss any topic, for that matter).</p>

I had <em>no</em> idea how different the world of podcasting was (I actually don&#8217;t listen to them &#8211; *gasp*) and if it weren&#8217;t for those guys I&#8217;d probably still be trying to figure out how to connect my mic correctly, haha&#8230; You might notice how different I sound compared to Paula in the first few episodes until we fixed it ;)</p>
<p><strong>But, we&#8217;re live now, baby, and ready to talk money!</strong> Literally! And it&#8217;s soooo much fun and easier over written word too, although much harder to edit&#8230; You&#8217;re gonna know exactly how I think and talk after listening to these as it&#8217;s all raw and uncensored. Our <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/itunes" target="_blank">iTunes page</a> looks like a rap album with all those EXPLICIT labels! Haha&#8230;</p>
<p>But hey, that&#8217;s real life right? No fancying it up and pretending to be something we&#8217;re not&#8230; We just get on the mic and do our thing! And hopefully you <del>don&#8217;t catch us drinking beer</del> get a lot out of it :)</p>
<h2>So What&#8217;s This Show About? Besides M.O.N.E.Y.?</h2>
<p>Well, pretty much the exact stuff we talk about here only amped w/ Paula on our side who brings a massive amount of energy and experience to the show to compliment yours truly. Not only does she run her own real estate empire and can technically retire anytime she wants (yeah passive&#8217;ish income!), but she&#8217;s an amazing hustler and entrepreneur too who&#8217;s completely transparent with how much she makes and shares how others can do it too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In other words, she&#8217;s a financial beast. Only prettier.</strong></p>
<p>So a lot of building wealth talk, investing tips, how to cut expenses, budgeting better, reaching financial freedom, entrepreneurship, and pretty much crafting a kick-ass lifestyle for yourself. <a href="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2016/01/better-way-teach-financial-education-schools/" target="_blank">The whole point of money</a> at the end of the day, right?</p>
<p>We also be bring on a handful of guests doing some incredible things as well (retiring early, paying off their houses, traveling the world, making thousand of dollars hustling and more).</p>
<p>Oh, we&#8217;ve also started doing <em><strong>&#8220;Ask Us Anything&#8221;</strong></em> episodes too where people can *ahem* ask us anything and we&#8217;ll answer their questions on the show :) Anything from money to personal life to blogging to entrepreneurship, whatev. And I guess now podcasting &#8211; hah!</p>
<p>If you want to submit questions yourself, <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/contact/" target="_blank">give us a shout</a> and we&#8217;ll answer them in the next round.</p>

<p><strong>Just a quick shout that our new podcast &#8211; M.O.N.E.Y. &#8211; is launching next Monday, Feb 1st!</strong> It only took us 10 months! Haha&#8230; I&#8217;ve partnered up with one of my favorite personal finance bloggers (and entrepreneurs!) Paula Pant from <a href="http://affordanything.com/about/" target="_blank">AffordAnything.com</a>, and we really think we have a good show for you. Or at least one that will hopefully entertain you :)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://themoneyshow.co"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47090" src="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-podcast-logo.jpg" alt="money podcast logo" width="600" height="173" srcset="https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-podcast-logo.jpg 600w, https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/images/money-podcast-logo-300x87.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><strong>[UPDATE: </strong>It&#8217;s now live!! <a href="http://TheMoneyShow.co/itunes" target="_blank">TheMoneyShow.co/itunes</a> :)]</p>
<p>We thought we&#8217;d be a good mix together with our completely different lifestyles (married/settled/kids/not financially free/hates home ownership vs world traveler/master real estate investor and technically doesn&#8217;t have to work anymore if she doesn&#8217;t want to!), but at the end of the day we both know how important managing your money is. And especially on your OWN terms.</p>
<p><strong>So that&#8217;s what the whole show is about!</strong> Financial freedom, crafting your ideal lifestyle, entrepreneurship, and of course interviews with some pretty incredible people doing some pretty incredible stuff. All packed with our tips and tricks to what&#8217;s gotten us all here.</p>
<p>You can sign up here to be notified once it&#8217;s live and to get future episode alerts, or you can check out our new website that will be featuring everything as well: <a href="http://TheMoneyShow.co" target="_blank">TheMoneyShow.co</a></p>
<p><strong>We hope you like it!</strong> We have no idea what we&#8217;re doing!! :)</p>
<p>(Back tomorrow with your regularly scheduled posts&#8230;)</p>
<p>******<br />
<strong>PS:</strong> It&#8217;ll be a weekly podcast, but the first two weeks we&#8217;ll be releasing a batch of 10 or 11 episodes to get the party started&#8230; Let us know what you think!</p>
