John, just wondering if in one of these ways we can get USAA ins.  My husbands father was military (deceased now), our son was military with an honorable discharge, (deceased now), and our son-law has USAA ins.  Is there a way through that we can get the insurances.  we&#039;re 74 &#038; 76 yrs old and just trying to save money.]]></description>

Not everybody who joins serves in combat and it depends on what period they joined.  Anybody who joined and served honorably has most of the same rights as those who were in combat.  Prior to the internet nobody would have even made a comment like this.  That&#039;s civilian talk and insulting to veterans that you would even say that especially coming from a civilian who probably only &quot;thanks for service&quot; because it&#039;s PC.

This just shows that non-military civilians should not be allowed to join USAA because they have no experience with the military for which USAA was designed.  It&#039;s for those who were in the military not the wannabe&#039;s who just want the connection.  I&#039;m against never-have-been&#039;s joining because it was never designed for them.  They lack any personal experience in the military and their knowledge of it is limited to what they read not experience.  It&#039;s two different worlds and non-military/non-veterans should not be allowed.  The right should be earned not handed over on a silver platter for the asking.]]></description>

@glenn, You&#039;re right about that.  They keep changing their rules because they know they are losing business.  I give them hell every time I call them.  They&#039;re not as good as they used to be.

From reading so many of these non-military comments, it looks like people are looking for the easy connection to the military without ever joining.  They should all be ashamed of themselves for thinking they are entitled to something they never earned.]]></description>

I totally agree with you.  I&#039;ve been with USAA since 1972 and never had any other insurance company.  When I joined, only officers and their family members were allowed to join through the parent who was in the military and signed up with USAA.  I think my brothers still have USAA through my father even though neither of them joined the military.  Frankly I think they should have been disapproved after the age of 21.

I joined the Army in 1978, but I believe I was still under my father because enlisted personnel were not allowed to join USAA at that time.  My thoughts were as the &quot;older&quot; members from WWII started dying off, they began allowing enlisted to join to fill that void.  I switched over from my officer father&#039;s policy to my own as enlisted when it became available because I didn&#039;t want the child connection.  I wanted my own because I served proudly.  Civilians who never served don&#039;t deserve membership unless they&#039;d like to raise their right hand and make a sacrifice.

Being a USAA member was a privilege that was earned whether a military members served in combat or not.  Unfortunately I served during a time when it was mostly peacetime even though there were things going on.  Civilians who never wore the uniform or raised their right hand should not be allowed to join.  Period.  Why should they reap the benefits and privileges they did not earn.  There are other companies they can go to.

I&#039;ve been in discussions with USAA many times and told them what I thought of these ever-changing policies of theirs and the day they allow non-military people to join is the day I leave.  It&#039;s a slap in the face to all who served.

I do think USAA is not as good as they used to be and I&#039;ve told them many times they need to clean up their act or they will continue to lose more business.  Many people who have posted on their website agree with what I have said here, and many of them have left.]]></description>

@donna, When you consider that the current CEO was in the military for a very short period of time and now manages USAA--you can pretty much say that USAA is already heading that way. I&#039;ve already terminated my financial business with them and moved over to NFCU. It&#039;s just a matter of time before I move my auto/home insurance. They are no longer oriented to military families--like the say there but aren&#039;t really.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need help. Can anyone tell me if the USAA Military Affiliate credit cards open to the general public who was not eligible for USAA membership and not eligible for any of the affiliate groups in May 2014? I had 2 Military Affiliate credit cards approved based on Business Projection income of $150,800.00.   If the answer is no. Where can I find the information online?

Thank You]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The day USAA allows civilians in-is the day military veterans like me need to rally our VFW organizations (as well as the VA that we founded), and form a new MILITARY ONLY financial institution and let the civilians have USAA.  

They are not like us and they never will be-we defend them, not befriend them.  Civilians need to mind their civilian business and military will take care of ours-and they are both very different!]]></description>

They have been serving the military community since 1922. Founded, in fact, by 25 Army officers.

					<description><![CDATA[So--I am still confused. Does USAA have a legitimate military connection or not? Are they just a &quot;fraternity&quot; that has set up guidelines that infer service/coverages support our military body?
Thanks]]></description>
