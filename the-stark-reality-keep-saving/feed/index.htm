					<description><![CDATA[I have been there as well. I will never ever forget the day I came home from work and the house was empty. My wife and kids gone out the door and I didn&#039;t know where they were. Talk about the scariest day of my life!

6 years later life has thrown amazing curve balls. I&#039;m remarried to a wonderful woman who though cannot have kids of her own have accepted mine with open arms. I also have main custody of both of them. There have been so many ups and downs I&#039;ve lost count, but the journey I&#039;ve taken and where I am I never could have foreseen.

Hang in there, keep trucking, and love those kids every second you can.]]></description>
