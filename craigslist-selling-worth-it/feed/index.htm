Hah! Nothing wrong with a nice road trip like that :) What a great chunk of money too - congrats! I had considered checking out TJ Maxx in the area where we were meeting, but I  knew that would lead to more $$ spent in the end so averted and just drove my a$$ right on home, haha... Though at least you can&#039;t spend *too* much in stores like them :)]]></description>

Great idea for sure! I didn&#039;t think about it at the time, but nah - don&#039;t have anything else of Hurley that I&#039;d be willing to sell... I really love the brand and use all my clothes as much as possible - even right now as I sit and type this! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I might have done this. I probably would have seen if there was an errand that I needed to run anyway to rationalize it...which would have probably incurred spending money which means that&#039;s what I would have spent the $12 on...at which point I would rationalize THAT and tell my husband, &quot;Look what I got for free!&quot; lol Seriously, sometimes getting out of the house and breaking the routine is a blessing. 

We just sold some scuba diving equipment for $350 (given to us by a friend who found it, assessed as brand new and worth $600) on CL.  Starting price was $450, negotiated down to $350 - $380 with shipping. Guy decided he wanted to pick it up. He drove two hours one way. (!!!) He might as well have paid the shipping. We asked if it was because he wanted to inspect it first. He said, no. He just wanted to get out of the house. Go figure.]]></description>

HAH! Great idea! I don&#039;t know if it does either but I&#039;m going to check it out :) Also it&#039;s smart to meet at 7-11 because if they &quot;forget&quot; to bring cash (or worse - a check!) there&#039;s a nice shiny ATM right in there waiting for them :)]]></description>

That works! I haven&#039;t sold my last two items I&#039;ve since put up either yet... It&#039;s more about the practice and habit of constantly getting rid of stuff that&#039;s important :)]]></description>

Awesome connection! That&#039;s another great thing about meeting people face to face than just dealing over the internet all the time - you get to meet knew people and come across interesting connections like that :)]]></description>

I actually only spent $20 on it (picked it up at TJ Maxx a while ago) and really liked it, but then when I used it on a trip I found it just too big and bulky for my taste, and since I used it I couldn&#039;t go back and return it. Then I found my current backpack for only $15 and made the switch and then just let it collect dust for years in my closet... but not anymore!]]></description>
