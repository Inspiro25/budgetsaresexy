					<description><![CDATA[I would use that 8 hours to study as much as possible for my ultimate goal of becoming a financial planner.  My plan is to focus on those people that are at the verge or at bankruptcy and who want to live beyond that process and come out educated and with a plan to succeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ernest,

There is plenty of time in the day when self-reflection can be done.  During your morning (and evening) commute, instead of listening to the radio, think about where you are going with your life and if it&#039;s the direction you want, analyze past mistakes so you can learn from them, etc.  You just have to carpe minutam (seize the minute).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would love to have some extra time to do some reading and even some self reflection.  Doesn&#039;t seem like we have much time anymore to have a free mind just to think about our day (ok, I know it sounds cheesy, but I do really think that we need time to just reflect on our lives).]]></description>
