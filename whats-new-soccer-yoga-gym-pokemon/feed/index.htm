That is the nice thing about doing large juicings like that.... A pain in the a$$ but then you reap the rewards for a few days! And of course your body loves it too :) Glad you&#039;re still doing it!

(And you&#039;re not wrong about the farting...  My father tried it years ago for a week but learned fast his body lets out enough gas to power the whole town each session so he had to give it up, lol... But there&#039;s really only one way to find out if you have that type of body or not - you&#039;ve got to try it!! I&#039;ve probably only heard 2 farts in my 20+ sessions so far so the odds are in your favor ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats awesome J, I&#039;ve thought about trying Yoga, but to be honest...And I&#039;m embarrassed to say, the thought of laying a huge screaming fart out in public (a real possibility) keeps me out of the yoga rooms.  It would be on accident for sure, but not sure if I could contain myself.  I&#039;m still Juicing, but you&#039;re right it is time consuming.  I used 2 heads of Kale, 8 apples, a tree of ginger, a bag of celery, 2 beets and all I got was (2) 24 OZ drinks and a hour less of my time.  But, I&#039;m still going to continue, cause the 48 OZ lasts me 3-4 days.]]></description>

&quot;as long as it makes you happy&quot;

I like that! we&#039;re always getting pressured to keep things up, whether from within or by others, so that&#039;s a great way to tell if something needs to keep going for real or we&#039;re doing it for the wrong reasons &#128077;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Way to go J! Love that you&#039;re investing in yourself. Yoga is amazing, and you can always do one which &quot;flows&quot; with you the best. I&#039;ve remembered enough poses to do a 45 minute routine every Thursday eve (or Friday mornings if Thursday eve&#039;s get gobbled up). It&#039;s amazing not just for the mindfulness practice, but you sleep so much better and have such a relaxed pose for the weekend! Keep it up my friend.]]></description>
