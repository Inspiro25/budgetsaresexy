Oh no - they looooove giving people credit because they want you using it all up so they can make more ;) So long as your credit score and history with them is good, at least (forgot to mention that part earlier - if you have crappy credit/payment history with them it&#039;s much harder to get increased.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, that I did! I just started reading your blog this year, so I&#039;ve got 8 years worth of information nuggets to work my way through!

I get why it&#039;s awesome to do it, and right now I&#039;d love to have higher limits: much like with your caddy you bought in &#039;08, I&#039;m using a 0% card to finance furniture (so I can get past the college years of living out of plastic totes and crappy IKEA furniture) and therefore carrying a balance until that 0% period runs out. Of course, this won&#039;t be forever, but I&#039;d love to higher limits for in the future, as well.

But if it&#039;s just as easy as calling them up, or hitting my fancy button, then it&#039;s worth a shot! 

For some (very irrational) reason I think I was just afraid of them saying something like &quot;NO! How dare you ask for more money?!&quot; and then cancel my account or something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/usaa-just-hollered-theyre-raising-my/#comment-244507&quot;&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Rachel! You found an oldie of mine :)

But great question indeed. First off, yes - it IS as easy as just calling them up and asking. That&#039;s what I did to raise both of my cards. (Or you can try that fancy button of yours - even easier!). What this does is improve your &quot;debt to credit&quot; ratio. I.E. make it look like you&#039;re even more responsible since the amount of debt *owed* compared to the total amount *open* for using becomes much much wider. For example, if you had a balance of $1,000 on a card with a limit of $2,000, then you&#039;d be using 50% of your total credit. If, however, you had that same $1,000 balance but your credit line was $10,000 - ten you&#039;d only be using 10% of your credit! Which looks much better, although of course it&#039;s the exact same thing.

So that&#039;s the pro. The con? You could now be tempted to spend all that extra credit you just got :( So if you&#039;re not good w/ your cards or don&#039;t trust yourself, then I&#039;d say leave them alone and keep going about your business. But if you are responsible with them and/or never carry a balance (like I do), then increasing it would probably be a smart move.

Hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I&#039;m wondering how exactly you &quot;pumped those bad boys up&quot; in order to help your credit scores, you know, the whole process you went through? I know people say you can request increases and what not, and all my wonderful online CC services have a little button specifically for requesting a higher credit limit, but I&#039;ve always been a little afraid to ask for an increase, and just let them increase naturally over time. Am I just being dumb to be scared of this? Are there any repercussions to asking for higher credit limits?]]></description>
