					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you are finally coming around to owning a home.  It is understandable to be skittish after you&#039;ve been burned but it is better to build equity and pay a mortgage then make rent payments; as well as enjoy an increase in property value as time goes by.  If one plans to stay in a home for a good period of time then it is a better way to go. In the past you have been adamant, so no point in posting why I disagreed.

I&#039;ve never participated in the rent vs own posts before because each person makes their own decision based upon their own situation and there is no point in debating certain topics.  Some plan on moving regularly or others have bad credit and need to wait a few years before they can borrow again so  in many circumstances it is better to rent.  Whatever their reasons; its personal.  I think in the long run though owning is better.  And yes it is always good to diversify;  Stocks, bonds, cds, property, gold etc. Good luck on your house hunt.]]></description>

Hey you!! Always love seeing you pop by! Very interesting indeed how much you appreciate that these days :) Maybe it&#039;s because we&#039;re getting older and more okay with spending money on such things than in the past? When we were in more of an &quot;accumulating&quot; stage with money? Either way - glad you&#039;re happy with your new place! I feel like another bubble is on the horizon/here too, but I&#039;ve never been good at timing stuff so not going to try now, haha... Sometimes you need a place when you need a place :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Late to this post but had to post my opinion . I bought a &quot;starter&quot; house in 1999, wanted to upgrade in 2005.  Dodged that bullet in 2007.  Failed to buy multiple properties during that bust.  Bought a dream home in 2016 at a substantial price which feels close to the second bubble of nowadays (2019).  Never thought I would enjoy an upper class neighborhood as much as I do now.  Expensive to maintain (high property taxes, mainly). But for some crazy reason it&#039;s worth it to have such a high quality of life a nice neighborhood provides...]]></description>

It all depends on your specific situation and how you want to attack it. I personally just feel better knowing that I&#039;ve already got myself on the 15 year track and reduce it from there.]]></description>

I would say you&#039;re scaring me, but I&#039;m already scared of all those things :(

I do hope it all gets better soon, though!! And at least you&#039;re mortgage free which is more than others can say!! So there&#039;s that! :)]]></description>
