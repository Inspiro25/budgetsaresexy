					<description><![CDATA[My shredder &#038; I go waaaaay back. So much so that we have weekly junk mail dates where I feed it the incessant amounts of crap I receive in the mailbox daily. Shredding makes me so happy it&#039;s hard to put it into words because let&#039;s be honest, identity theft = no bueno!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Julie @ Freedom 48&lt;/b&gt; - Perfect! But you trash even credit card receipts from the grocery store?  I trash all cash ones, but not c/c ones in case we need to battle down the road, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I&#039;m sure there is but the idea of waiting for a certain day would drive me bonkers. I always need to proceed the moment it hits me while I&#039;m in the mood or I&#039;ll phase out and never do it...
@&lt;b&gt;Einstein&lt;/b&gt; - I think I&#039;d like that too, but only if you were to print out the important ones to have on file just in case something happens to your email.  I&#039;m starting to get freaked out that EVERYTHING is digital these days cuz if something gets cleared you have no more records of it!  Even backing up doesn&#039;t solve this 100% unless you do it every single night.
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Try duplicating that picture up there ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Andrea @SoOverDebt&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, good for you on being able to do that.  I don&#039;t have the patience/desire to take pictures of them all - but I do agree it would be better!
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel211&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I&#039;ll keep it in mind!  Though everything is already unplugged - I only plug in when I use cuz the Mrs. is always afraid of electrical fires (she used to work at a law firm where people died/got hurt by appliances randomly catching on fire).
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - I hear a next birthday present in the works! And plus, it&#039;s kinda fun if you don&#039;t do a billion at once ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Hahhahaahaha.... BEST. IDEA. EVER.
@&lt;b&gt;Jon B&lt;/b&gt; - Nah, not for me at least. I don&#039;t like it all being digital and it would take a LOT more time to do that than to just file away and be done with it.  Though I suppose you still have to add them into the spreadsheet or accounting software anyway?  I dunno... I say if you think it&#039;ll get you to stay on it more, then it&#039;s def. worth it :) If you think you&#039;ll never touch it, then I&#039;d stick w/ the simple filing method.
@&lt;b&gt;BG&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, for sure!  I used to use our work one all the time too - they are way faster and better at shredding! Good one :)
@&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt; - Burning them! YES! haha... I like that!
@&lt;b&gt;Bridget&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME!!!  Freedom = Sexy, baby.
@&lt;b&gt;Beckey &amp; Jeff&lt;/b&gt; - I love it!!! Man, I never even thought about fire &#039;till HP mentioned it above... if only our fireplaces were REAL, haha... I don&#039;t think I could get away w/ a fire pit where we live.
@&lt;b&gt;Dollar D @ The Dollar Disciple&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, agreed!
@&lt;b&gt;Michael Senchuk&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I think this is the perfect season for shredders - when everyone&#039;s tidying up and doing tax stuff. The stores must love it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jerret&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, really?  Good ol&#039; Google Adsense ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - That would be pretty cool.  Though I&#039;d want to physically WATCH it being shred and not just handed over to them w/ all the other boxes to do at a later point (not sure if that&#039;s how they do it or not, but that would scare the crap out of me).
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll figure it out eventually :) Just a matter of tweaking all the time until you find the perfect way for YOU.
@&lt;b&gt;bax&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, you&#039;ve got no complaints in this department!  I&#039;d totally be up for a good fire pit action some day :)
@&lt;b&gt;Marianne&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, unfortunatley that&#039;s not a picture of me up there ;)  I bet that guy had a lot of fun with it though!
@&lt;b&gt;Ella&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, we need to get you one soon :)  Ask it for your bday or christmas instead of something random you&#039;d never use!  They really are fun in small batches. Makes you feel all kinds of powerful, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LaToya&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, good for you on workin&#039; it!  I&#039;m not a fan of digital scanning and all that, but I def. see the pros to it IF you do end up using it the right way. Which it looks like you are, so congrats!
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I mean, besides burning them all though, how else would you dispose of them if not by shredding?  I guess the good thing w/ going with those big trucks is that it&#039;s mixed with everyone ELSE&#039;S stuff too? Making it harder to put together?  Sometimes when I rip up important stuff on the streets, I&#039;ll just put a cple pieces in different trash cans for that reason, haha, but not w/ these guys.
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - I bet one&#039;s coming up now with tax season and all that!
@&lt;b&gt;BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - Should be happening anytime soon!
@&lt;b&gt;Patrice C. Washington&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well you can&#039;t be TOO technologically old if you&#039;re not only READING blogs here on the net, but you&#039;re RESPONDING too ;)  So I say you give yourself more credit there missy.
@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Work it, girl!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a paper whore too, J. Money. I&#039;ve had the scanners in the past and they worked when I had an assistant to do it every other week. But honestly, I LIKE having physical little files that I can run to and grab when I want to. It gives me some warped sense of accomplishment.  

I guess you have to do what works for you, but it is a very slow move for me into the technology age. How is it possible to feel this old (technology wise) at 30!?! :/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Be careful! There are people out there that will actually take the time to put the pieces together just to steal your identity. I actually started using a company that will shred for me; all I do is lug my reciepts outside and they shred them from a truck. It&#039;s cool! But, on the bright side if you have a party coming up, think of all the confetti you just made!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use Paperless by Mariner Software. I scan receipts in once a week during my weekly check-up/balancing of accounts, and shred the receipt after I am done. My accountant says the scanned receipts are good proof, and easier to go through. When tax time comes, I load all my info onto a disk and take it to him along with any paper W-2s. 1099, ects. It&#039;s kinda fun to look back on how much I spent on food, clothing, ect. during the year and use that to budget for next year.]]></description>
