Learning and experience can be like a form of payment. That&#039;s cool you value that more than the $$!]]></description>

Great point about the low spots! It&#039;s much more difficult to get through if you&#039;re not having fun along the way!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joel,

I really appreciate how you mentioned that money is a byproduct of success. So many today (and I was included in this category about a year ago) believe that money determines where or how you should start your side hustle. But that&#039;s not the case. Your side hustle should be something you are passionate about - something where you would wake up every single day because you are passionate about it. When you are driven and truly love what you do, the money will be no issue. If you love what you do, you&#039;ll be consistent, you&#039;ll work through the low spots and you&#039;ll always strive to improve. Those are the 3 key steps you need in order to level up and thrive. 

Fantastic post (and an awesome picture of the band as well!). 

Cheers,

Fiona]]></description>
