					<description><![CDATA[I was out of work for two months and the stimulus could not have arrived at a better time! I&#039;m using it to pay bills this month and for next month&#039;s rent. I have been unable to get any unemployment funds yet because of the overwhelming number of claims and outdated technology. I hope to get backpay eventually.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually feel guilty, I just stored it away in my Savings Account as I build up a down payment for a house. I feel bad because I&#039;m not necessarily stimulating anything right now. 

Maybe a feel a little better when I buy that house. =)
