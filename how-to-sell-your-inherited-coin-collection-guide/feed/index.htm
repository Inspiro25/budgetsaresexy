					<description><![CDATA[As with any coin collection sometimes it is the memories that make them the most value. there are some comes that I have told my kids to hold onto while the rest they can decide to keep or sell. As your article teaches there are many options in how you sell them, the main thing is when you do dont get taken advantage of and get a fair price and hold on to the few that even the money you might get isn&#039;t worth letting go of that memory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/how-to-sell-your-inherited-coin-collection-guide/#comment-298426&quot;&gt;Norm&lt;/a&gt;.

Excellent idea!! Love it! And hopefully at least one of those 16 g-kids continues on the hobby for us! We need as many new collectors as we can get! :)

Grading - unfortunately you can&#039;t just send in pics of the coins as they need the *coin* itself to properly grade it, however they do send it back to you in an encapsulated container w/ labels and I believe digital pics too. The two leading companies are NGC and PCGS:

https://www.ngccoin.com
https://www.pcgs.com/

It can cost $30-$60 a pop though, so unless it&#039;s a rare coin or is in exceptionally brilliant condition and the difference in grading substantially affects the value, it&#039;s probably best to just try your own hand at grading them and/or taking them to a coin shop/club/show and getting a 2nd opinion. It def. gets tricky once you&#039;re in the MS-60&#039;s and a sigle digit off there could certainly be the difference of hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

Here&#039;s a good page from NGC on that 1901-S $5 of yours:

https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/liberty-head-5-1839-1908-pscid-64/1901-s-5-ms-coinid-18404

If you think it grades mint or below it&#039;s probably safe to grade yourself, but once it hits MS-64 and up we&#039;re talking $1,000-$24,000 instead of $500-$600 so if it&#039;s  superb looking then def. worth ending in ;) Though FYI - if you ever send in your coins to the big auction houses to sell, like Heritage or Stacks, they&#039;ll get them all professionally graded for you as part of the process since they know it brings in bigger $$$ that way...

Goood luck! And great plan, again! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello J$, I very much enjoyed reading your site and questions/answers.  I&#039;ve thought long and hard about what to do with my collections (started at age 12, now 74).  I have 4 kids, 16 g-kids.  It&#039;s too much to give to just one person.  Oldest g-kid is 16, and would just sell it not knowing if any have value.  So your site spurred my current thought.  As you suggested, pull out the best and sell piecemeal.  Then take the rest OUT of their folders, mix them with a box of seconds, divide into 6-8 groups and send to the oldest g-kids with the empty folders.  That way they learn about coins, mint marks, care, etc.  These collections then become theirs.  When they are established in their careers they can fill in the missing ones (I removed) through dealers if they want a complete collection.
Q:  Is there a site where I send photos of coins for grading?  I&#039;m thinking of my 1901-S half eagle.]]></description>

Haha yeah - hard lesson to learn with cleaning coins!! 

Better to get it out of the way now with smaller ones though before you move to multi-million ones ;) I&#039;d like to see you rock a colossal ship one day!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ive collected coins all my life.  Basically I kept getting burned, but I&#039;ve keep at it.   If you inherit coins, this is what I&#039;ve seen.  The bank teller dumps the coins in her drawer in discust. People dump them down the coinstar.  I remember grandpa gave me a well worn Buffalo nickle.  As a kid I thought it was worth a million bucks because it was so old and worn.  For me, Ill be crawling into the coin shop to cash in. Only to die of a heart attack for the money I get.  I&#039;ll chaulk it up to inflation. And wishing i never shined those silver coins that made them completely worthless.  The queen shines her silver platters and they are now priceless. My last hope is my coins get melted down and made into a ship. A shiny ship! Lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, 
I’ve inherited quite a few silver dollars and other coins. Some older pennies, nickels, half and silver dollars. Probably a couple of hundred. Is it possible for you to take a look t them and give me a value? Or perhaps purchase them? 

Thank you, 
Roger Manning]]></description>

oh, sure - if you enjoy looking over coins you can certainly pick up bags of them at your bank and see if you find any gems :) most people focus on half dollars and look for silver ones, but you can sort through any denomination really and often times get lucky. The trick is then depositing all the coins back again and usually if you take it to the same bank they frown upon it. So you might need a good network of them if you&#039;re going to try this route :) But people do enjoy it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Selamat sore Joe Winston!

I live in Indonesia as well, but not Jakarta. Unfortunately there are no active coin societies with regular meetings in Jakarta or elsewhere. However, there is a very ethical auction company based in Bandung dealing mainly in coins and paper money. The owner who I know personally has experience in Ancient Coins as well. You can send me an email to indostocks at gmail dot com for further information.]]></description>
