					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes, stores raise the price of items before they put them on sale... I saw that for sport shoes. They were usually around $100, when they did a sale, the regular price went up to $190 with a 50% rebate... Well, I don&#039;t like that kind of business, and you better be careful when only shopping goods on sale. Businesses might start to figure out a lot of people are more incline to spend when SALE is on price tags...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something I learned from my job in strategic sourcing...

If it is on sale and it wasn&#039;t something you intended to buy then it wasn&#039;t a deal.
It is only a deal if you it is something you were in the market to buy and it happen to be on sale.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, bananas go on sale around me all the time. Must be a DC thing.

But seriously, I am all for the sale shopping, but it&#039;s really impossible to only ever shop sales. And impractical at times, as you&#039;ve pointed out. You have less of a choice and you may make a rushed decision that you&#039;ll regret.

I think the big thing is also making sure you aren&#039;t lured in by a &quot;sale.&quot; If you check the prices, a lot of &quot;sales&quot; are (on a big ticket item) $5-10 off.  It&#039;s not worth worrying about if I need to make a big purchase decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i rarely shop anymore for things other than food or household necessities. when i do go into a decent clothing store, i head for the clearance rack in both the women&#039;s and men&#039;s departments. i love white shirts--tees and button-downs--fitted or oversized--and they do need replacing every now and again. a men&#039;s small or medium often fits better than a women&#039;s medium or large (i&#039;ve got long arms) and is usually made better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just have to say I always buy on sale because I waited for it!  I no longer go &quot;shopping&quot; without a purpose (a real need).  Retail therapy is dangerous for me.  My name is Donna and I have a sale problem.  So, I  limit my trips, don&#039;t shop to shop and buy only when needed at the best price I can get without wearing me out in the process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do the same thing--as soon as I walk into a store, I make a beeline for the sale section.  Especially when it comes to clothing, more often than not an item will get marked down mere weeks after it first comes on the sales floor, so why would anyone pay full price?

I do have to remind myself that it&#039;s not a good deal unless I actually get a good amount of use out of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A real frugalist just hates to pay retail. That&#039;s why we scope out the &quot;everyday low price&quot; of things we need. Example: As you note, bananas never go on sale -- but I know I can get them at the QFC supermarket or at the Asian market a couple of blocks away for 59 cents a pound.
I don&#039;t buy off-season fruit unless there&#039;s a real loss-leader price. I just dried fruit or canned fruit. Or bananas.
I never buy toiletries at retail; I wait for the sale-plus-rebate weeks and stock up. 
I&#039;ve just started using cashback sites and am liking them a LOT.
I rarely buy clothes but when I do they&#039;re either from a clearance rack or a thrift store (think designer-label silk blouse for $3.99).
And never would I buy something *just* because it&#039;s on sale. If I don&#039;t need it, why would I buy it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m bad! I hardly never buy sale stuff.... unless I&#039;m buying jeans. Since they generally start at $150+, getting them under 100 is good enough for me.

But shirts/dresses...I buy what I see that I like. Maybe I do need to sale shop only. My mom does! And she&#039;s always at Macy&#039;s because they&#039;re always sending her a sale coupon! I think it makes her shop more.........hmmmm....

I do shop on luxury sample sale sites...like gilt.com, ideeli.com, etc... Does getting the Burberry boots for 100 instead of 200 count as a sale? I&#039;m really not that bad, I only buy the items that I need from those sites. or that I&#039;ve wanted for a long long time :)]]></description>
