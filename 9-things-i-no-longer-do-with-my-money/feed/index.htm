					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s some fabulous progress J, most of them resonate with me.

Have to admit I still track, as I *love* analysing the spending afterwards, and doing the values to spending comparison. I am chuffed if I am on track, and give myself a nudge if not. 

And I also still love the thrill of  a new job....and a new work location to explore. Don&#039;t see that changing, well apart from the fact in three years I hope to not *have* to work anymore.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The most successful people are curious people (not sure where I read that..Buffett?) and they keep learning.
Nine years ago, I didn&#039;t think of budgets, passive income, or enjoying life. The household was a crazy one and paying the bills while running the kids around and working was enough. Then, I decided to read finance books while on the treadmill. And it got me thinking, how can I live life better? After much reading and looking at our finances, we made a big jump by buying rental property. That started the &quot;thought snowball&quot; that we CAN work smarter and not harder. Let the tenants pay the mortgage....Slash expenses by cancelling most of them and go solar. Forget name brand anything. Heck, get a job very close to home and let it provide uniforms. We did all of these things and more.
This website is my all-time fave and taught me soooo much! Thank YOU J. Money for all of your hard work, intense discoveries and willingness to put it out there for us to read!]]></description>

Those comments are especially good when the person calling out the typo misspells something himself! I&#039;ve had two or three of those this year and are my favorite to respond to :)]]></description>
