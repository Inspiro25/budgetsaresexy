					<description><![CDATA[I always do these too. I always think that it is not a big deal and it will all up up in the end, but in reality I am losing money! I have now become a bargain shopper always try to get things on sale because A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY!!!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;finallygettingtoeven.com&lt;/b&gt;  - &quot;Sometimes we just gotta let this stuff go and not re-hash it over and over&quot;  yup!  At least on the one-time occurrences like that.  If it&#039;s a monthly expenditure or something then def. worth peering into more if it&#039;s bothering you.  I sold my SUV a good $800+ less than it was valued at but I had to get rid of it.  And it didn&#039;t help that it was in the middle of Gas-hysteria the other year!

&lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/i-did-it-i-sold-elusive-suv-in-todays/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2008/08/i-did-it-i-sold-elusive-suv-in-todays/&lt;/a&gt;

@&lt;b&gt;Holly @ Shopaholly&lt;/b&gt; - Gotta keep it real ;)  You are welcome to come over any time!  It&#039;s been a good year+ since i&#039;ve even tipped my toes in it....sad, huh?
@&lt;b&gt;Moneyedup&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I like that.  Frugalness to the max!
@&lt;b&gt;dollar incense&lt;/b&gt; - HEY!!!!  nice seeing you here :)  Glad you&#039;re happy w/ the BMW too - the 3 series is also kinda on my list too, all depending on what happens when I test drive them both and what features/colors are available.  No matter which I pick though I will most CERTAINLY have a warranty on those bad boys - I hate car maintenance with any car, not to mention expensive ones.  Hope to see your blog pick up!! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yay for the new car!

I switched from the Porshe to a 08 BMW 335i and love it! Got it for 30k out the door, put 12k down and the rest is financed at .09%. Will never again own a German car out of warranty, but look forward to having no car payment for 2 years (yet still being under CPO). :)

Hope all is well with you, I might update my blog one of these days....hehe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nobody&#039;s perfect. I can relate to spending $4 on coffee and a ton at the movie theatre on snacks. When I was younger I would go to the Bulk Barn and stock up on candy to eat at the movies, and then stick them as well as a can of pop into my coat pockets. I would then wait until a loud crash, yell or explosion in the movie to open my can of pop since you weren&#039;t allowed to bring in any outside food or drinks. I should start doing that again...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is one of the best posts I&#039;ve read in ages! Sometimes I feel like all other PFers are saving every spare penny, living the frugalist life possible and here&#039;s me spending £3 on a bar of chocolate just because I want it. Makes me feel like a failure but it&#039;s great to see other people are buying stupid stuff too.

But $1600 at GoDaddy? SERIOUSLY?!?!

Also, I had no idea you lived on a lake. When can I come visit? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2 ways I blew it in the past few weeks....

Bought a SUV- could have gotten them down maybe another $500 (did really well to begin with but I don&#039;t know...there was still room there I think)

Sold an SUV- could have gotten another $300 out of them (although I DID get $2000 more than hubby said I would)

Sometimes we just gotta let this stuff go and not re-hash it over and over, oh well...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$: I&#039;m totally judging you.  ;-)
And now I will break your heart: If you&#039;d spent that GoDaddy money through Mr. Rebates, you would have gotten a 12% cashback. 
And if you&#039;d used my referral link to join Mr. Rebates, I&#039;d have gotten a teeny percentage of your total cashback. So you see, your slackitude isn&#039;t just hurting you -- it&#039;s hurting me. I don&#039;t know how you can sleep at night.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I should be more honest all the time ;)  Really appreciate all the kind words everybody, I&#039;m so glad you all got something out of this! I honestly make mistakes and spend way more than I know is necessary every month - and I&#039;m okay with that (and you should be too). I&#039;ve tried watching every single penny before, and making the perfect move every damn transaction, but it stressed me out like none other. I appreciate life much more when doing things 80-90% well :) Plus it&#039;s more exciting!

Something to keep in mind, though, is that I&#039;ve also saved a decent nest egg at this point so I have the luxury of not caring as much. There&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;d be blowing $1,000+ on websites if I were climbing out of debt!  So yeah, it&#039;s okay to make mistakes and not be all hardcore about finances, but the stage in life you&#039;re in should also be considered :) Use this to motivate you even further in getting out of debt!  The less you owe, the more freedom you have!

A few comments:

@&lt;b&gt;David @ Money Under 30&lt;/b&gt; - I would LOVE to see every pf blogger write up their own list!  It seems like the readers would appreciate it off of the response here.  You continue the trend on your site now! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Katy&lt;/b&gt; - I did not know about that! Good lookin&#039; out... I&#039;ve also started trying to 
keep coupons in my glove compartment too which I would NOT be lazy enough to go out and grab ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Tim&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, usually.  Although I WILL say that both &lt;a href=&quot;http://shopaholly.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Holly&lt;/a&gt; and myself stopped shopping for a certain amount of time cold turkey (me for 40 days, and Holly for 1 entire year!) and it made a WORLD of a difference. I have cut down at least 70% of my discretionary spending, and Holly is a beast at saving now :)  Kinda extreme, but if you make it you get extreme results.
@&lt;b&gt;michelle&lt;/b&gt; - hahahahaa....b3 coups?  at first i thought you were talkin&#039; about some sexy new mugs or something (don&#039;t ask me why), and then maybe a new BMW car (like the &quot;M3&quot; coup), and as soon as I went to Google it I realized you meant Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coupons!!!  Man I&#039;m slow.
@&lt;b&gt;Kim&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m a banana addict!  I will spend $1.50+ on one if I need to because what you get in return is extreme deliciousness! :)

PS: Oddly enough my wife asked me last night (at 11pm) if I wanted to stop by 7-11 to get milk instead of going to Safeway.  Haha...tempted every day by the devil!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[GREAT POST!!!  I&#039;ve picked up milk a time or 2 (or 3, maybe 4) and I must shamefully admit that while at the convenience store I&#039;ll grab some bananas (or any other items needed immediately).  I do this when it&#039;s after work, I&#039;ve got to get home to fix dinner for my family and my son needs a fruit for his lunch the next day.  You just can&#039;t beat being able to purchase gas, milk and bananas in one shot.  Sometimes, the saving of time outweighs the savings in money; at least for me.]]></description>
