Cheers to Big ERN! I was lucky enough to meet him once and hear him speak at FinCon. He changed the way I think about SWRs too, particularly for early retirees. Congrats on Lean FI next year!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would say I&#039;m on Stage 3 knocking on the door of Stage 4.  Hopefully, in one more year I&#039;ll be officially at Lean FI using the 4% Rule of Thumb.  That being said, I think I&#039;m ultimately more comfortable looking at the 3.25% rate that Big ERN suggests when it comes to deciding when I might be comfortable calling myself full FI.  I&#039;m also debating upping the desired annual spend part of the calculation.  Here&#039;s to hoping compounding over time is on my side!]]></description>

If your mortgage isn&#039;t impacting your freedom, then I don&#039;t really see a difference. Congrats on FI!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/the-6-stages-of-financial-freedom-where-you-at/#comment-328453&quot;&gt;David @ Filled With Money&lt;/a&gt;.

I purposely left money milestones out because everyone has different dollar figures. I also like to think about the freedoms we are achieving when we progress on the journey. Having a $2M net worth might seem like a killer milestone to some people, but if it comes with zero freedom and flexibility, it&#039;s actually not really what we&#039;re shooting for.

I also like the money milestones (for celebrating new achievements!) but maybe that&#039;ll be a new post idea :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great post! I like the acknowledgement of the different milestone in the huge journey known as financial independence. 

I think it would have been better if there was a general numbers guideline between each of the milestones as I&#039;ve been wondering if I&#039;m either too impatient in the financial independence journey or not. Good post regardless. 

Independence is where happiness lies.]]></description>

Great idea. I&#039;ve seen several versions out there... One of my favs is this one by Mel at Partners in FIRE... https://partnersinfire.com/finance/type-of-fire/   I just like how the questions aren&#039;t specifically revolving around money.

I just took it again. Surprise surprise, I got Coast FIRE as my answer. :)]]></description>

Love it! It&#039;s nice moving money into savings before it comes to your regular accounts. Easy way to avoid lifestyle creep!]]></description>
