					<description><![CDATA[I have one word for the concept of investing in companies you love and use all the time: 

Webvan

(Ok, a few more words: I dropped $1000 into them because I and everyone else I knew used them at least once a week.  We see where that went. :) )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is such a beautiful concept and I agree that the U.S, would regain much of its former glory and charm if this happened, but greed and convenience will always reign supreme.  An example close to my heart is the death of blockbuster and other movie rental stores that used to be so widespread.  Although these stores played a special part in my childhood- my cure for teenage angst was always renting a few movies- I fell into the same trap of convenience and cheapness that everyone else did and defected to redbox and netflix. In much the same way, people will make financial investments in what they see as benefitting their wallet, whether or not they respect, or can even tolerate, the company values. Morality is a distant cousin to money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a fantastic idea. If you stop and think about the fact that people will put their money into stocks of various companies, but they wouldn&#039;t even walk through their door to pick up something small. How many people do you think own stock in Apple but refuse to use an Apple computer or iPhone? Or who refuse to drink soda, but stock up on Coca Cola stock because their dividends are steady. That&#039;s not to say I&#039;m not guilty of the same -- I don&#039;t eat fast food or drink soda, but you better believe I have Coca Cola and McDonald&#039;s in my portfolio -- but you would think that if you won&#039;t support a company with your business, you wouldn&#039;t want to support them by purchasing their stock.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s the question of the day, isn&#039;t it ;)  If I liked Kors I&#039;d try it out and then let you know, but not sure how helpful that would be for you, haha... Start watching it though and see what happens!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw last month that fashion house Michael Kors went public.  I was considering buying some, but haven&#039;t done any research.  I love Michael Kors and his products.  But I don&#039;t know how stable fashion companies are as far as investing goes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ronx&lt;/b&gt; - Holy!  That ish is up to $360 now! Wowwww, good call on that for real! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah!  That seems to be a smart strategy too from the comments some of y&#039;all are leaving - I like it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bridget&lt;/b&gt; - I think that&#039;s smart - asking if you think it&#039;ll be a good company in a handful of years.  Ultimately I&#039;d love to buy and then just forget, so picking the hottest trends or latest &quot;it&quot; companies may hit me on my ass later if I forget to sell ;)  I wish there was just one solid stock that just always goes up for years and years w/ no worries, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Yeah, might not be the best time for that yet ;)  Unless you wanted to just play with, say, $1,000 and see what happens.  Maybe once you hit $1500 or $2000 you sell and apply to one of your clubs?  So you have a definite &quot;out&quot; - which most of us don&#039;t.  And what will hurt us sometimes ;)
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah!  That was a smart one to invest in for sure!  Maybe still is too, who knows?
@&lt;b&gt;Rich Uncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man, appreciate you reading and taking the time to comment :)  I oddly enough got into GE as well, but only last year.  I think it was $10 at the time and now it&#039;s hovering around $19 so not too shabby!  Though only if I sell ;)
@&lt;b&gt;me&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s not the first time I&#039;ve heard that either.  I think there&#039;s def. some validity to it, so I&#039;m kinda hoping that one wins at the end of this run :)  Though of course it would be much better to have someone kicking ass where I woulnd&#039;t mind at all paying them to do more of it! Haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;PPS: Speaking of all my trial runs, remember the Ultimate IRA Test?  So far the non-actively traded account is still in the lead!&quot;

You&#039;re passive account will, 90+% of the time, beat actively managed accounts.  I&#039;m a firm believer in low cost mutual funds, not because of their performance (they&#039;re average, but because I have *some* control over it - the fees) but because they&#039;re not weighed down by the fund managers &#039;picking your pockets&#039; each day.]]></description>
