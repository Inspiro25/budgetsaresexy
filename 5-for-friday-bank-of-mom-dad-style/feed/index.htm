					<description><![CDATA[1.) I am sure BoM+D would be happy to lend to us if we needed it. For whatever reason, we turned out to be the high income earners in each of our families (the Mrs. has a BS in BioMed Engineering and a PhD in Physiology and the Mr. has BS in Electrical Engineering), so we don&#039;t really need it. Our siblings still seem to get loans from BoM+D though.
2.) Not a loan, but the last financial thing we got was reimbursement for the Mrs.&#039; Maid of Honor dress for her sister&#039;s wedding this fall. Mom though it was fair, since she paid for the sister&#039;s dress when she was a MoH when we got married. While we don&#039;t need the money, we aren&#039;t going to turn it down. The Mr.&#039;s parents paid alot for college, so it is assumed that there doesn&#039;t need to be borrowing for a loooooooooong time.
3.) I made two promises before I went to college. The first was to my older brother that the next time the Green Bay Packers went to the Super Bowl, we would be there. Feb. 6, 2011 at Cowboy Stadium took care of that one. The other was to my dad that I would buy him a Corvette, the car he always wanted. The only deal was that he would have to drive the wheels off it. While I haven&#039;t sprung for the car (yet), I have every intention of keeping it.
4.) Absolutely. I wouldn&#039;t call it a loan though.
5.) Our parents were always there for us. They were at every game or meet. They kept food on the table, clothes on our backs, and a roof over our heads. Not to mention the unconditional love they gave. Do we have the greatest parents ever? No. But they were really good, and we wouldn&#039;t be here without them (literally/figuratively).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Is the Bank of Mom &#038; Dad still open to you? Yes if I really absolutely need it though

   2. When was your last loan from them? $10,000 to buy our house.

   3. What are your payback terms? Or do you secretly hope NOT to pay ‘em back? They said not to worry about it but I&#039;d love them pay them back and give them more. They&#039;ve done a lot for me over the years. Right now it&#039;s no possible to pay them back since my husband got laid off.

   4. Would you ever loan money to THEM? Absolutely.

   5. What do you love most about your parents? My husband got laid off a couple of months ago. My parents gave him a side job to help us out. They have 7 kids and they treat us all the same. They taught us to work hard for our money and it&#039;s a lesson i hope to teach to my kids. They are fun to hangout with. Sometimes I&#039;d rather hangout with them then my friends. They are still very much in love (45 years married). In fact I got married on there 44th wedding anniversary. The inspire me that a couple in love can last even through financial problems.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another good question too, courtesty of LLF -- &quot;Are you close enough with your sibs for the bank of sibs to exsist?&quot;  YUP!  I&#039;ve loaned money to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/i-loaned-my-brother-1230-and-i-will-be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; before actually, and all is great on that front :)

@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s awesome :)  I&#039;m still getting my mind right for &quot;gifting&quot; over &quot;loaning,&quot; but I&#039;d 100% hook up my family too whenever they needed anything.
@&lt;b&gt;LLF&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh that is a good question!  That&#039;s great you all support each other like that!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that was always the best! Being able to take your parents out to eat when you started to have the funds and/or transportation ;)  We used to take &#039;em to McDonalds all the time!
@&lt;b&gt;Tim&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re right, it DOES feel good knowing someone has your back!  Even if you never take them up on it.
@&lt;b&gt;Austin&lt;/b&gt; - Love to hear it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Dani @ OK, Dani&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, now you&#039;re getting ME misty eyed! haha.. they seem like wonderful people - thank you so much for sharing with us on this one :)  Damn good loan too - 0% interest helps incredibly!
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, true that - parents ARE awesome, even if only to bring you into this world of theirs ;)
@&lt;b&gt;BoeshaneHR&lt;/b&gt; - Another 0% loan term, I love it!  Sucks about your mother&#039;s money habits though, maybe she&#039;ll start learning from YOU now? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  Good for you on finding out about that $3,000 amount - dads are funny like that sometimes ;)  Sounds like you all have a great family, that&#039;s wonderful!
@&lt;b&gt;Katie&lt;/b&gt; - Your mom sounds FUN!! Haha... mine used to come to my college parties every now and then and sip her wine ;)  I think they like knowing that when we&#039;re drinking we&#039;re doing it at least somewhat responsibly, and the fact that they&#039;re willing to come along with us during the festivities shows they care too.  And not nearly as dorky as when they wanted to hang with us back in elementery school! haha... I hope you never have to use that get out of jail card btw ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Amy Lou&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, I can&#039;t wait for you to have a loving husband and kids one day!!!  You will love them to pieces and everyone will be rock stars with their money ;) Haha... just a matter of time, baby!
@&lt;b&gt;Steve A.&lt;/b&gt; - That is so cool!!!  I&#039;m always impressed/grateful when the older (to me) crowd discusses money so openly like that, esp my parents.  Def. makes things sink in more, and we all know who to come to when we have questions/concerns!  That 50% deal is pretty smart too, I dig that.  Thx for sharing man :)
@&lt;b&gt;FinancialStatus10&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, that is great :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... how old is your brother?
@&lt;b&gt;Diana&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... &quot;grown up 9-5 job.&quot;  That&#039;s sweet of you :)
@&lt;b&gt;JerryB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice.  Maxed out for sure!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Especially in your teenage years I&#039;d imagine!  If you&#039;re anything like my sister was, anyways ;) Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Yes! You should!!  Cuz it&#039;s so honest and REAL, ya know?  I loved reading your comment :)  And the idea of letting &#039;em use your $10k LOC is fascinating - esp since they have a very good income.  I was kinda hoping you DID let them so I could have read what ended up happening, haha, but I think those uncomfortable feelings were probably there for a reason :)  So way to go w/ your gut!  And your mom was awesome enough to pick up on it.  Thanks for sharing Melissa!
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting, I didn&#039;t know you were Asian - that&#039;s cool :)  I know a lot of kids that send money back to their families too, such a fascinating culture.  Especially the Korean culture - which I got to experience a little when I lived there during high school!  I really wanna go back some day...
@&lt;b&gt;Adele.fred&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, I&#039;m so sorry to hear about that :(  I&#039;m glad you feel so loved w/ everyone all around though! That is so good :)
@&lt;b&gt;South County Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that makes me sad :(  It kills me hearing when parents don&#039;t get along w/ their children...  We got nothing but love for ya here on this blog though! :)  Thanks for sharing!
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... you said &quot;cow poop.&quot;
@&lt;b&gt;bleu&lt;/b&gt; - Yay!!!  And $1300 isn&#039;t *too* much, so that&#039;s good.
@&lt;b&gt;thehouseflipguy&lt;/b&gt; - That makes sense if you&#039;re flipping houses! LOVE that wallpaper on your recent post btw, that is awesome!!  Though something tells me you&#039;re not gonna keep it around ;)	
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I think driving you nuts is part of their duties ;)  I like it how they both give away money too!  Good hearts those ones.
@&lt;b&gt;Absentminded Mother&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I wonder how much &quot;too big&quot; is in my parents case too.  I might have to pretend I need like $60k and see wha happens, haha... though when it&#039;s never a *need* it gets harder to convince ;)  I&#039;m sure they&#039;d loan us tons if we absolutely needed it.  Let&#039;s just pray that&#039;s never the case!
@&lt;b&gt;Darwin&#039;s Money&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  Love it!  I think it&#039;s a GREAT way to learn and not be a dufus throughout college/afterward too, since you know you need to get that money back ;)  Now you can be a dufus all you want, haha... actually that&#039;s never true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is the Bank of Mom &#038; Dad still open to you? 
I think it is as long as the loan isn&#039;t too big.
When was your last loan from them?
They loaned us money for the down payment on our house in 2008
What are your payback terms? Or do you secretly hope NOT to pay ‘em back? :)
We paid them back as soon as our taxes came back.
Would you ever loan money to THEM?
If I had money, I would loan them money, but I don&#039;t think they would ever ask.  I think my mom would ask her parents first before she asked me.
What do you love most about your parents?
I love that my parents keep teaching me life lessons all the time and are always there for me and my family.]]></description>

I think it is as long as the loan isn&#8217;t too big.<br />
When was your last loan from them?<br />
They loaned us money for the down payment on our house in 2008<br />
What are your payback terms? Or do you secretly hope NOT to pay ‘em back? :)<br />

					<description><![CDATA[1) Bank of Mom &#038; Dad still open to me? Dad&#039;s kinda poor. Mom &#038; Stepdad are open, but I always try to not borrow money. I feel that if I don&#039;t have it to begin with, then I might not be able to afford paying it back. I&#039;m sure that if we were gonna get a house, I might ask for a little loan.

2) Last loan from them? At least 6 or 7 years ago.

3) Payback terms? I always expect to pay back anything I borrow, and I make it a priority to pay it off ASAP---without neglecting our other financial obligations. They don&#039;t set any terms because they know I hate to borrow money.

4) Loan them $? Dad- no way. He would just give it all away, which is why he&#039;s so broke. Mom &#038; Stepdad- I couldn&#039;t really imagine them needing any, but I guess so. Wait, my mom actually borrowed 20 bucks from me last year to give to a homeless woman. She paid me back within the week, she just didn&#039;t have any cash on her.

5) Love most about the &#039;rents? Knowing that no matter how much I screw up, they will always be there supporting me and helping me right things. My Stepdad is really good with money and investing, so it&#039;s always fun to talk with him. My dad and I can talk about almost anything. My mom is kinda like a girlfriend when she&#039;s not busy criticizing me and telling me what to do. Nobody&#039;s perfect, but these people will always be there for me and loving me---I am truly blessed and never take that for granted. Sometimes they drive me totally nuts, but deep down they always mean well. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually do borrow money from my mom from time to time when I have a project going.  The reason is she usually just keeps money in savings so I pay her a little more than the interest she is earning.  For me it is cheaper than going to get a loan at a bank for one of my projects.

However, I only borrow to the point it impacts her.  Also, its always an amount of money that I could replace quickly if I had to - such as thru a home equity loan.]]></description>
