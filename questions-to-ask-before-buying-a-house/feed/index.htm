Damn - no kidding!!! And exactly what scares me about owning again, ugh...

Hopefully you got all the nasty surprises out of the way though and you&#039;re now good for a while!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[8/9 
In our home for about 1 year and a half and the maintenance stuff got us good. 
1. A/C compressor went out in first 2 weeks. Whole system replacement recommended due to older freon. (Covered by warranty after a long fight) $2,600 3 days worth of work. 
2. 3 Months later electrical issue with living room lighting. (Contractor friend helped fix) $65
3. 6 Months later refrigerator goes out. (Warranty would not cover. Learned to fix on my own) $65 1/2 day worth of work.
4. 1 year later Water Heater goes out. (Warranty wouldn&#039;t cover since parts were under manufacturer warranty. Contractor friend helped to replace and manufacturer provided most of the cost for a new water heater). $500 A days worth of work. 
5. 1 year later Garage Door Opener goes out. (Replace on my own with higher horsepower unit and learned the hard-way that I needed a stronger anchor with more horsepower). $150 a days worth of work. 
6. Last month the fence came down after a wind storm. (Contractor friend just fixed it up). $850

All in all. It&#039;s good to have a contractor friend who could help with tips, a hand and even get the work done at a decent cost when needed. It&#039;s also a good idea to learn how to work on your own home.]]></description>

Def. keeping my eyes open on that HOA stuff! An aunt of mine used to pay over $1,000/mo for her HOA dues! Granted she was in a condo complex, but still - the money alone could be just as annoying as the rules you need to adhere too :) (I remember once seeing a place in NYC for sale for only like $200k and was wondering why it wasn&#039;t selling for a while, and then eventually found out - the monthly dues for almost $2,000/mo - more than the mortgage payments! Yikes!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on being soooo close to getting into a house, J! This checklist would have been helpful for me about a month ago, when I was in the middle of escrow.

But thankfully, even though it&#039;s all said and done now, I scored 8 out of 9! Phew.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good points and good comments.  I would definitely second the comments about property taxes and property elevation.  Just two more quick pieces of advice.  The first, VERY IMPORTANT!  Is there an HOA (Homeowners Association for the uninitiated).  These can be both expensive and a royal pain in the butt.  Second suggestion, just a thought.  If possible do some online research or even ask your insurance agent if possible to see if you can get a feel for whether insurance rates for both cars and homes may be more expensive in that area.  Where I live in the mid-west car insurance rates can fluctuate a lot depending on the area or suburb. Not to mention the infamous &quot;flood plane.&quot;]]></description>

Yes - great points!!

We&#039;re putting down 20% so thankfully we&#039;ll avoid it, but never thought about the &quot;keeping track of equity&quot; part to nix it once it&#039;s time! Very smart.]]></description>
