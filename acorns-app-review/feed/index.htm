Oh, totally - if you can&#039;t do the roundups def. not worth it! I&#039;m sorry they didn&#039;t connect with your banks :( I thought I had noted that they don&#039;t work with *all* banks, but I must have missed it... Going now to update - thx! (And weird about double authentication? My USAA account worked fine with max security on, but it probably depends on the institution and how it connects up with Acorns... I do remember having to try it a couple times before it fully connected with USAA due to all the security though)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was very excited for Acorns, and I tried Acorns for 2 months, and finally gave it up.  Two things you did not discuss in your review:

1.  Acorns will not connect with smaller credit unions.  So in terms of the rounding up feature, it wasn&#039;t happening for us.
2. Acorns will also not connect to financial institutions where you have second-stage authentication turned on for your log in.  So, we couldn&#039;t connect our Wells Fargo debit card of chequing account.

Without the rounding up feature connected to our chequing accounts, Acorns just didn&#039;t do it for us.  There&#039;s no way I would turn on rounding up on our credit cards!!]]></description>

hey - very sweet of you to ask! go ahead and sign up however is most easiest for you :) it&#039;s all good whether I get the referral or not, but I think so long as you click the link here on your computer and then sign up from there it should work?]]></description>

I tried to withdraw my money and have gotten nothing but excuses and runaround from their &quot; support&quot; latest update was 6 weeks for a check. I requested the withdrawal and my stocks were sold in the end of October. So they are essentially hanging on to my money for 5 weeks longer than it should take assuming I see a dime. The ach transfer failed from their end although they insisted it was my bank ( my bank said it was their error and I trust my bank more!) do not recommend them at all.]]></description>

I think it&#039;s never bad investing *more*, whichever account the money goes, but it might get annoying having a bunch of accounts open though. You can always try it for 6 months or a year and then stop if you don&#039;t find helpful? Or roundup the amounts yourself for a month and then xfer $$ over to Betterment in one chunk at the end of the month and see how it feels? And increase it going forward too? It would take some calculating in the beginning, but would give you a sense of how it would look in the end :) Just some ideas anyways...]]></description>
