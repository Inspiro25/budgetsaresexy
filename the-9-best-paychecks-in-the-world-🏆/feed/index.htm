Great example!!!  Money *feels* different depending on how it comes into your life. I&#039;m proud of you guys for doing that during the pandemic and helping people with groceries. Well deserved side income!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes to all of these.  I&#039;ve experienced most of them, and they all feel good.  But the most exhilarating was side hustle income -- specifically from some DoorDash driving my husband and I did early on during COVID lockdowns because we were bored.  As mid-career professionals, the money paled in comparison to our salaries, but it felt so much better.  We actually worked for that money!  And the amount was directly tied to how hard we worked.  It was a feeling we hadn&#039;t had since waiting tables decades ago.  Of course, we&#039;re obviously not giving up our day jobs to go do that, but it was eye-opening!]]></description>

That&#039;s an awesome game to play... &quot;Guess your raise&quot;!

Glad to hear all your extra pay goes to savings. I know it&#039;s boring, but boring is good! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of my favorite paychecks to receive is the first paycheck after a significant promotion and corresponding pay raise.  I always try to estimate the change in my take-home pay before I receive the first paycheck with the increased salary.  It&#039;s fun to see how close I was and what the true take-home pay increase actually is.  Then, the 2nd best part is allocating the increase to our budget...although it seems anymore that everything goes to savings (either short term needs, or most likely retirement savings).]]></description>

CONGRATS!  And now all paychecks going forward are that tiny bit sweeter because without the debt payments there&#039;s more for investing! :)]]></description>

Daaaang! That&#039;s a nice pay day. But it&#039;s even better feeling that they paid their dues and are in good financial standing.

Love that you are staying sharp Steve :)]]></description>
