Maybe you can experiment with a &quot;one month cash only&quot; challenge and see how it goes? And then come back to tell us all about it?? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the idea of ditching the debit cards, I think getting back to cash for most of my everyday spending would help A LOT. Dating is a little too old for me, I&#039;ve been together with my husband for 23 years now and I&#039;m way too old to consider any men :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish more conversations came up like this in a coffee shop! Too many are on their phone, headphones in, or looking down. I try to make eye contact and smile but in todays culture I guess some say that can come off as creepy lol]]></description>

Oh yeah!! Seasons of life for spending money! Sometimes towards homes, sometimes video games, sometimes companions. Whatever is most important to you at the time! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To be a fly on the wall during that conversation :)  As someone that has been off the dating treadmill for nearly three decades, it never occured to me that dating in general had become a budget line item.  I love the take away, &quot;Make yourself more “visable” when you want something.&quot;  Powerful words!]]></description>
