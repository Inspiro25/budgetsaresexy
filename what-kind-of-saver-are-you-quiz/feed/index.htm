					<description><![CDATA[I definitely used to be a magician when I was younger, because as soon as I got paid **poof** all my money would disappear for clothing or food or trips! Now I would fall under salt and pepper category. Hopefully as I get better at saving and budgeting, I will begin to lean towards the rock star or goalie category!]]></description>

its tough for me too.  I&#039;m probably no better at it than anyone else, When I feel that anxiety is taking over I just try to breath and remind myself that this moment is all we are promised.  It helps you appreciate here and now.  Even if that is a screaming baby or a kid crying, it somehow seems less frustrating when you view it as just part of life and no less valuable than sitting on a beach enjoying the day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to be the Rock Star but now I&#039;m the Goalie. Unfortunately, my husband is more magician and expects me to work the magic of being able to save while he spends. I think he thinks I have secret money or make more money than I actually do (I&#039;m not sure why he would think this. He knows I am a public school teacher).]]></description>
