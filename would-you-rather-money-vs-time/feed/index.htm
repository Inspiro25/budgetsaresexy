Yup, you could do a lot of good even when you&#039;re gone too - depending on how you set things up for your departure. I know a lot of people who want to spend every last penny before they move on as well, but man - then you couldn&#039;t help anyone going forward? Even your family who then needs to pony up money for funeral, taxes, and whatever else you have to do w/ this stuff. So hopefully they leave enough to at least not put their family members in debt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To answer this question, you must define the end purpose of having wealth.  Is your wealth to benefit you or others?  After you&#039;re dead and gone, one might ask, &quot;what does it matter&quot;?  

I believe that those who are equipped with the gift of financial prudence and have thus achieved a substantial position of wealth in life should look to give back...give money and financial knowledge to your kids and relatives. Provide them the skills and knowledge to know how to be appropriate stewards of capital.  Give to your community, to your church, and to your charity!  At the end of the day, wealth should be created by you and protected and grown for the benefit of others including the people and institutions you love and hold dear!

I&#039;d take the money in a heart beat, knowing I could pay it forward and benefit society.  What could be better in life?

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Holly. A billion dollars is too mainstream. I would go back in time and risk messing up the space time continuum. Time is more useful to me than money since I can always make more money with time, but not the other way around. I wouldn&#039;t change my mind if the 15 years were added to my future. I&#039;m confident in my ability to make enough money on my own in the future to live a meaningful life so in this situation, time would be the more valuable commodity. Have you watched &quot;The Wolverine&quot; movie that came out last year? Spoiler ahead -&#062; I think the moral of that story is that even if one had all the riches in the country he will still be willing to trade it all for the ability to live longer. I agree with that crazy old man&#039;s thinking :)]]></description>

He&#039;s a blast. He also plans to gorge on twinkies when he gets old; since they have a shelf life of 50 years, he figures he can self-embalm himself and save the family some money.

You know, when we joke about that in person, it&#039;s a lot funnier. Writing it down for strangers makes it seem morbid and gross.]]></description>

I&#039;d say NO WAY JOSE to the giving up 15 years of my life for a billion dollars. Or any dollars for that matter. Even if that meant I could retire now and live better for the rest of my life I&#039;d still be out 15 years!]]></description>
