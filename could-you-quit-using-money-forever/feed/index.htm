					<description><![CDATA[LOL me too! I&#039;m terrible at the follow thru...your piece on time being your bitch hit me right there... still hurts ;)

And if you live somewhere sunny def look into the solar shingles over the panels cuz like i said, you don&#039;t need framework plus they are much easier on the eyes than those ugly bulky rectangles!!! - what&#039;s sad about my uncle, the imported spanish tile his wife picked out was $12k and the solar shingles are only $10k haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Marvin @ San Jose Options&lt;/b&gt; -  Oh yeah, me too!  But I&#039;m pretty sure this guy DOES see and hang out with a lot of people - at least from what I&#039;ve read so far (I&#039;m on page like 30 I think)

@&lt;b&gt;Mikayla&lt;/b&gt; -  HAH!  Well chances are I&#039;ll never finish it (I&#039;m GREAT at starting books but horrible at ending them), but yes - I&#039;ll share what I find out once it&#039;s time :)  And we actually looked into solar panels on our roof too, but just like your friend it wasn&#039;t worth the financial commitment since we&#039;ll probably sell too in the near future.  And every few years this stuff gets better and cheaper, so we&#039;re gonna rock it once we get a more permanent home.  I def. love all that stuff though!  Esp the community helping out each other too - life would be better! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hmmm...let me think.....nope couldn&#039;t do it!!!!
Well not that way exactly, but i&#039;m all for spending as little as possible.  Just as you mentioned &quot;paying taxes is important for the general good&quot;  I would rather go &quot;off the grid&quot; in a way that could still be civilized community and camaraderie.  We&#039;re all in this together right?.  Solar power, water repurposing, growing your own (hey now), and trading goods or services cuts down on a lot of the silly monthly money changing hands that makes most people fed up and want to hole up in a canyon somewhere haha.  For instance, a family member mentioned that they needed to reshingle their roof and I recommended photovoltaic shingles which don&#039;t require the home wiring/extra bracing that panels do, in their sunny location they could do away with their energy bill entirely, the shingles would pay for themselves long before they needed any maintenance AND the excess power feeds back into your neighborhood grid thus saving natural resources... they passed on it cuz 1) they weren&#039;t compensated for the extra power by the energy company and 2) they would be selling down the line so why pay now for the future homeowner&#039;s electric bill... *sigh* I know it&#039;s family, but they make my heart sad sometimes.

I also think it would be a wee bit selfish to live soooo off the grid.  If say my dad did this I would worry every day about bears and poisonous wild things and did I hug him hard enough and tell him I loved him the last time I saw him, that&#039;s just terrible to put your family thru IMO... i&#039;m sure some of my family would feel the same way if i were to take to the hills... great question J, you should follow up after you finish the book and get all the D&#039;s, yes i&#039;m trying to get out of reading it myself :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t say if he lives alone or not, but for me, I need companionship.  Whether if it&#039;s in a friend or significant other, I need to be around people to communicate and connect in order to stay sane.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Christa&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly, medication/health stuff throws this idea right out the window... and from what I&#039;ve read so far, it doesn&#039;t look like he uses a dentist much either - so a DEF no for me too, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;sr&lt;/b&gt; - An excellent take away for sure, I can get down with that :) Any extreme lifestyle is pretty fascinating stuff in this world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anyone who lives experimentally like this gives value to society by showing us alternatives to our dominant paradigm of consumption and perpetual economic growth.  This man gives more than enough to justify &#039;using our roads&#039; and receiving medical care when necessary.  I would like to see more of this sort of demonstrative living because our earth really does need new options.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This would be impossible (or near-impossible) for me. Medicine keeps me alive, so contemplating this lifestyle is pretty implausible. What if I couldn&#039;t work in exchange for my meds? Add in our growing family and the desire to retire, and it&#039;s just not for me. But more power to him!]]></description>
