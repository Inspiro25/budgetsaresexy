Glad you&#039;re liking it :)

And good observation - most of our money *is* currently in traditional retirement funds. I haven&#039;t sat down to really strategize too much on the retiring early part since I don&#039;t really plan to anytime soon (though I do plan on working for *fun* and not for *money* even though my projects would still make some!) but with all the loopholes out there and ways to structure stuff I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t be too horribly hard to figure out. 

Mad Fientist just wrote up a pretty epic post on this stuff actually if you want to check it out: http://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/

We both feel maxing out the accounts at our disposal is smart, though I def. need to diversify more and get some non-retirement accounts up and running for sure... Baby steps :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey your site is rad, thanks so much for the inspiration.  Question: If the goal is to retire early, I don&#039;t see the correlation of maxing out retirement accounts that you can&#039;t access until later in life (&quot;normal&quot; retirement age)?   Sorry if you already answered this somewhere, I have like 20 of your articles open in my browser and can&#039;t seem to find the answer.]]></description>

Thank you J. Money....Sea Monsters my momther-in-law does what is called a partner. A group of people get together and say they will each put it a certain amount of money per week(ours is 50$). One person collects the money on the same day every week. Depending on the amount of people who choose to do this is how long you pay for. It also determines how much you get. Everyone gets to choose when they want to get there money. Our time is 25wks for a total of $1250. There is no interest on this but it does teach you that you have money to save.]]></description>

If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what is your mother-in-law&#039;s way of saving?  We are stuck in an ongoing circle of me wanting to save and my hubby thinking we don&#039;t have the &quot;extra&quot; money to save.  Even though I signed up for Digit when he didn&#039;t realize it and it took a while before he caught on! =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok so I am making a commitment to max out my IRA my mother in law challenged me to try her way of saving. I didnt even think I had funds to do this. I work part time and my husband had just been laid off. Well I am proud to say I have been saving 200$ a month since Jan of this year! I have paid off more than 50% of my credit card debt and all of my bills are current and on time. This is major motivation for someone who had nothing 7yrs ago. Now I have found this blog to help me stay focused! I am going to get to 50% of my income then go full time and do 75% of my income. If it takes me until I am 50 (currently 32) at least I know its possible and I did it so I can teach my kids to do the same. I will end the poverty cycle in my family! Thank you for sharing your knowledge.]]></description>
