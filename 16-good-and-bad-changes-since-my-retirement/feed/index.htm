Ooooh nice, thanks! I was trying the capsule B-12s for a bit but didn&#039;t seem like it was really doing anything? I&#039;ll have to try the sublingual ones next time they come back - didn&#039;t even know that was an option (or what &quot;sublingual&quot; meant until Googling just now, haha...).

I hope you&#039;re able to contain the sores okay! The steroids have done WONDERS for mine, and now I&#039;m starting my infusions so hoping and praying it does the same long-term as I eventually have to get off the steroids.... So crazy how our bodies can rebel against us like that... What did we ever do it it???! Lol...]]></description>

oh man, you&#039;re hitting me where it counts with that shrine - that is an incredible idea!

but you&#039;re so right... 400 years ago it was the same and 400 years from now it&#039;ll be the same... no way around it, but at least we can be better about *appreciating* our lives more and sharing our love with those around us!

so good to see you here - have always enjoyed your comments over the years :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think about how life is fleeting all the time. I keep a &quot;shrine&quot; to the dearly departed in my office. A while back when I started it there were only a few obits on the wall. Now the wall is completely covered. Lots of young people too (call it around 60 years of age, much less than expected) that are dead. 

I always remember this poem to remind me about how transitory life is:

Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
   Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today
   Tomorrow will be dying.

It&#039;s nearly 400 years since that poem was written. Still true today.

I&#039;m 62 now, so more than 2/3 of my life is in the rear view mirror. It puts stuff into perspective. I need to make my remaining time count.

Thanks for saluting your dearly departed in this column. It&#039;s great to have you back J Money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think if I listed out significant life events over the last couple of years I&#039;d have to stop at about two or three haha. Take the good with the bad, of course, but sure sounds like an eventful &quot;retirement!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love that you long board to the gym!! It&#039;s EXCELLENT exercise and 10x smoother transportation-wise than a normal skateboard too :) I used to ride alongside my kid to Taekwondo on my longboard while he road his bike - so great!

And appreciate the kind words... I do get pretty passionate about stuff here, lol... Glad to see you&#039;re still in the game too w/ the blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re youthfulness and vigor are so appreciated, even out here on the West Coast I feel enthusiastic on reading your posts J. Money! I longboard to the gym and for fun, and even though I may not &quot;fit&quot; the profile it&#039;s too much fun just to cruise on a board (and faster/eco friendly). 

I laughed at the Cream of Wheat. It&#039;s been around forever and I was actually thinking of adding that back in because I forgot what it tastes like. 

Huge congrats on paying off your home! That&#039;s a big weight off, and you can focus more on taking care of yourself.]]></description>
