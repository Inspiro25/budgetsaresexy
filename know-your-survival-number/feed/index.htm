					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not exactly answering the question you ask ath the end, but, I have a way of tracking _every_single_transaction_in_a_year_, and I did. In 2018, I personally, used 26,477€ and I have records for every single payment.

https://www.thewealthyfinn.com/2019/04/all-things-i-spend-money-on-in-year.html

This is 72€ per day (just myself. My wife included it&#039;s very close to double), but it includes about 16€ of traveling (which isn&#039;t essential).

I should look at the categorization from that perspective: necessity. I&#039;m pretty sure I could live on about 45€ but not a lot less.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our current number is around $200-$225 a day.  

If we cut back on almost all extras but didn&#039;t move, we could get that down to $162.

If we sold this house and moved into our paid off smaller rental home, we could get it down to $105 if we cut all the extras.  But then we&#039;d be losing $61 a day in rental income.

We&#039;re paying $18 a day for Liberty Healthshare.  The big chunk is property taxes, our mortgage, income taxes, home insurance, flood insurance, term life insurance, and HOA dues ($100 a month currently). The rest is food, a car payment, car insurances, utilities, cell phones on Ting, and fiberoptic internet.  

We would be cutting back on food expenses, the basic cable add on to our internet package, Netflix, and miscellaneous cash.]]></description>

I assumed he was talking about cutting as many expenses as he could, including housing.  So that would be him finding a cheap Alberta apartment and a roommate.  Just assuming though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was reading the post, I figured out my number to be $55, which seemed discouraging compared to the person whose number was $26. But when you said your number is around $200, I felt a lot better!! I also love that if I multiply that number out for all 365 days of the year, it is only $20,075!! Wow! I didn&#039;t include any &#039;extras&#039; when I figured my number, so no cable, no eating out, and didn&#039;t include student loan payments since this is &#039;my&#039; number and the student loans are my husband&#039;s. I think that the number I came up with allows me to live a &#039;decent survival&#039; as mentioned by the original post.

Considering I split our living costs down the middle for this example, it&#039;s interesting to see that my family&#039;s total number would be $110 a day, or $40,150 a year, which makes me wonder where the rest of our money goes all year??? (I&#039;m assuming, taxes, benefits [which come out before I get paid, so I didn&#039;t add those into my number], and random unnecessary purchases/eating out.]]></description>

About four bucks a day for the Gus The Dog, including vet visits and dry/canned foods and poop bags and the occasional plastic bacon chew toy. :) 

Congrats on the house! For the size and price and location, you really made it work!]]></description>

Oh wow - that&#039;s fascinating on many levels!! 

What&#039;s been the main sources of change so far? All the traveling or other things you didn&#039;t see coming? Or is it just the &quot;unlimited budget&quot; you&#039;ve got going on? Haha... Can I be like you when I grow up??? :)]]></description>
