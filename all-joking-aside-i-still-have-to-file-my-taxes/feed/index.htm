					<description><![CDATA[For 2009 and 2010 I filed an extension and didn&#039;t file until October.  I do not plan to do that this year. We paid estimated taxes throughout the year, but my estimation was too high, so we should get something back, so yes I want my money back!  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit late on here but we got a nice fat refund check due to a new baby and my husband&#039;s nice signing bonus with his new job. They taxed his bonus a lot higher than needed and then we got most of that back. But we usually try to break even. We need splurge on a new vacuum and a pair of boots for me but the rest goes into savings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I filed a week or two ago and will get about $1600 back once they can start processing my return (hate that I filed early but have to wait!).  Last year I would&#039;ve almost broken even if you exclude the first-time homebuyer credit.  This year was my first with the mortgage, so I wasn&#039;t totally sure how much I&#039;d be getting back.  I&#039;m going to look into adjusting my withholding this year to try to come out a bit closer to even, but if it&#039;s on the fence, I&#039;d rather err on the side of paying a little too much up front and getting a refund than underestimating and having to owe next year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ideally I&#039;d like to break even.  Unfortunately we underpaid last year so we have a couple of checks to mail off to the tune of $1500.   Stinkin state nailed me with underpayment penalties on $550!  I was so surprised.  I&#039;ll be making quarterly estimates this year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll probably wait to file till the last minute too, J. And like you, I don&#039;t know exactly what I&#039;ll owe. I just know it&#039;s probably a lot. Not fun to pay taxes, no matter when you do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great story!

I haven&#039;t filed my taxes yet.  I am waiting for two 1099&#039;s still, and have been told they are in the mail.  Hopefully, I will break even and not owe money because quite frankly, I don&#039;t have it!  I did pay quarterly into my taxes for my contracting work though, so maybe that will save me.  Every other job I had they took money out.  I guess I&#039;ll find out on Saturday when I sit down to do it!]]></description>
