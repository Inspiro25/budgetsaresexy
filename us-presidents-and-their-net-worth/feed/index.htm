					<description><![CDATA[Interesting!  I bet if you take out everything *after* presidency too, that the $$ would be far far less.  But still doesn&#039;t mean they weren&#039;t raking it in :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Think it woulod be more interesting to see what they were worth when they werre elected President, rather than what they earned afterwords.  Originally found this on Foxnews, where the first sentence says that Kennedy was married to an oil heiress.  They fail to point out that she married Onassis after Kennedy was killed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it even fair to compare the current president to past ones?  Clinton wasn&#039;t worth $38 million when he left office.  Modern presidents can make a lot with books and speaking engagements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Huh! Interesting stuff.  I really would have NEVER of thought that George Wash was worth THAT much!  

I also would of thought that Obama would have been worth a whole LOT MORE!  Give him time though, I think that a few years after his presidency, his net worth will skyrocket.  First Black president, any book he writes, even if it&#039;s horrible, will be an instant money maker!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t say that wealth has nothing to do with it. I would reckon to say that all of the presidents were wealthy, even though Abe Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant had less than $1 million. Back then $500,000 would have been considered quite wealthy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ooooh never heard of ‘Founding Brothers’ before, I&#039;ll most def. be looking into that one!  The older I get, the more curious and intrigued I become on our founding fathers... I&#039;m turning into my dad every day.]]></description>
