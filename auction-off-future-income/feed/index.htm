I think it&#039;s just a matter of time until you find your sweet spot :) As soon as one of these hobbies/careers take off, you&#039;ll be good to go for many many years my friend. So keep on hustling and growing!]]></description>

$125k won&#039;t get you very far in 10 years though :) Even if I *wanted* to scam someone like that, I&#039;d be wayyyyy to bored doing nothing for 10 years and would eventually just start hustling again. Better for all parties anyways cuz the more you have both sides winning, the more you&#039;ll be successful in the future too. If this 10% worked out for the investor at $125k, imagine what you can then raise for the next ten years?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$125k is more like 50% of my income for 10 years!

If my career was relatively stable, I &#039;d jump on this in a heart-beat. I wouldn&#039;t be getting any raises in the next decade that would do be bigger than the return I would get on a year&#039;s worth of income up front. But as it stands, my career is incredibly unstable. While this year will probably be lower than last year, if I switch gears, I could wind up with as much as a 100% raise over last year&#039;s gross.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like an easy scam. You auction it to 10 people and then sit on the money, &quot;retired&quot;... This Sarah can decide to have kids and stay home, with $125K for a downpayment on a house!]]></description>

Yeah, just saw that... Don&#039;t think it really matters though - it&#039;s the *idea* behind it all that intrigues me. And I know others are/have done it before in the past anyways :)]]></description>
