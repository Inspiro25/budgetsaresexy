					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the comments/tips/legal advice/etc :)  If I ever get a call or anything from them, I&#039;ll let you know... and ofcourse behave myself again. Though I still don&#039;t think this is exactly illegal yet... For now we just enjoy everyone&#039;s creativity!

@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - I have a new passion for Mustaches actually - I&#039;m totally creating some for my fellow dead presidents ;)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... how about, OK :)
@&lt;b&gt;Scott&lt;/b&gt; - Ack! I would have loved to! Didn&#039;t get a chance to go there, but I DID get a chance to check out the Denver Mint - INCREDIBLY fascinating! So much so that I got in trouble for talking too much during the tour - I got too excited :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - Hmmm... okay, so I&#039;ll post them up on the site first, and then drop them back into circulation :)  That would do the trick, right?
@&lt;b&gt;Tino&lt;/b&gt; - That would be cool!  Never heard of the &quot;no cash in mail&quot; rule though? People do that millions of times a day - we&#039;d be in deep doo doo!
@&lt;b&gt;Elena @ Financial Security&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!!! Excited to see it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;richard @ moneygraffiti&lt;/b&gt; - I wonder how large the operations have to be until they start dabbling in shutting &#039;em down? Or maybe they&#039;ve already reached out but the organization refuses to listen?  I&#039;ll tell you this much - if I ever get a call/letter from them, you can bet your sweet ass I&#039;ll be listening to what they say :)
@&lt;b&gt;Serena @ Thrift Diving&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Great question actually - hadn&#039;t thought about that... guess I&#039;d have to then?
@&lt;b&gt;DebtKiller&lt;/b&gt; - Someone out there must be enjoying them now! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, Serena&#039;s legal mind is mind-blowing. Wish some of our bureacrats were as astute and forthcoming. I do sense a trend that some of your readers are willing to PhotoShop their dollars (no harm, no foul) and send you .jpgs; this might draw some great creative work while skirting the illegality issue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh wow...  I wish I had my collection from years ago.  When I was younger, I used to draw all kinds of things on dollar bills.  I never really saved them though.  But I definitely got some funny looks when they were used....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Um, how about you mail ME the dollar bill and then I will deface it illegally, them send it back to you in a self-addresses envelope? Lol

Asking each person for a dollar could mean you receive thousands!! Would you claim it on your taxes? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: the legality of writing on money as touched upon by Scott, Jen2, Jessica and others: 
We&#039;ve  been in contact with the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Justice asking for clear answers. So far, nothing concrete to report. Our main concern is the current Move to Amend project that&#039;s selling rubber stamps to people to imprint money as a political protest. Details on our blog at http://www.moneygraffiti.com/wordpress. If you&#039;re interested in this fascinating (to us) topic please comment. And I hope that you&#039;ll share whatever bills you do receive to show off in our galleries. Bold move, J$! - R.A.]]></description>
