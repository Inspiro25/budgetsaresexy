					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t see an option to use a credit card, I would have gladly done it that way.  I don&#039;t have a backup funding for Paypal (on purpose) so that I can&#039;t overdraft.  Any transactions I make that exceed my balance on paypal would be declined.    It is a very convenient budgeting feature for me so I can&#039;t go over if there is no money there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did use paypal which I am glad I prefer it that way.  Paypal required an echeck which means the money comes directly out of my checking account at my home bank not the balance I have on Paypal.    I just would have preferred to use my paypal account balance rather than a transfer from my bank.  I know it is all semantics but it is for budgeting purposes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The only way you can contribute money is through PayPal right now! :)  That&#039;s how you signed up to Love Drop, right?  Should have been an option to use your paypal funds, credit card, etc etc all through that PayPal button you clicked.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this and your understanding in my question.  Will it be possible in the near future to use Paypal instead of the echeck?   I look forward to the success I&#039;m sure you will have in this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Bob - THANK YOU!!! Just saw that come through, actually :)  That&#039;s a great question  because we haven&#039;t thought about how that&#039;s going to work yet. We&#039;re def. keeping track of everything, just gotta figure out how to easily alert people w/out bugging them! haha...  But it&#039;s on our list to review now, so thanks for bringing it up.

And thanks again for being one of the first Love Drop members!  Time to do some good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good idea, I did sign up but I didn&#039;t keep the auto renewal.  Is there a way to simply notify me when the renewal  is up?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hah!  Kids are funny :)  Very cool that you&#039;re teaching him lessons and donating in his honor too - I don&#039;t have wee ones yet myself, but I hope I&#039;m a good dad once the time comes...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a Wonderful Idea!  I pitched in in honor of my 6 y/o son.  He has been fixated on the possibility of a house fire recently.  I am not sure what started his concern, but we have been using the opportunity to teach some fire safety...and we have been trying to reassure him also.  The most important thing is that everyone gets out alive, but I am sure it is still very devastating to lose everything all at once!]]></description>
