					<description><![CDATA[My calendar popped up today! 

...and I&#039;d cancelled the $25 auto-transfer back in, like, February. Because my budgeting doesn&#039;t work well that way. Oh well. On the bright side, my Election Judge side hustle pulled in $550 this year, so that&#039;s somethin&#039;. 

Happy Birthday, J$! Go pick up some fire sale VTSAX to celebrate!]]></description>

I like the way you think!! 

In fact, interesting that you point out $2,000 around a worthy cause as we literally JUST gave away exactly that this month - $2,000 - to do exactly that again - worthy causes! 

We gave 20 bloggers $100 a piece to wrap up our Community Fund project over at Rockstar Finance, and these wonderful bloggers (plus a handful of others that ended up jumping in on their own accord) turned this money into over $5,000 and made a nice little splash in their communities :)

You can see the results of it here at the top of this page (look for &quot;2017 Year-End Celebration!&quot;): http://rockstarfinance.com/community-fund/

We spanned the globe from Canada to Dubai to South Africa too - all in a matter of days... Pretty amazing what lighting a little spark can do :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The $20 will amount to an awesome $240 that if you set the reminder to beginning of December instead becomes an amazing $$$ charity pool. Think then if everyone decided this would go towards a regional humanitarian project or charity that supports others in the coming holiday season. Then think out of that $240, $20 of it from each person that participated went to a B.A.S. National Charity pool administered by you. That would be $2000 that Budgets Are Sexy could put to a worthy cause. 

We need to look out for ourselves, get smarter with our money of course. But I think the very first thing we should do once we are on stable ground with our budgets and finances is to help others.]]></description>

Haha... I think out of all the problems to have that would rank high on the &quot;good&quot; ones :) Now be sure to snap a &quot;before&quot; picture so in a year we can see the &quot;after&quot;!]]></description>

Wowwwwww I like that!! And will be especially cool to see *how* you end up giving it all away at the end :) I always find doing things in-person, and on the spot, when you see someone you can help is the most thrilling... Whether it&#039;s helping them buy something or literally just giving them cash. The small acts of kindness are always more valuable than the dollar amount as it shows someone *cares* for them. Which is as beautiful as it gets :)]]></description>
