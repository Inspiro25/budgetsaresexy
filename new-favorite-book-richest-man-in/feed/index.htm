					<description><![CDATA[I am currently reading the book again and found an exchange I thought fit really well with you philosophy.  The main character Arkad is teaching some guys to be rich.  He tells them in essence to create a budget to dictate where all their money goes after saving 10%.  One guy gets up and argues saying he&#039;s allowed to enjoy the fruits of his labor...:Therefore do I rebel against the slavery of a budget which determines just how much I may spend and for what.&quot;  Arkad, being the patient sort asks the guy who would make the budget.  Compares it to the burden a mule might carry pointing out that the mule would likely pack grain and water rather than the junk he&#039;s packing on the mule all to illustrate the point that the purpose of the budget..is to assist one in meeting their needs while allowing for a person&#039;s wants within reason.  

I bought two copies, one for me and one for my oldest daughter who is about to start working in the next year.  I hoping she learns the lessons way sooner than I did. :^)]]></description>
