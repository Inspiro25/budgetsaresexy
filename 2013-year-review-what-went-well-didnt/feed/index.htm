Ouch indeed, dang! Sorry to hear, my friend... I guess in 2014 you&#039;ll have to shoot for $5k more to make up for it :) Or even better, $50k more! Hubba hubba!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel ya on the car trouble. I broke down in the middle of the 405 freeway this year at rush hour traffic...5k later...ouch! But..I did make 25k more this past year than the year before! But...it&#039;s still a fairly tough income to live on in LA. Overall though, MUCH better year than the year before.]]></description>

There you go! I found a similar thing happened with me and starting this blog too - once I decided to spend time on it vs going shopping every week I magically saved lots of money :)

Happy holidays, my friend.]]></description>

Cheers man. It was actually surprisingly easy, I just decided to stop one day and then kind of stopped. The main thing for me wasn&#039;t the money it was the amount of time I would spend on the computer doing it. I&#039;ve now replaced that with much more productive endeavours such as reading your fine blog!]]></description>

Sounds like a fine plan, my man :) Good work on the gambling part too - I can only imagine how hard that is to break!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made as much as I wanted to this year - but I didn&#039;t save as much as I wanted to.  I cut down my eating out expenses, but I didn&#039;t save the money because I just spent it on other things. OH WELL c&#039;est la vie.  I had a fun year and I&#039;m looking forward to 2014!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like overall a good year J!

For me, good:
Got married and had an awesome honeymoon.
Got a pay rise.
Started a blog
Quit gambling(!!!)

Bad:
Worked far too much
Felt quite stressed throughout most of the year

I guess you could say that overall it was a pretty freaking good year! If hard work is the greatest of my worries then I should be extremely greatful (and I am, of course)
Next year I&#039;m gonna focus on working less, which I think I can pull off, which should in turn make me less stressed hopefully!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been a great year! Had a wedding, bought a new car, started a new higher paying job, and bought a house! Only thing I could say is that I wish it was a bit more spaced out! Haha. Our net worth has gone up a bit but of course not as much as I would have liked!]]></description>
