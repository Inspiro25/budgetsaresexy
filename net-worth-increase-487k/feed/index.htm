I went through the whole process of picking your model and year and all that to see what the current value of my car was, and then once I got on that page I saw some button that said &quot;have these emailed to you&quot; or something of that effect. Now I get a cple emails a month with updates (I thought it was only once but I guess I was wrong!) and all the same info is saved in it.... though prob good to update the mileage part every now and then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now how did you get the monthly email from KBB? I cannot for the life of me figure it out! I would rather use NADA as that&#039;s what our local dealers typically use, but hey I&#039;m all about automation.]]></description>

I literally put every dollar of all my investment accounts into VTSAX - one of Vanguard&#039;s index funds. You can see why here: https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2014/06/lazy-one-fund-investing-strategy/

I used to play around with it all and try to do all kinds of strategies, and then I realized the more simpler - streamlined - way was best for me and my comfort levels. I don&#039;t need to out perform everyone and their mother, I just want to be good overall and get an average return. And of course not have to think about it or second guess all the time :) It&#039;s easy peasy now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My goodness, sir. Well done #jealous. Seriously, it seems like you&#039;re bustin&#039; ass to boost that net worth over the past year, so hats off to you. You may have said this in an earlier post so forgive me, but how do you typically allocate your investments in your IRAs?]]></description>

It&#039;s all just dropped in a savings account. Being self-employed where money fluctuates a lot, I need/want super flexibility to pull from anytime I need to, so I just save it all there and not worry about the pennies of interest I&#039;m missing out on ;) I think for those who have more of a steady income or different ways to cushion an emergency more, it&#039;s financially better to put it somewhere else to help grow more. Like a CD, etc. Just depends on your comfort levels and *what* the money is set up to do. I know some people who are saving for a house or other longer-term goals where they&#039;ll even invest it all for 4-5 years before taking it out. Our comfort levels play a huge part :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J$...
Quick question for you...where do you keep your cash?  I see you have over $20k in cash.  You may have it somewhere, but I couldn&#039;t find it.  So, if I&#039;m blind and missed it....I apologize.  What&#039;s your opinion on cash?  We&#039;ve got a good bit in the bank in a savings account to just have it handy, but are making nada on it.  I am thinking about moving it to a Vanguard account.  Thoughts?  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks like you are making awesome progress to $1M.  The amazing thing is with compound returns is that it will go exponential faster as your IRA&#039;s continue to compound.  Best of luck!]]></description>
