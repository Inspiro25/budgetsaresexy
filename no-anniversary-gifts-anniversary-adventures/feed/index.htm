					<description><![CDATA[As we were planning our wedding we made the decision that we would NOT stress over everything the day of. The day before we would bring everything down to the hotel to store for the next day and have the rehearsal and dinner. Once everything was at the hotel, that was it. That was the point where if it wasn&#039;t done, it wasn&#039;t getting done and we weren&#039;t going to worry about it.

Well, I secretly scheduled an appointment at the hotel spa to have a couple&#039;s mineral bath (think hot tub sort of bath) followed by an hour couple&#039;s massage to end right before the rehearsal dinner. So we ran around like crazy the week before and had a crazy day getting everything down to the hotel where we were getting married. Then we went down to the spa and had this absolutely wonderful, relaxing afternoon with just the two of us and a couple of glasses of wine. It was so nice to have that transition from crazy planning to just enjoying it all.

Since we enjoyed it so much and it was where our wedding was, we decided that we should go back each year, have another spa afternoon, go to the restaurant for dinner, and then go up to the martini lounge to finish out the night. We also really enjoyed our honeymoon and would love to go back there (St. Lucia) for some of the &quot;big&quot; anniversaries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Barb Friedberg ...but do your cubic zirconium have screwback posts? I never have to take mine out or worry about them falling out. I even sleep in my diamonds. After I lost a tanzanite earring from Mr. SF on an escalator, I did not want to run the risk of losing something precious again. .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I read ya loud and clear! :)  I agree we gotta live it up every now and then and enjoy life NOW, while at the same time saving for later too.  I don&#039;t think drastically saving or drastically spending is good for anyone.  Gotta find that nice balance and prioritize depending on what&#039;s most important to you in life.  If seeing the world is, great!  Get it in when you can, and cut down in the areas you don&#039;t care as much for.  It doesn&#039;t matter what you&#039;re spending your money on, as long as you&#039;re cool with it and it follows along your game plan. And for us, trips are currently our favorites :)
@&lt;b&gt;Super Frugalette&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahahha... a woman who know what she wants!  I love it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For my 5th anniversary, I received diamond earrings...I know I should have oohed and ahhed...but I looked at the cut, color, setting and the price tag. My husband had been hoodwinked. I took back the $600 1/4 karat earrings (H, I2) set in platinum and replaced them with 1/3 karat E color martini set, white gold screw back earrings I got on Amazon for $400.

I have worn them every day since...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy anniversary!

I like the idea of going some place instead of just doing gifts, but it depends on the people in the relationship - some people like gifts better.

I&#039;m with you on spending some money now instead of saving it all for when you&#039;re 65.  Saving all that money for you and your spouse to spend in 40 years is great - if you&#039;re both going to be around.  But there are no guarantees in life.  Hubby and I have sometimes spent money on trips, even though it could have been more wisely spent on paying off debt.  Why?  Because we want to have fun along the way.  We don&#039;t want to get to 40/50/60 and say, &#039;Wow, I&#039;m so glad we didn&#039;t ever go on any trips&#039;.  Or, if (God-forbid) something happens to one of us, I don&#039;t think it would be great to be the spouse left behind and sitting there thinking &#039;Well, I&#039;m so glad we never did anything together&#039;.  Now, I know there has to be some balance and there are free things to do and what-not.  But sometimes, a trip out of town is really worth the money spent.  (Sorry, J, I hope that wasn&#039;t a downer for your anniversary - the point I was trying to make is that I think it&#039;s great you&#039;re taking some time and spending a bit of money to go on trips together.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on 3 years! We just celebrated 12 days :) hehe. That&#039;s actually a great idea, to go on trips instead of gifts. We &quot;Santa Claus&quot; each other throughout the year, so anniversary gifts are way too predictable. Looks like I have to not only plan a honeymoon, but our first anniversary trip too lol]]></description>
