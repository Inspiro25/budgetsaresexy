					<description><![CDATA[Life advice: I have a credit score of 200. you can easily rent an apartment in cash. Most places if you have the first two months rent they dont care. If you know you&#039;ll always be poor screw the credit score because you&#039;ll never afford a house or get a loan. You can make thousands from banks and other places if you don&#039;t give a crap about credit]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right. Landlords always check credit for rent payment history when they dont even report payments to credit companies themselves.so its harder for good credit to show up unless its something involving a funder of the bureaus. And recently equifax and transunion were sued for lying to customers. I have had good credit items removed from my reports, such as completed car payments, and they never make it clear how they determine credit scores. They are funded by banks and credit card companies so its mandatory for ppl to participate in loans in order to have a good credit score, forcing ppl into their system. Ppl are always told when they do this, their scores will become better. Some loan places even say they will report to the credit companies whenever the person uses their service, to improve credit. They just assume all Americans want to live their lives that way. I dont even use bank accounts. I get tired of them trying to force their ways of living onto ppl, then everyone finds out theyre scamming n lying to everyone  of course.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have never taken a loan on credit I&#039;m 36, hopefully I never will. I have honestly never bothered with my credit score, lets be honest as human beings materialism is an in built mechanism. The more we fight against it the more we want of the opposite, sometimes the best route is to completely avoid the loan route. You want something bad? Work for it, don&#039;t be in debt!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gosh, the US are really a crap place. How messed up a society has to be where a person is judged by how much debit he can produce??? Shouldn&#039;t it be (and it is, in normal countries) that you are judged by how NOT in debt you are? If you&#039;ve always lived within your means then you are reliable, while if you haven&#039;t (needing a credit card means you haven&#039;t got the cash to pay with a debit card) you aren&#039;t. While in the US evidently it is the contrary. I&#039;m not surprised at all. It was you people who cased the financial crisis after all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question. I&#039;m just starting to build credit, so am new to this whole idea. I am definitely hesitant about credit, so I started researching why credit history is even necessary. I have read that having a good credit score saves you money when needing to purchase insurance of any kind. I get the concept of paying for a car/house in cash, paying 6 mo. up front in rent, etc. as a way to get around the zero credit dilemna. But how has that affected those of you with no credit when needing to purchase car insurance, renters/homeowners insurance, etc. now that you&#039;ve bought that car/house? Or do you just put up with the higher insurance fee rates &#038; consider it a fair trade off to being credit free?]]></description>

Rock on man - way to get out from under the madness! All this debt is considered so &quot;normal&quot; these days that most people don&#039;t even second guess. Everyone they know has some too so what&#039;s the big deal right? Crazy world we&#039;re in... mortgages suck balls too, I hate sending a payment every month knowing the bulk of it is all going to interest only, ugh... but that&#039;s what I get for not having figured out the $$ game back then. Good way to learn at least :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are pros and cons just as mentioned for having a credit score or not. 

The MAIN reason they invented this crap in the first place (credit) and it has just got out of control is to get people so under debt you are paying for it for most if not the rest of your life.

Seriously why would they NOT want you to pay interest over that long of a term, you are making the banks huge sums of cash. Mortgages, credit cards etc etc, and they make them always JUST out of reach of MOST people so they have to lend the money. 

The economy would actually be a lot better if banks were not in such control of things and people would be a lot better off. The only way to make this happen though is if people stop relying on the credit system so much (I have) and never felt so much relief never having to worry about any repayments (apart from rent) coming out all the time, best thing I&#039;ve ever done and I actually have MORE assets now than ever after getting out of debt and stop paying interest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We own our home and cars outright and never plan to use debt again. We don&#039;t need credit cards for emergencies since we have savings. We don&#039;t know what our credit score is because we will never need it. I&#039;ve chased FICO and payments and this way of living is much better :)]]></description>
