					<description><![CDATA[Love the net worth of your two babies, baby nickel, and baby penny. I&#039;ve done the same thing to my kids and got them started early. The times when they do not know much about money is the best time. I remember my wife opening up a joint bank account with our two kids and start initially with money gifts from relatives. They really add up big time. They&#039;re both done with college now and they&#039;ve taken over their accounts and it&#039;s great to see how they start growing their net worth now themselves. Good job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My family just crossed the 100k mark in net worth in cash and investments (not including assets). Since following your blog and a couple others that we discovered a couple months ago, we have increased our savings rate dramatically. We are now putting $2,250 per month in my husband&#039;s 457, $320 per month in his 403b, and $1,600 per month in my 401k. We are trying to catch up for this year so we can max the 457 and 401k. Thanks for all your inspiration!]]></description>

I think I&#039;ve said it before.  The only thing I ever hear older people say they regret is not having more kids.  I have 4 boys and will not be saying that, I can honestly say I&#039;m good now.  I just didn&#039;t want there to be a twinge of regret.  If it helps at all, with our 3rd child we barely skipped a beat.  Was like 0% extra work, but every child is different, with our 4th, he made up for how easy our third was and then added on top of that.

I know people talk about how expensive kids are and all that but I would say to them, do you really want finances to dictate how you live your authentic human life?  I mean isn&#039;t that really the reason we are all here, its not really to find a budget, it goes beyond that, its because we want something more than this world tells us we can have.  If someone wants 0 kids or 6 kids I think they should go for it without considering how much money they have in the bank.  Because money (while it is a necessary tool in our society) is not nearly as important as living fulfilled (whatever that means to you).  In short, the biological window for having kids is short, kids are as expensive or as cheap as you make them, and money while important to live in our society has no business dictating to you how many kids you can have or want to have. My 2 cents...]]></description>
