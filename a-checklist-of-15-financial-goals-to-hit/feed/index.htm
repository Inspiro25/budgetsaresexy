Good! And it seems like you&#039;re doing much better than others in the world, so try hard not to be too down on yourself with things :) I mean, after all you ARE on a $$$ blog right now like a true champ! Haha... (and I say that while literally drinking a glass of wine right now which makes your comment even more interesting to me, haha...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over 40? Is that age, IQ or waist size? My bday is soon &#038; I think my IQ is catching up with my age. I&#039;m 94 &#038; scored a perfect 15 which means I have no life. Just kidding. I scored a 10 so it looks like I still have some work to do so I&#039;ll get right on it after I get home from the bar tonight, LOL biggest downfall, car loan. Couldn&#039;t resist 0% financing even though we have the cash in the bank to pay it off anytime. Also have a big fat mortgage but paying extra principal each month that will almost cut the term in 1/2. We max out our IRA&#039;s &#038; automate all fixed bills. As you said, we don&#039;t budget every penny but have a good handle on how much is in our budget for various things like groceries, gas, &#038; necessities like beer &#038; wine (LOL just kidding). We cut the cable cord years ago &#038; our cellphone plan is cheap too. Love Credit Karma to keep up with credit scores plus I just filed our taxes for free using it. This list gives me some ideas of other things to work on. Thanx!]]></description>

I was revisiting this post from last month and just realized that you replied again! I&#039;m sorry for not reverting sooner.

We posted about balancing account types a couple weeks ago, so I hope it&#039;s useful.

Also, I know we connected via email the other week about comment notifications (your response &quot;it&#039;s me - not you&quot; cracked me up), but I&#039;ll let you know if I come across any good solutions / plugins.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a good list. I have a five year plan, but it has a lot of contingencies for things shifting. Very soon I will have that mega Emergency Fund and no credit card debt. It&#039;s going to definitely reduce anxiety around money.]]></description>

That would be nice! Most bloggers who start blogs for *passion* first are always much more successful later monetizing it than those who just start up blogs for the $$$ :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m getting close to 40 and scored a 13.5.  I&#039;m the same like you about automating bills where I automate bills where the amount is the same like our internet and others I check manually like our credit cards where I want to see how we spend during the month.
The other one I failed on is earning extra income.  I started to look into monetizing my blog so hopefully I can start earning that extra income.]]></description>
