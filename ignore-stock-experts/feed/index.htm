					<description><![CDATA[You ask if I agree with you &#038; on what. It doesn&#039;t matter. I agree with myself &#038; feel good. You seem to agree with yourself too. That is great. By the way...

Sure, I&#039;ll agree to most of that. Always good to keep an open mind and challenge your ideas/strategies/etc over time. The important part is to make decisions off of facts/game plan vs emotion. And usually the media and &quot;experts&quot; amp up the emotional side of things more often than the opposite.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At this young age, it is easy to view the 10 years of investing as long but essentially, you might only see a good side of the market. There are toxic people but there are also the toxic self who ignores others, doesn&#039;t take in information and reflect in the unbias manner. 

We have to be humble enough to acknowledge that at times you have missed something out. this is harder when you have just made 1 mil in networth or successful because your method work, without realizing that you may be at the right place at the right time.

The game is not over yet. There is still 30 years of life left. There are some commentators that talk about asset allocation in value approach with quantitative results to backed it up. Sometimes to guard against confirmation bias is to listen to people that you generally disagree with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There have been only two people that I have listen to. Mom who never made it through high school. There was a war going on and she worked in the ship yard at 16. And Bob Brinker..
Started at 22 investing in mutual fund and at 55 retired with 1.5 million.  But live on 35,000 a year.  Paid cash for everything. If I die today I can say I live a good life and would live it just the way I did and do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If nothing else, when we get a small correction (yes this drop is still small), I scour my budget looking fora few extra bucks to throw into my retirement account. Nothing like a flash sale on my favorite stocks to get me excited about investing again! It&#039;s all about perspective. Do you still feel as good about those companies today as you did 2 weeks ago? If so,  pull the trigger on some more!]]></description>

I&#039;ll do that too if I&#039;m in the car usually - just cuz it&#039;s better than commercials and for some reason I like the news better in the car than on the TV? Maybe cuz it feels like you&#039;re being productive while getting from A to B?]]></description>
