					<description><![CDATA[yeah, probably the latter.  that&#039;s the only sucky part about all this new online technology and what not - if any of those big places gets hacked, so can all of our cards they have on file :(  but at least security measures are also getting better over time too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fraud protection is something the credit card companies usually do pretty well. The few times this has happened to us the company has called us before we got our bill. Which is definitely a good thing for them and us. Not sure how they got our CC numbers, but it wasn&#039;t from stolen or lost cards so either they tried a random number and got lucky, or somehow stole the numbers from a merchant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Proud of y&#039;all for staying on top of all this too!  It&#039;s great everyone&#039;s so on top of it, well done :)

@&lt;b&gt;Rich Uncle EL&lt;/b&gt; - You can still get banking products through USAA even w/out military connections, you should call them :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica, The Debt Princess&lt;/b&gt; - Woahh I&#039;ve never seen that one happening before!  Freaky.  I ALWAYS always ALWAYS ask for receipts when paying w/ credit card, and then I just throw them all into one of my drawers.  Ya never know when you need to prove something later on, it sucks.
@&lt;b&gt;Jessi @ PracticallyFunctional&lt;/b&gt; - Credit report? Ahahahahha... now THAT is funnny.  Wow, good story!
@&lt;b&gt;Ryan&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s pretty funny that they caught the Texas charge pretty fast, but not the Paris one ;)  At least they got it all cleared up though!
@&lt;b&gt;Ash (in US)&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  What &lt;b&gt;Big Reg&lt;/b&gt; said :) (Thx Big Reg!)
@&lt;b&gt;From Shopping to Saving&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ve been using them for over 10 years now and haven&#039;t looked back since.  Sometimes it&#039;s annoying if you come into too much cash and you want it to put into your checking account (although, also a GOOD problem to have! haha...) but other than that it&#039;s awesome.  Plan on using them for many many more years to come :)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool! I&#039;ve heard of that notifier system thingie, but haven&#039;t set any up yet, other than when something funky is going on.  I like that a lot though - esp when we&#039;re talking in the higher numbers out there.  Go USAA!
@&lt;b&gt;MoneySmartGuides&lt;/b&gt; - YUP! Exactly. You will 99.9% become a victim at some point, just a part of life :( People are assholes sometimes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great point about when you become a victim. The odds are you will, regardless of how much protection you use. The solution is to look over your monthly bills and keep an eye out for anything fishy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah USAA!!! Love them. I have mine set up to send me an email when a charge exceeds a certain amount I&#039;ve designated. They&#039;ve called or notified me when a charge seems odd or out of my normal travel areas. I&#039;m really happy with their service and watchful eye.

I&#039;m lucky, as a military offspring, that I can use all their services (insurance, credit card, investments, etc.). They are a superior customer service organization, and as a non-profit association, I usually get a small rebate back on my insurance each year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ooooh I think I better start using my USAA accounts. I have them but I rarely touch it. I only use it if I need to pull cash out of a random ATM. I check my Chase statements all the time since I have both my checking and 2 credit cards with them so it makes it easy to check them all at once.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes Non military can open accounts with USAA. Bank accounts, investments, credit cards, etc.... You do however have to have a military affiliation (either yourself, parents, spouse, etc) to have Insurance with them...what they call P&#038;C eligible. If you&#039;re not eligible for insurance there are some other &quot;features&quot; you won&#039;t be able to utilize, like making deposits with your smart phone....STILL one of the best deals in the biz, in my opinion.]]></description>
