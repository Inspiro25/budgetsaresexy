					<description><![CDATA[A great thing about buying online is they take things back for almost any excuse in the book, no questions asked. In fact, one company Jack threads will even send you stuff to try before you buy. They&#039;re making too easy!]]></description>

That&#039;s my ideal situation too! Find the right sizes/brands and then just keep re-ordering as time goes on, love it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To get the right size and save money, I buy all my tennis shoes online.  I order from the same manufacturer every time and I know they will fit.  

I  wait until they are on sale for 1/2 off, then buy several pairs for the next year or two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a big fan of buying online. I really enjoy a particular Banana Republic shirt. Its a non-iron button up. It fits me well. Whenever I need a new one I wait for a sale and buy it online. I know the sizing works for me so its just down to a decision on the style/pattern. Makes it pretty easy to buy new clothes and still save money with a sale.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish there was a good online store for men&#039;s gently used clothes that don&#039;t look like they are from the 70s. Women and children have plenty of good options. Men, not so much.]]></description>

Totally. That&#039;s my goal - to find brands I just love the $hit out of and keep ordering over and over from them... At least that&#039;s how I see it happening in my head :)]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard about that one before! They&#039;ve been around for years, right? Will have to start poking around them all as I find my stride here... so much to learn but kinda fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I buy about half my clothes online and have been doing so for years. I&#039;d say the key is to find brands with consistent sizes, and then order stuff from that brand (the sizes that you already know will fit you). Ordering new brands or brands you haven&#039;t previously worn is more risky, since the clothes may not fit you well. Although Amazon will let you return stuff that does not fit you, there are anecdotal reports on the internet of people getting banned from Amazon for life for too many returns. For that reason, I try to limit my Amazon returns.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been buying some stuff on amazon lately, but I stick to the standard brands that I&#039;d find in a B&#038;M store here.  And sold by amazon, since returns are way easier than the rando brand-x made &#038; shipped from china stuff my wife ends up getting herself.

Something I didn&#039;t see mentioned was CamelCamelCamel.... I haven&#039;t started using it, but I might need to so I can stock up when something I like gets near a historical/recent low price.]]></description>
