One more thought on the happiness video with the rats. Lily Tomlin has a quote, something like: &quot;Even if you win the rat race, you&#039;re still a rat.&quot; 

That&#039;s why for me personally, it just feels more intentional to say that I dropped out of the rat race, rather than &#039;retired&#039; from the rat race. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG! So weird that you included that Steve Cutts video! I stumbled upon him myself just a few days ago! I looooove his stuff. I like the &#039;Happiness&#039; video, but I also like one called &#039;Man&#039; (link below), which, in line with this post, is exactly what is happening to the world when capitalism gets out of control. Like you said, we are emotional beings and we need things like nature and functioning eco-systems for true happiness. It is not just that we &#039;want&#039; to be around nature, but rather it is an innate, primal need. We can&#039;t just turn all of our natural resources into &#039;stuff&#039; to sell. As I&#039;ve said before, achieving financial prosperity is easy, but achieving primal prosperity in a capitalist driven world is much harder these days. 

As always, J, you are spot on with your insights! :)

&quot;Sometimes I back-fill the logic of why I did something after I emotionally chose to do it.&quot; Powerful thought right there. I certainly have done this in the past; something to keep an eye on in the future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went along with everything until the writer made the comment &quot;we are just raising lambs for slaughter!&quot;  The message then seemed to bend towards an extremist view - which in my opinion is &quot;not&quot; a true reflection of life - I think a good life is about balance, a blend of numerical and literary skills are essential in all aspects of life.  Think what a world would be like if people only spoke numbers.

Me:  Hi, how are you?
You:  4, 5, 1456/56...293983556
Me:  How lovely.
