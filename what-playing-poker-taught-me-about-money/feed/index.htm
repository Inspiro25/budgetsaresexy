					<description><![CDATA[Nice job there. I applaud you for stressing out about being healthy and loving your money. To me as money can exhausting as playing poker itself, I strictly follow my restrictions. After all, I don&#039;t like to be accountable over missing my other family responsibility especially if poker was the main reason for it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved this article. I don&#039;t know the math behind poker...yet.  But I love the game and feel the same way about poker being described as &quot;gambling&quot; by the same people who live paycheck to paycheck. Too me that seems like the gamble. My wife and I went through Dave Ramsey&#039;s Financial Peace University right before we got married 10 years ago. Best decision we ever made. The things you talked about here are already second nature to us, and a topic of conversation and encouragement when discussing with other people who make smart financial decisions.  Thanks again for writing this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Schooling in ECONOMICS and SMALL BUSINESS / RISK REWARD etc. can teach students theories in book form. 
“True hands on experience is more valuable”
Children learn instantly that touching a hot stove hurts. You can tell them a million times, “Don’t touch the stove when it’s hot bc...” Yeah, yeah, yeah. BUT WHEN THEY FEEL THE BURN!
Same here. When you’re risking your own money, delegating how best to use your time and effort, balancing how and what to do with the profits (bankroll), planning your attack and then ATTACKING YOUR PLAN - valuable life lessons that you don’t learn without doing. Poker allows for the doing on your terms. Being a college student leaves your schedule in shambles, so running a business (even a candy store) is impossible. Poker has its time and place. 
Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this story. As a professional poker player myself I can tell right away that this guy knows what he is talking about. Awesome job paying for school with this game as well. Most people lose at poker in the long run.

I really can&#039;t say enough about just how complex/hard the game has become. 

There is no stake/limit in online poker now a newer player could survive at over any decent sample size of hands (e.g. even limits like .01/.02 have &quot;regs&quot; that know enough about the game that make it somewhat difficult to ascertain high enough win rates to make grinding worth your time). 

The widespread availability of information on optimal playing theory (even if incorrectly implemented by poorer players) has made becoming a long-term winner extremely difficult without hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of learning/practicing/critiquing and repeating ad nauseam. It&#039;s though to play online nowadays.]]></description>
