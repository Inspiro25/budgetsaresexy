I always pictured you as a young 30-40 guy, Steve. You&#039;ve been married for 42 years!!??  No wonder you spit out such mature and sound advice!

Congrats on a long and successful marriage. And thanks for proving that mega expensive gifts aren&#039;t needed when wooing your life partner :)]]></description>

Great story Adam, and very similar! Send me a pic of that ruby! It sounds cool!

When the ring makers set my wife&#039;s stone, they said that there&#039;s a good chance it will fracture or break in the first year or so (when you hold the stone up to the light it has many cracks and fractures visible in it). But it&#039;s been 7 years and it&#039;s still going strong! I&#039;m waiting for it to break any day because my wife is clumsy also, but so far so good! haha. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right on -- nothing like making the stone happen with your own two hands! When I was eleven I took a gemstone grinding class at a local science center (man I miss those summer classes); I came out of it with a large gorgeous polished opal. Wish I knew where that thing ended up. 

My wife definitely did not want a diamond, so I worked with someone in Idaho to find a .8 carat ruby and then had a local guy design and cast a platinum setting (she is clumsy and bakes a lot; it took some doing to craft something sturdy that looks good). The metals market today is far removed from what it was eleven years ago; at the time a platinum engagement ring with matching palladium wedding bands made great sense, but today&#039;s palladium prices are crazy. It&#039;s pretty fantastic that fate found you someone to design the setting!]]></description>

My wife doesn&#039;t know this yet (and I don&#039;t think she reads these comments haha!) but I&#039;m planning to use the remaining small yogo stones to make 10, 20, 30+ year anniversary gifts throughout our life. Doesn&#039;t have to be jewelry - I can try sicking them into any home made gift somehow :)  Something fun to figure out!]]></description>

That&#039;s so cool! There&#039;s really cool places around the world to go pearl hunting too if people want to turn the ring making into a travel activity!]]></description>
