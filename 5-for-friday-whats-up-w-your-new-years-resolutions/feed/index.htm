					<description><![CDATA[1) a. Pay off consumer debt. b. increase TFSA and savings.
2) Yes indeed.  Start planning for retirement...first, where to live.
3)  YAHOO!  As of Friday, we will be consumer debt free........from 26K 2 years ago to 0$  I can&#039;t freakin&#039; believe it!  Of course, I also can&#039;t believe how stupid stupid stupid we were.  Stupid.  
4)  We worked unbelievably hard to achieve this - we haven&#039;t eaten out once (at our expense) in 2 years; have had staycations exclusively (I just spent 2 weeks playing in the dirt in my garden); have not gone to a movie; sold lots of crap; found a little extra income; took every possible financial hint and at least tried them once (with varying degrees of success); became a once-a-week fixture at the local library instead of Chapters - and have read well over 5 books a week etc. etc.
5) Iincrease the mortgage payments.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been doing this for 4 years. I do set parameters or minigoals under the word, kind of define how the word applies to career, personal stuff, etc...  Some years are better than others. I put the word all around me. I have made vinyl versions of the word or definition and put that on my wall. It is in my signature on a couple forums I visit daily. This year, I made a book of quotes. (I am a crafter, which I how I got the idea in the first place) previous words:
Accomplish
Communicate
Create
This is by far my best year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Walnut&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, every now and then I think about just knocking off a ton of it in one  big shot, but I still feel more comfortable w/ it all in savings/money markets :)  I could start diverting a little into it&#039;s own &quot;mortgage&quot; fund though...
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well that&#039;s good!  In both areas of your life ;)  SO GOOD you are already at 9%, you&#039;ll def. go over 10 at this rate!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Having no c/c debt will be HUGE.  Goood job killing that, now time to use that money toward your newest goals :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - I hate mortgages, so anyone who&#039;s working on knocking it down has my utmost respect! Haha... it&#039;s the only area I still struggle with, but I&#039;m getting there ;)  Congrats on sticking with your goals so far!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - I LOVE the school one!  Really really smart, good job.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Do you have 12 rooms?? Haha...  I like that one though, anything having to do w/ minimalism is a friend of mine ;)  And I think cleaning def. goes in there.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, yeah that&#039;s a lot of things to check off every day.  Pretty impressive if you&#039;re sticking to it!  Have you ever read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401309704/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=budgetsaresexy1-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399369&#038;creativeASIN=1401309704&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Power of Less&lt;/a&gt; by Leo Babauta?  If not, I think you&#039;ll like it.  He says to break it down into small steps too, only concentrate on one for a while until you master it, then add on another, and another, etc.  It&#039;s worth the read :)
@&lt;b&gt;AH&lt;/b&gt; - Your husband is beating you??? Hah!  That is something! I am always sooooo slow at thank you&#039;s, esp my wedding ones ;)  AWESOME about the books!  I admire big readers -- I&#039;ve only done well with magazines lately. (though, they are financial ones so at least I&#039;m learning a lot :))
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch, yeah I bet :(  What kind of online biz do you have?  I love learning about new ones.
@&lt;b&gt;The Tin Man&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yup that still counts :)  Good luck on that replenishing! (I won&#039;t make any jokes about the gf, my wife may be reading!)
@&lt;b&gt;rainbowfish&lt;/b&gt; - Oh that&#039;s kinda cool, I like that.  What were some of your previous words you&#039;ve concentrated on?  Finance?  Career?  I like this way of doings :)  Though kinda hard to measure, unless you&#039;re *good* at following it (which it seems you are).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. I don&#039;t make resolutions anymore, I pick a word that encompasses several goals I want to work toward. This year&#039;s word: Healthy
2. I will work on this all year, and beyond. Healthy Mind: not worrying about things I can&#039;t change, being in control of my life (money, work, etc...), Healthy Body: lose weight, get in exercise, take care of myself, Healthy Spirit: travel more, relax more, enjoy life, find peace
3. I have made lots of progress in all areas, lost weight, gone on vacation, saved some money, spent time for myself, etc... 
4. I think about the goals several times a week. I have reminders in my house to help me be aware of my goals. 
5. Not adding a goal as the above covers so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Get my car title by my birthday.
2. New.
3. Car paid off June 30.  Birthday is July 24.  Title expected in 1-2 weeks.  YES!!!!
4. I didn&#039;t go super out of my way.  I could have done better to lower expenses, though the girlfriend makes that tricky!.  I had to drain my savings to hit the goal instead of cash-flowing it.  Still counts.
5. I guess my new goal is to replenish my savings.  And move out of my current apartment at the end of August with fewer things than I moved in with.  And that &quot;exercise consistently&quot; thing.
6. Yes sir!]]></description>
