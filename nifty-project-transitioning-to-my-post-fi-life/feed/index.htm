					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/nifty-project-transitioning-to-my-post-fi-life/#comment-364599&quot;&gt;Cynthia&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Cynthia, appreciate you reading the long post! I have not checked out the book, &quot;Start with Why&quot;, but it looks like a good one and will put that on my list. Thank you.

My husband did his personal values assessment on this site: https://personalvalu.es/ and I plan on doing that this month to see if it helps me with narrowing down what drives meaning for me. Let me know how your exercises went with your friend. I have found having an accountability partner really helps me and makes the process for fun and am more likely to stick to it. 

One other book I recommend is &quot;The Second Mountain&quot; by David Brooks. This book had a big mental shift for me that helped put this all into perspective. I was crying like a baby through half of it, as it touched a deep nerve and I could relate to what he was describing. 

Congrats for already looking at this stuff, it is what matters most. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;b. Value Statement: I am trying to figure out what is important to me. I have not spent any time really digging into what I value and how I want to prioritize my time and energy. Any resources you know of to help with this?&quot;

Have you checked out &quot;Start With Why&quot; by Simon Sinek? (TED Talk, book, website, etc)

I really relate to your story and feel like I will find myself on a similar journey when I reach FI. After the holidays, I&#039;m going to sit down with a friend and go over the exercises set out by Simon Sinek et al. in the books Start With Why and Find Your Why. If nothing else, it will be a unique experience for my friend and I. And best case scenario, it creates a guide for building a life true to my values in FI. 

Thanks for sharing your experiences!]]></description>

Self exploration is very underrated and such an important part for transitioning away from work. Glad you found a good balance Steve - I enjoy reading about your mix of work and life :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s my life now.  I figured it out before I retired so I never went through that self exploration phase Jen did.  But I&#039;m an older guy so I had a lot more time than her already to get to know myself.  Its a great life if you design it to give you purpose and to match your values.]]></description>
