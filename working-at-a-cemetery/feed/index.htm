					<description><![CDATA[To Jessy, 

You are right! I have had some customers go WILD making their own headstone! It is amazing to see!! 

The same often holds true with funeral plans. Some go over the top and others are incredibly frugal and simple. Either way they get what they really want. 

Thanks for the response!
Fern

Ps. J$, sorry it took me so long to respond. Just today it occurred to me that I needed to go to your website instead of just checking emails! Call me techy challenged!! Fern]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi guys, one point regarding getting buried in your back yard... that detail would need to be disclosed at the time of resale and could certainly freak people out! Unless you want to keep your property in the family forever, it&#039;s something to think about.

The vaults, even though not biodegrable, keep serious boo boos from happening to the ground and surrounding area. 

Thank you much,
Fern]]></description>

I love the idea of being buried in your own back yard - if you have an estate or something that&#039;ll be passed down through generations... Would be pretty freaky if the house got turned over though for the new owners, haha... (and wonder if they&#039;d still let family members come visit still?! &quot;My dad is in your back yard - I need to see him!!&quot;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We haven&#039;t booked our stays at the cemetery yet.  I guess I could visit the one closest to us to ask for referrals, but I hear the regulars are real stiffs.  OHHHHH... bet you haven&#039;t heard that one before ;-) I&#039;m thinking that I just want to be buried in our woods.  Put me in a pine box, or just lay me in the ground... no fancy metal canisters for me.  How many hundreds of years do those things take to break down anyway? Cremation might be a good option too, because my wife and kids (hopefully they outlive me) can take me to a really cool place one last time and celebrate my trip &#039;back to the earth.&#039;]]></description>

Oh 100%!! That&#039;s awesome!! And totally makes sense about setting all the cemetery stuff up if you already have a family plot like that... I love multi-generational burial grounds... You don&#039;t see them too often in modern times but back in the 19th and 18th century you did! So beautiful.]]></description>

Unless you put it in your will!! :) Then she&#039;ll have to do as you please! Haha... But if you don&#039;t really care either way, then yeah - money and freedom it is...]]></description>

That&#039;s a beautiful idea too :) It&#039;s very true it costs a lot of money to die the old fashioned way... I&#039;m hoping I leave mine with plenty of $$$$ to inherit later, but if money does become tight then I&#039;ll probably change my tune too... Or maybe get cremated and then buried? I think I&#039;ll still want a tombstone at least for people to come find me and say hi :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My parent&#039;s marker is in the same cemetery as their parents and many other ancestors...except my parents are 66 and very much alive! When they retired they got all their affairs in order--estate plan if they don&#039;t spend it all before they die (sell all the land and divide it equally among the siblings so there is zero fighting we can do over selling/renting/buying each other&#039;s land), funeral directives, plot bought, marker made and placed on the spot of their eventual graves. It was disconcerting seeing it a few yards away as we stood at my grandma&#039;s grave, but what a relief to know so much as been taken care of. My mom also explained which of her jewelry was real/valuable. Before they go on international trips, they remind us where their important documents are stored. I think their preparedness is part reaction to one of their parent&#039;s dying young (42) so they know life is short and part from dealing with the funerals/estates of their parents. I know I will be thankful someday for all the work they did now to prepare.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Daaaaang.  I spent less than $100 on my wedding.  Sounds like dying is going to be more expensive just to cover the requirements.  I do like Victoria&#039;s science idea!  Though, I&#039;ve come to realize while I may express my &quot;wishes&quot; or even &quot;permissions,&quot;  I&#039;m going to be dead so it will likely be my daughter doing whatever she is most comfortable with and I&#039;ll just be sure there is enough money for whatever that may be.]]></description>
