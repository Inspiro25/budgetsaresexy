					<description><![CDATA[LOL, I love the breakdown here and the teachable moments.  But most of all, I like finally knowing what &quot;raw denim&quot; is...apparently I&#039;ve been doing this for years...I knew washing pants was just a fad.  ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this! You are so right--there is no one right way to &quot;do&quot; finances. It has to match your values and create the life YOU want, and it will look different for different people. Thanks for the reminder!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, if you join the free Godiva rewards program you get a free piece of chocolate every month. I loved it when we had a little Godiva stand here; it sadly went away. :(

I love my Citizens of Humanity jeans, but I can&#039;t stomach the $200 price tag for a new pair yet. Instead, I buy them second hand off of eBay for about $50. Same jeans, and almost better since they&#039;re slightly worn in already. I get the quality and fit I love and don&#039;t have to cry about my clothing cost. I&#039;d rather spend the $200 on car parts or lift tickets!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this post!  Babs you are too funny.  It really is all about the choices and what you can live with.  I say F what everyone else says, as long as you can live with your decisions! :)

(I hope I believe that, because I just paid $4900 for braces and 2 years of torture.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great post!

I was also under the assumption that I had to either/or spend/save.  That was from when I started working at age 16 &#038; through my 20&#039;s &#038; 30&#039;s...now I do both while working on paying off my c.c. debt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Babs, I love your posts!! &quot;Make choices you can really live with, because you’ll have to.&quot; is so true. Such a simple lesson, too, that can take us half our lives to figure out. I absolutely lean to the &quot;we have a place to live, food, vehicle -- we don&#039;t *need* anything else. All money goes to debt/savings.&quot; I&#039;ve converted my husband (formerly a &quot;fashionista&quot;) into a saver, but he still keeps me from going overboard with such logic as, &quot;How long will you hurt your eyes squinting at that half-blown laptop screen before we invest in a new computer,&quot; and &quot;That $80 pair of jeans has lasted me four years. How long do your Target jeans last?&quot;]]></description>
