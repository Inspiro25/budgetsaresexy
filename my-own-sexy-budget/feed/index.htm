Haha, yeah man. You&#039;ve stumbled across an oldie but goodie :) It&#039;s sad all my comments from back in the day got erased too when we did the Wordpress upgrade cuz it would be fun to see what all those were like too! 80% of the people/bloggers probably aren&#039;t even around anymore...

					<description><![CDATA[This is so great to look back at your old budget and see how much progress you&#039;ve made! And your old posts as well! See what you meant about the capitalisation ;)

I hope I can do the same in 6 years time with my blog]]></description>
