					<description><![CDATA[Love the cash! It&#039;s pretty much the norm in Chinese culture to just give cash as a gift. This way you can do whatever you want with it and it&#039;s lucky money because it&#039;s been placed inside a red envelope. I loved getting toys as a kid too but its always hit and miss.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a fan of giving money, but I can see where your wife is coming from. Whenever my mom gave cash as a gift to kids, she would fold it into little origami art, which I always thought was adorable. I&#039;m still trying to master her ways!]]></description>

&quot;I loved getting gifts because my parents couldn’t take them away from me.&quot; - Awwww, so sad!! :(

I actually agree with the money going towards something you normally wouldn&#039;t buy yourself too - not that a kid could understand that, but it&#039;s what *I* personally do with cash I get from people as gifts :) I&#039;m allowed to splurge on anything I want even if it&#039;s ridiculous (though I usually don&#039;t since I feel bad deep down, haha...). But I def. don&#039;t do anything boring with it which is good. 

Perhaps subconsciously I&#039;m hoping my 5 y/o friend will get something he really wants but usually is not allowed?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hated getting cash as a kid. My parents would always &quot;borrow&quot; it and use it to buy food, clothes or bills. I never got an allowance either (actually, I had an allowance but it was never paid out - I was always told, &quot;We can&#039;t afford to pay you your allowance this week but we&#039;ll pay you double next week.&quot; but they never did). I loved getting gifts because my parents couldn&#039;t take them away from me.

Even as an adult, I hate getting cash for gifts. I usually end up using it to pay down debt or to buy something I need. Boring. I would much rather get something fun that I wouldn&#039;t normally spend my own money on. For example, my aunt got me a beautiful scarf for my birthday last week. I don&#039;t need a scarf as I have plenty but I was thrilled with this gift. It was way better than getting a $20 bill that would end up as part of my grocery budget plus it shows that my aunt was thinking of me when she picked it out.

If you are going to give a 5 year old money, then I would figure out a creative way to do it as he probably doesn&#039;t even know what money is. Like someone above mentioned, a savings account at the bank or a cool looking piggy bank with a roll of coins. For Christmas, I gave my 2 1/2-year old nephew an Uncle Sam piggy bank that gives a solute when you put in coins and a roll of coins worth $5 - he loves putting the change in it just to see the thing move. He thinks it&#039;s the best thing ever and plays with it more than most of his toys.]]></description>
