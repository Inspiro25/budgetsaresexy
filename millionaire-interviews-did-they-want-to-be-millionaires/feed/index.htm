					<description><![CDATA[I agree.  Not many people I know succeed when they *only* do it for the money. Being motivated by something bigger usually helps you get there faster in the end, where you can then enjoy the millions of dollars :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s no insurance for becoming wealthy and I thought it was pretty insightful that most of your interviewees did not set out with that goal.  I do believe that you find something that you&#039;re passionate about and it can lead to wealth if you are focused on its success.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for the nice change of pace, &lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt;!  I, too, never wanted or really thought about being a millionaire growing up, but once I hit about 25 it was all I could think about ;)  Now I&#039;m more focused on being &quot;financially free&quot; really - which will probably mean at least a net worth of $1 mil, but I think it&#039;s a nice challenge to kinda work on anyways, esp. if you&#039;re a huge money nerd like me and most others reading these posts here.  Oddly enough I&#039;d be happy stopping at $1 Mil and just patting myself on the back too, haha... We&#039;ll see what happens though! :)


@&lt;b&gt;Well Heeled Blog&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s always true, but a million dollars is still a million dollars ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Peter&lt;/b&gt; - I just want to see if I can do it (hit a million dollars), and then I&#039;d totally be happy with stopping the &quot;race&quot; there and feeling good about hitting that mark... I don&#039;t think I&#039;d then shoot for $2 mil or $3 mil, etc - but I do think I&#039;d reach it eventually if I kept hustlin&#039;.  Like you though, I&#039;m much happier focused on what money can do for you - like with traveling and exploring and just living a more peaceful life w/ friends and family.  We&#039;re gonna get there, bro!
@&lt;b&gt;Meg&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, it&#039;s nice and changed now - don&#039;t you worry ;) And I agree with doing stuff NOW rather than waiting till you&#039;re a millionaire or have $XXX in the bank whic could be like 30 years from now.  If something&#039;s a priority to you, and you do your diligence with planning and all that stuff, then I say go for it!  Nothing wrong with going for what makes you happy in life if you can get away with it :)
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Those are great goals :) You&#039;re a sweetheart.
@&lt;b&gt;Ron @ Fringe Village&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you like &#039;em!  I&#039;m new to her stuff as well, but very glad we ended up crossing paths :)  Interesting stuff.
@&lt;b&gt;Ornella&lt;/b&gt; - And you WILL make it, girl!  I&#039;ve got total faith in you :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jim&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!!! That is too funny. Flickr is coming to life here! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Debbie Beardsley @ European Travelista&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;Having goals are a necessary part of achieving your dreams.&quot; Agreed.  There&#039;s nothing wrong with having goals and following your dreams, even if they&#039;re super crazy or far out there.  And luckily hitting a million dollars is do-able for most people as long as you put a good game plan in place :)  (AND stay motivated)
@&lt;b&gt;Diane&lt;/b&gt; - I want to see you roaming the streets in only xmas lights!! hahha... that is too awesome. Good one :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[DC and Lance and Financial Independence- Yes! I just use the term millionaire as pertaining to a person with a million dollar net worth or MORE. A million is NOT what it used to be. I&#039;ve interviewed people with just at a million and they have regular cars and live a &quot;middle class&quot; life. But once you have $5-$10 million dollar net worth - then you can think about the nice cars and extras. Funny that decamillions is the new &quot;millionaire&quot;.

AdventureRob - Most everyone hasn&#039;t been JUST about the money. Though it doesn&#039;t mean you have to build a business out of your hobby, most of them are passionate about creating things and growing a business.

Also most of them want to improve as a person and grow- and going after wealth makes you improve your mindset and get rid of some of the junk in your head! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To become a millionaire you could buy a house in California 20 years ago and just stay in it...

I think we need to aim higher - what does it take to become billionaire?  I mean with the inflation and so on millionaire is an annual  salary for  somebody..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always wanted to be a millionaire (who doesn&#039;t?), but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the best goal to have in life. I can already getting there, and then wondering what to spend it on. A large house that needs more money to keep it maintained probably.

Following passion and goals is very important, but a lot of self made millionaires did it by chasing their dreams, rather than chasing the dollar.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would saying &quot;being a millionaire&quot; is a goal of mine simply because having wealth is a goal of mine.  I would say $1 million is a good starting spot, though certainly not THEE end goal.  I want to have wealth that opens up time and opportunity, and having $1 million would definitely help me get closer to that goal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Meg:  I&#039;m there already and my last car (bought this year) - was 10-year-old used Volvo, for under $3K.  Never had a car loan in my life. I would no more get an expensive new car ($50K is more than twice what I&#039;ve ever paid for a car) than I would walk naked down the street dressed in nothing but Xmas tree lights.  Not saying cars are silly, just saying if you really do want to arrive at decent savings, buying flash cars will not help you get there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jacob - I understand that! The million is only worth what it can do. I see it just as a number goal, more freedom and the ability to do what I want is important.

Ron - Glad you liked the interviews! :)]]></description>
