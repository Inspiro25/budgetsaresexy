Ron, I&#039;m in the process of seriously considering starting a cleaning business using natural products. I&#039;m a Young Living Distributor &#038; I&#039;m making $ with them but have always wanted to clean houses (try it anyway) and I&#039;d be using Thieves Cleaner cuz it&#039;s natural &#038; smells great! I think it&#039;d be great 2 ways...1-lots of people are into natural these days &#038; 2-if you&#039;re a YL Distributor, it&#039;s a great way to introduce people to these wonderful, Therapeutic Essential Oils!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up in a janitorial family (my parents ran the business out of our house, then had a garage down the street), so I&#039;ve been cleaning homes and businesses since I was a kid. We used lots of chemicals.  Now, I think about the market for more &#039;synthetic chemical-free living&#039; and wonder if there&#039;s a market for that type of house cleaning.  I use Thieves Household Cleaner from Young Living and LOVE it (great smell-clove, cinnamon bark, lemon, eucalyptus and rosemary; cleans fantastic).  Just wonder what people would pay for &quot;synthetic chemical-free&quot; house cleaning?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/side-hustle-series-im-a-house-cleaner/#comment-14395&quot;&gt;Budgeting in the Fun Stuff&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello!  what blog do you own that is making that much?  I just started a blog/website of my own not too long ago and my goal besides informing people is making money from it.  However I am stuck at content filling and don&#039;t know where to go from there to start making any money.  Do you have any articles or advice for how I can move on to the next phase?
Thanks so much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in a high cost of living area, and I pay $70 to have a one-bedroom cleaned. I think the woman spends about three hours. It&#039;s a deal to me, considering that I make $100/hr and like cleanliness. I&#039;d pay even more if I could get someone who remembered to take out the recycling.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in a high cost of living area and would never dream of spending $25/hr for someone to clean my house.  Maybe if 2-3 people clean and can do it in 4 hrs and have their own supplies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[haha, a couple things to note here:

1)  Anyone can start a business at any time - you set up a popsicle stand outside and make 25 cents - Bam!  A business.  You create a website and blog about money and then an advertiser comes and wants to pay you $50 to have an ad up - Bam! business. (well, small business, but still a business). The thing that makes it a &quot;business&quot; is getting money in return from a service or product.  (of course, doctors and lawyers and other professions require licenses and what not, but you get the point)

2) If you&#039;re thinking that a &quot;business&quot; is one with an LLC or Inc., etc attached to it, then the difference there is Legal set up.  My blog business and other online projects are pretty much the same business before I had an LLC and after I got my LLC (I have an LLC :)).  Only now there is more legal protection than before.  And more fees to pay and some tax stuff, but when you see LLC, Partnership, etc etc, it&#039;s a legal difference more than a &quot;business vs. non-business&quot;  We&#039;re just used to seeing that alot from major businesses because it&#039;s smart to do.

3)  Yes, paying customers should be your most important factor right now :)  Nothing else matters without them - no business cards, websites, store, etc etc.  The most important thing you can do right now is to get people to pay for your services/products and THEN figure out how to manage it better and save money and get legal protection, etc etc.  Anyone can give you money for something in return whether you&#039;re a &quot;business&quot; or not - so think of it in those terms :)

Does this help? I hope so.  I&#039;m no lawyer or professional business person, but that&#039;s the gist of it at least in my opinion.

--- Oh, and when it comes time to file your taxes, you just enter in that you earned $XX amount and it will let you know if you owe taxes on it when all is said and done at the end.  Think of it as a paycheck from your job, only the person paying you didn&#039;t take out the taxes and social security, etc etc - so you&#039;ll have to pay that at the end depending on your tax situation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hmmm.... that&#039;s interesting... so you dont even have to start a business or have anything special you can just report money that you make at the end of the year and then start a business when it looks like its working out?  I&#039;m currently thinking about starting a business, but I keep saying, I&#039;ll wait until I get customers, and then I don&#039;t get any (it&#039;s horse riding), but maybe come spring time.  But then I&#039;m scared to accept money and not have a &quot;company&quot; set up per say because I follow all the rules and then I&#039;m confused as to how I will report it at the end of the year.  Maybe I should stop worrying and just get started already!]]></description>
