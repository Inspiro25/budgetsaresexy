You got it, brotha! You said it best with this too - &quot;what if I took my fate into my own hands.&quot; So many people wait on others (or like complaining about things) that they never stop and realize it&#039;s all on them. It&#039;s much easier to never take action too, so I&#039;m glad at your ripe old age you&#039;re realizing some good changes need to take place! You figured it out almost exactly when I did - and I&#039;m now 6 years older than you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It shows me that I&#039;d have a surplus of about $2.5 million if I retired at 60, which actually seems reasonably correct. As with any good financial nerd, I aim to overshoot! :-) 

Passive income is something I&#039;ve thought a LOT about over the last couple months. To be completely honest with you, I am getting bitter and distrustful in my ripe old age of 28 (haha!). I work for an electric/gas utility, which is typically considered one of the &quot;safer&quot; sectors to be working in, but I could map out 10 different ways I could lose my job in the next year, not the least of which being a merger. I could also map out 20 different reasons why it&#039;s unlikely that I&#039;ll be able to stay in the same job for the next 30 years. 

That came off more depressing than is should&#039;ve. What I&#039;m trying to say is that I think - for retirement or otherwise - building a passive extra source of income puts you at an extreme advantage. My generation typically doesn&#039;t have pensions anymore, but what if I took my fate into my own hands and spent some of my free time throughout my working years and built up a passive income of a few thousand dollars per month or so? 

So, to answer your question: I definitely expect some passive income in retirement. I don&#039;t know how I&#039;ll get it, yet, but it&#039;s going to happen! If I&#039;ve got $2.5 million in excess, maybe I&#039;ll just retire in my 40&#039;s! 8-)]]></description>

At least you&#039;re aware of the situation and working on improving it! That&#039;s more than I can say for many people out there keeping their head in the sand. So keep going!]]></description>

You got it exactly right - it was 100% for simplicity. I was tired of having everything spread out all around town and over time got everything xfered into one main home base - despite fees/etc. It&#039;s really helped me out for YEARS this way, but now I&#039;ve xfered out all my investments right into Vanguard to take full advantage and make more in that department. I&quot;m still getting used to having stuff in *two* places now, but I&#039;m hoping this sets me up for much bigger wins in the future :)

Here&#039;s the post on it if interested:

					<description><![CDATA[One thing to also remember about that poll (and I hope I am not repeating) is that is best case scenario based on your current strategy and expected best case yield. I thought they also showed a worst case bar on this poll, but it has been a while. I am looking at retiring at 70 - and it puts me at best case at 1.27 Millionn over. I need to work on that number. with the current spread of numbers for my investment strategy I most likely will not have enough. :S]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Likely a stupid question, as I have read your information on you managing your own money vs. USAA vs. Vanguard. However, do you choose to have a lot of your investments with USAA for simplicity? I&#039;m dispersed over quite a few different banks, and am curious if others are paying a higher expense ratio with possible less earning for just the simplicity of having it all in one institution.]]></description>
