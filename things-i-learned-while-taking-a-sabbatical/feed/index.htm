You are living the dream! Sadly, I didn&#039;t figure this out until just recently. But now that I know, I&#039;m doing my best to integrate my &quot;work&quot; and &quot;life&quot;. I think there&#039;s some travel blogging in my future too! :)]]></description>

Sounds like you have some great options! Guaranteed work is a great safety net to have. I wish more companies could offer this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I took my first 2 year unpaid leave in 2011,moved to Europe where I had such a great time that decided to get anotherjob there.  Unfortunately, I lost a loved and was so devastated that I decided to come back to the States where I was offered a job at my old company. It&#039;s been some years and I am thinking of taking another 2 year unpaid leave in 2022, but this time I will go to my home country in Africa where I have a farm.  There is already a finished house so I won&#039;t have to rent.  I want to try farming full time and see if I can sustain myself.  If I can and also manage to save from theland, I may retire early.  I have savings which I have been ramping up in preparation. I am also researching some farm related hands on short courses.  I am assured of having my job if I decide to come back. Fortunately,  I have a pension which I can take as cash as soon as I  retire or take as annuity in a few years.]]></description>

Sweet! Work/Life balance is a great thing to reflect on, and *how* you work makes a big difference. Sounds like if/when you go back to work you&#039;ll be more conscious about the things that lead to stress and overworking!  Good luck with the time off and enjoy the process - let me know how it all goes!  - Joel]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually I just did this! I was overworked and it felt like I was spinning and it was having a negative impact on my health so after a few really rough months my wife and I decided that it was time to take a break. Initially, there was more than enough around the house to keep me busy. 

I figured that I needed to decompress a little bit, but what I didn&#039;t realize was just how heavy the toll of working the way I had was. I&#039;m approaching a month and a half and I&#039;m still decompressing! I haven&#039;t hit any really defined epiphanies but I&#039;m starting to mentally go in some interesting directions,]]></description>

Hey Suzy! It&#039;s great to hear you are coaching others and helping them learn a good balance also. I think it&#039;s cool that you&#039;ve got a little income also during your sabbatical - that goes a long way while taking time off full-time work.]]></description>

Hello over there! Yeah I think many people are guilty of focussing on work too much (myself included!). It&#039;s strange thinking that such a horrible pandemic is slowing people down and helping them reflect on the important things in life.
Cheers Josh - have a good one mate!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joel - Welcome to the blog! I have followed Jay for years and all though I was sad to see him move on, I am looking forward to your new posts.

I am in the middle of my second self-funded sabbatical. My first was in 2012 and was a great success. It took lots of planning and thought for me to take the leap and I am happy to say it worked out great. Travel, volunteer work, and lots of self-discovery happened in the course of the year. The best outcome was starting new exercise routines that I still do today!
In August of 2019, I quit my full-time job to begin my second self-funded sabbatical. The fall and winter of 2019 were great with lots of trips and time spent with family. In the spring COVID-19 decided to tag along and it changed my plans of traveling the world but hasn&#039;t put a complete damper on my sabbatical. I am still enjoying remote (Zoom, Messenger, etc) time with family and friends as well as reading, online classes, and lots of golf. I am lucky to be in Virginia where they still allowed golf. 
I have no plans to go back to full-time work until the year is completed. In the meantime, I have a small coaching practice and help others with job transitions and to plan their own sabbaticals as well as manage work/life balance. 
I would love to see more companies recognize the need and benefits of sabbaticals. Even if your company doesn&#039;t offer a sabbatical, I would encourage workers to fund their own sabbatical. It isn&#039;t easy and well worth the risk and unforeseen opportunities that arise. 
 
Thanks, Suzy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article Joel. 
Sounds like your sabbatical was pretty good. I think a lot of us spend so much time working that we forget that there are other things in life. I sometimes find it works like that anyway. 

In the UK, we have a scheme for COVID called furlough and I have basically had 10 weeks away from work and it has really given me chance to reflect. 

Best wishes from the UK!]]></description>
