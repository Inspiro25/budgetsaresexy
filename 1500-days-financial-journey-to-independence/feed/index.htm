					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mr. 1500,

Your story and others posted here are very inspiring.
My story- December of 2004 - student loan, two car payments, credit card bills. We pretty much lived on credit cards, paying one credit card with another.

That December night was sobering. After the family went to sleep, I laid out all the bills on the family room floor (the bills pretty much covered the space). I decided to do something about it. I thought it was not fair to put my family through this hardship because of my bad financial decision.

Fast forward 2009 March, I was lucky and grateful for the opportunity that presented itself. I took advantage of it.

I can&#039;t believe the journey, from deep red to flush green. My only regret is that I wish I came across blog sooner. I am planning to retire in 8 years. I am handy. I do a lot of fixing around the house. That&#039;s what I am interested in doing after retirement. Any thoughts, suggestions, or advice are welcome.
Thanks for the education !
Sincerely,
RPM]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Mr. 1500. Sounds like you did it the right way, slow and steady. I&#039;m happy for you and your family. I&#039;m 41 and just now getting started to try and get our financial life in order. Have a ways to go, but posts like yours keep me motivated!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good story and most of the retire early stories involve investing. (Who&#039;d Thunk it, huh) Buying assets is where its at, and if you cant afford to buy assets like real estate and index funds, forget about FI or retirement. Get ready for 65, and possibly a very low level Social security.]]></description>
