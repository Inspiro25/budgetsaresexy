					<description><![CDATA[Thanks dude :)  We&#039;re pretty excited about the new year, and all the possibilities too.  We have a TON of ideas in the works and it&#039;s just a matter of figuring out what goes first, and when :)  To a successful 2012, my friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, it&#039;s ending already?  I&#039;m really looking forward to seeing what you come up with in 2012. It felt so great taking part in Love Drop at FINCON11.  It was great to physically do something that would positively contribute to others.

It&#039;s truly inspiring to hear how people will come together to help those in need and how you were able to create this for them.  Awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful thing to do with a year of your time!
I would love to help and will be in Milwaukee on that day. I can start getting donations of household items from friends and family right away if that would help. I&#039;ll shoot you an email for the details.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What you guys have done is amazing!  Glad I got to be a part of it in Chicago.

I think you&#039;ve not only touched the people&#039;s lives that you&#039;ve helped but you&#039;ve also set an example for the rest of us in terms of giving back.

Job well done on LoveDrop, can&#039;t wait to see what you come up with next!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Has it been a year already? Wow.

It is sad to see it go. Er, sad to see that it&#039;s gone... apparently. (KILLAAAAAAA....)

I would say that it&#039;s unfortunate to lose it, but I&#039;d rather appreciate all the good it has done, and rest easy knowing that you lot are definitely going to keep the Sexiness going in your own ways.

Besides, you totally deserve a break.]]></description>
