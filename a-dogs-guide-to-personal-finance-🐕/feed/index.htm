Hey MM Woman! Thanks for reading. Curiosity is key! Such an underrated character trait to have, IMO. It might slow you down sometimes--walking with Sadie is a series of 50 foot bursts stunted by pauses to sniff around. Walk, sniff, repeat. But I think stopping to ask questions is SO WORTHWHILE. 

Keep on digging!

Hey Paul, thanks for reading. Sadie says thanks too. Great point on the risk tolerance note. Owning stocks is pretty liquid compared to owning a house, for example. Thanks for adding that note. 

All the best, 
Jesse]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joel,

What a great blog post - I really enjoyed reading this and especially from such a new perspective. I agree - dogs bury things for later: they are OK with delayed gratification. That is something I think more people should understand especially as it relates to finances. Another aspect that really resonated with me was the voracious appetite to learn. In my opinion, the second you stop learning is the second you start dying. You need curiousty to grow in this ever changing world. Thank you so much for sharing!

					<description><![CDATA[Haha enjoyed the creative story. Favorite parts are burying the bones and living kibbles to kibbles. 

The emergency vs long term investing word I’d add is risk tolerance. You are still pretty liquid in a long term plan but your risk tolerance is where there should be a big difference. 

Great read.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey I.F. 

So, Sadie did keep a spreadsheet. Then she at it. Dogs. But she still successfully unburies her hidden treasure—like one of those weirdos who keeps their spending down *without* any form of budget. 

Glad you enjoyed the post :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the bury it for later personal finance hack that dogs discovered long ago--as long as they remember where they buried it! I wonder if they keep spreadsheets... 

I&#039;ve never had a dog that doesn&#039;t inhale any food in front of it immediately, though I&#039;ve heard rumors of the grazing types.

Fun post!]]></description>
