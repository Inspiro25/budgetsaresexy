					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t do it. Instead get a line of credit on your Vanguard brokerage. 
Stash the $900/mo and know that in the slim chance of the $14k emergency coming up you could easily get the cash from the brokerage. 
Probably not the fiscally best, but honestly, ~7% on $14k won&#039;t kill your financial position and it will keep you from being indebted to your parents and continue your independence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude!  I haven&#039;t read a single comment yet, but you do not need a family loan right now.  IF your kid gets super sick or IF you face a layoff or crazy emergency, then it is fabulous to know you have parents who will loan you money (heck they sound like they type to outright GIVE you money in a true pinch).  But borrowing $14K just to pad your reserves is crazy-talk.

First of all, you don&#039;t need it.  You&#039;d literally just be saving it &quot;just in case.

Second of all, having that cushion psychologically discourages you from saving.  It takes away the &quot;holy s**t I only have $3K in savings, we&#039;d better not spend a freakin&#039; DIME that we don&#039;t have to for awhile!&quot; feeling which is very normal and rational and will help you rebuild your reserves quickly.

I have borrowed money from my mother.  I borrowed from her instead of a bank to buy 2 rental properties, and she has a promissory note and deed and earns a market rate of return (I in turn got 100% financing and zero underwriting hassle).  Borrowing from family is great if it&#039;s a win-win or if you are in a true dire circumstance, but in this &quot;hypothetical&quot; case I just can&#039;t see any point to it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I borrowed about a thousand bucks to get me through the last semester of college, and paid it back with my first big boy paycheck a few months later. This is tough. I say I&#039;d only tap it IF an emergency came up and I needed it. But that&#039;s just me, so it doesn&#039;t matter :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I needed a loan, there&#039;s no better institution to borrow from than the parents! I would ensure I offer them the highest interest rate possible. They&#039;d earn money and help me and get their money back. Better than investing in some nefarious or nebulous institution where you have no relationship!

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/would-you-take-loan-from-parents/#comment-220743&quot;&gt;madeline&lt;/a&gt;.

Great way to think of it too! No one&#039;s brought that one up yet :)

It takes a lot for me to be bent out of shape one way or the other - especially with money - so taking the loan to help my wife out or not would leave our relationship just fine... In fact, I kinda want to just take it to make her feel better and happy! I&#039;m not super against debt when the money&#039;s there to be repaid at any time. Only when it&#039;s being taken out for nonsense and the whole financial picture is out of whack.

Great comment!]]></description>
