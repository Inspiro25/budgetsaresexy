Hah! I just searched eBay to see what that was and def. not what I was expecting, haha... was hoping it would be some large decoration piece - nope :) And you can buy it there for $15-$20 too, so will have to decline the offer this time around, but feel free to hit me up with more! That was fun to check out :)]]></description>

I can understand that. If it wasn&#039;t fun for me, or I wasn&#039;t trying to make a game out of it, I probably wouldn&#039;t waste my time either. But luckily I don&#039;t see it as a waste :)]]></description>

HAH! I remember paying like $1.50 for them at Union Station in DC. Total rip off but they just tasted damn good and were convenient ;)]]></description>

Haha yeah - they suck sometimes.  And you&#039;re right, I did have a lot of fun trying to sell the Pram throughout the process :) More so in the beginning than in the end, but still. It&#039;s really just entertainment when it comes down to it all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the &quot;flip&quot;...Longtime CL user and my advice....be patient. I agree you do meet some ....&quot;characters&quot;...as well as &quot; no shows&quot; but for the most part CL rocks and you do meet some nice folks. Gonna echo Sarah&#039;s advice on selling bikes....but you have to know what your buying. Recently bought a mountain bike at a yard sale for $7...put a tube in the rear tire...adjusted the brakes...oiled the chain. Did some research and found the bike sells new for $300. Put it on CL and sold it for $155...in two days...to a very nice guy. Just lucky I guess. I do have a Joe Montana Sports Illustrated pewter sculpture in the original box WITH certificate of authenticity..$30 takes it home..Might be a good &quot;flip&quot; for you...football season is right around the corner!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations.  I&#039;d have to agree too with the post that your time is worth something as well. This is what would prevent me from doing this, although, I have been able to do that with brand name children&#039;s clothes found in a tag sale. After my child was done with them, I&#039;ve consigned them. However, the return was so little. I was happier to have them be reused -- (children&#039;s clothes are usually in good condition, because kids&#039; grow out of them so fast, they don&#039;t have too much time to wear out.  For me it is more about not wasting good things and getting pleasure out of knowing someone else could use them. I love freecycle for this reason.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugh, we had people flake out on us multiple times when we tried to get rid of a desk through Freecycle.  I hate when that happens.  But at least you eventually managed to get rid of the pram for a profit, even a small one!

We&#039;ve been saying we need to do a yard sale.  We have furniture and clothes and glassware, and some electronics that we really need to get rid of since we aren&#039;t using them and we need to make room to store baby stuff, since we do want a second baby so it doesn&#039;t make sense to get rid of everything Amelia outgrows just yet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bananas were $0.1/lb today at the supermarket, I can send you 300lb for $30 and you can sell them for $0.5 just setting up a shop in your street haha!
Not a one flip thing and not sure customs will be happy, but a cool markup!]]></description>
