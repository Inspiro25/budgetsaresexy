					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post, J. Money. To me, buying a home has always seemed like something I would do eventually; something I&#039;d do &quot;when I grow up.&quot; But it seems like I blinked and when I opened my eyes, I just might be... a.... grownup. How did that happen?! Anyway, my parents have been asking me lately if I might start looking into buying a home, and, honestly, about two months ago, I laughed this off. But now, with the home prices where they are and, like you said, with a little more &quot;cushion&quot; in my life, I think I might just start looking into it. So long as you&#039;re not getting into something that you really can&#039;t afford, it seems like the time really is now! So thanks for the inspirational post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww I hope it gets better soon my friend!  That&#039;s pretty harsh for sure.  But it&#039;s totally true -- without the bads you can&#039;t even APPRECIATE the goods, ya know?  Both are always needed, though ofcourse it&#039;s much better when things are going UP more for sure ;)  I&#039;d much rather not appreciate it as much if it means everything&#039;s going sexily, haha...  keep us updated with everything, okay? And let us know if we can help out :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the &#039;sometimes you&#039;re up, and sometimes you&#039;re down.&#039; Even though now I am in the &#039;sometimes you&#039;re down part,&#039; I can enjoy memories of when I was up, and look forward to being up again in the future (I hope)! Unfortunately, I am on the real estate end of loosing my home within the next year or so, and definitely struggling to stay afloat. But I can still financially plan for a great future with a cheap apartment, and it is nice to have something positive to work toward.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the message in this piece. I truly believe that when in doubt you should always take the next small step. You won&#039;t always be able to take leaps. A small step is better than standing still.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Agatha Kulesza&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!  The &quot;American Dream&quot; isn&#039;t so dream-like either, even IF the markets were nice and sexy like it was back in the day.  I realized after year 1 that I am not cut out for home ownership no matter the financial perks ;)  All good things to learn while young, for sure.  Thanks for stopping by!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Only if it&#039;s something you truly want!!  It&#039;s the largest purchase of your life, so make sure it&#039;s a high priority ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s not a bad deal at all, you&#039;re right. And I&#039;m glad you&#039;re feeling good about home ownership too!  I&#039;m done with it, haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s just a matter of most of my friends ending up with about the same educational level and similar income levels as me, but we&#039;re all pretty solidly middle class and an awful lot of us have bought houses over the past couple of years!!  

But as Agatha mentioned, we definitely benefit from this because we&#039;re young.  We were able to take advantage of a bad market by getting houses at low prices and getting low interest rates.  In fact, I found out that my husband and I pay about $200/month less for our mortgage (including taxes and insurance) than a renter in our area would expect to pay for a similar home, so we&#039;re not just building equity, we&#039;re saving an additional $2400 a year by owning instead of renting.  Not a bad deal. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think we are really fortunate to be young people in these times of unstable real estate. Even if you are upside down on your townhouse you still have plenty of time to recover. My heart goes out to the baby boomers who put their life savings in their homes, hoping they could retire off the money they made when they sold it....and many of them can&#039;t sell their home now. I think we&#039;ve all learned that although real estate is still a good investment, it&#039;s probably not the best idea to put all your retirement hopes and dreams into one basket.]]></description>
