Yeah, maybe one day I&#039;ll sit down and run the numbers and start including it... Kinda like separating out business with pleasure, but we&#039;ll see :)]]></description>

I&#039;m actually surprised you don&#039;t list your business as an asset. Valuation may be a bit tricky, but it&#039;s definitely worth a lot.]]></description>

Oh yeah, you got that right. income-producing assets are key!! I&#039;ve got to be better about going down that route too... Although I do have some, they&#039;re just online... which aren&#039;t included in my numbers, now that I think of it... hmmm.. probably best to keep out since it&#039;s never secure, haha...]]></description>

I would include your primary residence (and obviously any investment real estate) and their associated mortgages. You do make a valid point about including property which is fairly easy to sell (such as a car), but it&#039;s been hard for me to draw the line on what should be included and what&#039;s not. 
I guess personally it&#039;s a motivational trick to include less on my net worth - it makes me want to work that much harder. Additionally, it helps me focus on acquiring income-producing or appreciating assets, instead of basic material possessions.]]></description>

That&#039;s a good way to do it too :) I only put things I can sell fairly easily in the &quot;property&quot; department, like the cars and house.

If you own a home, do you include that in it? If not, do you just have the mortgage in your net worth or do you omit that too? It&#039;s hard (for me) to leave all that out when it&#039;s such a big part of the equation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When tracking my net worth I personally omit my car because I like to focus only on assets. I don&#039;t include any of my other valuable possessions either - only bank accounts and investments. But to each their own, I guess. Good luck with your wealth accumulation!]]></description>
