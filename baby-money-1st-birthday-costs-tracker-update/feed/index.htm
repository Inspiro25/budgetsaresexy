Heck yeah man, you guys are killin&#039; it over there! And you&#039;re totally right - I forgot about taxes!! I gotta go back next time and incorporate that in - good catch. Maybe it&#039;ll wipe away my $50/mo padding I&#039;ve added in for when I forget to track stuff, haha...

Keep up the $200!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have 3 kids and they have cost me almost nothing!!  I have tracked it all as well.  $500 for startup equiptment  and tracking right around and average of $200/month each for food/clothing/diapers/gifts etc. . . 

So so far I have spent around 
Kid 1 (5) = $300 (birth costs) + $500 + $200*12*5  = $12800
Kid 2 (3) = $2000 (birth costs) + $200*12*3 = $9200
Kid 3 (1) = $10 (birth costs) + $200*12*1 = $2410
Total  Spent = $24410

So my main difference on spending is lack of day care which is a huge cost man!!

But you forgot taxes!!!  Each kid saves me $1000 in taxes (child tax credit) a year, plus $3600 personal exemption ($3600*.25 marginl rate = $900) .  So each kid has saved me

Kid 1 (5)  - $5000 + $3600 = $8600
Kid 2 (3) -  $3000 + $2700 = $5700
Kid 3 (1) - $1000 + $900 = $1900
Total Saved =  $16200

Total bottom line = $8210 for 9 kid years or $912 a year per kid.  Yes some of these will go up with more activities later on in life, diapers and formula will go down, savings for college isnt tracked here, and it is difficult to quantify the added cost of a slightly larger home to accomodate my family (which is definitly the biggest actuall cost).  But on a recurring cost basis they are pretty cheap :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy birthday, Baby $!!!!  He is such a cute. :-)

Man, this post makes me sooo glad to have government employee health insurance and retired parents, because those insurance costs and daycare bills are a killer.  We&#039;ve managed to keep our monthly baby-related costs to an average of about $200, and it&#039;ll probably actually go down a bit soon since that number included hospital co-pays/deductibles and well as some cloth diaper start-up costs. ;-)]]></description>
