It&#039;s still a real story whether their circumstances are different than yours/others. I don&#039;t know anyone in my life who&#039;s doing this and found it pretty inspiring!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is hogwash! She was a reporter $$$, and he had enough money to, after fixing up his yacht, would be able to travel the world??? This isn&#039;t realistic with what you would call car and tent living. And to be able to save $20,000 a year isn&#039;t even close to those of us who are REALLY living this way! You still have bills to pay; even without an actual roof over your head! So to those REAL car and tent dwellers, yes my husband and I live in a tent and are both working in Washington State, we wouldn&#039;t even come CLOSE to being able to save that much in a year; due to our &quot;regular Joe&quot; type jobs. 
Give us a RRAL story, and then we&#039;ll take you seriously!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the process of throwing away everything I own and living out of a car and a tent for the second time in the last year. Same thing, different supplies, and location. I&#039;m right by Seattle, an. Any tips or ideas? I pulled it off in Hawaii on the Big Island with little help, but this area is a whole new ball game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am intrigued by the idea of living in a houseboat, but I worry if it would be safe docked since I would be a woman living alone. Do you think you would have done it without your boyfriend?]]></description>

So we don&#039;t camp here but do live with the in-laws - Grin!? :) ... So life in Asia can be very inexpensive too … Japanese restaurants though can be a bit pricey here but still cheaper than in North America…. In Asia …American staples like Cheerios even in Walmart and Costco cost double, triple and quadruple as in the States —- so chocolate pudding cups are a luxury here … not to mention a steak restaurant like Friday’s or the Outback etc …. the price for a so-so steak is out this world here … to save money as international expat here we eat local fare and seeing my wife and in-laws are from here … we are living all together sharing the costs and it helps with child care too .. and I like big families too! :) … which helps … we actually have 2 maids … and a driver … the savings helped me become a multi-millionaire ….. seeing I re-invested the savings in stocks, rental real estate, business etc which I have written a bit about… see above link if ya like …. we also save on nursing home care seeing the maids help with the father-in-law who is wheelchair bound … hiking, skiing and cabin-ing? :) are catching on over here, but boating and camping is less common ... anyway a great posting – Michael CPO]]></description>

There are waiting lists in really nice spots like Sausalito, but none where we are. Plus, the East Bay has a lot of marinas. A lot of people anchor out for free and don&#039;t even pay for a slip. Ultimate cheap living.]]></description>
