Thanks for laying all this out here for both Ava and future readers. This is such a foreign world to me and still shocked at how this can exist in the world! So thank you for continuing to shed the light and help others!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would also add for Ava that her goal of helping her siblings still in the cult and eventually creating a foundation is a great one. I know many people that would support that vision. But I would caution her to put herself first and really think about what&#039;s best for herself before trying to help anyone else. I learned the hard way with trying to help my own siblings and even from the nonprofit work that I do now, that it can be very dangerous to always put others first without considering your own needs. I supported my siblings financially for years but in the end it barely made any difference. Some of the help I gave probably did more damage then good. As painful as it is to realize, people have to want to rescue themselves. You really can&#039;t save anyone, they have to do the work for themselves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m actually really sad to hear this. I rarely come into contact with anyone who went through what we did who ended up so well. Most of the girls I know from the Family that have left all work in the adult entertainment industry probably because we&#039;re so used to surviving in eroticized environments as kids. 

Maybe Ava will see this so I&#039;ll leave this here. I would tell anyone who grew up in the Family and left to check out http://archive.movingon.org/. There are over 5000 ex COG/Family members on this site. It helped me cope and find other survivors to talk to after I left. Be aware that not everyone on the site will be in a particularly good spot. A lot of people are still struggling to get by outside the group and some relationships can drag you down if you&#039;re not careful.]]></description>

Could you please put me in touch with Ava? Her site doesn&#039;t work and I don&#039;t have any contact information. I volunteer with an abused women&#039;s shelter in florida and the east coast that I think she&#039;d be a huge help to given her background and education. I&#039;d love to have her speak at one of our dinners.]]></description>

I am so so sorry to hear all of this :( I really don&#039;t know what to say except that I sincerely hope that the rest of your life - and your siblings - are incredibly happy going forward... I just don&#039;t know how this world allows such horrible stuff to happen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our stories are very very  similar. I also grew up in the Family and lived outside the US for most of my life. The first time I was sexually assaulted, I must have been no older than 5. I remember someone complained that I started crying, and my mom explaining that I had to keep quiet and smile for the next time it happened. I was raped several times a week, almost every week after I turned 12 up until 17. I didn&#039;t think of it as rape, I felt guilty for flirting with older men and blamed myself every time it happened. I actually believed that every assault was my fault and was Jesus punishing me for something. I left the cult at 17 after our visas expired in the country we lived in. My whole family had to return to the states for 6 months. It was there that my grandparents were able to get me out of the cult, get deprogrammed and into school. 

My childhood is still extremely traumatic to talk about. I still lie about how I grew up and tell most people a fake story of how we lived. I don&#039;t talk to either of my parents anymore. The rest of my family has since left the cult. But not everyone has been as lucky as I have. 3 of my sisters became strippers, and still are to this day. They are all in abusive relationships. One of my brothers died in a motorcycle accident almost 10 years ago, and the other is an alcoholic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Solidarity! The fundamentalist church I was raised in had many similarities to your cult. I had night-terrors every night until I was 21. I&#039;ve only recently begun to feel safe in limited scenarios. I&#039;m ever-vigilant. But, like you, I was able to access education and get myself 1000s of miles away from my abusers. I&#039;m glad you had a sister who could help you. I&#039;m glad you got out and are looking for ways to help others behind you.]]></description>

Thanks for the heads up! Ohhh this is gonna be JUICY READING!!!

Both my wife and I work from home/retired, so we have a lot of time. I think it would be fun to relearn everything again we forgot. But maybe not so much after several years!

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much! 

Yes, my sister is a pretty amazing person. Hopefully one day I&#039;ll be able to pay her back for all she did!

I wish the $160 was more like $16, but so true about learning the hard way. If I do retire early, one thing&#039;s for sure - I&#039;ll be able to point back to the decision to take on all that debt as the main reason why. Dealing with the uncertainty around how I would pay it all off was what got me so interested in becoming financially independent. 

That&#039;s awesome that you&#039;re thinking about how you&#039;ll have more time to help others when you retire. Couldn&#039;t agree more that time is an incredible resource to offer someone else! Most of the time, I think it makes a much bigger difference than just throwing money at a problem, although money is important too. 

Congrats on being able to retire in just a few years - so exciting! :o)]]></description>
