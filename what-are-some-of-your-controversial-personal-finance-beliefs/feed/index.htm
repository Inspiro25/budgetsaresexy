					<description><![CDATA[Oh, tipping!  Now THERE&#039;s a topic to get my dander up! Lol

I worked for years in high school and college as a busboy and waiter.  And even for a time in my early 30s in between real gigs.  I *refuse* to tip 20% for crappy service.  0-10% for crappy service (there are varying levels of crappy), 15% for average, and 20% or more for excellent. 

 I am weirdly passionate about this topic, because I cannot stand it when my friends (who have never worked a service job in their life) feel a kind of moral obligation to pay these &quot;poor people&quot; a &quot;fair&quot; wage. As if they have any idea what they&#039;re talking about!  Believe me, an excellent server makes excellent money - and has a great time doing it. 

**stepping off soapbox**

The only other statement that&#039;s  potentially objectionable is &quot;it&#039;s ok to pay fees for great banking products.&quot;  I&#039;d need more specifics on that - like what products?

Sweet!!!

Also less painful paying off in chunks too, cash-flow wise.

You should blog the before and after pics when you write about it ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I simply love this. I saw this one come through last week in my email and was saving it to read when I had time. There are no rules only what is right for you. As a testified rebel from Gretchen Rubins, the 4 Tendencies quiz, I often go against the grain just because. It was a lot more random and scattered in my past before gaining a whole bucket of self-awareness. Now post sobriety/awakening, I calculate my rebellion for what truly resonates with me.

One outlandish financial idea: it&#039;s okay to borrow money if (big if) there is no interest. For example, I got braces and could pay for them all at once. However, my dentist lets me pay them off slowly. He doesn&#039;t charge interest so I&#039;m doing it :)]]></description>

Probably better for a later stage in life too, like those already retired or nearing it and can&#039;t stomach the turmoil with the markets as much. Or those saving up for something in the more nearer term.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bonds are rarely good investments.

Bonds have very small growth for investments compared to others and it would be far better to invest in stocks or higher growth assets despite the risks, especially if you are investing for over 10 years. Some bonds are ok like in balanced funds which allocate risk and diversify a little. For instance, I have a balanced fund which invests in stocks and bonds. The bonds are frequently high yield and they are invested in to allocate risk for the international equities in the fund. Despite having bonds in this fund, my fund&#039;s returns very closely matches the gains of the S&#038;P 500 and it does not drop as much as the S&#038;P 500 during corrections. 

Every other bond was cashed and put towards something else that will have impact my net worth more.]]></description>
