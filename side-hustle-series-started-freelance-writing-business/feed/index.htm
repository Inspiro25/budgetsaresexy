I say start a blog up and just pour your heart out! Hit up Wordpress.com and start one for free, and then commit to writing weekly in it... You&#039;ll get better over time and learn how the online world works more which will help immensely in landing gigs :) Then you have a portfolio of work to show too! If it makes you too nervous, go under a pseudonym as well so only people that will find it are those who know it exists (until you get super popular overtime and it spreads like wildfire ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a writer at heart and yes I love writing. But I&#039;m scared that my writing is not good enough to be a freelance writer to make a living out of it. Do you have any recommendations for people who are interested but scared to give it try?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Leah (and J. Money), thank you so much for sharing this story. It&#039;s very encouraging, on several levels. The folks in my life have always strongly urged me to try my hand at writing, yet I&#039;ve been a harsh critic of my ability. Your idea would afford a fledgling writer the opportunity to receive first hand, honest critiques, even if that comes in the form of simply getting a slew of &quot;no&quot;s. And being moved to action by something so essential and dear to you (such as a wedding) is a priceless means of motivation.  I was sitting here, having gone through ALL of my money today on absolute essentials - broke ! I said to myself: &quot;Self, Google &#039;how to make money when you&#039;re cold broke&#039;&quot;. That little lightbulb over my head lead me to your enlightening article. Just shows to go ya, never know from whence the &quot;push&quot; you need will come ! Great idea ! Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks ladies and gents for the kind words!

@Michelle--I found that having a purpose for my freelancing (and cash) was super rewarding when it came to paying for stuff. I wanted to tell everyone, &quot;I paid for this and it is awesome!!&quot; I hope you feel the same!
@Jenn--So true about starting side gigs. It&#039;s fun to think about how you could ditch your day job and do the fun side thing forever, but it does take a ton of work to build that kind of income. So, in the meantime, use the income to keep yourself excited and in love with what you&#039;re working on! And I hope the tips are useful!
@Veronica--Yes, I am a copywriter :) To answer your question, I don&#039;t know if I could have charged as much starting out because I needed to prove it to myself FIRST that I could hack it. Then, I wanted to test how much I could charge. At some point along the way, I starting quoting $10-15 higher than I quoted the last client, until I ended up doubling my prices!]]></description>
