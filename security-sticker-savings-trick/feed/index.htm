Ha! My mom had the same thing at our house. It never occurred to me as to why it was there. It all makes sense now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like alot of things in life, this is all about perspective. How things appears is just important as how things really are. By putting up sticker is shows that you have security, which should be enough deterant for most crimes.]]></description>

We just installed a programmable light switch for our front porch lights (it has some fancy calendar tracking, so it adjusts for earlier darkness in the winter &#038; daylight savings time, with the added bonus that the lights don&#039;t flick on/off every day at the exact same time).  It is nice to come home and the house is lit up, also makes it look like someone is home.  And we do add the time plugs to inside lights for when we are actually away.  We do need to update our stickers/yard sign, they are getting awfully faded :)]]></description>

HA!

I know people like this.  Sort of gritty chicago neighborhood. Old victorian with peeling paint.  Go inside and you have beautiful hand finished wood carpentry and top-of-line kitchen.  Couple is a cardiologist and a Harvard grad who decided to do carpentry:-)]]></description>
