					<description><![CDATA[J. Money...great to see you are doing so well...You and I were in touch a long time ago when you got started and I was trying to do something similar with FinancePuzzle....obviously you have had much more success than I have at the blogging thing as I have hit some personal challenging times that took me away from maintaining that site...I am back at it again with Shakethemoneytree.com and really look to you and your blog as a form of motivational on what can be accomplished...great work and keep at it, not just for yourself but also for smaller players like me that you influence in a positive way]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog! Easy reads while keeping it interesting! I see how long you&#039;ve been tracking your detailed net worth as well as writing this blog; your persistence is very impressive!
I have recently launched my own blog teaching young folk how to become millionaires! Upon hitting the big milestone, I knew it was time to help others do the same :)

It&#039;s always a process, my man! Everyone&#039;s trying to do their best and grow their blogs - I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s &quot;figured it out&quot; :) I tend to focus on the community and just doing my best to put out decent content though than worrying about the rest... I find you get luckier the more you do that.]]></description>
