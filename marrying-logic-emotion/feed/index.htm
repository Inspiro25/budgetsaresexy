I think it&#039;s the latter :) Then again I&#039;ve never had high interest debt either and I seem to still like that snowball method... I guess what I&#039;d do in that case if figure out a way to consolidate or just get it lower by calling persistently/etc until I win. But usually when people have super high interest it&#039;s because of bad credit or other things going on in their lives :( So who knows... what&#039;s important is that you and I are doing our best, right? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny because I&#039;m with you on the mortgage vs investing thing...I know it makes more sense to invest, but I just hate having the mortgage, so I choose to overpay on it. But I&#039;m very logical about the high-interest debts thing. I can&#039;t stand it when people follow Dave Ramsey&#039;s advice to pay the smallest debt first. It makes no sense! Huh. Maybe I need to get over it and let everyone do what they want. Yes, I guess that&#039;s what I&#039;ll do. Also, I&#039;ve never had high interest debt, so perhaps that&#039;s why it&#039;s so easy for me to be logical about it! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agree 100%. You can&#039;t tell someone to invest instead of pay off debt because most will never invest that money. They&#039;ll use it for something else. People need to remember that personal finance is PERSONAL. You have to do whatever allows you to sleep at night. If paying off that 0% debt allows you to sleep better, then you should do that. Yes, it&#039;s important to understand you could do better by investing that money, but if that debt adds stress to your life, then just get rid of it and be happy with the choice you made because it was the right choice for you.]]></description>

There&#039;s a lot more people out there financing new cars than paying off their mortgages though! As scary as that is.]]></description>

Good! That&#039;s all I care about with these blog posts - to get people *thinking*. And then, hopefully *acting* :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/marrying-logic-emotion/#comment-131660&quot;&gt;FrugalTeacher&lt;/a&gt;.

Great question indeed! And honestly, who knows what you&#039;re priorities are going to be over the next 3 years (or, even 3 months for that matter) so I always say go the route you&#039;re excited about *right now* and then change it if your situation/emotions change. 

For example, I wanted to pay off my mortgage in like 8 years and was gung-ho for almost 2 years, and then I had a baby and my wife stopped working and my business income went down and then we moved away from that house so it&#039;s a totally different story now. And thus so, we stopped trying to kill it off and moved our energy elsewhere.

So, do what you think is the right path for *today*, and then evaluate as time goes on. There&#039;s no rules saying you have to stick to your goal forever! We&#039;re not robots :)]]></description>

Haha.... you know what&#039;s funny? After I re-read this post one last time it *did* occur to me that I&#039;m still choosing sides here - aka going the emotional route, instead of merging the two ;) But I like it too much to go back and spend another 30 mins editing, haha... Hopefully people got enough out of your quote to realize that anyways :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/marrying-logic-emotion/#comment-131655&quot;&gt;Broke Millennial&lt;/a&gt;.

Yup, or perhaps he just didn&#039;t pay attention much before? Or *thought* he was enrolled when he wasn&#039;t? That actually happened to me when I was a big idiot back in the day... My dad was on my back for years to enroll, and I guess I thought it was automatic or something so when I went to tell him how much was in there I about had a heart attack, haha... Lesson learned!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a numbers guy so will always follow the math, as that will ultimately be the thing that makes me happy anyway!

The best thing about the discussion is the two choices are both smart. It&#039;s not like some people are arguing that it&#039;s best to finance a new car over paying off your mortgage, which would obviously be a ridiculous argument :)]]></description>
