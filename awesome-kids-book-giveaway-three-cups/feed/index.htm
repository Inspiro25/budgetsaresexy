					<description><![CDATA[I would keep it for my little one. She is 6.5 yrs old and we just started an allowance.. I was looking for a way to explain saving and charity to her. The book would help. I am also looking for those 3 divider piggy banks to visualize her money in the buckets.
Happy Friday!
