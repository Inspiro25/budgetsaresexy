					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I&#039;m sooo sorry to hear that!  That&#039;s no joke :(  And really sucks when you go out of your way to really help someone out, and they&#039;re disrespectful like that.  It&#039;s one thing to be constantly trying to pay you, even little pieces here and there, but to just be a dick about it is uncalled for.  Sending you some positive vibes things turn around soon for you!   It&#039;s def. possible! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so glad I just stumbled across this entry. My husband and I rented an apartment last year with a friend of my husband&#039;s. The &quot;friend&quot; was going through a tough time, so we offered to pay his half of the rent until he could get back on his feet. Well... 7 months of rent, utilities, groceries, and a live-in girlfriend later, the &quot;friend&quot; moved out (leaving behind a mess that WE had to clean up, plus a broken cable TV remote WE had to pay for) with nothing more than a &quot;I&#039;ll pay you when I can.&quot; That was almost 6 months ago and we&#039;ve still got nothing. It is EXTREMELY frustrating, so I am glad that your situation has worked out better for you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am happy to hear that it has worked out well for you. I cannot even get one of my friends to pay me back $20. And if I ask her for it I seem cheap, but she does it all the time and over the years it adds up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, actually I wasn&#039;t sad.  When I gave him the money, for some reason, I expected that I wouldn&#039;t get it back.  So even though he said he would and didn&#039;t, my mind was already made up that I&#039;d never see that money again after it left my hands.  If it were a larger sum of money, maybe I&#039;d feel differently, no I&#039;m sure I&#039;d feel differently.  It has been the only time a friend has asked to borrow money so I haven&#039;t had any experience outside of that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that is a tough one :(  I feel like I&#039;m going more fishing road lately from now on, but maybe you can give both for a bit and then slowly move toward no fish?
@&lt;b&gt;LaToya&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well this $5k hasn&#039;t hit yet so it&#039;ll be going into next month&#039;s Net Worth update, BUT the 401k one will be sexy enough for sure :)
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it kinda is stressful.  Even when you think it may not be, so good choice.
@&lt;b&gt;Kelly&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, yeah that&#039;s tricky.  Esp for your adorable nephew!  I think I&#039;d be the same way too :)  Giving him what he needs, but trying to limit the amount directly to the brother.  I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about him just yet though, it takes us guys a good 25-30 years until we mature ;) haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Yana!
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks :)  It&#039;s def. a weird ride, that&#039;s for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, that&#039;s messed up!  Especially over something as small as $40?  Dang... yeah, totally not &quot;friend&quot; material then.
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Me too!
@&lt;b&gt;slug &#124; sunkcostsareirrelevant.com&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah for sure, GREAT idea w/ Prosper!  Much more &quot;legit&quot; that route, though it would be weird for me (I think?) to make money from any interest.  I&#039;d feel bad doing that.  But I can see that it would get someone to take it more seriously and pay it back faster knowing they&#039;re getting charged a lot for it!  So in that case I can understand it.
@&lt;b&gt;LizzyL&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, that is def. sad about your brother &amp; dad :(  Yeah, I think your friend/mentor is really onto something w/ that :)  Good to keep in mind, always!  (And thx for the kind words about the blog - that really means a lot).
@&lt;b&gt;financialmoneytips&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s a slippery slope sometimes, that&#039;s for sure.  But it DOES feel good to help someone out though on the other side.  My friend was very appreciative of the $5k :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Sorry to hear you&#039;ve been dissed before like that, that $hit really pisses me off.  Very disprespectful either way you look at it :(
@&lt;b&gt;Work At Home Market&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, me too!  Thanks :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Already on it! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, just a crappy situation altogether for her.  I&#039;m pretty surprised nothing major has panned out over the past 4 months, she really is brilliant!
@&lt;b&gt;Ms. S&lt;/b&gt; - Still makes you sad though, right?  That someone promises to pay it back and make good, and then just move on like that?  Def. nice of you to offer though either way :)]]></description>
