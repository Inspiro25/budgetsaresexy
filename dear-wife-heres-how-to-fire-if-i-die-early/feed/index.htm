					<description><![CDATA[I remembered reading your article months ago and had reason to search for it again as a neighbor&#039;s husband died, no warning, and now 1 yr. later helping her with questions she has . We previously lived in CA and a Trust was in place before my 3rd marriage in 2011. It wasn&#039;t a simple one with his 4 boys. Fast forward - moved to FL. What a difference. Had the Trust updated, a Power of Attorney, Health Care Surrogate, Living Will, &quot;soup to nuts&quot; for $350. And, this was all done with 1  meeting in the attorney&#039;s office. It took 1 month and with Covid, we were able to pick up our Trust Documents without having any other contact. I found our attorney who had a small ad on &quot;Next Door&quot; in the Deltona FL area. He was in Orlando and well worth the 30-minute ride to get this done.]]></description>

We just use our dogs name for everything to keep it simple.

KIDDING!!  Haha we use a family version of LastPass. Also we set up Google recovery/security verification addresses so trusted members are able to reset our gmail passwords.]]></description>

Cool! I didn&#039;t know Branson did that. Not sure I&#039;d be able to get through that much sadness, but interesting exercise to think about for sure ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Super creative and practical post. It reminds me I really need to do something like this where I create a financial plan, not just for myself, but for those that might survive me.

There&#039;s one other place I&quot;ve seen someone writing a &quot;letter&quot; as if they&#039;re dead to their loved ones, and that&#039;s Richard Branson writing letters to his entire family as if he had died, while he was still alive. Quite the serious exercise, but also means that this post is in good company!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s admirable how much you and your wife love and appreciate each other. Not only does your outline help your wife in the future, but it also helps everyone reading this as well! There is so much regarding estate planning that I didn&#039;t know about - thank you so much for shedding light on this. Death is so taboo, especially in America - I&#039;m glad you were able to discus it.]]></description>

Dang. And the worst part is the DMV has probably the most frustrating customer service out of all state departments (at least that&#039;s what my experience has been like). Sorry your MIL is going through that mess right now!]]></description>
