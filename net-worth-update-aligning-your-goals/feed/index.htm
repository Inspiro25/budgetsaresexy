					<description><![CDATA[J, 

Why not just create different accounts for outgoing bills and money that is being kept? This way it is stable?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not sure I understand the question all the way. 

Why do we have such high bills? And lots of cash? We bought a house that was way too expensive than we should have years ago, and I hustle my tail off to save up a lot of cash :) 

If the question is why we don&#039;t use the cash to pay off these high mortgages, it&#039;s because we use it as a large emergency fund since I&#039;m self-employed and the wife likes feeling secure.  We may use part of it in the near future to pay off part of the mortgage, but that&#039;s why it&#039;s the way it is right now. Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you have such bills ie mortgage and such cash ie 77k handy? Somewhat new to your site, but what am I missing? Couldn&#039;t you take 67k and throw it right at the mortgage?

Thanks for condsidering this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Yup! I&#039;ve thought about it but nixed right away once Operation Mortgage Payoff came into play ;) I&#039;m all for investing tons of money for tons of return, but I feel like I was putting *too much* into that category of finances and wanted to pay off that damn mortgage debt instead. So we pour all extra money into that over more investments. Plus, I HATE dealing with taxes on stocks so we get to avoid doing that as well (one of the perks to investing in retirement accounts as you never have to report losses/gains etc when you&#039;re not dipping in!)

@&lt;b&gt;Johnny @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, smart man. Pregnant women get whatever they want :)

@&lt;b&gt;John S @ Frugal Rules&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Believe me, we&#039;ve had plenty of our shares of Romos over the years - this is the first time I actually have hope for the &#039;Skins! :) But to answer your question on outside brokerage accounts, no - we do not. See above for more details.

@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, yeah you have. If you can rock it with no unemployment checks that&#039;s crazy good man! Way to go. And hopefully you&#039;ll be back to the full/part time arena here too shortly :)

@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - COOL! That&#039;s a great milestone to hit too :)

@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha... but -$10 is a lot better than your guestimate of -$1,000! Way to go on just jumping right on it and knocking it out :) Hope your water issues at home have started drying up! Literally!

@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - WOOHOO!!!! You guys are killing it, that is great!! And I like that you have a multiplier for Zillow too - I find it is def. needed :) Though the trick is usually coming up w/ that number for people, so it&#039;s awesome you figured it out. Here&#039;s to hitting $400k by the end of the year! Then on to half a million! (Wow)

@&lt;b&gt;Tony&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! How did you fair this round?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband and I hit a major milestone this month.  We broke $300k.  We hit $302,000 as a matter of fact.  We&#039;re up $15k this month, though it mostly came from our house&#039;s value on zillow going up.  I feel more comfortable trusting zillow now because we had our home appraised recently, so I use a multiplier to bring zillow&#039;s appraisal in line with the actual value.

It&#039;s kind of amazing because I started tracking our net worth in June &#039;10 and it was $10k.  Reading your site and tracking our progress has really helped us to stay on budget and on target.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are way ahead of me this month already!  New Years resolution for me to get going haha.

I am not looking forward to my net worth at all.  I thought I was ahead when I purchased all my gifts in advance and even saved on buying a computer for school.  Then the IRS said income wasn&#039;t correct and another couple of hospital bills showed up at the very end of December.  After running the numbers in my head, the guess is I will be negative $1000ish.  Will see when I actually run the numbers soon. blech.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[December wasn&#039;t a stellar month, but I&#039;m still up by $1,400 over the month before. I&#039;m really itching to hit the 6 figure net worth (goal by 30), and I&#039;ll be stoked if it happens before I even turn 29 :D]]></description>
