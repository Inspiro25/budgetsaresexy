					<description><![CDATA[Hah, came here from your link on the latest post. We saw a load of house boats the other day and I thought how cool it would be to live in one, definitely not now but one day...
I&#039;ll stick it on the bucket list I think!
They look so cool and chilled out!]]></description>

You know, that&#039;s not a bad idea actually... I don&#039;t know squat about how you&#039;d create that, but I reckon it would make a fun project for an architect!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about buying a piece of land, digging a pond slightly bigger than the houseboat, and placing it in water just deep enough to clear minimum draft requirements? That would be cheaper and safer than buying houseboat in an area with high cost of living and deep saltwater port. 

You could potentially avoid property taxes and a $4000/month mortgage in an area where land-based permanent homes run $500K-$700K.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You came to Victoria and didn&#039;t say anything? I totally would have taken you out for a drink!

My boyfriend lives in James Bay, and yesterday, totally unrelated to this post, we wandered down to Fisherman&#039;s Wharf for the first time. I thought it was just a fish market; I didn&#039;t know about the houseboats. We had stars in our eyes thinking about owning one. They are so gorgeous, and I love the little community, although I think I would get sick of tourists gawking at my house all the time. Also, we have stuff yet to do before we can ever think about it, but perhaps for early retirement. I fell in love with the idea of living on a houseboat.

But seriously, next time you come here, say something, because I would like to shake your hand. (Even though I only read and never post comments, I love you J. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ &lt;b&gt;Tracy&lt;/b&gt; - hah!  I like that... pretty clever.
@ &lt;b&gt;Jessica W&lt;/b&gt; - YOU WIN THE PRIZE!!!  Longest BUT most informational :)  I love you so much for sharing all of that with us.  I would have never ever EVER realized so much was involved like that - Crazy!!  And scary too.  I think you might have just sealed the deal for me.  Unless I hit the lottery, I&#039;m def. steering clear for a while... although I say that now.  My fish memory brain will forget all this next week.  
@ &lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Mmmmm San Diego... I can never think about that place again w/out Anchorman popping in my head! :) I def. want to live there too one day - absolutly beautiful.
@ &lt;b&gt;Cass&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, really?  That is great they&#039;re living the dream!!  Good for them.
@ &lt;b&gt;Greg McFarlane&lt;/b&gt; - I am pretty girly. It&#039;s a good thing my &#039;hawk changes that in real life.
@ &lt;b&gt;Jim&lt;/b&gt; - I agree.  Dinner on decks = supreme splender!]]></description>
