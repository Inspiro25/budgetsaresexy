					<description><![CDATA[Last year I finally shopped our home and car property casualty insurance rates. We had been with State Farm for 40+ years. After doing alot of pricing, I finally settled for a company called State Auto. We got the same coverage as our previous company and saved $1348 per year. Hope this helps someone.]]></description>

Hi lacy, 
When i saw your post about Muvibox, i thought you were just spamming for sure. But i went on their website just to read about it. For some reason I decided to give it a shot (Only because they had a 100% money back guarantee). I received the box yesterday and I must say, im in total shock that it actually works as they said it would being able to watch any show. How is this possible without paying any monthly fees or subscriptions? Do you work for them? I have no idea how I&#039;ve never heard of this box in the past, but thank you sooo much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the middle of a move from Massachusetts (Taxachusetts) to Arizona. One of the biggest reasons I&#039;m moving is to save a lot of money on cost of living. I won&#039;t go into details, but suffice to say, it was killing me to live in Massachusetts. My Comcast bundle package along was costing me about $170 a month. Once I move into my place in Arizona (a 2 bedroom, older doublewide mobile home that I&#039;m paying only $13,500 for, and is fully furnished, with park fees of $495 a month), I plan to get only Internet, no house phone or cable. I already pay for a cell phone, $80 a month, and I&#039;m not willing to go cheaper, as I like having unlimited everything (although if I end up using wifi at the house, I may not need the unlimited data anymore). I have both Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I don&#039;t need cable. I can get local channels with an antenna. Don&#039;t know how much Internet alone will cost yet, but I&#039;m sure it will be cheaper than a bundle package. I will miss The Walking Dead, however.]]></description>

YES! I&#039;ve heard great things about Ting too. We&#039;re rocking Republic Wireless over here, but I&#039;d be lying if I didn&#039;t say I&#039;m jealous that you can use iPhones with Ting ;)]]></description>
