					<description><![CDATA[Wow! I can completely understand the lure of doing escort work,  and during my college days, I would have considered this. The way Monica explained, yes, there are the pros and cons of this, and you need to be very aware of the possible danger and go into it knowing that at some point, you will end up in a dangerous situation, so you need to be alert at all times, and have your phone, and your wits!  
 

Do I think it&#039;s immoral? Idk, you gotta do what you gotta do. Is it smart? It can be, if you save the money and go in with the understanding that this is a very short-lived career, kind of like being an athlete. Actually, shorter than an athlete&#039;s career!

I would also say, avoid drugs! That&#039;s just asking for it, and as it turned out, that was Monica&#039;s downfall.  

Know yourself, and whether you have the self control and good judgment. And forget about it if you&#039;re thin-skinned or very self-critical (as I was) You don&#039;t want to develop or worsen any self esteem or self worth issues.]]></description>

Yes, totally - would love to share other experiences in the industry! It definitely wasn&#039;t our intention to put everyone in the same box here, so I&#039;m sorry that it offended you :( It just happened to be the first account brought to us from the trade and so we shared it as I don&#039;t have any other connections. If you know of any high class escorts willing to share the opposite of the coin here and divulge details please do send them over!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know its articles like this that stigmatize escorts and sex workers even more then they already are. Not all escorts are like this and not all of them dont like being an escort,put themselves into dangerous situations for money ot just let it destroy their life in general. I am an escort and i love my job,and have definitely been doing it longer then 6 months but to say that that is because i &quot;have nothing else&quot;is absurd and incredibly offensive. Maybe instead of only talking an escort who got sent to prison, you should talk to some high class escorts stilm in the business because i promise you their story is not like this womans at all. I enjoy what i do, genuinely care about and appreciate my clients and am an intelligent, independent and financially independent young woman and im only 22 years old, so before posting stories like this and insinuating this is the only life sex workers could ever have you should try talking to more then just one escort and see how vastly different many of our experiences are compared to &quot;monica&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I’m an escort in Australia and I am forever grateful that the laws here mean that we are much safer, and our profession is seen as more legitimate than in countries where we are criminalised. I just want to add for the people reading this that while escorting may be fast money, it is certainly not ‘easy’ money, and there is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes (admin, screening, marketing etc) before we make a dime, just like any other freelance business. Also, drugs aren’t necessarily part and parcel with the industry, despite what the media says. 
Thanks for discussing this with some level of respect, it’s more than most can manage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Such an interesting story this one J, thanks for having the balls to post it! 

I&#039;m also very heartened by the non judgemental comments, I can only imagine the hand wringing, high and mighty, holier than though bloodbath that would ensue if this sort of thing were posted at the mail online or similar. 

Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would be interested to know how this career pays in various states.. For example does the same appearing girl make as much in New York as say.. Nevada (where the practice is legal?)

Granted you see documentaries here and there about the workers in Nevada, but I personally would find it interesting to see if there is a change in price depending on the change in supply and demand vs. Risk and allure..

Too bad this profession isn&#039;t on Glassdoor ;-)]]></description>
