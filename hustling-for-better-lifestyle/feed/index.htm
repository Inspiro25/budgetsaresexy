					<description><![CDATA[Some great ideas in the comments, I love a side hustle and always believed that you should have more than one income as you never know. Also, the number of times ive snapped in my head at work and I do worry that I will do that out loud one day and just walk out. It always helps to have multiple income streams. My favorite at the moment is matched betting as that can earn me a few hundred a months. P.s from what I have seen your blog is a very friendly place to hang out, No trolls as of yet! Keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks man! We&#039;re incredibly fortunate to have awesome readers and commenters here on the site - I don&#039;t even read most comments at other places because there&#039;s such negativity and bashing going on, it&#039;s lame. We&#039;ve got enough issues to worry about in our lives than dealing with random haters hiding behind the computer, right?

And thanks for adding to the convo too - sucky but interesting story you have there. I couldn&#039;t agree with you more on this one - &quot;I love side hustles because you get out of them what you put in.&quot; So very much true. If you end up giving Lyft/Uber a shot lemme know! We had tons of comments/discussions going on w/ that post so hopefully it really opened up some good opps for people who enjoy riding and making some extra cash :)

Stop by again anytime!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just want to say I just stumble across this site while researching Uber/Lyft and found it very refreshing. I&#039;ll give you a brief list to show my appreciation! 
1.) I worked for Apple Inc. (yes the ones that make the iPhone, etc.) recently. I was an At-Home Advisor making decent money to sit AT HOME and tell people how to fix their phone/computer/etc. Loved it, was certain I was going to retire there...WRONG. Got canned on some BS. So for me this hits home because you NEVER know (especially in this economy) when things will go awry....sadly. I also have a wife and 2 young children to support.
2.) Although I am a Military (Army) Veteran I DESPISE having people breathing down my neck. I can do it when i absolutely NEED to but I try to avoid it at all costs, hence the work from home job.
3.) Work/Life balance SUCKS in 90% of jobs. This is another huge reason I like side hustles, even if some of them do not pay all that well. I prefer that and being able to see my kids, then good money and working 50+ hours a week. 
4.) (At the risk of sounding like a complete, self-promoting, D-Bag) I have never been paid what I am worth. Where I am from (rural Ohio, and I&#039;m sure in most other places) employees are paid what the company thinks they should be paid, not what they are worth. I love side hustles because you get out of them what you put in. Which is why I am really interested in Uber/Lyft, plus my buddy does both and makes decent money!

There are more, but those are the principle reasons. I know at some point (unless i find something on here that earns enough) I will need to go back to working for &quot;the man&quot; but it is def refreshing to see that there are others out there that have the same mentality. 

Also love the comments! Most blogs and forums are nothing but trolls and negative/unnecessary comments/internet tough guys. This place seems to be friendly, and...well..I like that :) 

Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the pub as always mister J.  I think when it comes to making money, or hustling as you put it, the key is to try and tap into as many potential sources as possible.  Whether it is your 9 to 5, eBay, working nights, or ad revenue... money coming in, regardless of where it comes from, is the same.  

The more streams you build up, the more zeros in the bank account.  Just gotta tap into your own potential.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, I think one of the things we&#039;ve all got to remind ourselves is to continue hustling with the main job we have.  To not take for granted our current position, and to treat our job as if we won the lottery!

Best,

Sam]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But J. you forget, nobody has any time :-)

It drives me crazy how many people think they don&#039;t have control over their own destiny. Truth is we all have a lot of time that could be used on a side hustle... if we really want to. 

There is a new blog built on a great premise called 151DaysOff.com. The writer says when you consider the fact that we have weekends and nights, outside of work we all have about 151 days off each year. What are we doing with them?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ J. Money- It must be all the years I&#039;ve been hustling that I&#039;ve gone through the more traditional ways to make extra cash. I&#039;d love to contribute- I&#039;ll know how well my hustle worked in 10 weeks (fyi- that&#039;s the life span of my chics!).]]></description>
