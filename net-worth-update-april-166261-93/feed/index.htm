					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, don&#039;t be fooled - I get hit!  It&#039;s just some months I put in MORE than the loss so it looks positive ;)  if you go through some of my old net worths, you&#039;ll def. see drops of $5 and $10k some months....there&#039;s never a secret!

@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, ask away anytime. You know I love talking about this stuff :)  To answer your question, no.  No chance of us refi&#039;ing because we&#039;re too underwater and we&#039;re not willing to dump all our cash into it to make it refi&#039;able.  If we knew we&#039;d be there for 5 years straight (or however long it would take to recoup the refi costs at least) it woudld be another story, but as it stands I just want to leave whenever feasible ;)  And hopefully our neighbor selling will increase those chances for us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was up this month too!  Yay for going up!  I only started tracking my net worth in December, but it has become second nature to me and I actually look forward to doing it.  Next step is to start automating my savings so I can start posting up some big numbers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[YES!  If you don&#039;t know where you stand financially, you can&#039;t figure out where the hell you&#039;re actually going :) Now you have a determined starting line, and can work toward that awesome finish line of yours!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just posted my very first NW Statement.  Unfortunately, I&#039;m in the red, but at least I know where I am so that I can measure where I am going.  

Congrats on a great month!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on a great month!  Last month was great for us as well.  My son made a $1000 in gift money from his baptism which went straight into his college fund.  Plus, we came out $200 under budget for the month.  We&#039;re going to invest the surplus in some home improvements that should improve our energy efficiency and [hopefully] lower our utility bills.]]></description>
