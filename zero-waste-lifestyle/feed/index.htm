Costco can be irritating. Same thing with Sam&#039;s Club. The good parts are buying stuff that is in glass jars or so.]]></description>

Look at you go!!! So glad you enjoyed this one and then TOOK ACTION!

I&#039;ve since started composting (so far so good!), used more microfiber towels around the house (to save on paper towels) and then swapped glass jugs of milk for plastic ones. Though those are DOUBLE the costs and not sure how long I can keep that one up :( At least the plastic you can recycle eh?

Here&#039;s my follow up post if you&#039;re interested - congrats again! :)

					<description><![CDATA[I read this post a few weeks ago but it stuck with me.  Although I don&#039;t think I could go to Bea&#039;s extreme I do believe I can make additional changes to reduce waste even more.  This past weekend I walked to our local co-op and remembered to bring 3 containers with me for some of the items on my list.  One for ground ginger, a second for quinoa and a third for my treat of chocolate covered almonds.  Three bags with twist ties were saved on this trip.  Often times my trip to the store are not this well planned as I often stop on my way home from work but I loved that I was able to make it work this past weekend.  Thanks for planting the seed!]]></description>

No Impact Man was my first introduction to this lifestyle.  I really enjoyed his blog at the time, and the book is pretty good, too.  (I haven&#039;t seen the movie.)]]></description>

Thanks for popping in :) I used to be a water bottle fiend and thankfully have reformed my ways. Though I still swear that water tastes better than tap or filtered! Haha...]]></description>

Agreed! And I&#039;ve been just as guilty of not caring about the environment/waste that I&#039;ll need to keep on sharing about this movement just to make up for it! Haha...

But you&#039;re def. right on picking off a habit here or there at the least. I can&#039;t look at a paper towel roll anymore without asking myself &quot;is there a different way?&quot; I&#039;ve probably cut back on 50% already just by that one question - and I&#039;ve been recycling a helluva lot more too lately - but outside of that I still have a ways to go... 

But baby steps, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! This is pretty fascinating. Packaging drives me nuts. Water bottles kill me. Straws are handed out whether you need them or not. I&#039;ve been working hard to not waste food, but it is a challenge because I travel a good amount. Even while on the road, restaurant portions are way too much for a reasonably-sized meal. I end up sticking to appetizers or the a la carte side of the menu. 

Good for you. This is a great challenge and really does make me think about choices I make each day.

					<description><![CDATA[Chiming in late here, but just wanted to say THANK YOU for drawing attention to zero waste principles. You have a big megaphone, and people listen to you, so this post will no doubt make a lot of people reconsider how they do things! So often, PF people seem to do whatever&#039;s cheapest, which is often the worst quality foods in the most packaging, and that way of doing things just isn&#039;t sustainable if we want the next generation to inherit a planet that can keep supporting them. Even though the zero waste way isn&#039;t the cheapest way to live, it&#039;s the best way to ensure that we don&#039;t keep trashing the planet. And even if people don&#039;t go all in, adopting some of these good habits will make a big difference if enough people do it! So thanks again!]]></description>
