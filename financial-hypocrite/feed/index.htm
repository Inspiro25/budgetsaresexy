I agree - that&#039;s one of my favorite parts about blogging: letting it all just hang out! And of course our kick-ass community too. I&#039;m so glad it&#039;s not cut-throat like other groups/businesses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kudos to that lady for letting it all hang out.  I&#039;d imagine she was worried about a great deal of criticism due to her occupation and the situation she finds herself in.  But that&#039;s not what the PF community is about, since just about everyone started their blog to help others.  It really sounds like she knows what she has to do, and the next step is to do it.  Just set up automatic transfers into the 401(k), bill pay, etc.  In my opinion, and, well, in reality, if the money isn&#039;t there you can&#039;t spend it.  With her husband providing care for the kids, she can focus on finding all of her essential expenses and then paring those down and begin the process of getting out of debt and growing her wealth.  Best of luck to this woman, because she seems pretty rad for laying it all on the line.]]></description>

I agree with this advice Frugal. Couples who plan togeather, budget, and track spending will always find $$ to invest. Obviously some financial advisors say to pay off debt before investing. What matters is focusing on financial weaknesses and complete each goal, before moving on to the next goal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the honesty, but I have to say it reminds me of the adage &quot;those who can&#039;t do teacher.&quot; I bet this post will be a great motivator for her and many others. My only kick in the pants is sheer motivation to achieve a certain lifestyle by a certain age. I inherently have an advantage by being debt free so I feel I can&#039;t afford to waste the opportunity and need to capitalize on the money I&#039;ve stashed away. My biggest regret was that I didn&#039;t start investing when I was 20.]]></description>

Thanks for chiming in friend, and for also allowing me to post this up :) We all wish you luck in not only your personal finances, but also your business! A lot of us know what&#039;s important to do even though we don&#039;t do it - I totally agree you can give clear and smart advice regardless of whether you listen to it yourself or not. So keep going strong! And hopefully some of these tips help :)]]></description>

HAH! I second the brilliant part!!! :)

Maybe you can just charge $100 to call their HR for them and/or get the paperwork filled out on their behalf which in turn gets them thousands of free dollars over their life time? (or, possibly even after just 1 year!). 

Not as lucrative, but it&#039;s much more do-able :) You just start the pitch with, &quot;What if I told you I can make you thousands and thousands of dollars and all you have to do is give me $100?&quot; 

SOLD!]]></description>
