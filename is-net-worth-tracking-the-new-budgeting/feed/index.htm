I think it&#039;s def. worth trying out and seeing if it sticks :) Sometimes you have to go through 3 or 4 different routes until you find the one that works! Let us know how it goes if you end up pulling the trigger!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve tried many times to use cash and write down every penny.  Ain’t working. I do ok for a little while but it gets to be to much like a work. Or I forget.

So thought of opening accounts and give them names ie groceries, restaurant, etc.
I will use either my debit card or credit card. Also getting points on the credit card.
Pay them off at the end of the month.  
That way I will see where the money goes without saving  receipts or writing each entry.

What do you think of this idea?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely 
Kay]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My budget tracker of choice (YNAB) does both. TBH, I don&#039;t take much notice of my Net Worth number. I don&#039;t know why... I guess I think of my house more as a home than an asset. I tend to be more interested in my little online investment portfolio. But after reading this weeks blog I went and ran the report and see that my Net Worth had been slowly and steadily going up and all of a sudden I feel like Wonder Woman too!]]></description>

Jennifer, we did the same thing!  Cash flowed 5 kids through college with no debt.  We pretty much kept housing expense at less than 10% of income and watched our descrestionary spending very closely and often.  Last one graduated 10 years ago, but those were some great years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always tracked both. I keep a budget and track my net worth. Kinda like a balance sheet and income statement in a business. Personal Capital makes it easy to do both in one app!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The net worth shows your wins and losses - the budget is your individual gameplan... one game at a time. Net worth tracking is new to us and as I just started, I was surprised by what I saw. The picture is a lot different with all of the information. Thanks for writing, I’m still loving this concept!]]></description>
