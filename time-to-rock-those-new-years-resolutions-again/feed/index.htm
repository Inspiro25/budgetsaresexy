					<description><![CDATA[Nice!  Isn&#039;t that amazing?  That you can think you weren&#039;t doing that well, but when you go back to check everything you surprise yourself with some AWESOMENESS?  That&#039;s the power of tracking, baby!  Very very important in financial management, at least to me. I had the opposite problem before this blog - I thought I was doing GREAT until I sat down to go over all the numbers... turns out I was leaking like $200-$300 a month.  Not the worst in the world, but def. not a smart trajectory!

Keep it up my friend - I have nothing but faith in you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just finished crunching some numbers and it turns out we paid $20,774.55 towards our debts, which is roughly 45% of our income from the year 2011. This number is rather surprising to me, I initially felt like we hadn&#039;t maid much progress, but who knew!

For 2012, I would like to flip the script a little bit. My goal is to max out the IRA ($5K) and fully fund our emergency fund ($6K) and put an additional $3K into savings. Also we want to pay off an additional $10,500 of debt, leaving us with no debts other than one of the cars (other already paid off). 

Besides that, there&#039;s the usual eat better, exercise more, take more time for ourselves, etc, etc. Happy new year everyone, hope it&#039;s a good one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I think you&#039;re right - it&#039;s great for finding out about our patterns :)  It&#039;s on my list!
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  We&#039;re super excited to be parents :)  And great goals too, each of them seem SUPER do-able!  Keep me updated on them all, okay?  Glad you&#039;re back signed up too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Beth Anne&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, all of those would be awesome, but ESP the last one :) I hope so much you can do it!  I have faith in you, Ms. Catholic Couponer, haha... GREAT blog name btw, I like it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Liz Martin&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Liz!  That means a lot.  I&#039;ve been a HUGE fan of Kiplinger since day 1 of getting my finances in order :) To have a small part in your organization is just crazy exciting to me.... glad you enjoyed my mohawk article! haha... it&#039;s def. different ;)  Looking forward to connecting more with you and the team.
@&lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; - I know what you mean, I used to be the same way too.  Then I cut down to like 1 or 2 goals only and it&#039;s sooooo much easier!  Esp if it&#039;s one BIG one and then 1 or 2 small-to-medium ones along with it.  The more connected they all are (like with my money and time one) the easier I find it is to be accomplished too as it goes together... kinda like going to the gym and eating healthily too.  Which both I suck at, haha... if you want me to, I can text you every morning at 5 am to see how your goals are going? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the success and the new goals, man. That&#039;s awesome! A part of me dreads even bothering to make any resolutions though because I personally have such a horrible time sticking with them. I find myself letting them all go before January is even over.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great goals! Congrats on the baby! 

I&#039;m really bad at doing new years resolutions. Since I&#039;ve been blogging and reading blogs I&#039;m really thinking about getting on board with this. I&#039;m also thinking about creating my &quot;bucket list&quot; on my blog and seeing if I can get any of it done. Anyway my goals:

1) Get a decent living-wage paying job
2) Start making a dent on paying off debt
3) Start feeling better about my life :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, so I guess I should have gone back further after accidentally deleting your blog from my feed... I totally missed the post about the baby!  Congrats!!!!!!

I just got done making the 2012 budget spreadsheet, and my main goal is to stick to a 33% increase in IRA contributions (that&#039;s a 33% increase from the previous contribution amount, not from my overall income), and hopefully save at least $5k for a downpayment on a new (to me at least!) car.

Non-finance resolutions include going to the gym 3 times a week - I stuck to that until mid-October this year, and have been to the gym twice since then...oops!  And hopefully fix up our laundry room, which is a complete mess but could easily be completely overhauled for $500 or so... I guess that&#039;s technically a finance-related resolution since it involves money, but it&#039;s money we already have available to us, it&#039;s more a matter of motivating myself to actually get it done! :-P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ J. Money
The time-tracking sheet is intended to show you the larger patterns in how you work--like, whether you tend to move frequently between different types of work or do one kind of work for hours at a time (which is how I work, so I have to make myself take breaks so my brain doesn&#039;t get fried). And you can see at a glance how long you spent on each of your different projects (or checking e-mail, or whatever). I also used it to mark how often I was interrupted because I have a particular coworker that interrupts me all the time--I got interrupted maybe 3 times total during the week he was on vacation, and then 3-4 times a day when he got back! Like I said, I just tracked my work for a month and that was enough to give me a lot of insights. It&#039;s worth trying, anyway :)]]></description>
