					<description><![CDATA[I know this isn&#039;t the point of the story, but it&#039;s what really stuck out to me. 

Let me, as a decade long telemarketer (sorry,) explain the Do Not Call List. 

The DNC and private numbers are in NO WAY connected. 

A private number just means that your phone number and information isn&#039;t listed in the phone book and doesn&#039;t show up on caller ID. 

Telemarketers legally cannot use the phone book to make calls. They need to buy a list. In fact, just going through the phone book is super illegal. 

So, making you number private won&#039;t stop telemarketers from calling you. 

Now, thr DNC list will scrub you from all EXISTING lists. It doesn&#039;t mean thag you will never get calls again. 

Oh sure, in theory if you sign up for thr national DNC lsit you COULD never get calls again, as long as you don&#039;t give those telemarketers permission to call you. 

If you&#039;ve signed up for thr national DNC list and you get a call from an actual company (not a scam, they tend to disregard the laws anyway) then it is 100% your fault they&#039;re calling you because you&#039;ve expressly given them permission to call you. 

You know when you sign up for a website, credit card, or anything else that haa lengthy terms and cinditions you never read? Yeah, well burried deep inside of those is a line that goes something like this;

&quot;By clicking agree, you give us permission to share your personal information with out trusted partners and affiliates.&quot; 

That permission you&#039;ve given bypasses the national DNC and allows companies to call you. 

That company that you just gave your information to, they take that information from all their custimers, compile it into a list, and sell it to as many companies as they can to make a profit off your informtation. 

So, maybe next time don&#039;t yell at the telemarketer for calling you because you were to lazy to read the terms. It&#039;s not their fault, it&#039;s yours. 

Side note, you can get a company to take you off the list and that will remove you from their list. 

If you ask a legitimate company to put you on the DNC they have to comply. It generally takes a few days. Usually, at the end of the week when they scrub their leads. And, they legally have the right to take some time to put you on the list, so you may get a few more calls in that time. 

But, asking a company to put you on the DNC only takes you off of their list. A single company can&#039;t take you off of every list; for that you would have to sign up for the national DNC. 

That will scrub you from all companies lists. That is, until you once again blindly agree to some terms and conditions and it starts all over again.]]></description>

Haha! They need to create an option or a check box to &quot;donate your settlement to charity if under $xx amount&quot;. That way anyone with a small amount they never want to cash they can pool up with other people and give all the money to charity.]]></description>
