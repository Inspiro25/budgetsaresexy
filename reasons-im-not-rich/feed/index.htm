Really enjoyed reading this man (woman?). I find it so fascinating to hear from backgrounds of all nature, especially when talking about money. So thanks for taking the time to drop by and share :)]]></description>

Another thing that irks me is just because you grew up wealthy doesn&#039;t mean you have the best of everything. My parents don&#039;t help me with anything unless its an emergency, so when people see that I have a nice laptop or whatever its because I EARNED IT. Saving as much money as I can is my main priority.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 21 years and I grew up extremely well off but, both of my parents worked their butts off to get to where they are and have always been humble. They also taught their kids to be humble as well. As a child It never really registered that we were wealthy until I got older and you begin to pay attention to those kind of things. Throughout my childhood I felt like your average kid but, it was obvious that I wasn&#039;t and I was (still am) very fortunate. I&#039;ve always prided myself that I was able to make people feel comfortable around me because, I know that when you have money sometimes it can be intimidating to people. I believe that my parents humble backgrounds helped teach their kids to know the worth of a dollar and I&#039;m eternally grateful. So long story short lol, I do believe It is rude to ask someone if they&#039;re rich because money doesn&#039;t define you. I&#039;ve never once had an allowance when I was a kid, my parents didn&#039;t believe in giving their kids money without them working for it. They also never paid for my schooling besides private school in grade and middle school. A lot of people ask me why they don&#039;t pay for my college and honestly I&#039;m glad they don&#039;t because I have more pride in my academic achievements when I pay for it myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally thought everyone was rich who had more stuff when I was a kid .It wasn&#039;t until I was older that I realized that having more stuff doesn&#039;t mean jack. For some it means they know how to save,others know how to borrow,and others are in debt to their ears.In the end its all relative!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When listening to a NPR report a few months back, the same question was asked, &quot;What do you consider being rich?&quot; and I was fascinated by some of the answers, including &quot;being able to go to the bar and buy a round of drinks without having to worry or think twice about it.&quot; It really opens your eyes to what some of us take for granted and how a large number of our population is struggling in this economy. Also, how &quot;rich&quot; means something completely different to each person.]]></description>
