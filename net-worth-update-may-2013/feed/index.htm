How are you including home improvements into the housing value? Or is the uptick mainly on the real estate environment there? Either way - better up than down! :)]]></description>

Well looks like you&#039;re working the angles! That&#039;s really what&#039;s important w/ car buying - doing your research and feeling like the end decision was right for you. So yay!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Operation Kill Mortgages&quot; -- I like that name. That&#039;s an operation I can definitely stand behind! And I think its great that you&#039;re flexible enough with yourself that you can back off of the anti-mortgage offensive when you need the spare cash (i.e. when you&#039;re moving) but you can still throw money at your mortgages when you&#039;ve got the cash available. Anyway ... your net worth update shows you&#039;re going strong, and you&#039;ve made a ton of positive headway, so nice work!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Net worth has been fun in this past year. With home improvements and the housing market uptick, we&#039;ve gone up about $40k! Kinda nuts, especially since we haven&#039;t done a TON of savings at all. I don&#039;t really count it, though, because it&#039;s mostly our house, which can swing wildly back down if things go south again. But it&#039;s fun to watch when things are going great!]]></description>

New new car! I know, against personal finance sense! We ended up getting a Prius v though because the regular prius is too small. We explored the used option according to finance sense, but its so new there aren&#039;t any used ones. Then we tried for a 2012 model, no special financing and dealerships weren&#039;t giving us a good deal. Finally we went for the new Prius v 2013, 0% APR for 5 years, and we were able to get it for less than the invoice price.]]></description>
