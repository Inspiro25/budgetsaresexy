					<description><![CDATA[My friend often asks &quot;Is this a problem that can be solved by throwing money at it?&quot; An example might be something like not sleeping well. Would buying a warmer duvet or a better mattress solve the problem? I recently went to visit my daughter who moved to a new apartment with some friends. It had great bones (high ceilings, wood floors, a great location) but it turned out to be disgustingly dirty with lots of little broken, missing things. My daughter was heartbroken and wanting to move again as soon as possible. Instead, we went out to the hardware store and I bought a whole bunch of really good cleaning products, lots of paint, hole fillers, tools, etc. And then we got to work. And in the evenings we got cleaned up and went out to some really nice restaurants and bars. By the time I left it was looking great and she had relaxed about it. As the credit card ads say....
Tools and cleaning products and fancy meals: $400
Happy in new apartment: priceless.]]></description>

Sounds about right! :)

Super healthy too!

Would love to pick up a power washer in the future... didn&#039;t know they only cost $100?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice work and congrats on your recent success. For me, there are a couple things worth spending money on. Buying the right tools to do any job totally makes the experience not only better but FUN. I feel like such a mentsh when I fix my lawnmower or install a ceiling fan. The best tool that I purchased in 2019 has been an electric power washer. This tool has changed my life. I power wash everything. It brings immediate pleasure as the grimy patio is instantly refreshed to looking almost new. Best $100 spend ever. Now, my favorite thing to spend money on is bikes. I turn 60 this year and am shopping for a nice premium road bike. I will drop between $3,300 and $4,000 on this purchase. It will take me three months of test riding to pick the right ride. I see the whole process as part of the value of the money I am spending. I&#039;m diving into the nuts and bolts (literally) and having tons of conversations. This is 3 months of joy leading up to the purchase. And then I get years of enjoyment riding after that. Tools and Bikes. That&#039;s all I need. Thx]]></description>

Different space, travel and points, you would know it if I mentioned it... I was a quasi-shadow owner :)

It&#039;s definitely more work... I have to do contact news reporters and work on back-linking myself now?!? It&#039;s a throwback to 2008!

Congrats on the sale of your site and glad it wasn&#039;t one of those uh, bad parent companies. Kudos to you J Money!]]></description>
