Good to know. Yeah, I think solo Roth is the way to go, but I&#039;ll probably wait on any contributions until the end of the year just to see what happens over the next few months.  Happy Friday Olaf!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You beat me to the punch, I was going to ask you if you planned to open a Solo K! If you don&#039;t do backdoor Roth conversions, you can also fund a SEP-IRA, but it will share the same $58,000 overall limit. 

Good luck with the adoption process, that is awesome to hear!]]></description>

Thanks Sam! Our social worker is trying to find us a sibling set right now that matches our criteria. It&#039;s exciting, but i&#039;m still shitting my pants a bit!

Cool - Didn&#039;t know you did the Big Brother/Big Sister program. I&#039;ve applied here in LA but since the pandemic they&#039;ve stopped their regular initiation events. Hopefully they&#039;ll start it all back up soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job on taking a look to revise some of the goals. At the beginning of the year there&#039;s often so much we can&#039;t predict, like your 401k going away. Thus the shift to open a solo 401k. I&#039;ve had some goals that I was too ambitious when I set. Or work goals that really require other people or departments, that we had to list, but were partly beyond my control. 
I was so burnt out from work, I didn&#039;t set specific goals, but stuck to some standards, like Roth contribution, 401k, HSA, and then I also moved some emergency cash to stocks.

Wishing you all the best with the kegerator!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m excited to hear you guys are fostering a kid! Keep us up-to-date on the process, as I think there are around 100,000 kids who need foster homes.

I volunteered as a foster home big brother for a couple years and it was a great experience.
