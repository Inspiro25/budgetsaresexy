					<description><![CDATA[We love using Chegg.com to rent texts and save a lot of cash. I wanted to share a promotional code for a discount on your text order. Put in the code when ordering and hit the &#034;apply&#034; button. The code also gives you back an additional $5 when selling Chegg your used texts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The code does NOT have an expiration date so it can be used every time you order. Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CC123047&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to pass this code to others to save money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, that&#039;s not a bad combination at all...don&#039;t know one myself out there, but perhaps it&#039;s worth starting one yourself and getting the community involved?  I get a lot of my info from commenters like you when I need some help - with a blog you can just post the question and see what people have to share ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, learning how to become more frugal or better money management can be applied to all areas of life out there.  So it&#039;s great you&#039;re researching already for this stuff as you can still use it! I&#039;ll keep my eyes open though and holler if I come across any sites like this.  Maybe try &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifeaftercollege.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Life After College&lt;/a&gt;?  Not related to grad school but still a fun (and helpful) blog :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for giving my girl some love everyone!  I&#039;ll have to have her pop in a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#039;s great that we have better tools and resources to help us save money these days too. Back in my college days we didn&#039;t have jack!  No Half.com, no discount stores, nothing. Shows you how old I am ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think renting is the greatest idea.  Despite the cheap cost being so tempting, I&#039;m a fan of buying them online and reselling them for more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I make a profit off of my textbooks :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://bigwords.com is the BEST!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a fellow grad student, I would like to add that textbooks can now be rented for the semester in some universities. I like to keep textbooks as references for the future, but they&#039;re a fantastic deal for those looking to save cash. Also, the university library is a FREE place to check out books, use the internet, study, etc. My university even provides $10 in free printing costs per student each semester, so take advantage!]]></description>
