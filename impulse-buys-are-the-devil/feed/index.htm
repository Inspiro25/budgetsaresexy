					<description><![CDATA[My biggest impulse buy was the iPad.  I got suckered into all the hoopla and hype.  Now, I&#039;ve got a great looking $500 paper weight that I use to play Angry Birds.  Impulse buy FAIL!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Charlie F&lt;/b&gt; - Good thinkin ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Budgeting in the Fun Stuff&lt;/b&gt;  - damn straight!  I&#039;m a huge fan of trading money for decent amounts of time and non-hassle.  if you can afford it, power to you. (says the guy who just bought another printer @ home so he can print without bothering his wife :))
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin I&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nice.  People make fun of me when I say that too, but you really CAN save money w/ an iPhone!  I saved $80 once doing something similar (checking online first before buying while in store) and that&#039;s already, what, 1/2 of the cost if the upgrade?  It can be done :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My worst impulse buy EVER was my Iphone, but now it&#039;s paid for itself in how much of an impulse buy deterrent it&#039;s become, I just pull out my Amazon app out and scan (if the employees aren&#039;t watching) or enter in items (if they are!) to see how much I could get it for online.

Given my impulse buys tend to be books, movies, comics, video games and electronics it&#039;s always cheaper, I put the item down, I tell myself I&#039;ll order it all when I get home and I never do. Saved hundreds since I started doing this, it&#039;s been great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I probably end up finding a way to justify purchases all the time.  We didn&#039;t NEED a kitchen scale for food but it does make Weight Watchers easier.  Should I have looked into my options more than the 15 minutes I took to find one on Amazon - yes.  Do I feel too bad - nope.  I figure my time is worth something and justify accordingly, lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad we don&#039;t have groupon in Flint yet. 
I&#039;ve got a bad case of Shiny Thing Syndrome. 

But the way that I&#039;ve been dealing with impulse buys, at least online, is to stick it in my cart or wishlist and come by later. Once I have time to think about it, it doesn&#039;t become necessary. 

Especially with books. I&#039;m a book hoarder. Instead, I get on paperbackswap.com to put it on my wish list, and if I can get it, I can get it, if I can&#039;t, I can&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Honda.

I defintely needed a new car-but I should have gotten a cheaper one.  I did not need a brand new Honda Accord.

The car payment was more than my rent!!

I&#039;m car free and sooo happy now]]></description>
