Congrats on the exit and windfall. What are you doing with the proceeds?  I 100% agree about no stress in management of physical rentals -- that&#039;s why i&#039;m selling them and buying into more syndications :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome net worth jump, and congrats on getting close to the $750K mark!

Speaking of syndications, I&#039;ve just had a syndication exit and have gotten a windfall. I&#039;m in 2 other syndications but those don&#039;t look like they&#039;re exiting that soon. On the upside, it&#039;s a lot more pleasant investing in syndications than it is to management my own single family rentals.]]></description>

CONGRATS!!!!!  That&#039;s a huge milestone. Even without the home increase, what a massive difference the last year has made.  I love the new goal of having your investments outpace your income. Gets easier and easier the higher your NW grows.

Thank you for sharing and inspiring others also!

					<description><![CDATA[Was kind of surprised at the milestone crossed this month...over $1million in assets ($851k net worth). 

That does include an increase in home value, so if I keep the value of the house exactly the same as it was a year ago, the numbers change to $954k in assets/801k net worth.

This compares to assets of $704k and net worth of $541 exactly ONE YEAR ago. 

Without counting house appreciation, net worth has grown $260k in 1 year on income of &#060;$160k (2 FT jobs and a few side hustles). Over $100k gained in market growth - ROTH 401k, ROTH IRA, 529&#039;s, HSA, etc. Recognize that some of the &#034;non-income&#034; $ was stimulus checks or child tax credits which where mostly all invested, not spent.

I would love to reach the milestone of having my net worth grow 2x more than my income. In other words---$160k income from jobs and $160k income from our accounts.

It has been so valuable to track net worth monthly! Thanks for the inspiration. For reference, household of 5 and we are both 39.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-report-14-valentines-day-up-36983-%f0%9f%93%88/#comment-352411&quot;&gt;Julius&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Julius! Congrats on going through the process to help more kids! Definitely interested in swapping stories on this stuff. :)

For the duplex property value, as of right now i&#039;m using the 2021 tax appraised value. I find that redfin/zillow aren&#039;t great at estimating multi-family residences. I will probably order a CMA from my realtor soon to get a more calculated value -- I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s probably gone up 5-10k this year.

For syndication stuff, I mention a few places &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/real-estate-syndication-example/&quot;&gt;in this post here&lt;/a&gt;. Before I invested in my first deal I sat on many conference calls, pitches, and reviewed a ton of prospectus decks. Good to do a lot of research before dedicating a huge chunk of capital to a deal. Shoot me an email if you have more questions on this stuff, i&#039;d love to help!  (FYI - many of the big syndication players require you to be an accredited investor.)

For brokerage accounts -- We have no individual stock positions. All ETFs.  (VTI, VXUS and BND).  I&#039;d prefer to match the market returns with no effort vs. beat the market with picking/research/monitoring. I used to find that stuff fun, but the older I get the more I realize it&#039;s best to just play the safe average game :)

Last note -- My wife and I have a few co-owned properties and private investments that are not tracked within this public net worth report... So truth be told we have already crossed the millie mark. But, for this set of assets it&#039;d be awesome to cross over $1m in Q1 next year! Not sure if the market will play along but I certainly hope it does and hope you get there shortly too!  Cheers!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow....$37K jump in a month is huge and something to be proud of. You should certainly cross the million dollar networth mark by Q1 of next year, the stock market permitting. Our number tracks closely with yours and it will be interesting to see who crosses first...lol. Great to see you are in the foster/adopt process. We have two biological kids but also going through the process to add one or two more and we have had to spend to adjust some stuff to pass inspection as well. Looking forward to you providing more details on this in future.
Few questions for you, are you getting your property value from zillow, redfin or any of the others out there? We used both zillow/others and the government appraisal and arrive at a value in the middle when we average. Do you have a specific website recommendation for the real estate syndication? We would love to try our hands on this soon. Your brokerage account, do you invest in individual stocks as well or just strictly ETFs? We started seriously dabbling into our brokerage account but going the individual stock route since we have ETFs in our 401K/Roth. our plan is to buy 5 to 10 stocks and just keep accumulating those. We are not timing the market just going the long term route of accumulating same stocks for the next 5 years or so. Would love to know your thoughts on this stock strategy.]]></description>
