You should have hung around and watched the buyer who bought it and asked them for your pictures and such.  I am sure they would have been happy to give those personal items to you since they don&#039;t have any need for them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently bought a unit for $10 I&#039;m looking at making $100 with alot of work. It was fun and we found a watch that we can&#039;t find on the Internet so need to take it to a jeweler. Bought another one for $20 that had a couch love seat and chair withe a couple other bigger items. We haven&#039;t sold those yet. But we will make a little. It&#039;s fun and to be able to help others that can&#039;t afford alot with a yard sale is always rewarding to me. Now a days there is just some stiff people do not want to our can not pay full price for.]]></description>

The storage facility gave the buyer my phone number and nicely asked him to return my birth certificate and my daughter&#039;s baby albums and he threw them out anyway.
So I have ill will towards the buyer because the office explained the situation to him and he still tossed out all of our personal items instead of turning them into the office. Now I have no photos of my daughter as a baby, and none of my documents. He didn&#039;t have to do that.]]></description>

Well that sucks, sorry to hear :( I don&#039;t think any ill will should be sent to the buyers though - they have no idea as to the reasons why people aren&#039;t paying their bills, just that they haven&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These shows seem cool until it&#039;s your life up for auction. I&#039;m a single mom and put my lifetime belongings in storage because I was going through an eviction.
After 7 months of paying on time,  I fell behind on the storage rent and this particular company didn&#039;t do partial payments so there was a time when I was only $35 short and they wouldn&#039;t take the bulk of the money because of the $35 shortage. Then they kept adding late fees every time I came close to paying.  Finally they auctioned off my unit. At one point, before the auction, I was standing in the office with $700 and they wouldn&#039;t accept it because I was short of the $250 in late fees.
(Some storage companies work with people. This particular company will not accept anything less that the full amount.)
They sold off my life because of $250 and now my daughter and I literally own nothing except our backpacks. My kid&#039;s baby photos are gone and every personal gift I ever gave her is now just somebody&#039;s merchandise. Storage auctions are a dirty business and I hope that whoever bought my life and everything I worked for, never has a peaceful day in their life.]]></description>

NICE WORK!!

I&#039;ve since stopped thinking about this stuff now that i have kids as they completely take over my free time (hah) but I do love watching the show every now and then still. And hitting up yard sales for some quick flips too, but I do wish to give this a shot one day when the stars align :) Glad it&#039;s working out for you so well - thanks for sharing!]]></description>

I don&#039;t think you do, but it&#039;s a good thing to hit up good ol&#039; Google for and double check. From my understanding anyone can buy a storage unit? you may have to pay taxes and do more business-stuff if you end up buying/selling in large quantities, but I&#039;ve never personally heard of a storage unit license/certificate...]]></description>
