Oh yeah - flexibility can be KEY with side hustles! The more you show up the more you tend to get too if you can pull it off time and time again...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once did the med school test subject thing my last year at college. It was at U of M (I went to a cheaper less prestigious university one city over) and it was way harder than you would think. You would just get a call or email saying that they would need you the next day. You would show up and they would give you a script of symptoms and put you in a room and then all the students would come in and ask you stuff and try to guess what was wrong. You would be shocked at the bruising you would get from 30 overzealous med students pushing on your stomach when you had to fake appendicitis. My favorite were the research studies for some of the other departments but I never got a chance to do a lot of them because I didn&#039;t fit their specific criteria. The pay wasn&#039;t great but it helped float me while I was trying to finish up my degree and had an erratic class schedule that a normal job couldn&#039;t accommodate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do environmental regulation &#038; enforcement for a state agency.  I receive a monthly email listing state and federal environmental enforcement activities nationwide.  Last year, there was a case where an individual was arrested for &#039;recycling&#039; fraud for transporting bottles from one state to another state where deposits were reimbursed.  At the time..I thought of Kramer and Newman.  Thanks for all the great articles.]]></description>
