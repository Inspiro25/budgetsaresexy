					<description><![CDATA[How many people need the inspiration to look at cost as you have illustrated? What a stress relief to be fearlessly honest and empower others to get real about these notions built up by years of assumptions and adopted perspectives. Economic turns can be a media fueled fear factory and the extreme consequences of living beyond means and purchasing frivolously can make some feel trapped by unexpected expenses and even avoid proper medical treatment due to cost. What you provide is a route for anyone who feels overwhelmed about money to redirect their energies and see it in a refreshing and explorative way. Your point of view is a valid and extremely relevant one. Thank you for the tools provided; keep em coming- you&#039;re helping people in a much more profound way than you might imagine. Cheers.]]></description>

I totally thought about reaching out to him, but then I remembered that he gave me a B in his class and I&#039;m still sore about that. hahaha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s amazing how at the end of the year some expenses that seem like a lot, at the time, are actually minor in the big picture.

This is really telling, thank you for being the perfectionist you are! It makes me feel comfortable to track a lot of things in my life, and it&#039;s empowering to see what diligence and awareness of finances can do for someone!]]></description>

Excellent idea!! Sometimes we never know how our words/ideas affect others unless they tell us. I&#039;d be so thrilled if a student shared this with me after all those years!

Good job on starting to track this yourself too - such a big step towards awareness :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Justin, thanks for sharing... Great insights!  I&#039;ve been wanting to try to start tracking but never find the &#039;right time&#039; to start!  This was inspiring... I start today!
Have you ever looked up your professor at Pepperdine and told him/her what an influence that assignment has made on your life?  Sometimes receiving feedback like that is all it takes to make your day and to know you&#039;ve made an impact!  If you haven&#039;t you should think about it!  Love your podcasts too!  All 3 of them! JB]]></description>

Oh wow - you def. break it all down there. Never thought to track &quot;cash withdrawals&quot; like that - I always just put it in &quot;miscellaneous&quot; which I know is a no-no in the $$ world ;) Pretty brave of you to share too after seeing you&#039;re spending $100,000+ a year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Love seeing the quantitative analysis backing up the post. Glad I&#039;m not the only one who enjoys the guilty pleasure of an occasional lottery ticket! The part about healthcare is something that I think would make a great post in itself. I&#039;m not presently self-employed, but one of my concerns of going that route is dealing with the healthcare situation.]]></description>

Yikes... I don&#039;t have a simple solution without diving into the spreadsheet and doing it myself, but that&#039;s a good idea for a future upgrade to the sheet!]]></description>
