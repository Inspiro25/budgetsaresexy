					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jane Savers @ The Money Puzzle&lt;/b&gt; - LOVE IT!! Very very smart stuff, on all accounts. The more you have as padding, and the better grip on a a game plan you have, the better you&#039;ll not only be during an emergency, but you&#039;ll also FEEL great every month too! It&#039;s such a great feeling knowing you&#039;re on track and every day/week/month getting closer to your goals :)

@&lt;b&gt;KJJ&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... Not sure what that means exactly, but go you! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! I hope your year (and future year) goes swimmingly too!
@&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt; - Aww, thanks Jolie - appreciate that :) I wouldn&#039;t be writing if no one was there listening!
@&lt;b&gt;Johnny @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! That&#039;s what drives my wife crazy about Facebook too - all the crazies spouting political &quot;facts&quot; without doing any research... she spends hours on there sometimes debating people and I rarely think any minds are changed, haha... But hey - it&#039;s her free time, not mine ;) I&#039;m glad you enjoy the site and articles my friend, really means a lot that you said that. Here&#039;s to a great year for all of us!
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! As they say with money, &quot;the first million is the hardest&quot; ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Serena @ Thrift Diving&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks friend!! And yes - you TOTALLY should do a recap! I bet you&#039;ve redesigned TONS of items you&#039;ve forgotten over the year! Most of us forget what we&#039;ve done, which is the whole inspiration behind me doing this look-back too :) I want to soak it all in before moving on w/ our fast paced lives.
@&lt;b&gt;Emily&lt;/b&gt; - Wonderful! That&#039;s what I wanna hear - happy new year! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll be reading about the mindset of them all tomorrow :) Though I happened to get carried away with a lot of my past goals too, but oh well... I found them kinda interesting at least.
@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - You too debtgirl! Sending you an e-hug :) (Was that cheesy?)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Well you better tell us about it so we can see *just* how crazy it was, buster! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well thanks! :) I&#039;ll admit I haven&#039;t touched it since, but I do have a better appreciation for it now and definitely plan on keeping it up in the future. Especially as Spring time comes back again. Happy new year bud!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! And awesome! I should have noted that on my list up there, eh? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Aloysa @ My Broken Coin&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well, living off one paycheck didn&#039;t happen until the end of the year, but it certainly helped with a lof of things for sure :) More importantly for future management!
@&lt;b&gt;jesse.anne.o&lt;/b&gt; - Awww, really?? I can totally remember how I felt, and what was going through my mind, when I was posting about him too - it&#039;s crazy how certain times of your life gets imbedded so well. I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the article, and I really appreciate you letting me know too :) Sometimes we (as bloggers) don&#039;t know how our articles affect others, so thanks!
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah. It&#039;s one thing to get away with 1 paycheck for a while, but to keep it up going forward? Whew. Lots of work for everyone until we figure out how to get used to it all :) Glad you were able to pull it off too this year though! I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll only continue!
@&lt;b&gt;K.K. @ Living Debt Free Rocks!&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! NO!!! It&#039;s like I jinxed myself because I&#039;ve only seen him ONCE since posting that up, and it was only in passing :(  What if he DOES randomly read my blog?? He&#039;d totally know it was him! Haha... But I&#039;ll def. have to snag him soon for sure &#039;cuz for the first time in my life I will be giving my mailman a tip :) If he doesn&#039;t deserve it, I don&#039;t know who does!
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you Cassie!! Much love to you and your fam too in the new year! And in all years, for that matter, hehe... :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, what a year. We, too, went to 1 paycheck after having a baby. It&#039;s really been an awesome adventure, definitely a lot of work ahead of me. And nice work on 4M pageviews!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember reading your post about Bob a little while after the event passed so I didn&#039;t comment but whenever you mentioned it, I re-read it and get teary-eyed.  I think it was one of the sweetest posts about a pet and family member passing that I&#039;ve read.  It&#039;s obvious he was loved.  (And it&#039;s true - dealing with their end of life costs and decisions is very strange.)]]></description>
