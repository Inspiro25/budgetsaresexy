					<description><![CDATA[J Money, you are so close!  I&#039;m getting pretty close to, although my current goal is slightly less than yours, about $300,000 less, but still a huge achievement compared to a year ago!  Didn&#039;t have a great month this month, but high hopes for March!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent question. The answer is: &quot;I&#039;m just going with the flow&quot; :)  I tend to go in phases with where to put my money, and how much, etc, but as long as the money *keeps coming in* I think it&#039;ll be a safe bet no matter where I end up storing it all.  And life will change that too, like how we&#039;re about to have our first baby this Summer.  I&#039;d much rather have too much cash in the accounts than the opposite problem ;)  But for right now $100k seems to be a nice mark.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question J: Do you have a cap on the cash savings amount? For example, will you do something differently once you get to 100k in that account or will you just continue adding to it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, okay will do - as soon as I post this up ;) Your brain is always thinking!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah it is! Will be GREAT to see you there too and chill - I booked all my stuff too! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeff Crews&lt;/b&gt; - You know it brotha. Hope things on your end is going well too :)
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Wonder no more --&gt; $340,000 ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Earn Save Live&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I guess they gotta go at some point, right?  We literally thought last night was &quot;the end&quot; - but he somehow came through and is now feistier than ever?! Haha... we&#039;ll take it for now, but the end is very very very near... just enjoying the last hours/days with him :)
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, thanks!  I keep meaning to put together a &quot;total&quot; progress chart, but just haven&#039;t yet... I like looking back to see how things progressed too - pretty crazy how much happens in just a matter of a few years, yeah?  I&#039;m sure you guys are experiencing the same too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Kaye&lt;/b&gt; - We&#039;re def. gonna try and refi again here in the next few months if we&#039;re allowed to (we just did it last year, but we&#039;re too underwater for most banks). We went down from 6.875% though which was nice for now :)  We&#039;ll see tho!  (And roger that on babies, I hope you&#039;re right! :))
@&lt;b&gt;KC @ PsychoMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, no shame in that my friend.  We all go through the phases - sometimes I WISH I could relax a bit more, but I keep reminding myself that in a hanful of years I&#039;ll be a-okay and it&#039;ll all be worth it ;)  Plus I&#039;ve been working a lot less these past 30-40 days or so now w/ Love Drop paused, so it&#039;s been a nice change... We just do what we can, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J. Money- I have to admit I have been relaxing a bit more lately and enjoying life.  Passive income is more than enough to pay the bills.  I am kind of in that complacent lately.  I plan on buckling down more and working on the blog though going forward.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking good, J!  Have you considered refinancing that first mortgage?  You can get a much better rate than 5.5% right now (we&#039;ve just locked in at 3.75%) that might save you some money even with your accelerated payoff plan.  Just a thought.  Looks like you&#039;re rocking the financial plan though!  And by the way...babies don&#039;t cost nearly as much as some people think - especially if you don&#039;t let baby stores tell you what are the &quot;necessities.&quot;  Honestly, they require very little when they are tiny. =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats on your progress!
