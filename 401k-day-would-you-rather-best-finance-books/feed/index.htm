					<description><![CDATA[Put me in the $100,000 camp.

All that knowledge sounds great but its kind of redundant at some point. You don&#039;t need to know EVERYTHING to manage your finances half decently. You just have to know enough. In my opinion the average person could read 5-10 good personal finance books and be well on their way to a better financial life (assuming they put that knowledge into action, which is a whole other issue entirely).]]></description>

I would go for Ramit&#039;s I Will Teach You To Be Rich if they like to be entertained a bit while reading, or David Bach&#039;s Automatic Millionaire if they just want to get in and learn and then start *taking action*. Although both books give specific tasks to get you going which is nice.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been liking that answer from people - &quot;I have enough knowledge right now&quot; to be able to make decisions. Sometimes people think and learn *too much* before getting out there and making moves in the real world. So I&#039;m glad you recognize you&#039;re in a position to feel confident with taking action :)]]></description>

Oh wow! Dark, yes, but that is an interesting thing to consider!! And not one that most would, haha... Kinda like if you could hear what other people were thinking too, especially about you. It would be fun for probably a day, and then just be way too much afterwards :)]]></description>
