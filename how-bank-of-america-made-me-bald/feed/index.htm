					<description><![CDATA[When the hubby and closed on our house in July, we had been dealing with another bank for the application process.  We had been told that the same bank might or might not decide to manage the account.  Imagine our surprise when on closing day, we found out that bank was BOA.  I never would have intentionally gotten any kind of account with them.  Why don&#039;t we have a choice in what company services our mortgage accounts?  It&#039;s not like you can easily switch bank like switching savings or checking account from one bank to another.  This practice is deceptive and seems to eliminate any possibility of choice.  Because of BOA&#039;s reputation for screwing up people&#039;s accounts (like considering that your account is late if you make your payment a week ahead of time or taking too much out of checking if you do some kind of electronic payment), we have declined doing any bill pay, automatic withdrawal, or mailing payments in.  We go in person to the bank each time and make sure to get a receipt for the payment.  I also keep track of the payments and receipts just in case.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband has had several very negative experiences with the automatic bill payment feature. It led to many hundreds of dollars in overdraft charges many of which were not refunded. Can you email me that vp&#039;s phone number and name? Seriously ...  :/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent post. My favorite line:
&quot;Walk me through the process. This is a big step in my life, so hold my hand. I shouldn’t be the one helping you figure out how to resolve your mistakes. You want me as a customer? Earn it.&quot;
I feel like you must have been a fly on the wall in a recent conversation I had about this. My refinance experience was similarly bad. The thing is: refinancing is complicated. Please don&#039;t lie to me and say you&#039;re going to make it easy. No one can make it easy.Don&#039;t abandon me for long periods. Don&#039;t make me hound the title company for the documents you need.  Instead, let me know it&#039;s going to be complicated and offer to walk through it with me, step by step.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your post was a little sexist and racist. Sounds like you had a terrible time with BOA but that doesn&#039;t mean you should revert to stereotypes of non-Americans and women to make your points.  Really? Comments about the woman&#039;s accent and vowel-y name? &quot;Maybe she&#039;s getting married?&quot; &quot;Maybe she&#039;s giving birth?&quot; Uncalled for. 

You can make the same argument and leave out the sexism and racism, please.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[UPDATE: Heard back from my brother:

&quot;BTW, I just called Bank of America&#039;s VP of Customer Services office (found the number online) and talked to someone there. About 20 minutes later, he said he&#039;ll send me a $500 check and a $100 giftcard to Amazon for all of my pain and suffering. He says there&#039;s really zero chance I&#039;ll get the $863 back, considering it was applied to my loan and brought my loan down before refinancing. Since I didn&#039;t technically lose that money, I&#039;m ahead $600! Nice. :)&quot;

AWESOME!!!  20 minutes for $600!!  There you go people - stand your ground and keep going up the customer service chain until you feel like you&#039;re heard :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[yep I&#039;ve had issues with BOA, actually they&#039;re my current bank and I don&#039;t blame anyone who has issues with them and I will not defend BOA, my bf suggest that I try a credit union &#039;cause he is happy with his credit union, the only reason I keep my account at BOA is because they&#039;re everywhere. 

But honestly if you&#039;re going to travel, and if you do have a credit union account you can just tell them when you&#039;ll be traveling so you&#039;re purchases will go through when you travel,that&#039;s also what you have to do even if you&#039;re traveling and have a BOA account. So my excuse of &quot;oh they&#039;re everywhere&quot; is pretty much an excuse. 

I&#039;ve just been too lazy to get a new account but this post makes me think I should find better banking. I think when it comes to finances we should be treated well by our banks/credit unions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A huge embracing DITTO to everything you said regarding Bank of America with a resounding &quot; I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH BANK OF AMERICA (EVER) AGAIN!&quot; 

I can&#039;t figure out WHY these institutions have been allowed to get away with the raping of people&#039;s finances only to have their customer service, when questiond on their sleazy tactics, treat you like an ovepaid streetwalker.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you could of gotten a better rate with another bank. I had my mortgage with BoA and refinanced with Wells Fargo in September. Went from 6.75 to 4.75. BoA was offering 5.25 at the time with 1 point. Wells Fargo offered 4.75 with no points. BoA loan officer said I got a good deal and they can&#039;t do any better. It was all said in done in about 4-5 weeks.]]></description>
