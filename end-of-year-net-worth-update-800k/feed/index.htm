					<description><![CDATA[Hi J,

Net worth calculation is always one of the most interesting things for me. I like to see how my net worth is growing and which factors are making the major contribution.

It is inspiring to check how your net worth has grown in 12 months.

Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$,

I downloaded your Net Worth template in 2016 and it has quite honestly changed my life.

Since then my net worth has tripled, my savings have skyrocketed, the template has grown into a massive beast of my own creation, and I actually know where my money is coming from, where it goes, and how much it makes.

Watching your journey and growth is so inspiring; I just want to say thank you.

&#060;3 $tickyWicket

P.S. When I showed the NW file to my CPA he turned giddy and said, &#034;Oh yay!! You&#039;re my favorite kind of client!&#034;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s two-year employee salary you gained in a single month. Although I know that there&#039;s lots of hard work you must have put into Rockstar to make that work. You reaped what you sowed. Congratulations!]]></description>
