					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m treating myself to home improvements and furnishings, for my upcoming new home. I&#039;ll so love it when I get it.
The lovely kitchen and the automatic blinds are a big chunk of it... I&#039;ve spent about €8k so far in down payments, and have a little more budgeted for the rest.
That&#039;s the bulk of my savings now, except for the emergency fund. So quite a treat.]]></description>

Haha..that&#039;s what mine was too...the staircase going to the basement.  Life is funny isn&#039;t it.  At one point you&#039;re excited to get a new bicycle, then a new pair of Jordan&#039;s, then a cool car, now...fun is doing home improvement projects and fixing things and looking back and saying...I did that myself and it&#039;s much more satisfying than buying some fancy new overpriced shiny object that you won&#039;t care about in a year.]]></description>

Totally!!

But how incredible that your ring covers *4* generations now!! So beautiful!! Imagine if your kids later inherited it and then added to it, and then their kids and their kids - you&#039;d have one massively sentimental (and valuable) ring by the end, haha... I love that you did that with them so much :) Even just the fact that they are being *used* now vs taking up space.]]></description>

HAHAHA! Bryan, I&#039;ve got a 16ish foot hallway leading to my basement I&#039;m dreading getting on a ladder for, I cant do any of the corner work without risking my life or paying someone.  Oh well, if I stop posting on here within a few weeks I guess you know what happened to me...  although, I may just pre-paint some crown molding and shove it up there to minimize the amount of ladder time.  If I can avoid caulking and make a solid attempt at a copped joint vs a mitered one, it could save a lot of time.  that&#039;s a big IF though, in my experience all my crown has looked like garbage until it was caulked and painted.]]></description>
