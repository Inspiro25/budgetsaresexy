					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;C Ann&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! That was our favorite part too :)  ANGRY BIRDS!! Haha...  It really was surreal, I don&#039;t think we fully understand the impact that our Love Drop community has done for them.  It&#039;s really about you all who&#039;ve stepped up and made this possible - not Nate and I. We&#039;re just the organizers :)
@&lt;b&gt;Amber&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Amber!  We hope to keep on spreading the love too.
@&lt;b&gt;Clare&lt;/b&gt; - haha... the &quot;tits&quot;?  you don&#039;t hear that one every day ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jon the Saver&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s okay, I did too after watching this!!!  We don&#039;t get to see all the emotions and shots while we&#039;re there, so it&#039;s just as exciting for us to watch when the video is done too :)  The craziest part is that all this gets done in a matter of WEEKS.  The power of the community, man.]]></description>
