Awesome Max! Must have visited some cool places for DHL.
Has your wife still got the Aussie accent? Or did she move a long time ago?]]></description>

Man that was fun to read, haha...

I also was a dishwasher for a while but I actually loved it!! You got to be messy and blare music in the back and got paid more than a lot of people there! At least base pay... No one unfortunately tipped you ;)

I think I&#039;d enjoy that cemetery gig too. I already hang there for free so to be paid for it would be a bonus, lol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As soon as I got my driver&#039;s license at 16, my parents put me on the job hunt for gas and fun money, so up through college graduation:

From 16-18, worked part time at Lowes&#039; Foods; at the time I hated it because all I wanted to do was hang with my girlfriend, but in retrospect it wasn&#039;t that bad, and definitely gave me an appreciation for grocery store workers/

Once I started college I mostly just worked over the summer, with a couple exceptions:

Summer between Freshman and Sophomore year: I first got a job at Champs&#039; sports working in the back stocking shelves, which wasn&#039;t too bad, got paid $7/hour when minimum wage was $5.75, so *shrugs*...then, I got an offer from my dad&#039;s old boss (he works in IT), asking if I wanted to consult for 5-6 weeks on a bank merger job (essentially what we did was load software onto computer towers for 2-3 weeks, then take them out to all of the branches, 20-30 in total, and set them up making sure they could perform all the necessary banking functions)..this was my favorite job to date, and I got paid $10/hr, plus mileage, so I was making bank (for a 19 yo anyway).  Then after that was finished I went back to champs for a couple weeks (although they screwed up my time sheet, so I got paid like $11 for like $100 worth of work, lol).

Summer between Sophomore and Junior year:  This was an interesting one - got a job at Aeropostale making $6.25 (minimum was still $6.25), worked there for 2 weeks, then quit to take a dishwashing job at an upscale restaurant for $8.00....this job was awful and I was fired after 3-4 weeks for not being fast enough; my least favorite job ever...I still had half the summer left, so I made $50/week helping to mow my church&#039;s graveyard, and helped a friend with a blueberry farm pick blueberries for $7 per probably a half gallon jug :).

Summer between Junior and Senior Year:  Worked as a temporary bank teller for $10/hr....narrowly beat out the consulting job for favorite, I loved it.

During Senior Year:  I refereed Intramural soccer and football..the rate was by game refed, and I don&#039;t quite remember what that was, but I made about $900 in a semester before quitting to finish up my studies strong.

This was also in addition to the income I made online gaming that I mentioned in the side hustle post, to the tune of probably $4000 or so over my four year tenure.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, I love that ID card, Joel! I think a lot of us did our time in food services. 

My first job ever was working at the Hollywood Bowl in L.A. The only problem was I lived an hour away. I literally worked there for one concert and made a little over 20 bucks at $4.25/hr for 5 hours. 

I wised up a little in college and got paid $5.25 working in the dining hall. And I always gave generous portions of mashed potatoes! ;)]]></description>

Wow - I&#039;m so sorry you had to go through that! Glad you stuck up for yourself - and I hope your story helps others do the same... Because harassment is NEVER worth it.
Thanks for sharing, and I&#039;m glad you&#039;re stronger because of stuff like that!

Flip side... I used to work at a banquet hall too, catering for weddings. My experience was different, because they paid me well and I&#039;m a hopeless romantic that loves weddings! Or maybe I just watched the Wedding Singer movie too many times and wanted to be like Robbie. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first and worst job was as a banquet waitress for a country club. I think I made something like $4.25/hr. Which was minimum wage at the time and we couldn’t get tips. They treated us like complete crap. I remember they made us carry around these ridiculously heavy platters in baskets with apps. Your arms would fatigue and get numb. Once, for a wedding, I was at that point when people were clambering for the last kebab and as I turned, I stepped on one of the ridiculously long ribbons they attached for decoration, and the kebab the guy was grabbing somersaulted onto the back of the mother of the bride. It didn’t go well!  And of course, serving at events where kids from our high school trotted around like princes was great fun too. I ended up quitting during their biggest event, a golf tournament, after the management refused to prevent us from being sexually harassed by the golfers. I guess it was my first #metoo experience. And the manager was surprised and disgusted that I would be so bold.  I learned that an organization and team is only as good as it treats its employees, and management by being a blowhard or terror is no management at all. This was further confirmed by my first job after college where my supervisor ruled over her employees like a tyrant.  I also learned that you gotta know when to fold em. Some situations are just not worth it.]]></description>

So cool!!! Love that y&#039;all hung out there even when you weren&#039;t working, haha... I suppose many of us did that back in the day since it really was where all our friends were :) Funny you called it &quot;THE&quot; Taco bell too. I don&#039;t know why but that reminds me of how much my wife makes fun of me for saying &quot;David Grohl&quot; all the time instead of just &quot;Dave&quot; :) Our brains can be weird!]]></description>
