					<description><![CDATA[Well I don&#039;t tip for bad service, if its kind of okay service, I tip less. But bad no, its rare for me to leave zero tips because most servers do a good job or an okay job to leave some kind of tip. If the service is really bad, I will complain to the manager, this has rarely happened though. I usually like to tip between 20 to 25% , if its excellent service I might tip 30%.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s easy to calculate! No more whipping out the “tip calculator” on your cell phone. All you have to do is add $2.00 for every $10.00 of service/food/etc. that you spend. EASY! Spend $4o bucks, tack on an additional $8. Spend $47, round up and add $10, or round down to $45 and make it $9 – that’s it!

it&#039;s even easier than that- just move the decimal point one to the left (that&#039;s 10%) and double it (2*10% = 20%)!]]></description>
