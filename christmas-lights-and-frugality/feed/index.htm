					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, BIG fan of conscious spending.  I call it &quot;spending on priorities&quot; which Ramit pretty much taught me too :)  it&#039;s OKAY to spend money on things as long as they are important to you and you&#039;re CUTTING BACK in the other areas that aren&#039;t.    It works if you&#039;re really good about it :)

And go Xmas lights!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah most definitely everyone has their own sense of frugality. We don&#039;t have a landline, we use skype and a pay as you go phone. My bf doesn&#039;t even have a cell phone, well he used to it was pay as you go but he shut it off. There have been times where I will loan it to him when he needs it which is rare. 

I can definitely afford to pay a monthly bill for a cell phone but its just a phone. Have you ever heard the term conscious spending? I&#039;m sure you have, its Ramit&#039;s version of frugality. Anyway, I don&#039;t really think a phone is that important to me which is why I haven&#039;t upgraded mine, oh and its real thick too. lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had mine up for quite a while this year due to laziness... (not saying you&#039;re being lasy here).. but I eventually took them down. Personally I knew that in my case if I left them up any longer they wouldn&#039;t be as special when Christmas rolled round again and they came back out and went back up]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If they&#039;re all white lights, you&#039;re just in style.  I love those year-round. If they&#039;re multi-colored, that&#039;s okay too.  It&#039;s your house; I have enough to worry in my own, haha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You guys are funny :)

@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - hahah, really?  is your bed on wheels?? (bow chicka wha wha!)
@&lt;b&gt;Jonathan&lt;/b&gt; - Damn you.  You make an excellent point, good sir.  If I ever take them down you get the award ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Cathie&lt;/b&gt; - haha true!  they&#039;re now &quot;awesome lights.&quot;
@&lt;b&gt;Too Funny&lt;/b&gt; - Ewwwwww expired food? That&#039;s just nasty.  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever experienced something like that before. But yeah, I can see how that could get annoying.  I guess in those cases you should just ask them to bring over a bottle of wine ;) 3 Buck Chuck tastes okay! haha... or just accept that that&#039;s how they are and know that you&#039;re walking into every time you invite them out or over.  Tricky one.
@&lt;b&gt;Heather @ Work At Home Market&lt;/b&gt; - Woooo!  Rock on, sista! (and my christmas tree is still up.... but mainly because I&#039;m too busy to fool with it.  The fake ones never die ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Amanda&lt;/b&gt; - Your neighborhood sounds like heaven :)  Great job repurposing all the needles!  That stuff always impresses me cuz I&#039;d never think of it on my own accord.
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Samurai&lt;/b&gt; - They&#039;re hating that my budget is so sexy!! haha...  j/k... Cuz christmas stuff is &quot;tacky&quot; after the date of ____.  Let &#039;em hate!
@&lt;b&gt;Rachel&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;It&#039;s how you react and pass on your legacy that matter.&quot;  Damn you&#039;re smart.
@&lt;b&gt;Leen&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s right!  No more apologies! You let your cats chew on your tree and you be happy about it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;JennyDee&lt;/b&gt; - haha, first off, I have no idea what a TARDIS is but you own that and you do your thing girl!  Paint is one of the best ways to express your self and extract emotions.  You&#039;re the one living there so as long as you&#039;re happy with it all is good in the world :)  Says the guy with bright blue paint across his entire living room...
@&lt;b&gt;Brandi&lt;/b&gt; - *head nod*
@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well, whether the lights are up or not, it&#039;s def. Xmas at J. Money&#039;s house anyways every day ;)  You should stop by some time and say hi.
@&lt;b&gt;aj&lt;/b&gt; - thank you much!
@&lt;b&gt;JT McGee&lt;/b&gt; - hahaha, good point.  that is, of course, if I ever take them down? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Goose! (the Goose that&#039;s alive - I pretend he never died)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Awwwww that makes me so happy and sad at the same time.  Obviously those &quot;friends&quot; aren&#039;t real friends cuz that $hit doesn&#039;t matter.  I&#039;m so proud of you for sticking to your guns and knowing what is truly important in your life :)  I 100% get why you like mobile homes!  I like them too!!   Keep being YOU LB, you&#039;re beautiful.
@&lt;b&gt;Marc&lt;/b&gt; - Ahh, yeah I&#039;ve heard of community rules like that.  If I got a notice to take mine down I totally would. Not trying to cause trouble or get fined in any way, that&#039;s for sure.  Thanks for sharing my man.
@&lt;b&gt;dee dee&lt;/b&gt; - Good for you!!!!!  Now THAT&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about.  The haters keep hating cuz that&#039;s all they know how to do.  They don&#039;t take a second to learn how things can be different and actually improve their lives - instead, they chalk it up to something being &quot;wrong&quot; with the picture and keep moving on.  You&#039;re gonna be so happy in retirement, I&#039;m proud of you!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Jon the Saver&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well, I can&#039;t promise that if you scream that you&#039;re not gonna be labeled the &quot;weird guy&quot; ;)  But you better believe saving IS sexy!  You go and keep rockin&#039; those brown bags.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, this post made me laugh out loud!  Tomorrow at work I wanna yell out &quot;saving is sexy and I don&#039;t care what you guys think of me!&quot;  

I get so much flack for bringing my lunch to work!  Hmm let&#039;s see, it saves money, the food is healthier, and I don&#039;t waste money on tips!  Maybe I&#039;m just crazy.    

Anyhoo, great post, good to see some humor in a financial blog, loving it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will be 50 this year.  In my professiion I can take early retirement at 55 and I PLAN TO DO IT. I have co-workers roughly the same age that say...&quot;oh, no...there&#039;s no way I can retire then, I haven&#039;t saved enough,&quot;  and then they look at me like I can&#039;t possibly have done the math.

These are the same co-workers that turn their nose up at my bag lunch as they buy lunch at the cafeteria.  These are the same folks that are driving a BRAND new car, while I drive at 2000 Honda Civic and the same folks that scoff at my cheap, but extremely relaxing and rewarding vacations while they jet set around the world.  Priorities, I guess ~ I know that I plan to honk my horn loud and long everytime I drive by my former workplace in 5 years, whileI&#039;m off enjoying myself and the rest of the gang toils away for &quot;the man.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am in the minority here as I don&#039;t leave the Christmas lights up past mid-January.  I do this because when I first got into property management, as a manager of a 400+ unit apartment complex, my boss made me go to each tenant that had their lights up and ask them to take them down.  If they didn&#039;t comply I would then have to serve them a notice to comply with the community rules as stated in their lease agreement.  This was engraved in my head so I can be a scrooge about the lights being left up.  Having them inside a window does not bother me as much as if someone left them up on the outside of the house and especially if they still turn them on.]]></description>
