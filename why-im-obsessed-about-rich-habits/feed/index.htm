I took it that they&#039;re much more careful of &quot;brain dumping&quot; than others, which includes watching what - and how - they say things, yeah. I.E. they don&#039;t really care to gossip much or get into random arguments with no real point :)]]></description>

Yeah, good to think about for sure. But for motivational reasons, I like to assume if I do all those traits  (or don&#039;t do the bad ones), that I&#039;ll become wealthy too :) So no harm no foul!]]></description>

Btw, I have them all except the one about &#039;speaking your mind&#039;. I do that; always have and probably always will....]]></description>
