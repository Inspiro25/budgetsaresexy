Yup, gotta do what best feels right to YOU no matter what the others are doing. As long you do that I think we&#039;re on the right path whichever side of the money you fall on (and as long as you&#039;re okay with the consequences too! Some of those who &quot;live it up&quot; get mad stressed with money once the high wears off from their recent trip/car purchase... Gotta find that balance)]]></description>

I&#039;m one of those people that see both sides equally. I know people who spend like it&#039;s doomsday and KNOW they will work to 67 these are mid 40 year old couples. 

I know the opposite too people who save, save, save, and try like mad to be debt free.

My issue with the first is &quot;What happens if you get hurt or can&#039;t work?&quot; the other is &quot;Aside from normal family what type of life experiences can you afford living like that?&quot;

Fast forward a bit my neighbors are 57-58 have less than 100k &quot;they say&quot; and are going on trips, travelling, nice cars, nice house &quot;Mortgaged&quot;, but they live they do alot.  My teenage kids get jealous sometimes as their kids go to &quot;Italy, Mexico, Cruises&quot; its seems every holiday.

Down the street is Jesse who has 7 figures, drives a 10yr old truck, and is very frugal. 

So, what&#039;s the point? There is no right answer. We all will die for some the security of $$$ in the bank and a sound retirement is the reward. For others it&#039;s living each day to the fullest because our time is finite.

The blow it alls will regret it if tragedy strikes and the other group ask yourself on your death bed will you say &quot;Man, I wish I saved more money?&quot; or will you say &quot;I wish I lived more it went by so fast!&quot;]]></description>

Yes! That&#039;s the important part there. You have to be able to track progress or setbacks to really grasp the impact and better line up the game plan.]]></description>

One year, I  tracked every penny in and out for a year. I had it set up in excel, it only took a few minutes a day, and by the end of the year, I had a neat graph showing when exactly we started breaking even, and a pie chart breaking down down the expenses. I&#039;m getting back in practice, and I want to do this again next year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ll be about $400 over this month, but this is our month to get dug out from under a mess we got into. 5 months with hubby unemployed really threw a wrench into our lives, but the bleeding is over, we&#039;ve got the stitches in place, and it&#039;ll be a couple of months until we can start paying down the debts in a meaningful way again.]]></description>

Yeah! 30% is no joke!! It would be much worse with that piece out of the puzzle ;) So def. good job on saving/investing and living off the rest - that&#039;s not always easy to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, right now not much. Like many commenters above, I&#039;m routing much of my income (30% of gross) to retirement or savings accounts at the beginning of the month. But I still really wish I had something left over at the end, because I want to get sinking funds going for clothing, car stuff, entertainment, etc. But something *always* seems to come up to prevent my coming in on budget, and I dip into next month&#039;s slush or food budget, which then makes the next month tight and.... I need to get a handle on this. At least my net worth is climbing steadily, even if my end of the month money is consistently absent.]]></description>
