					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback from everyone.  Seems things like this happen more than we know, but we still never expect we are going to be &quot;that guy&quot;.  Bottom line is that it is a life changing event; I made a lot of mistakes when I first found out that I&#039;m now making up for.  I&#039;m not the same today as I was the day I found out, but nor am I, nor will I ever be that guy I was before finding out.  At first I was just full of a lot hate, desperation, and self-pity.  Now I&#039;m just living life again and hoping for the best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This story made sense to me.  Depression makes people do weird things--it&#039;s not just sitting in a room wanting to die.  I went through a minor depression a few years ago, and piled up a small amount of debt, but unfortunately left me with some bad money habits I&#039;m still trying to overcome.  I think Joe has done a fantastic job with all he&#039;s been through.  When life goes crazy, we can&#039;t always make the best decisions--hindsight can tell us what we should&#039;ve done, but until we get there, we have to make it up as we go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, forgive yourself. Then, pick the pieces up. Sell what you can and if possible get a second job to pay off the debt. You need to be willing to work and sacrifice in order to fix the situation that you created with your own irresponsibility. If you are not willing, then you cannot be helped. Also, Do not CONsolidate your debt. Debt consolidation is nothing more than a &quot;con&quot; because you think you&#039;ve done something about the debt problem. The debt is still there, as are the habits that caused it – you just moved it. Bottom line: Get back on the bandwagon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My heart goes out to this fellow. To flip from perfectly healthy without a care in the world, to &quot;you&#039;re going to die&quot; and back again like that is absolutely gut wrenching emotionally. I&#039;m an anaphylactic, and I&#039;ve been close to the end 3 times now, so I have an inkling of an idea about what he went through. It&#039;s going to take time for him to build back up to where he was, but I hope he&#039;s learned something from his experience. At the very least, I hope he learns that the most important parts of his life don&#039;t require vast sums of money, and that the toys are only temporary. He&#039;s already made a dent in what he owes, and I wish him the best of luck with the rest of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing all your thoughts &amp; words of advice everyone!  It&#039;s crazy that so many of you are currently experiencing diseases and heart aches like this :(  I don&#039;t know if I would be so free about telling everyone on a blog, so thank you for doing that.

This stuff affects everyone differently, but for me it gets me super sentimental and mushy.  I get so caught up in the day to day activities in life and I forget to *truly* appreciate what&#039;s happening right this instant.   I literally just held a baby for 20 mins right now and almost missed out completely because I was so determined to write this comment...  what&#039;s more important - my baby niece or this comment at this *exact* second, you know?

Anyways, I tell you guys this all the time, but thank you again for being so open here and supportive.  To me, to the guest post&#039;ers, to the stories we feature here - it&#039;s wonderful.  

@&lt;b&gt;Joe&lt;/b&gt; - Putting this stuff out like you do inspires me.  Keep being YOU.
@&lt;b&gt;Carrie&lt;/b&gt; - My heart goes out to you! I had no idea... as cheesy as it sounds, I feel closer to you :)  And also not in a stalkerish kind of way, haha... I think it&#039;s awesome you&#039;re improving your quality life the way you wish like that.  AND still saving, wow.
@&lt;b&gt;brewcitybabe4&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m sorry to hear your situation too :(  I think the best thing for you to do re: the money is to speak with a financial planner and set up a 2-3 year game plan.  There are so many ways you can make your money work best for you, and a planner could help you with the pros and cons and suggest the best route based on your situation.  Or, you can follow what feels the best for you and what would make you emotionally content.  There are always 2 sides to these things - the financially smart way, and the emotional one.  Sometimes they both align together, and others not.  But if you always choose the one that helps you to sleep at night better, I say you&#039;re on the right track :)  This doesn&#039;t directly answer your question, but hopefully it helps a little bit.

Guys --  Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems like when Joe was sick he had some regrets saving his money and becoming debt free. My advice to him would be to think back to why he had those regrets.
He has experienced both sides now (being almost debt free with retirement vs. having a large debt).  It sounds crazy but having both experiences gives you all the information you need to make the right choice for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can totally relate to Joe&#039;s experience. Five years ago I landed in the hospital on the verge of death and I completely understand the fear of being sick and dying. I didn&#039;t go on a spending spree, but I did spend time after my doctor&#039;s and hospital visits in stores trying to escape my situation. I didn&#039;t buy anything there, I just wandered around in a daze trying to avoid the reality of my life.

I think the key to life is living like every day as though it&#039;s your last. This doesn&#039;t mean you should spend all your money, but rather that you live in the every day moments of your life. That you truly experience the moments during the time you&#039;re given.

I just finished reading a great book called &#039;The Untethered Soul&#039;. It probably wouldn&#039;t be everyone&#039;s cup of tea but it talks a lot about living each and every moment to the fullest so that you do not fear death once it comes. The author points out that you don&#039;t need a bucket list to say you&#039;ve lived a full life.

One of my favorite passages reads, &quot;Don&#039;t be afraid of death. Let it free you. You should be experiencing life that&#039;s happening to you, not the one you wish was happening. Don&#039;t waste a moment of your life trying to make other things happen; appreciate the moments you are given. Don&#039;t you understand that every minute you&#039;re a step closer to death? This is how to live your life. You live it as though you were on the verge of death, because you are.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder how much information he had about his condition before he panicked. As I was reading this, I was thinking: metabolic syndrome, hmmm, not optimal, but a manageable condition. Then at the end he came to the same conclusion. So, I guess the first thing I would say is: make sure you fully understand the condition and/or get a second opinion before you do anything rash. 

I would also say that this is a good opportunity to, as they say, put money in its place. Sometimes as people who are very focused on personal finance it consumes us. Maybe your reader should look at this as an opportunity to readjust the role that money plays in his life. Is it really the MOST important thing?]]></description>
