YES!!! I did!!! We had originally planned on picking one up as we used to have one years ago with our first house, but then we completely forgot about it and no one brought it up at closing or anything :( I do think they can help, even if just for peace of mind.]]></description>

DO IT! Haha...

And then when they bitch and whine about how life isn&#039;t unfair in their teenage years you can show them the spreadsheet and see if it shuts their mouths ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A little known fact about home inspectors in VA - the licensing requirements are a joke. Until a couple of years ago, there were zero licensing requirements. Now it&#039;s like one 8-hour class. If I ever buy a house again my plan is to hire a general contractor for 1/2 a day to do the inspection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article and good advice!  When those unexpected, unavoidable expenses pop up, anything you can do to reduce the stress is worth trying.  Unfortunately, I&#039;m a single mom and my kids are students (net out-flows, big time!).  But maybe I can start a spreadsheet to tally up their &quot;share&quot;.  I&#039;ll probably never collect but it could be an amusing distraction!]]></description>

HAH!!! That&#039;s an interesting way of doing it!!! If our money weren&#039;t all combined I&#039;d try enacting it myself :) Hard to even remember it&#039;s 50/50 most times, at least for me...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I pay the bills in our house and keep a spreadsheet for all outgoing money, what date I paid it, and what 50% of that cost would be. When my SO venmo&#039;s me on the 1st and 15th for those expenses it feels like a paycheck from a second job (my pay days are the 8th and 23rd so it lines up nicely). It really helps take the sting out to get paid by my &quot;second job&quot; when I didn&#039;t have to clock any hours.]]></description>
