Yeah, I don&#039;t mess around with &quot;hiring&quot; my kids either to try and game the system... I wouldn&#039;t fare too well in jail :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is exactly why I Anti-budget. Save my intended savings goal off the top, then have no worries about where every last dollar is spent. If I don&#039;t spend it all by the next (monthly) paycheck, toss it in savings or brokerage and start fresh in a new month.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree that we can&#039;t blame others for our financial mishaps. There are no good excuses. But Amazon and Costco continually trick us. It takes practice to avoid the marketing traps. The trap that gets me is: &quot;It&#039;s on sale! Buy now before it&#039;s too late.&quot; We must remember that we always have the choice. Delayed gratification is critical to achieving any significant wealth. Great insights!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/real-reason-buy-stuff/#comment-254303&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

I could see that boy opening a Roth IRA at 16 when he gets his first W2 job.....I can see it mostly because I will make him.  I just wish I could find a way now to get my children some W2 or 1099 income right now so they could enjoy 50-60 years of compounding.  I don&#039;t have enough balls to hire them from my own company for advertising...]]></description>

Meh, I really don&#039;t see the appeal.  Maybe its just because I&#039;m a big dude but I&#039;d rather have a suburban or Yukon XL.  Really I&#039;d rather have a Ford Raptor SVT but that just seems like a ridiculous choice in a vehicle, fun, but ridiculous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like good coffee. That&#039;s why I buy it. There are no Joneses I&#039;m trying to compare myself to. 

Buying itself also feels good, which is why I&#039;m trying to remember that buying assets counts as buying. There&#039;s a childhood of deprivation that demands I take care of myself properly and not unduly deny myself.]]></description>
