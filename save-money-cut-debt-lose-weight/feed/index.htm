					<description><![CDATA[Excellent guest post!  Some people reading this may find it hard to believe that you graduated with a degree in Accounting and knew how to audit the financial statements of a publicly traded company but not know how to manage your own debt?  Which to me means that you knew even less about managing and understanding credit since they are both inextricably linked  But I definitely know better.  It&#039;s why I created my blog, the Amateur Consumer, because that&#039;s, in fact, what we all are - regardless of our level of education.  In 20 plus years of dealing with Credit and Finances, I have seen Doctors, Lawyers, and Engineers have bad credit. The reason?  Exactly what you just posted and I have been saying for a while; we are all amateur consumers.  There are no prerequisites for graduating high school or college that teach you about money consciousnesses, about having a spending plan, and understanding how credit and credit reporting work.  When you don&#039;t know these things going into the game of life, you find yourself in a position of working for debt and credit instead of making it work for you!  Loved the post! 
P.S  I am completely the opposite.  When I&#039;m stressed about finances or credit issues is when I actually intensify my workouts and even eat better (I know - strange :) It&#039;s the one thing I know I can control at the time so consciously, I refuse to compound my issues with hurting my physical well-being.  It has worked for me and helped me keep my head on straight.  I might not be here otherwise.  Again...great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true!  Stress biologically helps you put on those pounds...both through hormones and making you want to run to the fridge.  Back when we lived in caves the biggest reason for stress was not having enough food on hand.  So now when our modern, sedentary selves are stressed, we still crave that ancient cure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tend to be like Jordann, when I get stressed out I lose my appetite and my already-high metabolism skyrockets.  Once in high school I lost nearly 10 pounds in a week (and dropped below 100 pounds, eek!) because I got super, super stressed out.  But I also tend to weigh a bit more when I get more exercise, because I like weight training and when I slack off in the exercise department, I lose muscle.  

In fact, right now I weigh about 5 pounds less than usual because I slacked off on going to the gym over the holidays, then I got bursitis (ugh, that sounds like such an old person injury!) in my right knee and gave myself another gym break to let it get better.  I still haven&#039;t gotten back into going to the gym.  I may weigh less, but I feel kind of dough-y and weak, and most of my pants are too big now because I lost muscle in my lower half. :-(

But generally speaking, this Agatha&#039;s experience definitely makes sense.  Self control in finances almost certainly translates to self control in other areas.  Also, if you&#039;re trying to save money, odds are you&#039;ll cook at home a lot more, so in that case trying to control your budget is one in the same with a healthier diet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jordann&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m like you actually :)  If I&#039;m nervous/stressed I can&#039;t eat or do much really, takes a big toll on my body.  Luckily though I only get that way for a day or so and then it&#039;s back to normal!  So not the worst in the world :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holy cow, you look amazing at age 30 Agatha! You&#039;re right, stress leads to weight gain because you are not taking care of yourself first and foremost! Also I noticed when I got my finances in order, I was more disciplined...this transferred to many other things such as studying and maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is a great story Agatha! When I am stressed out I also gain weight. I eat when I&#039;m stressed. Especially since I have no set schedule in grad school. Great journey!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually found the opposite effect. When I&#039;m stressed, my appetite disappears. I could always count on exam time at university to shave off an extra 10 pounds. Now that I&#039;m more comfortable and less stressed, my appetite is back!]]></description>
