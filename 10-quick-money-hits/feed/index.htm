					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic tips - thanks for sharing Rita&#039;s newsletter. I just subbed.  There is so much know-how to be found on the net, it&#039;s great to have newsletters like this one..  Personally, I keep a well-curated list of the best tools for investors on my investor toolbox page as well. I like tools that help you to automate things, such as portfolio dashboards, performance trackers, etc. Anyways, keep up the good work, love your content! Cheers from Singapore, Noah]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the second one as buying food from flashfloods, not Flashfoods, as in buying food that is from a grocery store that was flooded LOL. Great idea though, I know there are non profits like We Don&#039;t Waste that do a similar thing to make sure of almost-expired food.  Whole Foods and Sprouts need to get in on that!

Last one was hilarious and yet scary, never thought of that. Great points in all!]]></description>
