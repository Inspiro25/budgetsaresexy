					<description><![CDATA[Awesome!  We&#039;ve started finding good ones at Safeway too - we just log on before we go, add them to our card or account or whatever, and then when we check out they&#039;re already there! Presto :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to my supermarkert&#039;s website this week and they had ecoupons for items that I actually buy, like the brand of organic baby yoghurt that we like and the string cheese I like in my lunches.  I didn&#039;t even have to print and/or clip them, I just added them to my club card and saved money on a few items that I already planned on buying.  I also went to the yoghurt company&#039;s website and they had a manufacturers coupon for the same youghurt.  Not all couponing is for bad food or things you wouldn&#039;t buy.  I often find, however, that the generic is cheaper than the brand with a coupon, even if it&#039;s on sale.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know how many of you have a Kroger in your community but I have found the Kroger Plus card to be very helpful. One option I use on the website is to download coupons on to my Kroger Plus card. It eliminates coupon cutting and you have access to all weekly specials. Another added benefit is that as you rack up Kroger points you can get 10 cents a gallon off of your fuel bill.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Andrea, in just about all stores I shop in (in NY) BOGO means just that. They do not allow you to take one at half price. In fact, years ago my local grocery store used to have almost everything priced at 2 for __, and you really had to take 2 to get the sale price.  The first item would ring up at regular price and only the second was discounted enough to make it come out at the 2 for price.  Supermarkets have generally veered away from the &quot;must buy 2&quot; or &quot;must buy 4&quot; promotions, but they do still sometimes have them.  You have to read the fine print. Also beware the fine print for promotions that call for a high minimum purchase.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Melissa &#038; Mark - coupons for produce and organic foods have traditionally been harder to find because the producers don&#039;t tend to have the big budgets that larger companies do, but we are seeing more of them!  My favorite sources include:

CascadianFarms.com
EarthsBest.com
HorizonOrganic.com and
MamboSprouts.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Denise,

Your response to Kitchen Penguin &#038; CM mentioned you are seeing coupons for produce on the internet?  Can you elaborate on where you are finding these?  How about unprocessed food?  A solid 80% of my weekly grocery trip is for produce and non-processed starter ingredients.]]></description>
