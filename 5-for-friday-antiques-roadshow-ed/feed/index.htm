					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, being able to SEE it every day would be nice! I love Picasso... and one day hope to at least own a small painting of his ;) They&#039;re all not *that* expensive since he pumped out so many in his lifetime, but we&#039;ll see if I get lucky down the road... I hear ya on the cable bill though, ugh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you ever scored an incredible antique deal before? nope

Have you ever been ripped off before? haha… with an antique, no. Repeatedly with my cable bill, yes…

If you could get your hands on one piece of priceless art – any kind you want (painting, sculpture, etc), what would it be? Leave the money part out of it – go with something you’d just be thrilled to own and show at your house :) A Picasso maybe. Actually, any fine art…but definitely a painting….I would love a focal point in my foyer. A Picasso, or Rembrandt (starry night) or ‘The Scream’….thats a great painting —Muntz or something, I think is the artist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.  Do you watch/like Antiques Roadshow? (Ever been?)   I have honestly never watched it.  My only real exposure to it was from the movie Grandma&#039;s Boy...

2.  What would YOU bring to it if you had the chance? (What’s the story behind it?)   If I could ever get it out of the house it was in...  On my mom&#039;s side of the family there is a hand written copy (with editing marks) of the star spangled banner.   We know it is authentic because that side of the family was related to Mr. Key and the smithsonian has authenticated it.  I just think it would be neat to bring it in to watch the appriaser go nuts over it.

3.  Have you ever scored an incredible antique deal before? Not that I am aware of.

4.  Have you ever been ripped off before?   Never really purchased anything that &quot;old&quot;

5.  If you could get your hands on one piece of priceless art – any kind you want (painting, sculpture, etc), what would it be?  I think getting something done by Banksy on a wall in my house would be pretty sweet...  I&#039;d promise to not reveal who he is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Erin&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  I didn&#039;t know you needed tickets? I thought you could just show up and try and get lucky?  I&#039;m gonna go to their site after this and try to get some... now I&#039;m SUPER curious as to how much this hand-painted wood Madonna we have is worth!  Plus, I think it&#039;ll be a fun challenge to try and conquer ;)
@&lt;b&gt;changeonabudget&lt;/b&gt; - What!  Really??? OMG that would have been great to watch. I haven&#039;t seen anything too crazy happen so far, but I&#039;ve only recently been watching.  I wanna know how much your typewriter is worth too :)  Do you actually use it?  Would be fun to type up a blog post on it and scan it in! Haha...  you should do that ;)
@&lt;b&gt;lorakathleen&lt;/b&gt; - Nice!!  So if you get the tkts, do they revie *everything* people bring?  Or do you have to get lucky enough to actually be seen too?  I know they only put the exciting ones on TV, but wondering if you actually get to speak w/ someone kinda like American Idol auditions... not that I&#039;d know, *ahem*.
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie S&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah OG!  I like original stuff too - even though they usually don&#039;t work as sexily as the newer knock offs ;)  I just hung this crazy awesome lamp up the other week and so far it&#039;s been workin&#039; great!  Old school for sure, check it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/p/PYi0A/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://instagr.am/p/PYi0A/&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... we get killed on our cable bill too!!!  Good one ;)  And MAN would a WW2 ring be cool to have!! No idea on the price of that either, but jeez - def. value just in cherishing that.  Thanks for sharing!
@&lt;b&gt;Leslie&lt;/b&gt; - Hey thanks! I&#039;ll be doing a small post about it shortly ;)  But don&#039;t get your hopes up, haha...
And WOW about that Stonewall Jackson portrait!  So cool y&#039;all donated it to the museum - that&#039;s great.  And don&#039;t get me started w/ the eyes following stuff - that always freaks me out!! The older the painting, the creepier it seems to get too! Haha... just like your Egyption cold curses, bleh! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey $J how&#039;d you do in the lotto?  Even though we don&#039;t play any more, I&#039;m living vicariously through your blog and hoping you win!

Anyway here are my answers:
1.Love it!  I haven&#039;t watched in a while because we have rabbit ears and getting them so PBS doesn&#039;t flake out is quite difficult.  I really miss the show, and the Newshour.  We need to get an antenna booster on the roof or something...

2.  My grandpa has this awesome Japanese woven silk piece hanging in his house.  He got it during WWII and apparently some of the threads are made of gold.  He tells the story that &quot;everyone else got kimonos, and I was bummed, but the guy said this was worth much more&quot;  I&#039;d love to see what it is really worth and maybe get more history behind it.

3.I haven&#039;t but my dad has.  His college roommate was a decendent of Stonewall Jackson and had an original portrait of him.  Not sure why it was in their dorm.  When they guy left for the year he forgot it, and my dad picked it up for free.  Turns out it was worth about $25,000.  We donated it to the National Portrait Gallery when we saw they had a small photocopy of the same painting instead of an actual painting.  You can still see it there with a plaque in memory of my grandma.  (Creepy painting - the eyes seemed to follow you)
  
4. Probably.  I don&#039;t want to learn about it though.

5. I&#039;d love to get something from ancient Egypt.  Something gold and awesome.  Not from a tomb though - no curses please!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you watch/like Antiques Roadshow? (Ever been?)   Nope, Nope

What would YOU bring to it if you had the chance? (What’s the story behind it?) 
I have a ton of old jewelry my Papou brought from Greece.   Greek gold jewelry isn&#039;t like ours, it is usually 22K.  It is probably worth some money (esp. in this economy) but not sure I can part with it.  I also have a great uncle&#039;s WW2 ring.  It looks like a class ring, but it says WW2, European Theater.  He stormed Normandy, and I&#039;m sure to war buffs the ring is worth alot.  But, again, not sure I can part with it.

Have you ever scored an incredible antique deal before? nope

Have you ever been ripped off before? haha…  with an antique, no.  Repeatedly with my cable bill, yes...

If you could get your hands on one piece of priceless art – any kind you want (painting, sculpture, etc), what would it be? Leave the money part out of it – go with something you’d just be thrilled to own and show at your house :)    A Picasso maybe.  Actually, any fine art...but definitely a painting....I would love a focal point in my foyer.  A Picasso, or Rembrandt (starry night) or &#039;The Scream&#039;....thats a great painting ---Muntz or something, I think is the artist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you watch/like Antiques Roadshow? (Ever been?)  When I do catch it, I love to watch it!  Never been or applied, only because I don&#039;t have anything worth it. (I prolly do, now that I&#039;ve said that.)

What would YOU bring to it if you had the chance? (What’s the story behind it?) My grandma has this TACKY plug-in/light up pic of The Last Supper.  It&#039;s gotta be at least 40-50 years old.  It&#039;s so tacky I&#039;ve asked her if I could use it for my Day of the Dead altar.

Have you ever scored an incredible antique deal before? Yup! Got 1950s clip-on bakelite (a vintage plastic that can be worth cash!) earrings for $0.25!  They were prolly worth at least $10/$15!

Have you ever been ripped off before? HAHA prolly, but I&#039;d rather stay in the dark on that.  It would just piss me off.

If you could get your hands on one piece of priceless art – any kind you want (painting, sculpture, etc), what would it be? Leave the money part out of it – go with something you’d just be thrilled to own and show at your house :) I would KILL for an original atomic kitchen light fixture.  The silver one w/all the little lights on the end.  there&#039;s knock-offs but I want the OG!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. I used to watch it all the time with my mom (I don&#039;t watch TV anymore), but I&#039;ve been twice!  It was awesome.
2. I took a couple things, but I really want to bring this awesome 19th century dresser that was handmade in the Texas Hill Country.
3. The aforementioned dresser. 
4. Not yet, I haven&#039;t had much time to spend antique hunting!
5. I love all art, but probably two a painting like Klimt or de Kooning and a marble sculpture from ancient Greece or Rome.  Awesome.]]></description>
