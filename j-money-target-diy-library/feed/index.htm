					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/j-money-target-diy-library/#comment-153167&quot;&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey! You found an old (but awesome) post here - woohoo!

Great questions. No, I did no cutting whatsoever :) I just assembled half of them and then used some brackets and screws to attach to the main shelf below it, as well as to the wall behind it (and also the roof in some places). I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the stablest, but I didn&#039;t plan on putting anything super heavy up there anyways so I think it&#039;s fine.

The nice part about using halves though is that you can cut costs on buying more units cuz you get two for the price of one ;) Just keep in mind that they do get uneven as the bottom half and the top halves aren&#039;t exact matches. But I kinda like the &quot;character.&quot;

Good luck if you&#039;re going to do something similar!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These look great! For the ones where you put half of another unit on top, did you have to cut it in half or did you just assemble half of a case? Did you have to nail them together (the top of one case to the top of another)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is awesome, J Money... 
Built ins are a huge trend these days (just ask HGTV), and you added them on the cheap.
They look great.

Here is a look at where I keep my books:

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J. Money, you can check out my green bookshelves here:

http://www.broketo.ca/2011/10/used-furniture-coat-of-paint-bargain.html

It&#039;s not the greatest picture, because I took it with my cell phone, but it made SUCH a difference to the entire room. It just brightened it up so much! This is actually the same colour as my bathroom, and I have a TV cabinet that was painted the same colour. (Though both of those painting jobs look much nicer than the bookcases, since my stepdad did those for me!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Oh don&#039;t you worry about that, we&#039;ve got more than enough scattered around the house that will be finding a new home there shortly ;) I just don&#039;t wanna fill it all up yet, cuz then I can&#039;t get more! Haha... I&#039;m gonna take it nice and slow. (That&#039;s what she said!)
@&lt;b&gt;Michael Senchuk&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, that&#039;s cool!!  What&#039;s wrong w/ that?  I&#039;m digging all those white boxes and binders - looks nice and organized! (okay, except for maybe those lower left shelves, haha... but that&#039;s easy to fix ;))
@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Money Mustache&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe, thanks.  I don&#039;t have the skills to make it a TRUE built in like some people over there ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Tyler S.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well that counts for at least 1/2 a point ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @ SimpleIslandLiving&lt;/b&gt; - And now you know it&#039;s super EASY (and CHEAP) to do too!  Just takes a little measuring and time to assemble everything.  Not a bad trade off ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Ella&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh I like it!  You totall covered the wall too, that&#039;s dope.  I don&#039;t blame you on not wanting to get rid of many of them - maybe you can just create more parts to your library so you can keep on adding to them? ;)  It only becomes a problem when you move, haha... 
@&lt;b&gt;The Happy Homeowner&lt;/b&gt; - Wowww that&#039;s awesome!!  I love crown molding but have nooooo idea where to start!  Wanna come over here next? I&#039;ll pay you in beer and pennies? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;I Am 1 Percent&lt;/b&gt; - Oh for sure - and THAT I could actually do cuz it requires no plastering or anything, right? I could just nail some of those bad boys in there.  Not a bad idea at all, thx :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... it&#039;s always a work in progress ;)  You should google for record organization ideas actually - I&#039;ve seen some clever ones that were super easy to do before! Or look on Pinterst - there&#039;s tons of library ideas on there, it&#039;s incredible.  I love having extra LPs around the house though, make everything so much more quaint.  Let me know if you find something good - I&#039;m not sold on the way mine are stored either ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Lindy Mint&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  Yup, plenty of books left to fill - just can&#039;t do it all at once or there&#039;ll be no more fun left ;)
@&lt;b&gt;John &#124; Married (with Debt)&lt;/b&gt; - If you&#039;re handy like that, it&#039;s probably the best way to go really.  You can customize the whole thing and then actually add value to the house!  Esp if you have lots of nooks and crannies... we got lucky w/ the way these fit in here, or this post may have never been written ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Tony&lt;/b&gt; - YUP!  That&#039;s *exactly* what I&#039;m going for actually, haha... it&#039;s dark on purpose!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job J!!! that looks great. I don&#039;t mean to hate, but it looks a little dark. If you painted the inside of the bookcases white it would bring a little more brightness to the room. Unless your looking for the pipe smoking , robe wearing look then go for it. =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this turned out great. Crazy how it fit perfectly under your ceiling. I need to do something like this, but I am toying with the idea of building one from scratch (though it will probably cost more to do so).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love how the fireplace fits in perfectly. Nicely done Mr. J! $300 is so little for such a lot of wall. 

I think you need some more books though. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this!!!  Maybe I&#039;m biased since I&#039;m a librarian, but I think no home is complete without a library. ;-)  

Right now my goal is to find a better way to organize the music portion of the library/music room.  We currently have more records than fit under the stand for our record player, so I need to come up with some sort of storage solution that doesn&#039;t involve a crate next to the piano.  Also, I recently decided to use one of the currently-underutilitzed built-in shelves for our CDs, which are a horrible mess, and for some inexplicable reason are still stored in a CD tower next to the fireplace in our living room, clear on the other side of the house from the library.  :-P]]></description>
