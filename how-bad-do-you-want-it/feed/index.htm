					<description><![CDATA[People always get really excited at the beginning of any major project (saving money, getting in shape, etc) but the people who stick it out get the results. I can&#039;t ever say enough about consistency. Showing up really is half the battle. 

But showing up often is more than just wanting it, it&#039;s having a very actionable plan and taking steps to reinforce your goals. I think that&#039;s why the FI community does so well and people find the graphs of increasing net worth and declining liabilities so compelling. It&#039;s the visual reminder you need to stay on track.]]></description>

I canceled cable until I realized how much money I spent going out to bars to watch college football and basketball games and it completely negated (or was worse) than the incremental cost of the cable + internet package. The ESPN&#039;s are the last thing stopping sports loving cord cutters.]]></description>

I think that&#039;s the whole missperception with early retirement actually - that once you reach it you&#039;re just chillin&#039; on the beach or being lazy. It&#039;s hard to imagine that someone smart enough to have reached E.R. would then do nothing with his/her life. People like that stay connected to the world, just not necessarily for pay (although most people I know who are &quot;retired&quot; still get paid, it&#039;s just they&#039;re doing stuff they love and because they WANT TO vs HAVE TO). 

In other words, &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/retiring-early-means-being-financially-free/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it&#039;s more about Financial Independence than it is &quot;not working.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; At least that&#039;s my opinion of it.

And since I know you like it when I keep it real, I figured I&#039;d share ;)

(Also, for what it&#039;s worth, you can reach E.R. without sacrificing too much... It may take a little longer, like in my situation, but I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever really sacrificed much on the path so far... It&#039;s amazing what you can be happy with when you commit to a goal)]]></description>

Hey, thanks! That really means a lot actually. I&#039;ve really tried hard over the past few years to focus on the way I say things as I know how easily people can get offended... Sometimes I fail and people unsubscribe (hah!) but I do try my best. It can certainly get tricky at times (like last week&#039;s debacle w/ Anton and his lies all over the internet, ugh...)

Took me FOREVER to get my true thoughts out while at the same time being careful!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of the time, people get lazy when they don&#039;t get immediate results, which hinders them or make them blind from fulfilling their dreams/goals. As a matter of fact, it is really hard to stay on top or get motivated at all times. But, having smaller goals is trick in here. Seeing these fulfilled one after the other is really motivating. If you want it so bad, you&#039;d better be a planner and strategic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. 

Putting away that much right away is commendable but its hard not to get burnt out when you&#039;re living on $90 a week. Fortunately for the client, he put away so much that he can probably slack a little and still be ahead of where he needs to be because he started so early. 

I save and invest regularly but I think people get too hung up on an early retirement. So you save a ton and sacrifice your whole life to retire at 45, then what? Sitting drunk on the beach gets old after a while. Find something that you enjoy doing and in which you can make a little money. Be happier and don&#039;t worry about retirement. 

Oh, and J$ some of us appreciate the realness. Keep it up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, you have to find a balance. Extreme actions can&#039;t last long. Life is a journey so you need to enjoy it now as well as later. The problem is most people just can&#039;t look ahead into the future so they are putting too much weight into living it up today. You can go extreme for a few years to get a good head start, then you probably need to step back to moderation. 
Anyway, good job guys.]]></description>
