					<description><![CDATA[@ J. Money - Yeah, the money comes out whenever you schedule it. For instance, if I need to pay you $10, I can have a check mailed to you by 7/26 and that&#039;s the date the money will be deducted from my account. Even if you don&#039;t cash it until September! 

This is how I can get around someone who isn&#039;t motivated to cash my checks. I actually pay my rent and give offerings in church by doing this. I have the checks delivered on payday, so I won&#039;t see all of that &quot;extra&quot; money in my account after I&#039;m paid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well truth be told I don&#039;t balance or deduct/clear anything ;)  I just log into my Checking account every day and make sure the balance is always $100 and up (which it should be if I&#039;m budgeting/tracking correctly).  That extra $100 is for times when I mess up or people take forever to cash their checks from me! haha...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have checks, but I rarely (if ever) use them anymore.  I don&#039;t carry them around with me either...that&#039;s what a debit card is for!  

As for receiving checks, I don&#039;t mind at all!  I love receiving unexpected checks in the mail!  The last one I received was for $0.23, which seems like an awful waste to me.  They spent more on the stamp than the check!  I&#039;ll deposit it, but it&#039;ll be a while...I&#039;m not spending more on gas for the trip to the bank than what the check is worth.  I&#039;ll wait until I receive another expected check before depositing it!

Also, I was wondering why you should be concerned with going over on your account if the person you sent the check to waits a long time to cash it?  If you deduct what you&#039;ve spent right away, then it&#039;s in the account...you can clear it later when it&#039;s been cashed.  I never wait until bills/payments have been cashed before taking them out of my account register...that&#039;s just asking for an overdraft!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ace&lt;/b&gt; - Shoooooot...I&#039;d have taken a check for $0.75 as a kid!
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - Rare breed = AWESOME breed too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah, I like your creativity indeed :) I&#039;ll agree that some bill collectors can be extremely sketch!!!  I plan on never having to find out personally too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;mbhunter&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ll tell you what. If any of you can find one of these for me I&#039;ll give you $10 for it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Adrian @ PIN&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s true, money is money.
@&lt;b&gt;eemusings&lt;/b&gt; - They&#039;ll be extinct one day :)
@&lt;b&gt;nyx&lt;/b&gt; - Believe me, it&#039;s not my preference.
@&lt;b&gt;Khaleef @ KNS Financial&lt;/b&gt; - Hmmm...does that actually &quot;take out&quot; the money from your account though as if it&#039;s already gone?  Or do you still have to wait for it to clear to not see it anymore?  Cuz if it&#039;s the latter, it&#039;s the same thing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually go a step further. I will set up the person as a vendor with my bank&#039;s online billpay service, and have the bank mail them a check for whatever small amount it is. This way the money is automatically deducted from my bank account on whatever day I schedule the check to arrive - so they can let it sit around if they want, but at least I won&#039;t have to keep remembering that little check is still out there!]]></description>
