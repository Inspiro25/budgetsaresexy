Oh wow - this is a blast from the past, haha...

If I recall our plan eventually crept up to the $1,000/mo range after having a couple of kids and the markets continuing to climb - ugh... So happy to have &quot;regular&quot; insurance now through my wife&#039;s work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice work...8 years later! Amazing how the pricing has evolved on some of these in only 8 years.   Small business option was definitely pretty high! 

I would totally pay the $3,504 these days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s awesome that you finally have health insurance again; it must be nice to not worry. I&#039;ve checked out eHealth Insurance before and loved it, so many options and sortable---they def. have a great site. I still don&#039;t have any yet. :-( I just can&#039;t really afford an extra few (or more) hundred bucks each month right now on just my honey&#039;s income. One day.....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just as financial companies rely on “credit reports” to establish credit for customers, insurance companies utilize “medical reports” to assess the health, determine the insurability, and set the price for insurance applicants and policyholders. 

Few consumers realize that the Medical Information Bureau Inc. (MIB), Ingenix Inc. and Milliman Inc. have personal medical report files on them. Like the credit-reporting agencies Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, these “nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies” monitor virtually every aspect of a person’s life. 

According to the the health insurance lobbying group AHIP, the MIB was founded more than a century ago and operates the most extensive database of medical information on individuals who have previously applied for health, life, disability income, critical illness and long-term care insurance in North America. These medical reports, which are “like credit reports for your health records,” have been created for more than 200 million Americans. Using information from these medical report files, insurance companies can charge you higher premiums or terminate your coverage altogether. For example, “Denied Insurance Because of a Medical Coding Error in Her MIB Report”

Remember, the new health care reform laws in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act don’t go in effect until 2014! All insurance applicants and policyholders should order an annual copy of their “medical reports” from the three nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies to ensure they aren’t overpaying for insurance or in danger of policy rejection or rescission for reported pre-existing conditions or errors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J - I don&#039;t buy your &quot;sleep better&quot; logic for choosing a high premium, low deductible plan. You should insure against major loss events and self insure the rest.  That&#039;s what real personal finance is about. If &quot;sleep better&quot; was that important, you wouldn&#039;t have gone so long without any insurance at all.  The best of both worlds is a high deductible, HSA eligible plan. Did you even investigate those?  An HSA is the best retirement investment vehicle ever created - no taxes in, no taxes out.  You should reconsider this move.]]></description>
