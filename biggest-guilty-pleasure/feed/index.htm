Yikes - high car payments are no joke. I won&#039;t try to convince you to nix &#039;em, but make sure you&#039;re at least saving in other areas to be able to afford the sexy car more :) no shame in prioritizing when you&#039;re cutting back in other areas you care less about!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh and I guess the thing I spend the second most amount of money on would be my car... my friend keeps telling me to sell it for one with a cheaper note, insurance, and maintenance ($300 for an regular maintenance... deep sigh) but I am NOT giving up my baby.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if I can call this a splurge, but I like buying expensive cuts of beef when I visit my family, which is not often.  Somehow those cuts taste better when one of my family members who is a very good cook prepares them.  Apart from that, I hardly ever splurge.]]></description>
