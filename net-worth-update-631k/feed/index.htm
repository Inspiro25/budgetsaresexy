Thanks ZJ... We&#039;ll find out in a couple of months when she either gets activated as an official gov&#039;t employee  (she&#039;s on a 1 year holding period) or she doesn&#039;t and gets let go ;) At least she&#039;d still have her degree though no matter what!]]></description>

Haha, thanks man... And true - factoring in those and other stuff in my house (coins, jewelry, etc) it would add more in, but I prefer to add stuff in only when they convert to cash :) so will happily await those days later if/when they ever happen!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been mentioned before, but your website(s) have significant value. If you included the monetary value of the business you own, you might just be a millionaire.

Cheers to the second comma!

					<description><![CDATA[Another update where you are chugging along I see! Thanks for your inspiration and for motivating me to get started on tracking my net worth as well! February was a funny month for investments like you said with all the politics stuff going on! 

Still wish you&#039;d get rid of that funny little car loan. It&#039;s so silly seeing you with that when your net worth is so high, but I guess they call it personal finance for a reason ;) 

My resolutions are still going strong and I even took it a step further this year in that I&#039;m actually posting my progress monthly to hold myself accountable just like these net worth updates! Here&#039;s to a great March!]]></description>
