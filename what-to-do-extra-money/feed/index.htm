					<description><![CDATA[Harps and blacksmiths??? You don&#039;t hear about those every day, haha... 

Awesome :)

Also, agree with this 100%: &quot; always turn it around and ask what they want to do with their lives because that’s what they should do with their money. &quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kind of hate when people ask this. I always turn it around and ask what they want to do with their lives because that&#039;s what they should do with their money. It&#039;s hard to balance a ton of different goals though, and there really isn&#039;t any easy answer on how to do that. You just have to spend some time thinking it over and deciding what matters the most.

My latest &quot;extra&quot; money things - 
A new harp - partially financed with the sale of my old one. Also, new strings and next month, probably a carbon fiber reinforced flight case. Fun stuff!
Investing in my husband - The blacksmith forge is still our big project, so we continue to stash money for that. We&#039;ve got a couple more masons to get quotes from and have to wait for the weather to warm up and then it&#039;s go time. We may end up doing some or all of this ourselves, but for now it&#039;s full on super cash stash!
Retirement - Now that I have a mortgage and property taxes, I can adjust my tax withholding. I shoved that extra money right into my 401k!

Upcoming &quot;extra&quot; money stuff -
5 year anniversary vacation
Fix our plumbing and driveway
Stash money for a rental property

Actually, it looks like I&#039;ve got a pretty nice balance going here. I&#039;ve got long term, short term, and a want on both lists. I might have to keep that going!]]></description>

Very interesting, I didn&#039;t know that... I count our 529 into my own net worth since it a) can be used for any of my kids or future kids, and b) I don&#039;t want my kids thinking they&#039;re &quot;owed&quot; this now once they&#039;re old enough to read my blog, haha... But I guess I can&#039;t convince colleges/loan companies to think along the same route ;)]]></description>

Do people still get things resoled?? I feel like it went away along with writing checks, haha... But I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s much much cheaper than rebuying - so good for you :)]]></description>
