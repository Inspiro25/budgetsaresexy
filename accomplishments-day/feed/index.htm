Killin&#039; it!!! Way to ask for that raise for sure - that&#039;s hard and most people don&#039;t go for it, well done :) (And thanks for letting me know the blog&#039;s been helping you!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea J.  It&#039;s easy to forget our accomplishments, even those that are fairly recent.  Also, I&#039;ve been tracking my net worth monthly for about three years now.  I don&#039;t comment often here and have been meaning to thank you for inspiring me to do that.

In 2017, I:
- Asked for a raise (kind of terrifying), and got it! 
- Increased my retirement contributions. I&#039;ve been steadily increasing for about eight years and am finally set to max out in 2018, so this feels like a particularly big win.
- Traveled to someplace new.
- Paid extra mortgage principal every month.]]></description>

Amazing!!! Even more so because $55,000 is like $75,000 when you factor in taxes and stuff from income! You did good! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My biggest accomplishment in 2017 was paying $55,000 toward my Parent Plus loans.  I can barely fathom earning that much money in a year, much less spending that much on any one thing.  Just think of all the things I could&#039;ve paid cash for with that money!  And I did it without depriving myself of anything, really.  I ate well, I went to concerts, I bought new clothes and traveled.

More than anything it taught me that I am perfectly capable of controlling my money.  It&#039;s a lesson I&#039;ll never forget.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/accomplishments-day/#comment-263101&quot;&gt;Janet&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Janet, I struggled with asthma from age 6 to 37.  It was getting worse and meds not helping.   Then, in May of this year I quit eating dairy products due to some dietary changes my wife was going through (milk, cheese, butter, ice cream).  The asthma has virtually gone away, and I lost 20lbs.  So many people struggle with asthma and the doctors tell us there is no cure, and I want to pass this experience along.

PS - J Money I saw your story in Forbes this weekend and it inspired me to finally start my blog yesterday (after a decade+ of procrastination and excuses) and I expect you’ll see a lot more of me.]]></description>
