I agree - credit unions are great!

There&#039;s actually a few of them listed in this list too ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J. Money,

You&#039;re missing a big point here. Banks often tip consumers off. Credit unions are often better choices.

Thanks for the info on both of these! I wouldn&#039;t want to tie my money up for that long either - unless it&#039;s a portion of my Emergency Fund which rarely gets touched. I wonder if they&#039;d still pay out a portion of the interest if you did have to withdraw too early? I just learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/go/worthy-bonds&quot;&gt;WorthyBonds.com&lt;/a&gt; does that - a newer player on the scene offering great rates as well...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[United States senate Credit Union has a 60 mos cd at 3.56% with $1000 minimum.  I&#039;m thinking about joining and opening up a cd there.  I&#039;m just not sure baout tying up money for 5 years.  I think rates on shorter time frames will rise.  Any thoughts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A very nice list and it includes many of my favorites. I have a few other recommendations. Sorry this is a little long, but these additions really are the best and help me make the most of my money... 

1) Discover Bank: Their checking account has 1% cash back rewards when you use a debit card and free paper checks. Like several of the other banks on this list, you get free ATM access at Allpoint ATMs. Those are usually at places like CVS, Walgreens, etc. I also have a high-interest savings account with them. It&#039;s not 2.45% like the CIT Bank Savings Builder account (awesome BTW), but it&#039;s competitive. I also have a Discover credit card and use it for the 5% cash back when it&#039;s the best deal. Discover will match all of the rewards you earn during the first year, so that&#039;s a really great incentive if the 5% cash back categories work for your life. Unlike Chase Freedom, Discover releases its 5% cash back calendar for the entire year. For 2019, it&#039;s grocery stores for Q1; gas stations, Uber &#038; Lyft for Q2; restaurants for Q3 and Amazon.com for Q4. Who doesn&#039;t spend money in those categories? 

2) Barclays Uber Visa: This is a fantastic credit card with no annual fee. Perks include 4% cash back at restaurants, 3% on travel, 2% for online purchases and 1% elsewhere. In addition, you get a $50 annual streaming credit if you spend $5,000 on the card. My favorite perk is free cell phone protection. Pay your cell phone bill with this card and you&#039;re protected up to $600 if your phone is stolen or damaged. Finally, there&#039;s a $100 sign-up bonus. Rewards can be redeemed for cash back, gift cards or Uber credits at the same value. I pair this card with the American Express that you mentioned for 6% cash back at grocery stores.]]></description>

Hey, thanks! I only put like $200-$300 on it every month so prob wouldn&#039;t make a difference, but this is good to know for the future for sure (and anyone else reading this right now) :)]]></description>

Oh good! I always hear good things about it but never know anyone who actually has one, haha...
