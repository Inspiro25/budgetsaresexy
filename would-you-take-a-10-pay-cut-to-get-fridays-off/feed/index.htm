Agreed. Which is super tough being self-employed too :( One of the things I miss about a 9-5 where you can leave work at work (at least the 9-5s I used to have).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes. Yes. and More Yes. I honestly think we as a culture (American&#039;s) work too much and it contributes to many of the high incidences of preventable illnesses that afflict our country. My boss brought 4 day work weeks one time as a threat along with the pay cut and the entire staff was for it, she has not utilized that tactic since.

I found this article from last weeks NY Times interesting though (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/your-money/the-unspoken-stigma-of-workplace-flexibility.html?pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0) , as there definitely is a flexibility stigma in several workplaces. It&#039;s so bad at our office that not a single person took advantage of the early summer hours offered by my job 3 years ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love my job but I would consider that offer. But not every Friday though. Just when I think I need a much-deserved break and I think I will need the whole Friday and the weekend to re-energize. It&#039;s amazing what a day can do without having to think about your work and just enjoy the day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not a bad deal, although I&#039;m not sure if I would take it. Yes, he is technically working 1 day less, but the other 4 week days are going to be especially stressful, so he WILL need the Friday off to recuperate. Combine that with a pay cut and the gig doesn&#039;t begin to sound too good...

Unless he was doing something much more profitable on Friday, and the pay cut will be offset by new income.]]></description>

It definitely is fun to think about. I love seeing how companies are becoming more flexible for their employees. It totally could be possible one day!]]></description>

Either way, it&#039;s fun to think about :) Never know when it&#039;ll come up either by you or your employer!]]></description>

I was just telling someone the same thing! Overworking can tend to lead to less productivity and creativity - all depending on what the job is. The times I&#039;m officially off the clock are usually when the nuggets of wisdom strike here :)]]></description>
