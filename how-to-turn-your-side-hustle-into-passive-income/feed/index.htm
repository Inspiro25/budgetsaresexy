					<description><![CDATA[Great info Zach, and congrats for being able to Productize Your Knowledge! I do trade time for money but this time I feel it is on my own terms. I am social media marketing manager for a great company. For so long I have worked jobs with only one thing in mind &quot;MONEY,&quot; and that&#039;s all that mattered, but I was miserable and hated it. I&#039;ve always loved how I could create really amazing relationships with people through social media and even helped others boost their businesses just by creating the right relationships through their networks and promoting. I finally decided to make this a career and no school necessary which was a plus. I&#039;m just good at it and have the tools. I love what I do!! Unfortunately there are way to many people selling courses, books, and lessons about social media marketing so It would be tough product to sell.]]></description>

Agree that it definitely takes work up front to productize your knowledge. Once the initial hard work is done though, it can turn into a passive income stream that pays you over and over again. It&#039;s just a matter of committing the time to make the product at first.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agree that productizing your knowledge can get you out of the time for money trade. That being said, you still have to sell those products, which entails a lot of different skills such as social media, online advertising, pricing, etc. I have productized some of my consulting services, and it&#039;s great having that stream but it&#039;s still a small fraction of my billable hours, even though I have worked with specialists to grow it. I still agree that it&#039;s worth it to start that business, but it&#039;s not as simple as build it and people will come.]]></description>
