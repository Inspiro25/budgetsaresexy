					<description><![CDATA[This was great! I completely agree that being up this early is like being part of a secret club. And I&#039;m right with you about being a little disappointed when the sky starts to brighten. It&#039;s amazing how much more productive I am in the morning compared to any other time in the day. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s just that I&#039;m most awake at that point, or that I have so many fewer distractions and so much less interference compared to later in the day.

Have you ever attempted his plan for moral perfection based on the 13 virtues from his autobiography? I have my students attempt it in class each year, and it&#039;s a pretty fascinating exercise. He had his faults for sure, but how consistently he worked to improve himself and the lives of those around him is pretty admirable.]]></description>

Waking up one hour before you normally do :) And then making sure to focus this time on YOU or things you love/want to accomplish.

The time itself isn&#039;t that important, it&#039;s the habit of waking up earlier and setting the tone for the day. Otherwise it&#039;s just rush-rush-rush as always!]]></description>

Agreed! I haven&#039;t been able to sit still long enough to meditate myself (after about 20-30 mins of praying/thinking/reading I get the itch to walk over to the computer now), but I bet it would be pretty amazing to pull off if you can figure out how! I haven&#039;t done so well on the exercising parts either like I thought I would eventually, but that&#039;s next on my list to try and finagle... at least I&#039;m still waking up early! :)]]></description>

Today marked work day #95 in a row waking up around 5am :) Some days I&#039;ve accidentally slept in, and others I&#039;ll wake up around 5:20 instead, but more or less I&#039;ve kept the morning routine going ever since trying this out. Pretty miraculous for someone who used to sleep in until 11am at one point!]]></description>

Haha yeah... I literally have 3 alarms set just to make sure I don&#039;t sleep in :) And I&#039;ll often get up after the 3rd one if I stay up too late the night before! I haven&#039;t been able to get back to sleeping early now that the habits have become &quot;normal.&quot;]]></description>
