I hear you on both accounts! Haha...

I will say this though, once the forums get going you can tell who the super fans are and they make great moderators helping the convos flow better. So while it can be a lot of work to get going/maintain, over time your users can help out a lot with it as well. In fact, if I recall Mr Money Mustache didn&#039;t even start - or manage - his own forums! His fans offered to create it for him and he let them at it... And you can see how smart of a call that one was :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back! That&#039;s a pretty cool deal by partnering up, selling, and getting some development expertise. Yakezie.com is broken since it hasn&#039;t been up updated since 2009! Can&#039;t even upload an image haha. But, I just keep publishing there every so often, collecting some passive income, and building some links.

Man, I&#039;m afraid to launch my forums. Feels like so much work. Don&#039;t wanna do it as I&#039;ve been sitting on it for months now!

					<description><![CDATA[Gah! I don&#039;t know how I missed this post! Yeah for sabbaticals. I highly recommend them for the exact reasons you stated. Each one I&#039;ve taken has paid off big time in both life satisfaction and considering/pursuing new directions.

Reading the top of this article, I couldn&#039;t stop grinning. I&#039;m SO HAPPY for your four epiphanies. THAT&#039;s why successful people are successful. Pivot in the directions you want and the rest comes together. LOVE IT! You be you J$...U2U (good idea for a T-shirt, eh? ;)]]></description>
