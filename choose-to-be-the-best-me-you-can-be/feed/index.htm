					<description><![CDATA[I like stories like these.  They help one take stock and appreciate what we we currently have.  For one reason or another, I have never been allowed to reach the financial point LB had.  The way I see it is there are too many &quot;financial aid&quot; crutches around me.  This is something I don&#039;t like, haven&#039;t liked for a long time.  The road to independence has seemingly been slow thus far, frustrating at many times.  As you say, one can only focus on being the best &quot;me&quot; they can be at any given moment.  There is no such thing as 110%, 101%, or even 100.00000001%.  The most a person can do is give life 100%, doing so I believe will bring happiness.  It&#039;s the times you don&#039;t give it your all or spin your wheels (110% ;) despair sets in.

I&#039;m happy to have found these blogs as I&#039;m not content with sliding through life like the majority around me.  It has only been a week and I&#039;m already changing the way I view the world around me.  There is even the itch to start up my own blog.  Me, a person who at one point in life felt he couldn&#039;t share his thoughts with those around him.  Like everyone else, I&#039;ve gone through my own personal struggles.  If sharing my experiences helps someone through their hard time then that will be awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your story really resonated with me. I went through a prolonged period of stress fairly similar to yours. It was mentally exhausting to get through each day. And hope and faith were the only things that helped me get through that financial crisis. What a wonderful post! You are an inspiration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading about your situation brought back a lot of memories for me, although yours was so much more worse. Mine happened many years ago, and to this day, I still get a tear in my eyes when I think how thankful I am for what we have. It&#039;s called the &quot;school of hard knocks&quot; I guess and some of us have a doctorate degree. You will never forget those lessons that you learned and I commend you and your husband for sticking with it and not tossing in the towel. Really enjoyed your article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[YAYY!!! Look at all this love and support going on, this is what the internet should be like! POSITIVE stuff floating around and everyone helping each other out - Thanks for leaving all these comments for LB, you guys are awesome :)

And, &lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt;, thank YOU for pouring yourself out there and helping to inspire others! A great way to start the new years off (which I must admit was my sneaky plan once you send this to me, haha...), and an even better reminder to continue pushing forward and having hope. Good things will come in time!

I&#039;m going to share your note about Cordelia too to her, as I&#039;m sure she&#039;ll just LOVE hearing her posts are helping people :) Her &quot;quits&quot; series are one of my favorites too!

A couple other quick comments:

@&lt;b&gt;Heather Stephens&lt;/b&gt; - I agree with that (&quot;there&#039;s never a really wrong choice&quot;). There may have been some that was better than others, or more helpful/etc, but since you can never turn back time anyways it does no real good except to learn from things and continue doing your best to push forward. And most times you picked the right decision at the given point in time anyways :) It&#039;s not like you can&#039;t change your mind later too! That&#039;s my favorite part about life - you have the power ANY DAY to make a change and send yourself down a new path for the future. It&#039;s awesome.

@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - $10??? That&#039;s crazy! So cool about Craigslist though, it&#039;s nice to see there is still so much good in the world! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent story.  I often feel my financial situation is a hole I will never be able to did myself out of you but I was never as rough off as you were and I always had family to fall back on.  I have never asked for help from family but I feel more secure knowing the help is always there if I need it.  

I am taking steps to feel more positive about my financial future and prepare for lean times and it helps me to feel more powerful as a single mom.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John S @ Frugal Rules – Congrats on being able to climb out of such a dire situation.  I am thankful for all such organizations out there that help people in need.  I am very thankful for the one that helped me and I hope I can continue to give back to them in the future.

The Happy Homeowner – I agree that putting it all out there sucks at times.  There are days on my blog when I think &quot;why do I want everyone to know how much money I make&quot;?!?!?!  Then I remember why I do it, because I want to help other people learn from my mistakes and choices.  If I can help one person, then all is well.  Thank you for the complements!

K.K. @ Living Debt Free Rocks! – (BTW, love the title of your blog!)  Thank you for the words of encouragement, as I truly hope to help many more people down the road.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate you sharing your story and especially that you now are giving back to those who are now in the same position that you were once in.  I&#039;ve been through a financial wringer in the past and can appreciate the emotions that you expressed.  Continue to remain true to thine self!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing this--as someone who also has had a pretty rocky financial past, I know it&#039;s not always easy to &quot;put it all out there.&quot; You&#039;re a resilient, strong, independent person--you&#039;ll knock whatever goals you set out of the park! Best of luck to you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for sharing LB! We had good friends that were blessed by the same charity a couple of years ago and I know it meant the world to them. We got very close ourselves to having to use it soon after we were married but have been able to climb out of the situation...slowly but surely. Keep up the great work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Budget &#038; the Beach – I wrote this story the day I gave back to my local food bank.  It was such a relief to end that part of my life.  It felt like complete and utter closure.  When I contacted J. Money about featuring this story it was hard for me to bring up memories other than what I had written down already.  It felt like I let it all go, but I hope to remember just enough to keep me moving ahead in life.

Edward Antrobus – The only reason I knew about the food bank idea and the emergency food box, was because my local news station had written a story on it.  The story showed us even a college kid scraping by can get an one-time emergency food box. The food box I was given allowed me to feast for a month!  Some farmers and grocery stores in my area donated sweet potatoes, bananas, and beans.  They allowed us to take as much as we wanted, even though we were only there for an emergency.  I am so glad you did find help, because Thanksgiving is a special time to celebrate food and family.

AverageJoe – Thank you for your positive words.  My story does help me overcome every day obstacles and allows me to strive hard in school.  Nothing is as hard as that time in my life was, and I use that knowledge to my advantage every day.

Cat – I really am sick of having people tell me I don’t have enough, or I am not doing the “right” things with my money.  That day I read a post from Cordelia Calls it Quits, about quitting things in life.  She made me realize that I wanted to quit letting those memories and everyone else run my life.

Thank you J. for letting me get my story out there and...

To everyone for the amazing words of encouragement!  I am so thankful where I am in my life right now, that sometimes I think it isn’t going to be around tomorrow.  I truly am happy and feel I can move on from that time in my life with a smile and my head held high.]]></description>
