I&#039;ll cheers to that, Sam.  So grateful for the big returns in 2020 and 2021, and we can&#039;t be sad that some of it (only a fraction at this point) has been taken away :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[January was definitely down for us as well. So sad to no longer make easy money! But we got to be thankful for how much we’ve made since 2020 alone. Nuts!

Here’s hoping we don’t go into a recession.

Yep! And for those that followed J$ all the years, he had massive swings month to month in net worth. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth/&quot;&gt;summary of reports&lt;/a&gt; show a pretty bumpy journey.  But non of those losses were actually losses, as you said only selling makes them real.
Cheers Steve have a great week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[January was a six figure down month for us in our net worth, but as the richest Arkansan said, &quot;Its just paper.&quot;  Sam was mostly pre computer age, he&#039;d have to rehab that quote now to say Its just numbers on a screen.   Its not real until you make it real by selling, which you&#039;d never do in a panic.  I think it just adds to your credibility to share bad market outcomes.  People just starting out need to see how successful people can take what amounts to loss of a years salary (for many) in stride.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As encouraging as these net worth updates are, you brought it home with the fact that even with your networth down, you still enjoy your life, pursue your hobbies, and do things that make you happy. In the grand scheme of things you can&#039;t obsess over the numbers, just work on the trends and enjoy your time in life!

Also nice plug there Joel, congrats on becoming a non-childless household soon!]]></description>

Yeah I was thinking about that the other day... If I can&#039;t stomach a 50k downturn today, it&#039;s gonna be hard to stomach a 200k downturn when I&#039;m older and have 4x the wealth we have today.  And I agree -- complete first world problem to have.

Hope all is well with your IF... have a great weekend. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The tough part about tracking your net worth is that the more you accumulate over time, the more you stand to lose during a market downturn. Talk about a first-world problem! Even still, it&#039;s never fun to see such a big number in red. As long as those are long-term investments, though, it&#039;ll merely be a blip on the radar.]]></description>

Hey there Working Mom!!   I completely agree with you!  Only reason I had cash to dump in this January was because we sold a rental property in December so I held some of the proceeds in cash until Jan for the Roth accounts.

Usually, I just invest every spare dollar into our after-tax brokerage. Then, come January, I withdraw 12k from our aftertax brokerage and stick it in the Roths (6k +6k). There&#039;s a few days gap where the money is not invested, but otherwise it&#039;s all working for me, all the time.

I think saving cash throughout the year just to do a lump sum has been proven time and time again to be worse off than dollar cost averaging every chance you get :)

Love that you&#039;re in it for the long haul! Keep up the good work :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very similar situation! I&#039;m 39 and our net worth went down $34k this month.  Losses in all retirement accounts, 529s and invested HSAs, small brokerage account. Lifestyle doesn&#039;t change at all because we&#039;re in it for a long haul. Shortest horizon is 6 years away from accessing college money.

I am always interested in the &quot;lump sum vs dollar cost averaging&quot; when people seem to be saving-up that lump sum throughout the year to invest in January the next year. Where do you keep it during the year? In cash? Isn&#039;t that missing out on investment time by not investing it until the next January? I guess it makes sense to get-ahead-a-year at some point, kind of like getting a month ahead on your budget (a YNAB principle) but having trouble wrapping my mind around keeping it in cash in 2021 to dump it in Jan. 22 vs putting some in every month in 2022. Seems like you&#039;d get a 1 year advantage 1x but hasn&#039;t been attractive enough for me to try saving up 12k on top of normal contributions and holding it until the next Jan.]]></description>
