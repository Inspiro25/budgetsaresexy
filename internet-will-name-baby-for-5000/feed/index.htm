					<description><![CDATA[For $5000, probably not. I&#039;d have to be closer to the situation to decide the amount... if was an amount large enough to set up a trust fund that could give the kid a little bit of reasonable comfort for the rest of his life -- maybe $1 million -- then I don&#039;t see how I could turn that down... especially since the yet unborn child isn&#039;t signing the contract and could thus switch to a more sensible name at age 18.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lover of money or not, I am not prepared to allow this - I would like one day to have the whole share of the blame that will rain on me for naming my son. He ended up with a good king&#039;s name (Philip) but I was planning to name him Ferdinant or Sigmund (Ferdo or Ziggie). I figured if he survived on the playground with a name like that he&#039;ll be OK in life :).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chubba-Wubba-kinda has a ring.  I don&#039;t know people, I&#039;m sort of in the &quot;this is a bit too far&quot; boat with this one.  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s an amount of money that would convince me to give up naming my own child.  I mean really-I put a lot of thought into my daughter&#039;s name (I have a really bizarre last name).  My mom and I talked about it and decided on the name we did because of its Biblical significance, and because of the historical reverence paid to the name.  While it&#039;s a fairly simple name, it still means much more than &quot;this is my name&quot;; it&#039;s the process I went through, with my mom.  And she actually really likes her name!]]></description>
