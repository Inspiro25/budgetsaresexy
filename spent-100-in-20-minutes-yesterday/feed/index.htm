					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know where you are in the country, but $100 for 2 items in a mall that could easily have cost you double ($70 jeans at Gap, $120 shoes at Foot Locker) - not bad! It shows that you thought about it even though it was a splurge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree.  I budget to spend less than my take home (the rest goes to savings directly so I never see it).  I also budget an additional amount for savings.  That way I can &quot;spend the heck&quot; out of the rest of the money and still be right on track.  So I try to look at my budget as an amount &quot;to spend&quot; rather than telling me &quot;not to spend.&quot;  Sometimes I still end up with money left over at the end of the month and that&#039;s fine.  Other times I&#039;m right at the edge and feel like I had a good (and enjoyable) month!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I learned my lesson last week.  I&#039;m not buying any clothes for one year (don&#039;t ask- my husband convinced me it was a good idea in a moment of weakness).  I do need running shoes though!  I purchased a pair a bit different from my regular wonderful amazing shoes (a mere $140) that make me float because they were &#039;only&#039; $100.  I ran 1 mile and my feet were going numb.  I returned them promptly and got the $140 pair.  And yes, I am back to floating while I run!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think your right about how allowing yourself to spend really makes budgeting easier.  For me, it seems like if I know I can, it takes the want away from a lot of different items.  If I know I&#039;ll allow myself the same amount to spend next week, I&#039;m quicker to pass it up, knowing if I still want it, I can get it next time.  Otherwise, it&#039;s like a binge-eater who&#039;s starved themselves for three weeks.  Once you finally decide to eat, you&#039;re naturally going to gorge yourself.]]></description>
