Ugh, that&#039;s the worst... But you can&#039;t help people who don&#039;t want to be helped! I learned that doing money coaching myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I worked at my church to help others get out debt and found most didn&#039;t want to work or change their habits.  They would pray and hope and not much action.  I eventually moved on and help less religious people because they are goal and action based.  I still go to the church, but I just keep money and religion separate now.]]></description>

Fascinating man!!! Such a cool opportunity to be able to have that chat with him - wouldn&#039;t have ever guessed it when you first started the blog, eh? :)

&quot;In the end everything we’re given is His, and releasing that ownership is actually quite freeing.&quot;

Never thought of it that way before - I&#039;m gonna have to let that puppy sink in!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/god-does-not-want-us-to-be-in-debt/#comment-256214&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks J for the link love my friend!  I actually had the opportunity to talk with Dave Ramsey on the phone after that article you linked above, and he told me about some of the vitriol that comes his way because of that house, even from many Christians. The problem is that much of the good that comes from the house isn&#039;t really advertised.. He has already raised millions of dollars for charity from events held at his beautiful home, and the home is used as a conference center of sorts for leadership events and other things for his business.  Yes, he could have bought a tiny home, and given the money he would have spent on it to charity, but in some ways having the larger home allows him to have a larger impact.

For me, I believe that God wants us to be good stewards of our money, planning ahead, saving for the future, all while giving to others and finding ways to help those in need. In the end everything we&#039;re given is His, and releasing that ownership is actually quite freeing. 

When it comes down to it there are so many resources these days for people to become educated and find ways to improve their situation, and those in the church have to do a better job of helping people to improve their situation, while not making money the ultimate focus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Money is neutral. A knife can either be used to prepare a delicious meal, or to stab someone.
Money&#039;s definitely a tool to be used and mastered, not the other way around. 
I think a lot of faith-followers have a tough time differentiating here. 

Appreciate Gloria&#039;s thoughtful writing! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/god-does-not-want-us-to-be-in-debt/#comment-256196&quot;&gt;Krystal @ Simple Finance Mom&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh, I&#039;m so sorry to hear that your friends from church as giving you a hard time about being good with money!! What Gloria says is so true - managing money well isn&#039;t the same as worshipping money. As you say, good money management actually puts us in a position to be free of financial stress in our own lives and to be a generous influence in the lives of others. The idea that &quot;Money is evil&quot; is a misquote! It&#039;s &quot;the love of money&quot; that is a root of all kinds of evil - not money itself, and not good money management. Krystal, you keep on growing your wealth and using it as a tool to do God&#039;s will in your life. Perhaps some day you&#039;ll be in a position to teach others how to do the same - especially at your church : )]]></description>
