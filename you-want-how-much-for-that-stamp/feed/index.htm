I have plenty baseball cards from back in Nolan Ryan days, all still in new condition untouched. I think I&#039;m going to try to tell them offshore and see how much I can get. This way, I can use the $ gUaP $ for big PPC ad spends in the near future. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have special edition comic books from 1990-1991 bran d new still in the plastic untouched that I&#039;m looking to sell. So I was thinking maybe try Etsy or somewhere online. Stopped by a comic book shop and the guy there @ the time had the nerve to tell me that they won;t be worth much. Too bad for him because I hope to sell some to billionaires online in which I know I can perhaps, someway, connect with them and make sales. If you know of any sites that I can sell comics on in or out of the U.S., gimme a holler. :-)]]></description>

Only you would think of that, Hank!

But seriously, his name is Ed Brands and he really did settle in the Pacific NW after leaving active duty for the Reserves.  I ran into him again a few times between 1992-94 when he was on active duty at COMSUBPAC in Pearl Harbor.]]></description>

I don&#039;t remember my first stamp amount, but I did come across a bunch of 1 cent and 3 cent stamps the other year while cleaning out a drawer... If only I had enough to add up to a single mailing so I could use them up and see if I could cover the entire front envelope! ;)]]></description>
