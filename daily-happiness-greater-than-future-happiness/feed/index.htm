					<description><![CDATA[Hi J,

Yeah it’s definitely tough at that stage of a FI journey to enjoy the moment instead of obsessing about your FI future. I remember that very well.

I try to shoot for a balance, doing things that bring happiness in the short and long term. But achieving that balance for all days is challenging. 

Sometimes I find a good dopamine reset is needed - there are days when little to nothing enjoyable happens, and I try to remind myself that I&#039;ll enjoy the good times a lot more as a result. A classic Bob Ross quote: &quot;Gotta have opposites, light and dark and dark and light, in painting. It’s like in life. Gotta have a little sadness once in awhile so you know when the good times come.&quot;

A couple tips that I find really help me: 1. Focusing on gratitude, which helps my short and long term happiness levels, and 2. Focusing on being proactive vs reactive, which can help a ton with enjoying a job a lot more (and find new income sources to quicken the pace to FI even further if desired).]]></description>

Wow - that&#039;s a helluva routine, I dig it! Do you have all those things at YOUR HOUSE?? 

Great goal for us all to shoot for --&gt; &quot;The ability to just sit quietly and be happy in the moment, in that moment – is how we achieve mental health. &quot;]]></description>

Future goals are pretty exciting :)

Fortunately daily goals can be too! And you reach them much faster! lol...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually - happiness is a second by second thing in our consciousness.  I have to be happy in my own skin.  The ability to just sit quietly and be happy in the moment, in that moment - is how we achieve mental health.   When we stack or append happy seconds together - we get happy hours (not that kind) and eventually happy days (no, not that one either).  In order to maintain this for consecutive days - I need a re-set.  I get my reset ~5 times a week by moving my body (whether stretching, aerobic, push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups) - and importantly - by 20-25 minute sauna at 180 degrees, dip into pool; steam room with eucalyptus, followed by dip into pool, then a jacuzzi followed by dip in pool.  These heat / cool cycles create a &quot;reset&quot; of my brain and body.  I am pain-free and mobile - and maintain happiness more easily.  That&#039;s my secret to being happy in my skin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Man, I needed this one. I also find myself having to fight to live in the present moment rather than fixating on the goals and dreams of the future which feel so much more exciting. Thanks for this!]]></description>
