@&lt;b&gt;Jessica @ Faith Permeating Life&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! Thanks so much for coming out again, it really meant a lot :)  And I totally agree that *experiences* are where it&#039;s at! My Aunt ALWAYS gives us one ever year and I love it :)  Have a great week!
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - YES! Was soooo fun meeting you in person finally :)  I&#039;m such a huge fan of yours!  Thank you for EVERYTHING you&#039;ve helped w/ over the year, you are an incredible person.  Hope you had a great Christmas!
@&lt;b&gt;Peliroo&lt;/b&gt; - Gift cards are awesome, I&#039;m always about them no matter what people say :)  Hope you worked it all out!

					<description><![CDATA[J$, hope you finished your shopping and are relaxed with your drink of choice. This year I made sure that the story from times past is not repeated by buying very few presents - so finished long time ago.

Merry Christmas, J$, and have a lovely break.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All that&#039;s left are the two online donations I make yearly (wanted to wait for payday) for friends to charities and I&#039;m DONE. One present left to wrap. Going to the store to buy ingredients for appetizers/food. Then I can relax all weekend!

Merry Christmas J$!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sooo, funny story.  I totally thought you were taking a break from blogging because I didn&#039;t see any posts from Budgets Are Sexy showing up in my feed.  Then I realized I must have accidentally hit &quot;unsubscribe&quot; at some point.  Now I have to catch up on all those unread posts. ;-)

Anyway, I managed to get all of my gifts purchased, but I may need to do some last-minute running for gift wrap stuff, and also for food... My husband and I are hosting Christmas dinner for 14!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally in the same position, J! I almost only shop online, so how hard would it have been for me to sit for a few minutes and get my shopping done a few weeks ago? Now I&#039;m scrambling trying to find stuff at the last minute. Good luck and happy holidays!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought I had all of my shopping done, but alas- I did not. I got home and realized that I wanted to give a little something to a few folks I only see once a year now and ended up having to search the house for my old gift reserves for some guests and friends I was going to meet up with.  Luckily though, for things like that I shop a year in advance and get gifts the day after Christmas that don&#039;t go bad and save them for the following year- I always seem to forget little things like hostess gifts for parties or guests that stop by...oh gosh.  

Merry Christmas- you&#039;ll get it done...just have a beer before you hit the crowded malls..or maybe that&#039;s just my advice. lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I ran into a bit of this problem. I think my solution to this is... add to my Google calendar now.. today for next Christmas. I&#039;m organizing it like this.

1. List of people I need to get cards for (group in family, friends, coworkers and clients)
2. List of people I need to get presents for (same grouping... however most will be for family and friends)

Then set up notifications throughout the year for me to review. Here I can rethink any that I need to add... add gift ideas... possibly buy a gift for someone to store for Christmas.

Next year.. I hope I&#039;ll be much more prepared! Happy holidays!]]></description>
