					<description><![CDATA[Hi, my name is  ZJ I currently have 26 dollars in my wallet. When I started managing my finances I was worth $-150000, and now have a net worth of $-140000. I currently work business owner and have been doing it for 3 years. I make roughly $70000 per year. I want to have $980,000 waiting for me when it comes time to retire. Aside from learning about finances, I really enjoy learning new skills and visiting my girlfriend. I think the world would be a better place if apathy didn’t exist. I had burger and beer for dinner last night and it was perfect. I have had 3 significant others over the course of my lifetime. One thing that makes me different is I&#039;m a lesbian and know languages you&#039;ve never heard of.. Now that I’m done with this mad lib, I think I’m going to read another post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi i&#039;m N.M. i currently have 0 dollars in my wallet. When i started managing my finances i had a net worth of -21000, i now have a networth of 1000$. I currently work an entry level position for a Bank. I make roughly 35,000 a year i want 800,000 waiting for mw when i retire. Aside for learning about PF i enjoy reading, chocolate, all you can eat sushi, jogging. I think the world would be a better place without debt. I had lasanga and samosas for dinner last night. Ive had 0 significant others and something different about me is i managed to pay all that student loan debt while only having this permenant fulltime adult like job the last 8 months and was working temp contract jobs and sidehustles until then. So im super exited to start using everything ive been learning to build personal wealth.]]></description>

For me the biggest hurdle was lack of sleep.  It got harder to deal with for each child.  I was 35 when our 4th was born.  Honestly, I can not imagine having another child again...it really kicked my ass this last time around.  But I&#039;m also grateful in that I can be certain that at old age, this will not be one of my regrets.]]></description>

Very interesting.... I&#039;d def. be happy with a boy if it ended up that way of course, just can&#039;t tell 100% if it&#039;s time or not yet like we knew the other times... I&#039;m pretty sure we&#039;ll end up going for it at some point though :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, my name is Brian. I currently have $70 (!) dollars in my wallet. When I started managing my finances I was worth $43,922.07, and now have a net worth of $334,429.92. I currently work as a CPA and have been doing it for 8 years. I make roughly $120,000 per year. I want to have $2.5 million waiting for me when it comes time to retire. Aside from learning about finances, I really enjoy pizza, beer and soccer. I think the world would be a better place if Donald Trump didn’t exist. I had steak for dinner last night and it was ace. I have had maybe 5 significant others over the course of my lifetime (counting awkward middle school relationships). One thing that makes me different is that I’ve never tried any drugs outside of alcohol (not even marijuana) (ha, copied ya!). Now that I’m done with this mad lib, I think I’m going to hop on this conference call....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, my name is Lulu. I currently have 65 cents (don&#039;t carry cash..found this on the ground) in my wallet. When I started managing my finances I was worth some negative amount, and now have a net worth of abut $15,000 (sigh grad school). I currently work on finishing my dissertation and have been in this PhD program for 4 years. I make peanuts per year (full time grad student). I want to have $1,000,000 waiting for me when it comes time to retire. Aside from learning about finances, I really enjoy watching crime scene dramas. I think the world would be a better place if Bath and Body Works would lower their candle prices, green beans did not exist, and everyone used credit cards wisely. I had cheese puffs and tea for dinner last night and it was a reward for eating well during the day and making my 10k steps. I have had 1 significant others over the course of my lifetime (counting awkward middle school relationships) because I stopped counting after 1. One thing that makes me different is I can&#039;t sleep without socks. Now that I’m done with this mad lib, I think I’m going to go to Walmart to pick up my online order (gotta rake in those ebates dollars!!!).
