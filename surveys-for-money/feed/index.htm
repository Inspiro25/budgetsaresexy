					<description><![CDATA[Bring it!  There are no besties in Beat Cordelia At Survey-Taking.  :D

p.s.  If you&#039;re looking to create a section on survey opportunities, I might be able to help.  I&#039;m on a ton of research panels and subscribe to a bunch of hot-deals-n-freebies type newsletters.  I&#039;ve gotten myself on a few sweet &quot;opinion panels&quot; as a result that pay you decent ke$h for logging in one a month and answering random questions about things like baked goods and cell phone plans.  Hit me up if you want to discuss further.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Btw, still not sure what I&#039;m gonna do with the $150 :)  I&#039;ve decided that I AM going to blow it on something fun for once though.  I&#039;m taking ideas!

@&lt;b&gt;Joe Templin&lt;/b&gt; - Oh nice, thanks!  They&#039;re going on my list :) Cool your frat buddy started one up too, that&#039;s dope.
@&lt;b&gt;cashflowmantra&lt;/b&gt; - Thx! It was fun.
@&lt;b&gt;Growing My Own&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, probably grow something AWESOME from it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa @ BrokeTO&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  That IS the best!  Nicely played, my friend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh I like that one! I&#039;d totally do that.  But really, I&#039;d totally do a LOT for $150 ;)  Especially if I already know the answers or I just have to give opinion, that&#039;s easy.
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ll let you know if any more come my way!
@&lt;b&gt;Cordelia&lt;/b&gt; - Hi bestie!! :)  That is fantastic, esp for just a half an hour? Wow. I wish I had a place to go and find sexy ones like this, but it really just came directly to me. Via email, which is why I thought it looked kinda spammy.  I&#039;m totally gonna check out that post of yours though and add it to my list!  That&#039;s really cool, I may spend an entire day on trying them out and seeing how much I can make.... maybe I&#039;ll challeng you to an online survey duel ;)  24 hours to see how much you can raise from those alone! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;ITIN ANDY&lt;/b&gt; - Literally! (bah dum, ching)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenny~Z&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, kinda makes you wonder about all he other stuff we&#039;ve deleted over time, eh?
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s really the only one I&#039;ve done that I can remember... I usually don&#039;t have the time or patience for them, but $150 had a nice sound to it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;CityFlips&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!  I like it.
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, they like people who blow all their money usually, haha... or who blog about how they blow all their money ;)
@&lt;b&gt;20 and Engaged&lt;/b&gt; - Did you get the email too?  You should have!
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - If that&#039;s the case, &quot;Universe, please send me $1,000 now!&quot; :)
@&lt;b&gt;Work At Home Market&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, that works as well :)  I usually don&#039;t have the patience to review the products and then write it up... I just prefer to give them away, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - I can help you get fired, if you&#039;d like?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm...I&#039;d say the easiest money in the &quot;side job&quot; ring would be getting paid to review companies on my blog or web site. Usually legit companies so I don&#039;t mind giving my buck&#039;s worth on what they offer. 

Tell those folks your readers want a $150 pop, too. Haha!]]></description>
