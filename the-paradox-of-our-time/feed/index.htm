					<description><![CDATA[Yes, yes, yes. This reminds me of the quote: &quot;The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry&quot; from the Shawshank Redemption, my all time favorite movie. If not handled appropriately progress in the world, isn&#039;t really progress at all. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with @William; spend years living in a 3rd-world country and find out a lot about yourself, and the traditional American perspective toward the rest of the world.  It will definitely open your eyes!  Like William, I read this poem and thought deeply about what those years mean to me, and how they truly make me different than the majority of people who surround me day to day.  And I&#039;m very happy for that.  The day I put material goods above the love of my friends and family I hope someone gives me a good swift kick in the a$$.  If I ever give up the beauty of time spent with those important to me, someone just slap me.  Material goods can be bought; time, joy, happiness, shared tears cannot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think we can all improve for sure - and maybe not today or tomorrow, or even next month - but what I loved about this is that it at least gets us to *STOP* and think for a bit. We need that every now and then :)]]></description>
