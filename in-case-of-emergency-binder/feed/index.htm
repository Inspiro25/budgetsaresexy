					<description><![CDATA[I would like to get married.  I right now have realized that I have been so focused on my career building and not making enough time to meet people and develop meaningful relationships. This will change. I found Groupon deals for social events... so I have no excuses now.  Super discounted socializing! Hubby, I am looking for you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J.Money!!!

I&#039;m surprised you are asking us to buy this binder when it&#039;s available for free. I&#039;m not even sure if the ICE binder is original idea as I&#039;ve been using a free resource. Ever heard of the &quot;The Big Book of Everything?&quot; It&#039;s FREE! And has been around for ages.. I&#039;m surprised the Financial Blogging world has not picked it up.

The AT holds a special place in my early retirement heart. It&#039;s actually the original thing that drove my interest in early retirement, since it is kinda hard (but not impossible) to take 6 months off to hike. Now I&#039;m hoping it will be a mix between my retirement party and a cleansing of corporate life while I figure out what I&#039;d like to do when I grow up.]]></description>

I think a lot of people in our society would agree with you :) What about just doing that for a full weekend or two? I know for me cutting out work on nights/weekends have been game changers.. Took me a while to get used to it, but now I soak it all up and then super ready to go on Mondays again!]]></description>

A quick way to do a home inventory is to just snap pics of all the rooms/walls, or even do a video... You&#039;d still need to document and value everything later if the $hit really did hit the fan, but at least you&#039;d have the pics/videos to look at in order to do so :) (takes about 1/100th of the time too vs inventorying all at once, haha...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This might sound silly or vague, but before I die I would want to actually relax for once.
