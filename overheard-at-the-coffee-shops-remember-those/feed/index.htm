I have to say, the shoulder devil made me blow my entire grocery budget plus another half when my kid was tested AND HE DOESN&#039;T EVEN LIVE AT HOME! And no, I didn&#039;t buy toilet paper : )]]></description>

Haha..... Shoulder devils are great, aren&#039;t they? ;)

And honestly anything you can do to keep yourself calm and collected at the moment i&#039;m all for it - even if it means spending a little more than normal. So now you got a J$ angel too to reconcile with! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On my walk yesterday in an attempt to maintain some semblance of sanity, a random thought. You’d posted recently about going cashless.

No freakin way!  How am I gonna fill up my change jar???  Horror of horrors.

I think this shelter in place is getting to me....Happy Friday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still waiting for this work from home/most of the stores and events are closed/canceled environment to cause a drop in my spending.  I&#039;ve easily been spending twice as much since this all started.  Me: Need to get out of the house?  Shoulder Devil: It&#039;s a great time to go buy food out every night because you are helping struggling restaurants and staff when others are taking a bigger financial hit.  Shoulder Angel: I agree with all of that.  Me: Oh look the grocery store is open. Shoulder Devil: You should go into Trader Joe&#039;s and buy some more food items because you haven&#039;t been really stocking up to WFH for 5 weeks.  Shoulder Angel: I&#039;m just going to go on vacation right now.  You don&#039;t need me. Shoulder Devil&#039;s got this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just thinking...I&#039;m not really looking forward to the weekend. During the week I&#039;ve got work to distract me for most of the day - but on the weekends, especially this weekend with the crappy weather forecast, what do I do with all my time? I don&#039;t have 3 kids at home to distract me!]]></description>
