					<description><![CDATA[Well, you definitely have to WANT to change your habits before anything can happen that&#039;s for sure.  You can try and tell me not to drink beer ever again because it&#039;s bad for me and I&#039;ll have a hangover tomorrow, but it&#039;s not going to stop me ;)  guess that&#039;s how finance is for some people, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article and interesting follow up opinions. I think teachers get kids into the stockmarket type games because they appear exciting and glamorous. Budgets, business plans and checking accounts may be important but they take a bit more work to grab kids attention]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember having to take a 1 quarter life skills/studies class in high school. One of the projects was creating a budget so we understood just how much money we would have to earn to fund the lifestyle that we wanted to have post graduation. We did, however, play the stock picking game in the elective economics class I took; my group was a bunch of slackers so we lost because we didn&#039;t buy enough stock. But I went to a private school so YMMV.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your blog should be required reading in school.  I wonder how many of your readers are under 18.  What is the demographics of your readers anyhow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-StackingCash]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude I agree 100%. Basic financial management is more important than even some of the mandatory classes in high school in my opinion. It honestly should be right up there with health, math, and english.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great post as always J!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[True - volunteering would help.  Personally though, I feel like my 750+ posts on this site will serve the general public much better than me trying to teach a class.  (And last even longer being on the internet and all). You&#039;d be amazed at how many students read/email me every week ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post may have been more biased than information-giving, but the bulk of my site is geared towards improving personal finances. 4 hours a day working here will reach far more people than I could ever possibly imagine.]]></description>
