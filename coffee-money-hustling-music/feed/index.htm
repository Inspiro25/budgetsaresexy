Thank you, Melody! Let me know if you have any particular questions when you get started -- there&#039;s definitely a lot of &quot;orientation&quot; for getting set up, but once you are, the sky&#039;s the limit!]]></description>

Sorry for the delay here Kristen --  but thank you for sharing your thoughts! The &quot;Just do it&quot; can be a hard approach because it&#039;s so vague... I&#039;m not sure I ever would have broken through that if I hadn&#039;t been laid off, haha!

I think the first step is to think of what you like to write and then think of who would pay for that. For me, digital marketing is something that every online company needs, so I know I can approach them and basically say, &quot;Need a writer? I&#039;m great!&quot;

For you, that might be writing about sports psychology for a particular blog or speaker. Whatever you&#039;re good at, find those people and pitch, then see what they say. 

As far as pricing, that is all over the place. Figure out a comfortable hourly rate for you, then charge a project rate for the final item. Over time, you can adjust that to what you know you&#039;re worth based on your experience. (I started a project at $35, now I charge $75-95+).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a very common practice for banks to limit the number of (1) cash deposits (2) debits, credits, deposited items. I&#039;ve found that in many of the retail banks they limit this including SunTust, BB&#038;T, etc. 

My assumption is that their thought is that businesses will have 239847923847293847 transactions per month versus a personal account that may have 500, and that added &quot;stress&quot; on their processing will/could be costly. Make sense? 

It&#039;s been just over a year that I gave up on retail banking. I keep an account at a local bank (for cash deposits), but I do all my banking (business and personal) with EverBank. They don&#039;t have any minimums, and no fees + ATM fees are refunded.

I have a Chase business account and I am not sure I will wholeheartedly recommend it. I only opened it there  because my FCU doesn&#039;t offer business account for certain type of business set up. Chase charges $10 a month if the average balance under $1500, $2 extra if you want paper statement. But those are not the things drive me insane - the crazier part is that (at least for my type of business account , the lowest one) is that I can&#039;t use mobile banking to deposit a check more than $2000. I have to go to the bank to deposit it. Sorry but who goes to the bank these days?!]]></description>
