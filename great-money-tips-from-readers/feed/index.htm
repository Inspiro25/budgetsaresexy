I tend to do the reverse for tenant move-ins and move-outs.  I do the move-in walkthrough with the tenant and take a picture of everything they note and have them sign it that day and take it with me.  Usually I give them a week to add damage items to the list with a requirement that they describe the damage and email me a pic.  After that week I email them back a .pdf of the signed move-in inspection sheet with every damage item numbered (including anything they added) with a corresponding numbered pic.  Helps with any fuzzy memories when they move out and there&#039;s a dated email with the final list/pics.  Move out is the same except it&#039;s up to them whether they attend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently fought the landlord for our son&#039;s off-campus apartment and won. Pictures were worth 1000 words and I even used the words in their contract against them. The exorbitant cleaning charge had to be approved by the student before getting charged for it. Uh, nope, didn&#039;t approve it. So, he got all of his security deposit and cleaning fee refunded.

Also, I negotiated a higher awards package for our son for college. I made an appt with the adviser and said I didn&#039;t like the awards package he was given- it should be more. That conversation netted him an extra $5000.]]></description>

My wife and I started using the chart at the beginning of this year to save for vacations.... I am thrilled to announce that we can go on vacation next year cos we will be able to save $2K by the end of the year. Thanks all, especially @J. Money for all the great miracles you work out here.]]></description>

Thank you for the dueling budgets!  We&#039;ve gone thru job loss, and it makes complete sense to have the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; handy.  You don&#039;t have to live without a Sling TV, but if the ish hits the fan, you know straight where to go to cut the spending immediately!]]></description>

No, it doesn&#039;t automatically become theirs; you can also choose to transfer it to the benefit of another child or even yourself.

We also plan to pay for all of or as much of our kids&#039; college education as possible but want to  make sure it is going toward an actual degree, not just messing around. We have 529 accounts for each kid but intend to have them take out the full balance of student loans in their own names so they have some skin in the game and incentive to finish. Upon graduation, we will use the 529s to pay the loans. 

Yes, it will cost slightly more in accrued interest for those few years, but it makes contracts, etc. a non-issue (especially if everything goes up in flames! can you imagine the drama/costs of taking your kid to court?).]]></description>
