Hi E-Rock,

The top tax bracket in Canada for 2019 was 58.75%, but that&#039;s only if you make over $210,000. But with lower healthcare costs and educational costs, we have a better quality of life with lower salaries, and we have all sorts of tax deductions...especially if we have kids.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in Canada, so I&#039;m just amazed when other people don&#039;t want universal healthcare! Instead of thinking of it as paying for everyone else, look at it like car insurance. I have a car - therefore I have to get it insured. Sure, insuring my car helps protect others (if I hit them, cause damage, etc.) but really, it&#039;s for me. Do you get angry at having to pay car insurance? Why is it more acceptable to get insurance for inanimate objects rather than your health? Yes, I pay a bit more in taxes, but I&#039;m nowhere near the 50% bracket!! I&#039;ve had car insurance since I started driving, but never once have I used it. I have universal health insurance, and I use it a lot.

I had stage 2 cancer years ago, and luckily I was able to just focus on getting better instead of figuring out how to pay for it. I consulted with multiple specialists, had surgery, follow-up appointments, etc. and it cost nothing. I did have to pay $70 out of pocket at the beginning, but I was able to get reimbursed through my tax return. I have a family doctor that I see for check-ups and chronic issues, I have a walk-in clinic that I go to for emergency appointments right near my house (they also have a nice service that will text you when it&#039;s your turn to go back to see the doctor rather than spend hours in the waiting room), and I rarely need to go to an actual hospital. Sure, wait times can be long for certain things, but I&#039;m sure that&#039;s not any different than in the USA. We have a plastic card that looks like a driver&#039;s license, but it&#039;s our medicare card. You swipe this everywhere you go - no need to carry cash or credit cards. The other thing about universal healthcare is not just the freedom from having to pay, but also the freedom to go anywhere. I can go to ANY hospital, clinic, or doctor (as long as I can get an appointment with them). There&#039;s no need to check if I&#039;m covered or if they&#039;re in my &quot;network&quot;. Occasionally, we do have to pay for certain procedures out of pocket, and sometimes our prescriptions aren&#039;t totally covered by the government. For example, I had to have a special eye exam that cost $150, and recently I had bronchitis and had to pay about $90 out of pocket for my medications. But for $90, I got 2 asthma pumps, antibiotics and codeine cough syrup. I&#039;d say that&#039;s a pretty good deal. So far, it&#039;s been an expensive year for me healthcare-wise, but these expenses are tax-deductible at the end of the year.

Student loans/credit cards/mortgages are more &quot;fixed&quot; expenses that you can predict and control to a certain degree. But healthcare can vary widely and you never know when you&#039;ll have an emergency. Also, the stress of having to worry about payment when you&#039;re ill or facing an emergency is just incomprehensible to me.]]></description>

20 years!! What a record!! I&#039;d keep going too until you hit that 50 haha... especially if you&#039;re enjoying it, which I&#039;d assume you&#039;d have to be for sticking around that long, eh? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would pick health care every time.  I would also pick universal health care free for all.  I&#039;ve been through a bout of cancer and had my knee fixed.  I have great health care so the out of pocket cost has been very minimal, no impact to our financial health.  But I&#039;ve gone through many years of paying large sums for health insurance and still having to pay a pretty penny for treatments.

Wiping out debt is a great thing, but it would now stop you from going back into debt.  Also paying it off and changing your outlook/habits is a great motivator.  You just don&#039;t get that life lesson any other way.

Great question though.]]></description>

Hi E-Rock, which countries did you have in mind here? I was surprised by the 65% number so tried to track one down and I couldn&#039;t find any country with a top 65% rate.  I&#039;m wondering if it maybe used to be true a few decades ago but no longer is?]]></description>
