					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I hear that brotha... and with blogging everyone KNOWS about those failures too! Haha.. luckily though they also hear about the Wins so I guess it breaks even :) That&#039;s the beauty of blogging though - it shows we&#039;re real people!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good luck with the goals J! 

I think one of the &quot;cool&quot; things about blogging is that you can look back on goals and objectives to see if you failed.  Although I always feel like an idiot when I fail miserably at a goal lol.  

If I had to give a theme to my goals it would be to get some type of routine! 2012 was filled with housing stuff and I am just pumped that is about to be all over]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Bryan&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yup! Tons of crazy good (and risky!) investments for that money :) Just gotta find the one (or two/three) that you&#039;re most comfortable with and then pour it all in!

@&lt;b&gt;Leslie&lt;/b&gt; - EXCELLENT idea! Especially for all those workaholics out there like us. Thank you for the reminder :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Simple, easy, consdensed...great goal. I like you have had a crazy number of new years resolutions in the past and in the end, I am someone who always has goals and projects on the go regardless of the calander changing or not. One thing I have been seriously lacking is fun. I have spent too many years with tunnel vision and although I am not giving up on my projects, I am making a deliberate effort to infuse fun into my life. I will probably feel a lot better too...as they say, laughter is the best medicine. Wishing you a great 2013.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy new year. My concentrations this year will be to learn a new language (still deciding on what that language will be, lol) and to find other ways to invest my money rather than just stocks, which is what i have right now.,There is just so many ways to make money out there, its dizzying. There is real estate, precious metals, blogging, domain name flipping, pet sitting, etc. etc. it will be interesting to see what i get into this year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, lots of crazy variables there - but at least you&#039;re *aware* of them all, and can thus keep your goals/budget realistic! And over time it&#039;ll all pan out more and give you a clearer picture of what to expect, where you can then adjust and keep moving the ball forward :) And we save a TON breastfeeding too, it&#039;s great - and REALLY good for the baby too. We&#039;re not so good w/ cloth diaper stuff though, haha...

@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - I like it :) And that 10k would be DOPE if you could pull it off! If you keep adding another every year you&#039;ll be crazy fit!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think simplicity is a great a great idea!  Sometimes having too many goals can be so confusing and frustrating. 

I am focusing on my running goals.  Last year I did 4 5k&#039;s as my goal and completed it, this year instead of ramping it up a lot, I&#039;m just going to shoot for the same goal plus a LITTLE extra.  4 5k&#039;s and one 10k.

We&#039;ll see how it goes but hopefully less to focus on will make it easier to achieve.

And of course, I have various financial goals but I look at them all together in a lump sum, trying to pay off as much as possible, without putting a number on it to eliminate the stress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am definitely with you on the needing less goal!  I&#039;m actually not quite sure where our take-home pay will end up for 2013 because there are so many variables still: I will get small raises at both jobs, but our insurance contributions will increase, as will payroll taxes... But my husband has a new job that resulted in a pretty big pay increase (but also higher commuting costs, which cut into a bit of that increase) and gets his first raise mid-February.  Add a new baby to the mix around early February, which could cost us a lot or a little (if we can follow through on cloth diapering and breastfeeding, we will save a LOT of money over the first couple of years!), and all I can do at the moment is guess at what our budget will be and hope for the best.  

Definitely counting our blessings that we have wiggle room in our budget to deal with most of those unknowns, but I&#039;d still love to pare things down, both in terms of expenses and material possessions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing all your own goals with us :) It helps motivate me to keep going and consider other ideas too! Happy new year everyone!!

@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! I guess that &quot;word&quot; idea is a pretty popular one then, eh? I like your health and wealth one, haha... that&#039;s great :) Here&#039;s to you rockin&#039; it as well this year!
@&lt;b&gt;Pauline&lt;/b&gt; - I like it! You and Maria up there should hang out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - I feel like I need to be working out more (and eating better) as well, but one thing at a time, haha... I do play a lot of sports when it&#039;s nice out, so at least that&#039;s something?
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - You too, friend!
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s very important - stopping to soak things in and *enjoy* it. We&#039;re always so rush-rush-rush here in the States, and it would be nice to figure out how to slooooow things down a bit more :) I&#039;m going to try and give myself 1 hour a day of doing &quot;whatever *I* want&quot; and see if that does the trick. I feel like it would.
@&lt;b&gt;Revanche&lt;/b&gt; - You too, friend! I&#039;m SO GLAD we&#039;re still connected after all these years of blogging :) Maybe we&#039;ll be able to hang out in person again sometime?!
@&lt;b&gt;K.K. @ Living Debt Free Rocks!&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME!!! Accomplishing any of those would be sexy, actually - make sure to check back in next year at this time so I can congratulate you on everything :)
@&lt;b&gt;Tony@YouOnlyDoThisOnce&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!!! I love your motivation my man! What an excellent game plan over there - I&#039;m proud of you! Even though I don&#039;t know you well yet! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeremy Jameson&lt;/b&gt; - I like that ;) And also that you&#039;re trying to grow your site and make some cash a &quot;meaningful way&quot; - that&#039;s important. And I struggled a lot with that early on with this site and made money the crappier ways. Even now I hate that there are ads on this site that I&#039;d rather be gone, but until I figure out better ways too, it is what it is... Especially if I want to keep this site going on and on! :)
@&lt;b&gt;NoTrustFund&lt;/b&gt; - Great one! I&#039;ve started doing the same a year and a half ago, and now I only have 8.5 years instead of 10 to hit my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/mortgage-payoff-plan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pay-off&lt;/a&gt; goal :) Probably not as sexy as yours if you&#039;re getting closer, but we all gotta start somewhere right?
@&lt;b&gt;Connor Harley&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yup! But hardly anyone ever DOES ANYTHING about it ;) The key to being successful in any area, really. It&#039;s like wanting to win the lottery but never playing!
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... Well &quot;needing less&quot; is tied completely with &quot;no more mortgage,&quot; so as soon as that is gone then I&#039;ll be well on my way to not needing as much income anymore! *If* I want to simplifly a lot more by that point... We all know I&#039;ll be hustling either way, but knowing you only need $XX amt every month to survive is motivating for me. You can the work on the stuff you love more even if it doesn&#039;t pay as nice :)
@&lt;b&gt;shey&lt;/b&gt; - Excellent goals! And all three of those will help you immensely in the future too, esp the traveling abroad. People rarely think about the impact that makes on both your mental health and &quot;edge&quot; it gives you in future conversations (even with job stuff - world travelers seem &quot;smarter&quot; to people cuz it means you&#039;re soaking up other cultures!) so I think that&#039;s great. As well as the internship and high gpa :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, you&#039;re gonna be a hustler! I hope they all go well!
@&lt;b&gt;Alyssa&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;ll figure it out in no time :) And the writing it down part will be helpful too, even if just to look back every now and it to check-in with yourself. You can do it, friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid! lol

Simplicity is the way to go. It&#039;s easier to function and you can focus on the things that are important. I try to keep my finances fairly simple. However, I have noticed that the most effective way to keep me saving is to have several targeted savings accounts. I keep them all under 1 online bank, so it doesn&#039;t *feel* like separate accounts. But having specific accounts really gives me something to focus on, particularly now that I&#039;m saving for a wedding :)

Your goals sound great. I&#039;m still solidifying mine. I&#039;ve got ambitions, but need to write them down and be more specific so I know I&#039;ll attain them :)]]></description>
