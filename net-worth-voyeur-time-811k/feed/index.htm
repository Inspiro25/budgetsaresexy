How true that is! And after 10 years of diligently tracking this stuff every month, i&#039;m sure that&#039;s exactly what&#039;s happening to me too... Unfort in both directions though, as I def. don&#039;t get as excited when it jumps most months like I used to :) Great insight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually use moments like this to savor the loss.  Not that I like losing money any more than the next person.  But I use market losses like these to desensitize me in a way.  The thought process being that the more I see larger losses in my investment portfolio, the more used to it I get and the more likely I&#039;ll shrug off bigger losses during recessions.  Stock goes down, comes back up, goes down, comes back up, rinse and repeat.]]></description>

Yup, that&#039;s all I do!

Not saying it&#039;s the 100% best way to go about it, but it&#039;s been workings for me over the past 3 or so years anyways :) I love not having to think about it anymore and just keep pilling it up... Eventually I&#039;ll probably diversify more and start picking up a bond fund or international fund w/ Vanguard, but as it stands it&#039;s VTSAX only, all day every day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Same here too! I&#039;m in the red for February. Hey, so every year do you just keep adding value in your Vanguard ETF (i.e. $20K)? I bought VIMSX mid of &#039;17 and was thinking of adding another $15K. What&#039;s your view? Thanks!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe since you have more passion around the charity work, you can plan on donating a portion of your book sales to fund your endeavor. Maybe that will help put some passion back into writing and publishing. 
Using some time to help families in need with getting their finances in order? Definitely agree with the idea of supporting diverse business owners. Again via investment and coaching?]]></description>

SCORE!!!

Although I actually just went to count, and I&#039;ve had *39* total down months over the years :) The ones listed above are just the major dips. But on the other hand, there are *83* ups out of the 122 months, so still trends upward!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Uhj... less than 10 down months over ten years?!  That is an awesome track record if you ask me!  If you think about it, every time Berkshire Hathaway has a bad month, Warren Buffett loses net worth....I&#039;m sure he has had more down months than you over the past ten years!  You&#039;re beating Buffett.]]></description>
