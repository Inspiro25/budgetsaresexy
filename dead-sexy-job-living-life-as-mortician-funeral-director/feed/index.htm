Hey Vantasia,
My advice to you is to go to your local funeral home and tell them you are interested in working part-time for them. That way you will get to see what it is all about first hand before you actually commit to going to school. It is a great profession, and the industry will desperately need more funeral directors over the next few years as the population continues to age.]]></description>

Yes, no, and yes. Over 50% of mortuary school students are now female. There are a lot of great female funeral directors out there. However, in many places, the funeral industry is still a boys&#039; club. The best thing female funeral directors can do is to prove these D-bags wrong by showing that they are able to do everything a guy can do - embalm, lift, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Serena,
Congratulations! Good luck at mortuary school. As far as advice goes, one of the most important things you can do is act and look professional. Don&#039;t be a weirdo. You&#039;d be surprised how many people we see trying to get a job that come in looking like they just rolled out of bed. For better or for worse, the funeral industry is a very conservative looking (and sometimes thinking) industry. So, when you are 60 miles from home, you can look and act how you want. However, when you are on the job, you have to look and act the part. If you are looking to be an owner, save as much money as you can right now. You&#039;ll need it to buy the business. And as the years go by, there will be times when you people will wear you down. Try to remember why you started out in the business to begin with - helping grieving people in need. Good luck and hopefully this was helpful. Feel free to send me a private email at my website if you have any more questions.]]></description>
