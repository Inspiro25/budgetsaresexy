					<description><![CDATA[I too had a bunch of credit card debt, to the tune of around $7500. Took me around 6 months as well to pay it off once I got serious. For me it was all about realizing that I was way over spending and being too much of a consumerist. Identifying purchases that I actually needed instead of purchases that were fleeting wants was totally key.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know about Natalie, but I know it helped me want more money too :) Especially when I barely had any left over every month! Cuz if you can stay on track and spend the same, all the extra money you get in the future feels SOOOO much better!]]></description>

Ouch! Health stuff is so freakin&#039; crazy sometimes. All the more reason to save more than you think you need and be prepped for emergencies! Hopefully they&#039;re just not as drastic as some cases :( I hope your grand daughter has lots of years ahead of her!! So sad when things happen to young people :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice article and congrats!  Here&#039;s a little piece of information that may keep you &quot;on budget&quot; for the rest of your life.  Our grand daughter was just diagnosed with a rare, incurable disease.  Wow are there medical expenses involved.  I NEVER dreamed, imagined or even thought this would ever happen.  It simply never occurred to us.  Now that it&#039;s happened, we&#039;re helping with medical expenses just when we thought we had raised and educated our kids and thought we could finally push hard to get our retirement fully funded - ha!  Hope this never happens to any of you guys, but keep it in mind &#039;cause it could be just the motivation you need to keep you on track.  Best of luck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well done Natalie!

I don&#039;t fight any financial demons, but I do try to change how I feel about earning more money.
I found that by creating a budget, I realized how much I actually wanted, and it made my drive for earning more money greater.

Was it the same with you, or did you know how much money you wanted before creating a budget?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah for you Natalie! I&#039;m sure moving back in with your parents was really hard to do. A big blow to your pride and ego. Plus having to admit that you needed your parents help. I&#039;m glad you were able to get it all together! It&#039;s a wonderful inspirational story. Thanks for sharing this moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing that story, and congratulations on conquering your credit card debt!  My financial demon was (and is) trying to impress people by picking up the check.  I think a lot of it is ego, and a bit of it is just not liking the process of chopping up a check uncomfortably in a big group of people.]]></description>
