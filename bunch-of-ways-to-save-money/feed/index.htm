I do get cash tips and occasional payments very frequently from my side hustle(s).

Cash rule 1: It can NEVER be spent, only deposited.
Cash rule 2: It cannot go into an account linked with our daily lives (checking or main savings)

Cash goes into the accorns, roth, 529, or even in a vacation fund if we have one open but I like to treat it as money that I was never meant to have.]]></description>

It&#039;s a good way of investing more money in little bits - I&#039;ve been doing this with my contributions to 2 retirement accounts for the last year.

I increase the amount each month by +1% of the previous month&#039;s sum. This is the bit which throws colleagues when we ever talk about it because they say that 1% isn&#039;t worth doing.

As I find this too fiddly to manually adjust each month I just add 5 bucks each month until the next higher amount is crossed and needs adding another 5 bucks. In reality this means that I only had to adjust my contribution every 3 or 4 months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you ever have the feeling that there is still some &quot;spare&quot; money sloshing about but even though you track your expenses, and it all adds up, you just can&#039;t seem to put your finger on it as to where it is?

Because of this I started this Savings challenge in January (https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/use-this-chart-to-save-1000-this-year/).

I&#039;ve adjusted it so I will save 250 bucks in total over the course of 1 year into a separate savings account - at the moment I manually transfer money every Thursday. 

I&#039;ve started with the bigger sums to get them out of the way early - and good was it that I did. 16 manual payments later and I am a bit fed up with it so in 2 weeks time I will fix it at the then current amount of 5 bucks a week and make it an automatic transfer from then onwards. Doing this will mean that I will also end up with 310 bucks saved instead of 250.

And of course I went then one further and started it a second time - this time from the beginning as an automatic transfer of 5 bucks a week.]]></description>

Exciting about the MacBook! It&#039;s been about 15 years since I&#039;ve had my last one, but thinking it&#039;s time on the next replacement :)]]></description>
