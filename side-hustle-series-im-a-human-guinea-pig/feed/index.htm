					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve participated in a few studies.  One was for weight loss, the other was a sleep study.  

The weight loss one had me on a liquid diet for 3 months. I had to report in once a week &#038; buy the shakes they had me use.  I couldn&#039;t go the whole 3 months - I only made it for 2 months, because I was dying to chew on some real food.  I did lose 30 lbs, though.  A few months later, they sent me a check which basically reimbursed me for all the shakes I bought.

The sleep study had me stay overnight 4 times for one night each, every two weeks.  Each overnight stay I was hooked up with wires all over my scalp, face, and legs that connected to a monitor.  I was also being observed via a camera while sleeping.  I had to take some medication which was either a sleeping pill or a placebo, and was required to let them draw blood each morning.  I was paid about $1200 for that.  There were other people in the study center that were getting paid $2000 for their participation in a different study, but they were taking some kind of injections, which I wouldn&#039;t do.  My study was aimed at people with insomnia and sleep apnea.]]></description>

Wow, that is a big commitment!  It makes sense though that you aren&#039;t being compensated because you are (I hope) going to benefit from the experimental treatment.  Best of luck to you in this endeavor!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting.  I&#039;m being screened for a medical study tomorrow that I hope I qualify for.  No pay, reimbursement for travel, but what I&#039;m reading shows a good chance of long term alleviation of depression symptoms.  For that chance, I&#039;m willing to part with 3 hours a day, 5x week for 4 weeks!]]></description>

Yikes!  I&#039;ve never donated plasma and I&#039;m not interested in selling bits of my body - it is difficult to know all the down-the-line consequences.  But yeah, clicking buttons on a laptop is pretty safe.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In college my roommate used sell his body to science by donating his plasma. He did this for awhile until he was too run down and got pneumonia...eeek! I never wanted to do anything like that but participating in computer based studies sounds a lot more appealing!]]></description>
