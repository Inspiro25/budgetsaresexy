					<description><![CDATA[I have considered selling my eggs. I don&#039;t intend to become pregnant myself, but I have some nice DNA and it could be put to use. I wouldn&#039;t give up something I couldn&#039;t replace though. I like my body. Money is not that important.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am willingly eating office meeting food (which is oily and unhealthy, low quality ingredient that I would never buy). But it&#039;s FREE and I would save the meal cost to buy only free range chicken for my other meals. 

As for debt, I am a person that jumps into any low interest loan and use that for safe investment. So debt doesn&#039;t fear me, as long as the cash flow is intact.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HA!  This clearly has sparks some debate, and some laughs.  &quot;The bottom has fallen out of the testicle market&quot; - who knew there was one.

For me, no, never.  But it can be sad that folks can/do resort to desperate measures such as this.  Cheers. Tom]]></description>

Good point on the &quot;crisis&quot; mode - that changes everything, you&#039;re very right. And probably (but hopefully not!) why we got this &quot;left testicle&quot; comment which sparked this post :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a pretty funny comment. I do think debt really bogs people down! I live in one of the most expensive cities in the United States (San Francisco), and lived in a car/tent to pay off my debt! I was the only way to do it around here. I&#039;m so glad I did! The freedom is so worth it. I don&#039;t know about giving up a body part, but for sure people can think of ways to save and downsize!]]></description>
