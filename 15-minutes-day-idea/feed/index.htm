					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, for sure. Because you&#039;d end up playing over the 15 mins when you sat down ;)  That&#039;s what ended up happening to me a lot - I only mean to go in for 15 and I leave like 45 later, if not more.  It&#039;s just the *starting* that&#039;s so hard to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading for 15 minutes is a great way to wind down at the end of the day.

Not sure 15 minutes is enough to learn how to play guitar, but it would definitely get me started on learning it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a concept. I think I&#039;ll invest in the book and my first step will be to finish reading it in 15 minutes increments since I have a habit of starting to read a book and never finish. I shared this with my co-workers and they are brainstorming to see what they can do with the extra time. Now to get busy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every little bit DOES help for sure!  Same with saving here and there - it all snowballs and works towards your advantage.  Most of us say we&#039;re going to start something later but that later sometimes never comes.  We&#039;re always waiting for the &#034;perfect moment&#034; to being - whether it&#039;s buying a house, having a baby, getting a better job, etc etc.  You work on that for a handful of minutes a day and you&#039;ll get there MUCH quicker - believe it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats a great idea! I always hear people giving fitness advice like that. Every little bit counts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m especially prone to having this &#034;all or nothing&#034; mentality so I like the idea! I should probably start devoting 15 minutes a day to decluttering as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been meaning to buy and read this book. I already have a habit of reading before bed because it usually makes me sleepy. That works against me sometimes when I try to read during the day! Thanks for mentioning the book. I think I&#039;ll use today&#039;s 15 minutes to hit Amazon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great idea. Though, I think I&#039;m already doing this with my 20-minute Shred workout. So I&#039;m really spending 5-minutes more, but getting a similar benefit. The hardest part is dropping everything and doing it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lots of great discussion going guys!  This is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - DO IT! do it!!!!  Excellent plan.  The less you bring over, the less you&#039;ll have to unpack too! I want a report on it tomorrow ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Abigail&lt;/b&gt; - Love it! I have a hard time stopping too so I could totally use that timer :)  (and now you know what to get me for Xmas next year)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Ariella&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, ain&#039;t that cute :)  Beautiful idea, thanks for sharing.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;lifeexcursion&lt;/b&gt; - Dude, totally okay!  Anything having to do with minimalism can go on this site :) Really glad you dropped that - will be adding it to my future reads buddy.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Sarah O&#039;Neill &lt;/b&gt; - (for a second I thought your name was &#034;Shaq O&#039;Neil!&#034;  got all excited! haha...)  Yeah, I actually JUST learned about Fly Lady this week and linked to her within the post ;)  Also just started following her on Twitter - excited to see what she&#039;s about.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Robert&lt;/b&gt; - True, but that&#039;s the point ;)  This FORCES you to stop and do something about it, or you&#039;ll just keep on running full-speed until you overload.  Although there&#039;s nothing wrong w/ giving it a shot in the morning before work, whatever you like.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Jolie&lt;/b&gt; - I like that!  I do much better accomplishing a lot of mini-tasks than I do large ones (thus the reason I tend to pay off lower credit card bills first even if others have higher interest rates), so that would fit in well with my personality.  And lists just plain rock :)]]></description>
