Interesting take! As much as I feel like I&#039;d enjoy hanging out and &quot;doing nothing&quot; on a beach, I&#039;d probably end up working on/building something in retirement too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My personal conclusion from this story is that everybody has their passion. For the fisherman, it&#039;s to fish and spend time with his friends and family. For the Harvard MBA, it&#039;s to build a big corporation. I don&#039;t think what the MBA guy actually wants is to sell out and go relax on a coastal village. I think he would jump right back in the game and start an even bigger company. Because that&#039;s what he likes doing. It&#039;s not about the destination, but the journey. If you don&#039;t know what you want, then it&#039;s easy to lose focus and get lost, but if you know yourself you should be fine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love that story, it really hits home for me. I think the first time I read the “The Mexican Fisherman”, it was when I was reading either the &quot;4-hour Work Week&quot; or &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;.

I agree with you, everything I read it, it really makes me think about what&#039;s important in life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I first heard this when I was off at university and it was a real ah ha kind of story. Because of its surprise ending.

It&#039;s stuck with me. You always have to evaluate the goal or purpose because if you aren&#039;t careful you might just take the long way and miss out on a lot. The part of the story that never made sense to me was the part where the guy says after building an empire you get to take days and relax and spend time with your kids. But the truth of his scenario is his kids are born already. If he were to take 20 years to build this empire his kids would be grown and gone. 

A more accurate statement would be and then you get to spend time playing with your grandkids. If it were said like that I think the trade off would be even more pronounced.]]></description>
