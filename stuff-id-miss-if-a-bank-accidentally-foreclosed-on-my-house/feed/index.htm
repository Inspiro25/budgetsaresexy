Haha... nice. I&#039;m a big fan of fake trees myself, actually :) But as hard as it was, I had to give up two of them on our last move which my wife was very proud of me for... I thought I&#039;d miss them a lot, but this is actually the first time I&#039;ve thought about them in two months! Pretty interesting...]]></description>

Oh man, I&#039;m SURE they do. Which is why I&#039;d be too scared to wave anything around in a situation like that. Would rather have my stuff stolen than my life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure the people who had their stuff stolen by the bank will have no problem finding a lawyer willing to take there case.  It is absolutely ridiculous that happened.  I can&#039;t even begin to imagine how angry I would be with them if they did that to me and didn&#039;t immediately make it right.]]></description>

I thought of that when I heard this too!  Not to make this political, but I&#039;m not a huge fan of guns but this is a time when just the sight of one could help you protect your home.  There&#039;s a time and place for a shot gun, and this would be a good time and place. I wonder if repo guys pack heat though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok so I&#039;ve been thinking about this all weekend.  First, I loved Up In The Air!  It&#039;s not every day that ol&#039; Georgie gets his heart handed to him.  What I would take out of my apartment if my landlords were foreclosing or evicting me (that would NEVER happen) and I had 10 minutes is:

All of my camping,hiking and rock climbing gear - that stuff is super expensive to replace.
Cedar hope chest - There&#039;s no hope in it, but my mom gave it to me for my 18th and it&#039;s a family tradition.
File box of financials/documents - No explanation needed
Laptop - No explanation needed
Fake tree - I consider this a prized possession of mine.  I got it for free and then spent hours and hours modifying it.  It&#039;s senseless really.  I&#039;d leave it behind if I had to, but it would kill me.
Christmas Tree topper - I spent hours making him (Sebastian).  It&#039;s a hiker made from clay that I then baked in the oven.  I sewed clothes on him and glued hair to his head then made him a backpack.  Another senseless item that I&#039;m attached to.
Undergarments - I have a hard time finding ones that fit right and are comfortable. A little awkward, but hey.
If I had a minute left I&#039;d snag my jewelry (nothing valuable), toiletries, and some clothes... and a snack.

If I had a full hour and a truck I could probably move just about everything.]]></description>

I bet!!! $18k is nothing for the amount it COULD have been. I&#039;d do whatever it takes to resolve a situation like that just to shut down the media mess!]]></description>
