					<description><![CDATA[Only 10 days left now! No pressure, anybody.

What I usually do is walk around looking at everything in the mall, then start wondering if I can get it cheaper or in a different color or better online, go home, look it up online and order. Then feel guilty because I &quot;used&quot; the mall without paying, but then remember that I bought a sub and a giant cookie from the food court so at least I spent something, but still...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh I like that list idea... kinda goes around the &quot;thought that counts&quot; - but at least you know you&#039;re getting something people want and are excited for :)  Nixes the minimalism problem I seem to have where I&#039;m VERY thankful for the stuff I get, but then not sure how to deal with it if it doesn&#039;t fit in my new program. Big pimpin&#039; on knocking it all out though!

@&lt;b&gt;Edward&lt;/b&gt; - Ahhhh, yeah - that&#039;s not good.  I imagine they&#039;re losing a nice chunk of change from all those hustlers out Colorado too!  I guess they ran the numbers and decided it was worth it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J. In February, Colorado passed a sales tax law that requires online retailers to send sales info for purchases sent to Colorado so the state can make sure you are paying the sales tax due.  It&#039;s a stupid law that they can&#039;t possibly expect to be able to enforce except against a handful of larger retailers.  But in protest, Amazon pulled their Affiliate program out of Colorado, despite the fact that it has nothing to due with sales tax.  That&#039;s the part that upsets me the most, the disconnect between the new law and the company&#039;s retaliation. It&#039;s like getting fired from your job because your company doesn&#039;t like your state&#039;s stance on gay marriage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finished my Christmas shopping about a week and a half ago, the earliest I&#039;ve ever had it done before, but it sure feels nice.

My family all makes up a Christmas list (along with birthday lists as well) so it makes it much, much easier to get people. A couple of hours at the mall and I had picked up everything but 3 gifts and I already knew what I wanted to get those 3.

Hell, even the gifts are wrapped. I usually don&#039;t do that until Christmas Eve.

Merry Christmas everyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Forgot to mention - if you&#039;re looking for more ideas, check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/10-financially-sexy-xmas-presents/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;10 Frugally Sexy Gift Ideas&lt;/a&gt; :)

@&lt;b&gt;Andrew&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, a list is a nice start!
@&lt;b&gt;Mercedes&lt;/b&gt; - Damn girl, you are GOOD.  25 y/o male...hmm.... women, beer, video games. That help? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Annelise&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  CVS gift card, that WOULD actually be pretty good.  Esp for all those CVS coupon lovers!
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie S&lt;/b&gt; - You can give them the gift of USAA ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Megan&lt;/b&gt; - Love etsy!
@&lt;b&gt;Kathleen&lt;/b&gt; - If it&#039;s a funny mug, I say go for it.  Funny mugs are where it&#039;s at.
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I feel your style homeboy.  24 hours is plenty of time ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jeannine&lt;/b&gt; - You forgot someone! *cough* Me. Better start knitting! :) 
@&lt;b&gt;Tom Meitner&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s not a bad idea... great for those with A.D.D. too - quick in and out! (that&#039;s what she said!)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward - If You Can Read, You Can Cook&lt;/b&gt; - What! They did?  dang.... I&#039;d be pretty pissed too.  Although, probably not their fault - I bet there&#039;s some weird law in place that makes things difficult.  Or maybe they just don&#039;t like you guys ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kitchen Penguin&lt;/b&gt; - Aloha!  And you start on my birthday ;)  I&#039;m usually out and about then too, only I shop for myself then, haha...  And you better believe our place is decorated for the holidays! Xmas tree up, lights, snowmen things, candles, stockings, and everything else tacky that you can imagine.  LOVE xmas. Nice seeing you here :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - I like that donate to charity idea - we always say we&#039;re going to do that but then we forget and/or wait &#039;till last minute to all decide on it.  Guess it runs in the family.
@&lt;b&gt;Janet&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD ONE!!  I like that because it&#039;s an &quot;experience&quot; over stuff.  And you just reminded me that I lied when I said I didn&#039;t get anything!!! I forgot I pitched in for my dad&#039;s present - Race car around the track!!  Experiences, baby - people like those.
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Now you&#039;ll have plenty of time to find me something good ;)  Hint:  I take money.  And beer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Gift Giving Guru and finished my shopping and wrapping.  There are a couple of other things I am picking up, but not because I have to.  All I have left to do is make some holiday cookies and ship them. :)

I usually search for deals all year and buy stuff we want and need that way.  On the stuff we can wait for, I put in a gift drawer for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  Everything that doesn&#039;t get given away through out the year, gets wrapped up for Christmas.  Of course there are always a few special items for Christmas that are purchased later, but I look for deals starting in October.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Umm, I just started my shopping last night, and it&#039;s not last-minute until December 24. So I&#039;m ahead of schedule. :)

I&#039;m excited about my parents&#039; gift. It&#039;s a huge deviation from the norm. I got them tix to go see Jerry Seinfeld, who made me cry I was laughing so hard when I saw his stand-up routine.]]></description>
