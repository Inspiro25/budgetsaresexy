					<description><![CDATA[Definitely money.  I&#039;m doing everything I can by working two jobs and paying 60 percent of my income toward Parent PLUS loans.  If those loans were gone, I&#039;d have more money for beer and more time for sleep and sex!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, feeling super fortunate to be able to say I have enough in all those categories ;) 

Interesting to see beer and sex as the two lowest ones :P Maybe people want more money so they can get all the other things in the list.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is cliche, but I would say money, but not necessarily retirement. We are in the middle of finishing off IVF and going for adoption. That comes with a lot of costs....like 40-50k. Right now I don&#039;t have it. So if I had that in the bank I might feel a little calmer.]]></description>

ACK!!! Sending you loads of good vibes, man! you can do it!!! Pick up a 12 pack on your way home tonight! Haha.. or even better - visit a cemetery :) That&#039;s my trick to fixing all temporary problems because people in there have *permanent* ones - eep!

					<description><![CDATA[Currently, #1 on my list is patience.  I want more patience.  I NEED more patience.  Right now, we are 5 days into a kitchen renovation which is taking a mental toll on everyone involved.  Yesterday, the old oven was removed, and somehow the gas to the furnace was shut off, so consequently we had no heat last night (the Chicago area is not very warm yet this spring).  A space heater kept the bedrooms warm enough for sleeping last night (and the contractors fixed the problem already this morning), but needless to say, the Mrs. was not very happy about it.  She&#039;s been taking the brunt of everything so far since she works at home while I get to leave and head to the office every day.  When I get home, I hear all about all of the things that went wrong with the remodel which is bad enough, but then add the teenagers on top of that, and it seems like a constant barrage of complaints.  I&#039;ve been good about keeping my cool so far, but I&#039;m running out of patience by the second.  Who knows, maybe more beer will help!!]]></description>
