					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;maria@moneyprinciple&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome! Congrats!  Yes, keep pushing and putting out all your thoughts out there as you never know how big of an impact you&#039;re having on people :) MOST readers never EVER leave a comment (I think the % is like only 2% tend to comment?), so you can be changing lives without even knowing it.  And it keeps your own finances in check too, which is great :)  Congrats on the 1 year!
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Cherleen!  Yours too! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations J$ and I am so pleased you kept going that long - I found you only about a year ago but as I said before, I really like the company. So here is to many more productive and enjoyable years to come. And on this wave, mine will be one year old this coming Saturday - youngling, really. Just hope that I love my blog as much as you love yours and that I have similar eagerness to learn, improve, relate, make people think and entertain. Cheers!]]></description>
