					<description><![CDATA[Good luck on the road trip and have fun at the conference! I&#039;m sure everything will go well. I don&#039;t have a baby so I can&#039;t really give you tips. The one time went on a long road trip with my niece was 6 hours. She wailed for about an hr and fell asleep the rest of the time.

When I was road tripping across the country, we took breaks every 2 hours! Seemed to work well for us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have fun on your trip! I can&#039;t imagine driving that far with a baby, more power to you sir. I did not realize that other people intentionally did that with enterprise. When my sister and I went to Austin, we wanted a small economy car and ended up cruising around Texas in a white Crown Victoria looking like under-cover cops. It was much larger than we expected.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good luck on the road trip.  I have had to do the long road trips but never with small children in tow.  Although if you head out at night, you might be able to get through most of it while they sleep. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good luck brother! Can&#039;t take wife/kids with me this time, but they&#039;d probably be crazy bored anyways. I&#039;m flying out tomorrow, and booked it with miles, so doing it on the cheap! Splitting the hotel with a buddy as well, so I&#039;ll be out about $300. Food and other activities might cost as well.

We took out 8 month old to California (12 hours) and he cried for the last 3. It was bearable, but barely. Hope things work out, and definitely just hop on the mommy blogs to find ways to keep kids calm and (hopefully) asleep during long road trips.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last Feb. I flew to Australia which for an ADULT is a very long journey. My LA &#062; Brisbane hop was 13 hours long and there was a family in the row ahead of me. The entire whole family was not able to get seats together, so Dad and one child were in a different part of the plane (they came by to visit a few times) and Mom and 3 kids were in front of me.
The kids in front of me were total angels for 12 hours and 55 minutes. As the plane was docking the 10 year old sister finally just snapped at her 8 year old brother. Since the plane was almost at the gate, the cabin was very quiet, so the entire back of the plane got to hear this conversation:

10 Year old sister: Stop making faces at me!
8 Year old brother: I am not.
10 Year old sister: You are! You are making FACES!	
8 Year old brother: I am not.
10 Year old sister: You are. Mum he&#039;s making faces at him. Make him stop.
8 Year old brother: I am not making faces. 
10 Year old sister: Mum&#039;s he&#039;s making faces at me!!! Just stop it!

Everyone around them were just trying NOT to crack up.  The guy sitting next to me, his face was flushed red because he was trying not to laugh.

So what I am saying is at least Baby $ does not have any siblings to fight with (yet) so I guess,that&#039;s half the battle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Snacks and videos - &quot;long&quot; car trips are the only time she gets to use the iPad, so it&#039;s special.  With a &quot;baby&quot; driving isn&#039;t so bad - with a potty training toddler, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve *ever* stopped so much in my life on the last 200mile trip to grandma&#039;s, and we&#039;re doing it again this weekend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can do it! We moved from Florida to Oregon last year, and my husband drove the truck while I drove our minivan (with our three kids) all the way to Oregon. I lost it by the time we hit Utah. I went to Costco and bought three fat sticker books. Like 1000 pages of stickers, and gave them each one. By the time we reached our new home it was like stickers had vomited all over the the van. I did not care. We also did the DVD player, Leapster, gameboy, and ipod thing. We&#039;ve now added a Nintendo DS to the bunch for more excitement. Basically we rely purely on digital entertainment. My kids are addicts but I don&#039;t know any other way to do it. At a younger age we also went through a lot of goldfish and fruit snacks in the car.]]></description>
