					<description><![CDATA[Weddings are costly.  When planning for my wedding, we let ppl know that we are happy that they were attending.  There were not obligated to get us a gift.  Our bridal and groom party was very small so we paid for them so they wouldn&#039;t have additional expenses. I think it helped having a small wedding so we could divert some of our budget to our wedding party.]]></description>

Definitely! The number of pre-wedding events are growing! We typically do just 1 gift for the couple, no matter how many parties they have.

Luckily most of our friends are still married! I haven&#039;t been to anyone&#039;s second wedding yet!]]></description>

Haha love your green thumb, Gary! Actually my wife and I were dedicated a tree once, and our friends made a plaque with our names on it, planted in a secret spot on Oahu. Not sure if it&#039;s still there, but it was one of the coolest and most memorable gifts we have received.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is spot on and timely Joel! I can&#039;t believe some of the screenshots I&#039;ve seen and discussions I&#039;ve had with friends on them feeling compelled to shell out hundreds on a wedding gift, after travelling there and partaking in other activities as well. 

I&#039;ve been on a mission to be more mindful about those gifts too, and make them unique to the couple. Love nature? Can donate two trees to be planted in their name for less than $20. Into photography? Can put a picture you took on your phone of a place with special meaning to you two on a canvas for less than $30. For those well off couples, giving them something handmade, or meaningful, or making a modest donation to cause important to them are all fair game. 

At the end of the day, they shouldn&#039;t judge your friendship by the gift.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great topic Joel! -- I went through a period of my life where it felt like I was buying a wedding gift for someone at least once a month. Then, when you get older, things start getting weird when you get invited to the second and third weddings of people you know! But the big thing I had a challenge with was all the wedding showers...because you&#039;re supposed to bring a gift to those too! Normally, you would only get invited to just one of those but if you are in the wedding or immediately family (like when my two sisters got married - one of them twice!) that&#039;s when you are required to go to SIX wedding showers and buy gifts for all of them - PLUS the wedding! Sigh....]]></description>

Absolutely! Most of the wedding&#039;s I&#039;ve been to have a specific lockbox to put cards (many have cash inside). Totally agree about gifts brought to the wedding venue... It&#039;s better to ship directly to their house before or after the wedding day. Carrying them all home can be a hassle for the bride/groom depending on how big!]]></description>
