					<description><![CDATA[I would say never fall for these scams or even agree to them no matter how good they sound. Though people who were scammed did get a decent home theater system and all, it&#039;s best to avoid this fully. Usually people who come out of nowhere and offer you a so-called cheaper price will know that something like this is high in demand and will offer you a good price, but to what consequence?

There are so many teenagers that go around offering to sell cheap iPhones and popular smartphones in NYC. You would think they either are very good at finding bargain prices, or better yet, stole it from someone. 

It&#039;s almost like me buying a perfectly good iPhone for $50, except it freezes every 10 hours or has a 20 minute battery life.. which I will have to spend to replace anyway.

I would avoid it even if there&#039;s a good chance you get a 100% working product, but why would you take that chance and lose money? Unless it&#039;s really something you can fully test right on the spot and then pay, it&#039;s never a good idea.

1) You are not always sure whether it is used or not. Therefore, it can be faulty. And you cannot return it to the person, obviously, so you will be wasting money.

2) If you do not have the website, nor know if it&#039;s a good brand, you should stay away. Sometimes, these people can get so tricky that they would make a fake website just for you to look at and make you think it&#039;s legit.

3) Worse things can happen. In worse case scenarios, it could be stolen and someone would catch you helping these people who could&#039;ve stole these. It could set your house on fire or cause injuries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many years ago, it has to be almost 10 now, I was approached by someone with this scam.  I was in a talkative mood and I did talk to them but I also had my guard up.  So I also asked a bunch of questions.  They &quot;seemed&quot; to have answers for everything.  But it seemed really odd.  I asked to see the speakers under the pretense of, &quot;how do I know there are really speakers in those boxes?&quot;

They opened the box and let me see that top of the speaker but that was enough.  I could tell just from looking at it that it was garbage.  I had worked in a theater as a technician for several years and had seen hundreds of speakers and brands of quality and not-so quality speakers... and you could tell these were worse than any of those.  I took a good look at it and turned to the guy, &quot;I wouldn&#039;t pay $30 for those speakers.&quot;

He started stammering and then said that I obviously didn&#039;t know what I was talking about and he wouldn&#039;t sell them to someone who didn&#039;t know anything about audio equipment.  LOL

Then he went off looking for another mark.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was only partly scam.
There is a manufacturer of audio equipment called Paramax (i think it got bought out).
The only scam part about this is that you can buy the same equipment from Amazon or ebay for $100 instead of $280. 
So relax... you just made a bad purchase :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the warning. I&#039;ve had &quot;kinda&quot; similar experience but I didn&#039;t buy since I didn&#039;t have money at that time. I was getting my gas and I was approached by this guy who said he&#039;s got designer jeans, purses and jackets in his car. He wants to sell the items to me but would only take cash. I was tempted to check it out, but then, I didn&#039;t have money at that time so I said- never mind!]]></description>
