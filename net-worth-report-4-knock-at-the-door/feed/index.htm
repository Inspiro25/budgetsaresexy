I&#039;m actually quite proud of myself... The old Joel 10 years ago would have given them $100 as a moving present, instead of just $40. So breaking even is actually something to celebrate :)   Cheers to a good year IF!!]]></description>

Interesting! I&#039;ll be honest - I had to google what the Buffet Indicator was! :)  Can&#039;t blame you for trying to preserve capital, it&#039;s more and more important as you come closer to your retirement date. Most people find it hard to give up good returns for less risk, so I&#039;m glad you&#039;re doing what&#039;s right for your personal situation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth-report-4-knock-at-the-door/#comment-318078&quot;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m roughly 5 years away from retirement.  The current valuations are lofty enough that it makes me too nervous to stay in the market and risk a significant drop which would require me to delay my retirement until the market had largely recovered.

I can miss out on some additional growth and still retire on schedule.  But if the market were to crater me, I would have to wait it out.

I&#039;ve considered the possibility that the recovering economy may bring GDP up and therefore make the market valuations more attractive to me without a &quot;crash&quot;.  And if GDP recovers while equities remain steady, at some point I&#039;ll start getting back in. Maybe when the Buffet Indicator drops back down to about 120%.

It may be splitting hairs, but I&#039;m trying to value the market vs &quot;time&quot; it.  I took the last installment out of the market when the Buffet Indicator pushed past 150%.  I didn&#039;t start reducing my positions until it had gone over 130%.  The only time it was over 130% prior to that in my lifetime was just before the 2000 crash.  Currently it is over 190%  Yikes!

If I miss out on some growth, so be it.  And I&#039;m even ok with that.   I consider that &quot;loss&quot; the same as paying insurance that ensures I won&#039;t have to delay my retirement plans past my &quot;sell by&quot; date.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on the NW increase! And a great way to end 2020 indeed with stimulus checks. It&#039;s like Christmas 2021 came 51 weeks earlier than normal. 

My 2020 was OK.. when I started the year I was on track to increase my NW by 100 - 200% but then the pandemic ended and I only increased my NW by 50%. Smaller numbers such as my NW have an easier time climbing up than higher numbers like yours, ha. 

I am hoping 2021 will be the year everyone can safely socialize and actually do stuff. But then a new strand of COVID could happen so who knows.. We shall see!]]></description>

Awesome, Michael! That&#039;s one of my goals this year - to set up a donor advised fund. I&#039;ll have to hit you up and pick your brain about the process. I was just gonna transfer cash, then invest it. But now that I think about it, appreciated lots of stock is a way better move. I&#039;m still scratching the surface of researching this stuff!

Congrats on the Net Worth gain my friend! And exiting the rental in a hot market!! :)]]></description>

Congrats Ben! You are a smart investor. I do know of a secret crypto fund that I just heard about... Super small right now, but it&#039;s gonna blow up massively this coming year. It&#039;s called Joelcoin - let me know if you want to invest and I&#039;ll give you the account number to transfer all your money to. :)]]></description>

Try this Steve... Break your wealth down into pennies...  100 x pennies is longer than 1 dollar bill, but the same value. Each penny is .75 inches, so 1 dollar is 75 inches. I&#039;m too tired right now to compute into feet and miles, but you&#039;ll find you&#039;ll go probably 10x the distance your bills will take you?  :)

PS. holy moly 23,000 miles!!!?  You&#039;ve nearly circled planet earth?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year, Joel! 

2020 was a good year for net worth. We ended up ~13% year over year in December. 

We did, however, decide to give away a chunk of the gains by funding our first donor-advised fund. This allowed us to donate appreciated equities and also realize a nice tax deduction for the year (which is welcomed since we also sold off an appreciated rental property too).

Wishing you a healthy and prosperous year ahead. :)]]></description>
