Yeah it seems I&#039;ve got a higher risk tolerance than others. I&#039;m certainly not opposed to health insurance, and we will eventually get it in the longer term, but it&#039;s just not one of our short term goals rn. Any advice should be taken with a grain of salt for sure - even MMM&#039;s!]]></description>

I&#039;m also curious- how do you get your closing cost so low? I&#039;ve just called and asked and all 3 companies I just called had closing costs of at least $4000. Thank you!]]></description>

This is awesome! Thank you for sharing. Your post has inspired us to look into refinancing. Quick question- i have never heard of keeping a consistent max balance to earn the 3.2% interest. Which bank are you with? And a high-yield savings would still be a bit low nowadays, right? Maybe 1%?]]></description>

It&#039;s kind of fun though... I used to set myself a HUGE alcohol budget (i really enjoy it, so why not) and would try to max out every dollar in it. I&#039;ll have to share some figures in a future post :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Joel. Adoption seems like a pretty good route and it is great that you will be making a huge impact on someone else life! Kudos!

My net worth has grown a lot in the last six months but over Q3 I am going to be taking my foot off the gas a tiny bit to put some investment into personal development (although most of my money will still be going into Vanguard).

Best wishes!

No health insurance. Yikes! Last year, 2019, my friend was diagnosed, out of the blue, with breast cancer. Chemo, surgery, all kinds of doctor appointments, medications, etc. Thankfully, she was covered under a MN state plan, which has excellent coverage. If not, she&#039;d be broke. Couldn&#039;t work, so out of income for the year.

Please, please reconsider this decision! If you have lower income, then I assume you&#039;d qualify for one of California&#039;s plans (I&#039;m not familiar with their choices). Having that peace of mind should something come up is worth far more than paying a penalty on your taxes. Your wife rides a bike. It only takes one bad situation to create an enormous nightmare, or ruin your life.]]></description>
