					<description><![CDATA[Agreed :)  And also, in TRUE emergencies having a credit card could also be very very important if they ever get stranded or in trouble/etc.  It always made me feel REAL secure knowing i had one in my pocket throughout college just in case.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do prefer cash over credit. However, I must admit that my credit card does come in handy. I’m not a parent, but if I was I would start teaching my child how to be financially smart at an early age. Kids are pretty impressionable and observant at a young age. Your cousin definitely proves that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;South County Girl&lt;/b&gt; - Very true indeed - sometimes simple IS better!  It&#039;s too bad we get so jaded over the years and have so many things rolling around in our heads every time we make a decision ;)  Athough it obviously helps with decisions too, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a cool idea!  And once the money&#039;s gone, it&#039;s gone - no building up interest or trouble until they get their next card, I like it :)
@&lt;b&gt;crashdamage1957&lt;/b&gt; - Right.  Pre-paid or debt cards are nice in-betweens that save you the hassle of using straight up cash, but also don&#039;t get you in too much trouble if you stick to your guns.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, perhaps.  But only if he has a radio w/ him when he fishes - that&#039;s pretty much all he does these days ;)
@&lt;b&gt;MariaN&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s interesting about video games = killing and how people perceive it nowadays/etc.  I know there&#039;s research done on this allll the time just like they did when rap music came out (and people sill say that&#039;s bad!  which I don&#039;t agree with), but I haven&#039;t really paid enough attention to say I fall on one side or the other.  It&#039;s certainly pretty fascinating though :)  And I&#039;d throw in &quot;local news&quot; in there to cuz all that violence is in there every day too!  

As for Debit cards - yeah, if I ever gave up my credit cards I&#039;d totally revert to those in its place.  It&#039;s super convenient and keeps you out of trouble a lot more.  I think it would just scare me more for two reasons: 1)  If it&#039;s stolen and used before you catch it, your money goes bye-bye a lot faster than w/ credit, and 2)  I&#039;d feel less secure not having that large credit limit there (mine are $25k and $30k). Obviously I&#039;d never need to max out either of those for an emergency that would come up, BUT I like knowing I hace access to it just in case something scary DOES come up.  Esp that would cost more than what I have in my checking account (not sure what that would be, exactly, but ya never know).
@&lt;b&gt;Catherine Turley&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  In cases like those I try and do the same thing :)  I know what it&#039;s like to run a small business and those fees DEF add up!
@&lt;b&gt;Kelsey Horner&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that would be awesome of you :)  I slip every now and then when I don&#039;t  actually HAVE the cash on me to begin with, but if I do I always try to pay with that first, and then use card as last resort.  If they have an ATM it helps too, but then you&#039;re paying THEM to use cash! haha... (but maybe you really want to help them out? :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never really thought of the cost to the business when it&#039;s a small, local business. I&#039;ll definitely rethink using the credit card at smaller shops from now on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good morning, J. Very interesting post; and a contentious one, I think. I agree that &#039;Cash is King&#039;, I am afraid. Credit cards are a bit like other &#039;removed mediators&#039; - they tend to mask relationships further and make actions easier. Actions, like spending money we don&#039;t have, on crap we don&#039;t need, killing the planet meanwhile. It is a very similar set up to the latest weapons systems - they are like playing computer games. People are so removed from the consequesnce of their action that it is a play. As a result, killing is easier, I believe.

I still have loads of CC (with frightfully high limits) and use some of them; but given what I have just written I suspect this is not going to last long. How about Debits cards though?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m thinking your nephew has been listening to Dave Ramsey..as one of his mottos (that he says at the beginning of almost every show) is &quot;Debt is Dumb, Cash is King!&quot; Or maybe he&#039;s just smart!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that pre-paid C&#039;cards would be a good hybrid between charge cards and cash.. the convenience of a card, with the limit that you woudl have to have the cash to load the thing in the first place.except that right now, the excessive fees and arcane use -it- or- lose -it rules make them a really poor alternative choice.]]></description>
