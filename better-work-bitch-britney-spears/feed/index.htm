					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Britney Spears&#039; music is not sending out financial advice. Funny that she says work, when she has made her millions from crappy songs and bad publicity. She is just promoting what your blog is against, making money and filling it with instant gratification and material items.

Lordes, &quot;Royals&quot; is not about money. It is simply stating that most people in our world are not celebrities and we will never be like them. The lyrics state that it is okay to have a normal life.]]></description>

You&#039;re right, Miley&#039;s all kinda of dope these days. Despite what people say and hate on. She may not be the best role model for youngin&#039;s, but damn she&#039;s good at what she does. And especially at marketing! She has the entire world talking about her!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J you don&#039;t need to be ashamed of your musical taste as I like those songs.  Of course when I was single I had to hide my taste in music before I was able to trick my wife to falling in love with me.  She doesn&#039;t like my taste in music, the beauty of being married she&#039;s stuck.]]></description>

I know, right? I feel like a LOT of singers&#039; voices go into accents here and there... I don&#039;t even think they mean it to either - it&#039;s just what they think *sounds good* when they&#039;re doing it. At least that&#039;s my only reasoning for it :)]]></description>
