					<description><![CDATA[I would have to say the big screen that I bought for 900. Getting 20% off Bing plus an extra 4% elsewhere made the deal pretty sweet. (It made me feel less guilty about the purchase) Plus I paid it off in full the next month :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I opened a credit card through Circuit City in order to get 0% interest for 5 or so years on our flatscreen TV a few years ago.  That was $1600 or something.  We paid it off pretty quickly.  No regrets though.  I love that TV.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The most expensive thing I&#039;ve charge to my credit card would be my airfare and cruise that I&#039;m going on in 28 days!  All told it came to around $1900 and I&#039;m almost done paying it off.   Took me a good 4 months, but I think it&#039;s worth it for 10 days cruising around the Mediterranean!

As far as tangible items on my credit card, that would be the Coach purse and matching wallet I bought myself at the outlets for my birthday last summer.  I think those totaled about $350. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm I&#039;m pretty sure the most expensive thing I ever charged was either my plane ticket to Europe for this summer ($1400!!!!!!!!!!!! ridic).  Or it might have been the one time I had my car in for repairs (new radiator, new neutral switch, new door pin, etc.) that was somewhere over $1000 but I don&#039;t quite remember how much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had weight loss surgery (lap band) 6 months ago.  I have since lost 73lbs and still losing.  I put my entire surgery fee and after care on my capital one rewards visa card: $17200.  I paid it ALL off at the end of that month, so no interest charges and I rec&#039;d back about $350 in rewards cash back from Visa.  Then I claimed it as a deduction on my 2009 taxes as a medical expense and got back about $3k more than my usual tax return check.  Best thing I ever did for my health.  period.       lapbandgalsjourney.blogspot.com]]></description>
