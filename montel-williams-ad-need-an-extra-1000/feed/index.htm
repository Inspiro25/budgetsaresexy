					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear, William :(  Hope things get better for you!

@&lt;b&gt;vicki&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting, never heard that before?  And also, sorry for commenting back so late! haha... you weren&#039;t waiting around for 2 years were you? ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Def&lt;/b&gt; - Obama coin?  I&#039;ll have to Google that one... sounds vaguely familiar but must have happened before I started collecting them more. Shame either way :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lt. Commander Montel Williams has some serious issues with credibility. It&#039;s a shame for such an accomplished person to stoop this low. First, there was Sylvia Brown, then the Obama coin (which turned out to be a sticker glued to a coin!?).. Then we get the Montel Williams juicer, finally Commander Williams joins the likes of Magic Johnson and Russell Simmons in deceiving their own communities with these predatory lenders in disguise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Occasionally, Montel comes to me in my sleep (we&#039;ve become very close, that&#039;s why I use just his first name.) I don&#039;t mean figuratively, i.e. in a dream. I mean the actual guy, Montel Williams, through the bedroom window. He sits on the corner of the bed. He usually brings food - Thai is my favorite - and we swap stories about the good old days before the infomercials and the mold.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Vicki...To make sure I understand, are you saying that Montel was threatened by someone about telling the truth on his talk show and when he refused to stop, they fired him? Where did you get all of this information from? 

@ Greg, yeah I just had to come back to see what she was talking about. What I got from all of that is Montel cleaned out the mold in her home for $1,000 - pretty good deal!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[first of all, to all of you who have said that montel williams has sold out ,or went down hill from t.v. to infomercials. before you speak, you need to do some research, so let me clue you in. on the day that ended montels career was on t.v. the goverment or t.v. station, i;m not sure who told him [ not to tell the people the truth ] about situations that were talked about, [ and he chose us the people ] and told us the truth, even when his job was at stake because montel is a man of integrity and truth, and anybody who ever watched his shows many times knows this about him,  so if you all think he has really went down hill remember it was 4 you and me.                    1000 $ get a home with no mold so i could be well]]></description>
