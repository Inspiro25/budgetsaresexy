We&#039;re just about to take the plunge and start investing with Vanguard too. They have very cheap management fees and the way the company is structured is very unique and important.

A great blog I read on this stuff is over at http://jlcollinsnh.wordpress.com He&#039;s an already retired and very experienced investor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love that football analogy, William!! My wife was the EXACT same way - hated to watch cuz she never understood it and didn&#039;t know what the big fuss was about... Then I helped explained things to her over time, and we had a team to root for (the Redskins, what what!), and now she enjoys it immensely :) It took a few seasons, but the more you&#039;re immersed in it as you said, the better (and more comfortable) you&#039;ll get over time! Great point, indeed.]]></description>

GOOD JOB keeping that emergency fund safe and secure! That&#039;s a wonderful feeling isn&#039;t it? Knowing you always have it just in case? I never advise anyone to start investing until they&#039;ve got most of their debt away and a nice savings cushion for emergencies/etc... You gotta have a solid foundation first before venturing into other more complicated worlds :)]]></description>

Maybe you should, indeed :) Your brother&#039;s lucky he has you to help watch over and lead him too - you only need to learn this stuff once and then it&#039;s always in your head!]]></description>
