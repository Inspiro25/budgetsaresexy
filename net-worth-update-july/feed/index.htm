					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys!  Sorry for the delay here -- been in and out of town for the past 3 weeks hustlin&#039; ;) Well, that and vacationing - but still!

Here are some responses:

@&lt;b&gt;John&lt;/b&gt; - Yes!  That is exactly what happened - my AC just went kapooey all of a sudden.  I don&#039;t know jack about cars, or how to go about even fixing a relay, but I can def. run it by my mechanic friend to try out :)  Though luckily Fall is slowly approaching which means I have another 8 months or so until I need to start worrying about it again! Haha...  good lookin&#039; out though, bro.
@&lt;b&gt;jennypenny&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  We *are* in very similar situations :)  Though unfortunately I still have yet to figure it out... I&#039;ll actually be blogging about WHICH mortgage to pay off first though this week, so def. stay tuned.  I promise to let y&#039;all know the plan as soon as I do!
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Glad to hear it my friend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, well yeah - I haven&#039;t done it yet cuz I HATE THEM! ;)  But it&#039;ll be coming up soon, I promise.  Stay tuned...
@&lt;b&gt;CityFlips&lt;/b&gt; - Heck yeah it is!  $1,000 is no joke for anyone&#039;s net worth - congrats :)
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - What? Really?  Like, you sued them or a group of people sued them and they&#039;re now forced to pay people back?  Cuz if so that&#039;s allllll kinds of awesome! Haha... congrats :)  Def. let us know what happened!	
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, the markets haven&#039;t been helping at all this month either so far, bleh...
@&lt;b&gt;Alex&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I should probably have a liability section too, but last time I tried it I just confused myself more.  I figured this way it HITS me more when I see such a big clump going away every 3 months.  It may not make the most sense tracking-wise, but it def. helps to keep me on track and conscious of it all ;)  So for now, it works.

@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Yup!  A HUGE relief.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s still even settled in yet, haha... almost 2 years of waiting and hoping for it just makes it all so surreal once I got it! :)  I&#039;m glad your net worth is going up too over there though, it all adds up!
@&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt; - Oh awesome, that&#039;s great :)  Watching others&#039; net worths helped ME when I first started blogging, so it&#039;s something I def. keep doing to hopefully help others too (as well as keep myself on track at the same time).  Keep up the good work!
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s all a part of the game ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kody @ Financial Money Tips&lt;/b&gt; - Heck yeah!  The faster you start saving/investing, the more it snowballs over time!  I&#039;ll try and get that morgage post out sooner than later, I&#039;m just working on figuring out some more stuff... as for your house buying, I won&#039;t tell you not to do it, but DEF please for all that&#039;s holy - make SURE it&#039;s something you really want to do!  It&#039;s def. not for everyone, so take your time and make super wise (and slow) decisions :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Nope, cuz it could have very easily been long gone.  In fact, I started writing it off in my head as the odds got smaller and smaller every month that passed w/out any deposits :(  I was still planning on fighting tooth and nail for it, but to me it was all wishful money and could only be counted once I had it in my hand.
@&lt;b&gt;Nicole&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  You ARE a sugar momma ;)  Very impressive too - $200k at your age is awesome, ESP with having a child.  Keep rockin&#039; it my friend! And congrats on the upcoming wedding :)
@&lt;b&gt;Million Mile Secrets&lt;/b&gt; - No doubt, good sir :)
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - I get lucky sometimes ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“being too busy to splurge even if I wanted to!”  

That&#039;s not entirely a bad thing!  Seriously, just like with the page views, the first million takes time, but it should be easier after that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My net worth went down about $10,000.  I am at $189,860.  Most of the reason is I lowered the estimate of value of my second property that is still not sold.  I had it as $120,000, but since it still hasnt sold, it obviously isnt worth that!  So, I am now estimating it at $115,000...Zillow agrees.
The other reason my networth went down is I am getting married in September, so I have been on a spending splurge.  Luckily, the fiance&#039;s parents are paying for the wedding (Mostly because they are the ones that wanted the wedding, fiance and I wanted to just go to Vegas and mine arent paying because they threw me a beautiful first wedding and I wont ask them to do that again).  Anyway....I&#039;ve been buying bridal shoes, and jewelry and honeymoon clothes, and bathing suits for Hawaii, etc, etc.
But, I still think a networth of almost $190,000 is pretty good for a 35-year old single mom.  My hope is that by age 40, my husband and I will be at $500,000.  He&#039;s got some student debt and credit card debt though that I can&#039;t wait to start kicking out.  I hate that I am inheriting his debt, but we&#039;ll manage.  Also, upset that he is 40 and just started his 401(k) last year.  What a difference between me starting at 21 and him starting at 39.  Hmmmm, am I a sugar mama?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shouldn&#039;t the 401(k) be listed as -+$16,908.95? (or whatever the balance was before you rolled it over to the IRA) As you pointed out, this is technically money you already had, even if they were dragging their feet about giving it to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally logged into my Mint.com account after avoiding it like the plague for 12 months.  The Cons: It took forever to classify transactions and cleanup my account.  The Pros: I realized I still (often) spend money like an idiot ($150 on Potbellys WTF?), and I was able to easily calculate my net worth. 
I&#039;m up approx. $1,800 for the month due to monthly 401k and ING savings account contributions. Sold some stock and used that money to open up a Roth IRA. Ongoing liability is 9k in student loans. Total net worth sits at $34k. Currently 25 and tentatively shooting for $150k net worth before 30 (I think this is a realistic goal?). Thanks for posting - Your Net Worth pieces help inspire me to analyze where I&#039;m at now and realize what I need to do to achieve my savings goals.]]></description>
