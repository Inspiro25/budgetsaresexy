Yup! CPAs can save you a TON - much more than you pay them especially early on in the working together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In terms of getting a &quot;return&quot; on your savings -- you&#039;re getting a so-called &quot;guaranteed&quot; $9,000 &quot;return&quot; by following your accountant&#039;s advice, which translates into an almost 33 percent guaranteed benefit. I&#039;d say that&#039;s a very strong reason to heed his advice and put that money into a SEP-IRA. (And for the rest of the readers, it&#039;s a great reason to get an accountant. Yes, hiring a CPA costs money, but when they can find $9,000 in tax savings for you, they&#039;re worth every dime!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting! I feel like we have something here in the States like that too - a &quot;like purchase&quot; or something? I&#039;d much rather re-invest the money than pay 30% - yikes! Hope you find a new one you like a lot :)]]></description>

I&#039;m stunned that your mother things saving for retirement is throwing your money away. Makes me wonder what state her retirement funds are in? Or, perhaps in her generation she has the luxury of a defined benefit pension plan and additional personal retirement savings are/were not essential. I have this situation with my inlaws. He worked for the same company from the time he left school until he retired (who does that anymore?) Now they live comfortably on his pension, and so sometimes they struggle to understand conversations between their kids/kids spouses about various retirement savings vehicles. They just never had to understand all the options or make investment decisions. Everything was done on their behalf. To them all income that landed in their account was theirs to spend on living. Retirement savings were never a line item on their budget.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would certainly invest the money. I have a similar case since I sold a property and can either buy another one within two years or give 30% of profit to the state, so far, I am going with another property!]]></description>
