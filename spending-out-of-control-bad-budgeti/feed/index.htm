					<description><![CDATA[I had a debt awakening back in May after I returned home from an expensive vacation I knew I couldn&#039;t afford.  It&#039;s been over 6 weeks since I&#039;ve bought anything for myself other than bare essentials, and it hasn&#039;t been too difficult, and I rather enjoy a new outfit.  I am day 4 into my 30 for 30 challenge, so I&#039;ll have abstained from shopping for well over 2 months by the end of July.  It feels good to break bad habits and use what I already have. I wish the emailer luck in achieving her goals!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I stopped shopping but it was to force myself to sew more of my clothes... I have gotten really creative with mixing and matching plus it has been really helpful with my finances.  I used to shop whenever I got bored and it was bad.  I find now whenever I go into a store for something I am totally drawn to the clothing section... it&#039;s like a drug.  I have to resist considering I don&#039;t need more clothing or I can sew the article for a fraction of the cost.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha that would be a record for me, even though I&#039;ve cut back a lot myself ;)  I don&#039;t know about others, but I know I personally like wearing brand new fresh clothes cuz it changes it up a bit and just makes me FEEL better.  Especially Tees.  I could rock a new one every day and would love it if there were no costs involved. Better to be addicted to clothes than other more expensive things. *ahem* crack.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t get it: Why are people so obsessed with buying clothes?

I have not purchased a clothing item in over a year. All of my shirts, pants, and shoes are all still in great condition!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww well that was close!!  You didn&#039;t binge the next day, did you? ;)  Maybe you can try in different chunks?  Like, 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, etc?  For me 40 days of not shopping was enough to really get me in gear, but with other things I have to take smaller steps and build up.  But the good thing here is that you, and the girl who emailed me, are TRYING!  And that&#039;s fabulous, so keep it up!! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[She sure sounds pumped, I hope she does good and learns a lot. At least she knows where her weak points are and realizes that there’s a problem. Once we fully understand there’s a problem and the consequences we’re facing/dealing with it makes it easier to act on (assuming people even want to, some don’t). Recently I’ve been trying to eat out less, but was only able to make it 23 days. :-(]]></description>
