Yes, right! It&#039;s more about the money and debt for sure - gotta dig deep and work on mindset/etc, esp if things are rooted from growing up in certain situations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[12 step programs can be incredibly successful when someone actually follows their steps. I think the thin I love most about them is that they require each person to take a honest self inventory of their situation. I also am very impressed that not only do you make a list of who you have harmed, but you do your best to make things right. Powerful stuff. I also didn&#039;t have any idea something like this existed for those in debt, thanks for sharing it with us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have some friends who are in DA, and supposedly it&#039;s life-changing. I guess they don&#039;t just focus on becoming debt free, they also focus on the mindsets that accompany debt, and the &quot;money deprivation&quot; attitude which causes people to be greedy, unethical, ungenerous, etc.]]></description>
