					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I thought of applying to that one, actually, but figured I could probably go to the beach or something in SC :)  Since it&#039;ll be Summer time and all.  But one day I&#039;m gonna finally visit Cincinatti! Never been yet.
@&lt;b&gt;Kathy&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, I&#039;m a much bigger fan of older looking churches too.  They&#039;re so cozy!  Maybe this statue is from a church?  I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s from a ship of some sort, but then others told me it was prob. from an old school church in Italy.  Hopefully we&#039;ll find out soon! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Sonya&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!!  Let me know if you end up going, okay?  That would be cool :)
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... well, it pretty much is if you don&#039;t like antiques or surprises about that kinda stuff ;)  It&#039;s def. not for everyone.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager &lt;/b&gt; - Maybe you should apply then, so if you win you can take ME!!  Then I&#039;ll see you in Seattle finally ;) Hehe...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[She&#039;s beautiful!  It reminds me of a statue from my childhood that was in the church I attended until I was eight. Then we moved and the church we attended was &#039;modern&#039;.  

I love churches that have the &#039;old world&#039; look and feel to them.  Too bad my Parish is very modern looking (however, it always feels like coming home when I walk in).]]></description>
