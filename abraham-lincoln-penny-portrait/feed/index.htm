					<description><![CDATA[Abraham Lincoln set up the national banking system while he was president.  Interesting fact that coincides with a very neat project.  Thanks JMoney for sharing this project with everyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is a fun fact that’s not widely known.. Sorry, I know this is a money blog and this is a little off topic but a fun fact non-the-less.
This is a little risqué but many consider Lincoln to be the first gay president. There are many documented accounts stating Lincoln shared his bed with men in the White House. And he had multiple male lovers besides his wife. 

This is a gay poem written by Lincoln.
  “For Reuben and Charles have married two girls,
But Billy has married a boy.
The girls he had tried on every side,
But none he could get to agree;
All was in vain, he went home again,
And since that he&#039;s married to Natty.”

There is lots of historical debate about this. I like to think it’s all true. It would empower a lot of marginalized people if it is.]]></description>

WOWWW that is wild!!!!

Though I guess it still wouldn&#039;t have saved him :(

&quot;Even if the Secret Service had been established earlier, it wouldn’t have saved Lincoln: The original mission of the law enforcement agency was to combat widespread currency counterfeiting. It was not until 1901, after the killing of two other presidents, that the Secret Service was formally assigned to protect the commander-in-chief.&quot;
