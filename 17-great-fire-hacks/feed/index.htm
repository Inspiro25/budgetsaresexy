Cool! You should blog about it if you end up liking it (or hell - even if you don&#039;t! Haha... which would probably be a more welcome post in this day of age ;))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love reading the comments! In fact, I typically read the post from the email subscription and then a few days later read it on the blog via my Feedly reader so that I can see what comments you have received. You have a great community of readers/commenters and I learn so much. Thank you to ALL your commenters!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Job Spotter app sounds really cool. I&#039;ll have to check that out. 
We just moved to a bustling neighborhood with shops all around. That app might make some money for me. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for mentioning my Job Spotter side hustle hack! It really is a great one for earning small amounts easily; just like finding money on the ground while walking around. I enjoy combining it with apps that pay me for walking steps taken - such as Achievemint, Sweatcoin and Walgreens Balance Rewards. I also use Field Agent, Easy Shift and Gig Walk apps to complete short market research tasks on the go, such as photographing in-store displays. Lots of ways to monetize your lunchbreaks or downtime while being active!]]></description>
