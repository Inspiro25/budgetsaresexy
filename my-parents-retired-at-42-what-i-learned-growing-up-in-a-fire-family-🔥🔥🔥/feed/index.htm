					<description><![CDATA[I FIREd at age 41 (now 58) although I think of it as more of a 10 year sabbatical.  My wife and I raised our 4 children (ages 1 to 12) at that time and home schooled them for most of it.  They were home schooled up to Grade 9 and then High School.

I went back to work and will now FIR next year; can&#039;t call it RE as I will be 59.

Best thing ever for my children, my wife and I.  We raised extremely independent kids.  They would disappear right after 12 noon when school was done; either hopping on their dirt bikes or snowmobiles depending on time of year.  They traveled well. 

It is now the active conversation in our family as to how they will lead their life and FIRE.]]></description>

hahaha! I&#039;m gonna change the site tagline... &quot;this blog will literally put you to sleep&quot; -- Matt Allen.

I get what you mean about enjoying work and no need to FIRE. You&#039;re lucky! Keep it up :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I literally fell asleep while reading this post. No joke. I dozed off and took a short nap, then woke up and read the rest. Lol

Not because the article was boring or bad. I enjoyed it. I just re-read the tagline under the logo for the site - &quot;A personal finance blog that won&#039;t put you to sleep.&quot; - Benjamin Franklin - and I quite literally fell asleep while reading this personal finance blog.

Personally - I&#039;m not a FIRE guy at all. I don&#039;t get it. I think it&#039;s cool that others have that goal. For me - I find it fulfilling to do work that I enjoy and plan to keep working as much as possible because I truly enjoy my work. I still have plenty of time to spend with my family and we spend our time together very well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an amazing story! We are currently 30-years old taking an 18 month mini-retirement after the birth of our daughter. Our goal is to achieve FIRE by the time we are 40. Our daughter will be 10 at that time. This post really resonates with me to know that some day it will mean so much to her!
Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVED this piece.  I&#039;m a finance blogger myself and read FIRE blogs all the time, but I&#039;ve never come across one like this.  Thank you.

My wife and I have four young kids.  About three years ago, when I was 41, we achieved a significant milestone of financial independence.  At the same time it hit us that our two oldest children were over halfway done their time with us before they&#039;d head out on their own. That hit us hard.  

I quit my job, we sold our house and most of our stuff and we traveled around the world for a year (pre-COVID) as a family.  Now we&#039;re in a small town with low expenses.  We drive used cars and have a modest house but are rich in the most important way: time.  Life didn&#039;t get easy, but now I spend my time on the things that matter the most to me, which is my family + the projects that I choose to work on.

I know the kids don&#039;t &quot;appreciate&quot; what we&#039;ve done, but it&#039;s really heartwarming to hear your reflections on the benefits of this unusual approach to mid-life and parenthood.  Thanks again.]]></description>

Thanks Frank. You might be disappointed to learn that it wasn&#039;t anything special. Or maybe that&#039;s more inspiring, that it&#039;s pretty basic to do? My dad was and continue to be a capable and enthusiastic investor, so while he obviously saved a lot of money, he&#039;s been actively managing and growing it for decades. Perhaps Joel will let me do a follow up post to share some more details!]]></description>
