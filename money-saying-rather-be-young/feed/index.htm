					<description><![CDATA[Man, is that scary/sobering/important to think about how in 100 years there will be an entirely different set of people on earth. (100 years actually doesn&#039;t sound like a particularly long time...) Just that thought makes me want to slow down time rather than speed it up. I will definitely add this to my strategies for trying to stay more in the present moment!]]></description>

I think that sounds like a good idea too :) I typically always have &quot;blow money&quot; I&#039;m allowed to use without worry, and even just knowing it&#039;s there makes a world of a difference even if I don&#039;t touch it. It&#039;s a tricky balance for sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the &quot;Millionaire in Training&quot; comment at the end!

Almost being 25, I have had that realization I do have my goals in place and I am on track to meet them but what if I don&#039;t take advantage of everything that life has to offer? Sometimes I get jealous that some coworkers are doing everything that they want to do while I know I am making decisions today so that I have my nest egg for the future. Is the delayed gratification worth it?

I think I will have to start budgeting in more of the fun stuff in addition to retirement and saving for big life events as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/money-saying-rather-be-young/#comment-187652&quot;&gt;GE Miller&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks man. That &quot;100 years&quot; thing has stuck with me for weeks now - I literally think about it every day! Really puts things in perspective and reminds me to keep asking myself why the hell I do _____ if it&#039;s not important. I still have a ways to go for optimal living/working, but time *is* slowing way the hell down now which is great :) And so far it&#039;s a direct result of working less. I don&#039;t know what speeds up time more than working!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article!  The problem many people have is that they believe it to be an either/or proposition.  If I want to enjoy life today, I need to overspend and have a great time!   Actually spending more has little effect on your current level of happiness.  

Eckert Tolle has some great ideas about living in the present.  Imagining your future life will either create anticipation or anxiety.  Everything that ever has happened or will happen happens in the present.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I&#039;ve been guilty of trying to rush to the next phase my entire life, and I&#039;ve finally gotten to the point (in my 30s) where I&#039;ve realized that slowing things down and enjoying THIS phase is really important - even if I don&#039;t quite have 7 figures in investments just yet. :)]]></description>
