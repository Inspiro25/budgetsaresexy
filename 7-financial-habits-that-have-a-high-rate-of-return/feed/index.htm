Very cool!!!! I hope I can even come close to doing 10 miles at some point in my life. You are good, sir! And I bet you totally waited for your wife and friends to be gone so they didn&#039;t stop you from trying it, huh?? HUH??? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like #5 for &quot;fun money.&quot;

I think it&#039;s so easy to underrate taking care of yourself whether that means running or indulging in some simple pleasures that prevent you from serious binges and burnout.

&quot;Set a low trajectory over the horizon -- or gravity will fix it for you&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Knee surgery and a blood disease ended my marathon hobby in 2012 but I kept running shorter distances three times a week with my wife and other friends. Saturday I turned 63 and since wife was out of town I decided to do a ten mile run by myself with no rest stops or walking instead of the normal Saturday 7 miler with lots of walking breaks. I think it had been almost seven years since I tried to run that far in a continuous stretch. I did it! And it was mostly fun except the last three miles were reminiscent of my marathon days where I had to mentally battle my worst enemy, me, to keep going. I don&#039;t intend to do that very often because the knee and the blood aren&#039;t great, so there is a safety issue with overdoing it. But the thing is I did more than I thought I could do, and I felt like I was 23 instead of 63 the rest of the day. We are slightly early retired and have more money than we need because we lived the way you now teach others, it was natural for us but I appreciate your modeling and teaching it to others who will find financial freedom because of your vision.]]></description>

Try this video when you&#039;re stuck inside!! It&#039;s the only one I&#039;ve continued to use over the years and really works you good in a short amount of time... Also has some great music (though NSFW):

In most cases I&#039;d agree w/ the &quot;trapped&quot; feeling, but when you&#039;re picking up stuff that you actually need to improve your life (HVACs, cars, etc), these companies *are* actually helping you out ;) It&#039;s not like any of us can build HVACs or cars ourselves, haha, so maybe thinking of it more along those lines would de-stress you a bit and help you feel more appreciative? I don&#039;t know anyone who literally just throws away money for the pure sake of it, so usually when you do it&#039;s because you want/need something in return. Most people just don&#039;t know where to draw the line and mistake &quot;wants&quot; with &quot;needs&quot;, which is a whole other story.

Just a different way of thinking about it, anyways... I&#039;ve been trying to do the same myself, and it definitely helps although not completely :)]]></description>
