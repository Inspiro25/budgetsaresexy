Dude - I&#039;m allll about that cash! I love love love having it in my pocket and spending it. I &quot;feel it&quot; each time I do which then makes me not spend as much :) I also feel a lot safer with some on me at all times in case cards aren&#039;t accepted somewhere or they expire/get hacked before I realize it. Cash never expires!]]></description>

cool! Let me know how it goes if you ever try any of them out :) I got over the privacy thing yearsss ago when I realized everything we do nowadays is online - hah. At least banks have gotten better at shutting things down and covering you if/when you get hacked :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your thoughts posed another question for me... You can only smell and feel actual money (cash) yet it seems like nobody uses cash these days. So what are we smelling and holding? Credit cards! Yaaay! Seriously though, I think the &quot;sensation&quot; you talk about with feeling money helps us be more conscious of what we&#039;re spending it on - when using a credit card we just swipe, swipe, swipe away.

Maybe we need to start using cash again?]]></description>

Thanks for your comment, Superbien! 

Instavest is registered with the SEC and 100% complies with all rules and regulations.

It&#039;s not crazy - we just think investors can do much better by sharing investment ideas and going through a better user experience to make an investment!  
Happy to answer any other questions you might have!]]></description>

For all of my loyalty cards, I see the Key Ring app.  It&#039;s free, except for the price I probably pay in privacy.  Ha!

I need to look into Digit and Acorns.  I am a little concerned about linking to my bank account, but I guess my account information is digital and shared over the WWW with or without me.  I am making investing a priority in the next week.  Thanks for the regular updates about these apps!]]></description>

Haha... that does sound bad, doesn&#039;t it? You of course want to do your own research before signing up to anything you read online (or from a blogger ;)), but for me - getting them on the phone and learning more always helps. And knowing they are backed by an incredibly successful, and trustworthy, source as YC does too. I guess I always prefer going to the source and then making a call from there.]]></description>
