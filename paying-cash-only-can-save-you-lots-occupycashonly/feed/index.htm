Wowwwww so interesting!! I bet you&#039;re more picky on what you end up buying too then, eh?? I can&#039;t imagine never using a credit card! Haha... but at least I pay it off in full every month and reap the rewards that come along with it :) Still though, I bet I spend more in the long run.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i live in europe and paying in cash is mutch more common here. I have never paid with a credit card in a store in my life. If i want something or need something i pay in cash whenever possible. Otherwise i use my debitcard.

The problem with cash is that it is used sometimes to provide a service without paying taxes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Fred the Foxy Finance Blogger&lt;/b&gt; - I like it! Though I don&#039;t have the patience to go elsewhere everytime I get denied, haha... that&#039;s pretty impressive you can do that :)

@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats on the savings! $100 just for 10 seconds of work - way to go.

@&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Now that is pretty funny... I had never heard of that before, thx :)

@&lt;b&gt;JMK&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah! When we were in Prague it was like that too - water cost more than beer!! Something I was NOT complaining about, haha... but you&#039;re totally right - the more culture you get in you, the more you&#039;re aware of the world. I love traveling.

@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a good question, I&#039;ll ask him :) Though I wonder if it&#039;s better to ask AFTER the work is done, rather than before, ya know? That way it doesn&#039;t mess w/ anything else?

@&lt;b&gt;Alex&lt;/b&gt; - Depends on what&#039;s more important to you really.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I confess, I was a bit shocked when I realized how much merchants pay for the ability to use credit cards in their stores.

I always thought I was getting the best deal by accumulating reward points, but paying cash might be a win-win situation for merchants AND consumers. It&#039;s something to think on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you think your service and quality was just the same paying all cash?  Do you have the same leverage, like options for dispute etc with all cash?

Cash worries me, even though I know it&#039;s very smart and can save you a lot of money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When travelling in northern europe this summer we used far more cash than we would have preferred for meals. The bill would arrive after the meal, but that was the price for cash. If you wanted to use a credit card they added on a few percent to cover their transaction fees. We weren&#039;t prepared for this at the first place but made sure we had cash for the next day. We still put our hotels on our card (perhaps there would have been a discount if we&#039;d offered cash) because that would have been too much cash to carry around. Different countries, different practices. Of course in Copenhagen, one restaurant we went to charge 2euros per glass of tap water. On this side of the Atlantic we are used to getting certain things for free automatically. It&#039;s good to have a little eyeopener now and then to make you appreciate what you have.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with several others that say this screams of tax evasion. Credit card swipe fees are a few percent. There&#039;s no way that someone would negotiate down 33% to avoid running a card.

If your friend wants an even better deal, he should turn around and report this guy for tax evasion. ;-)

Whistleblowers can pocket 15-30% of the funds of recovered. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialramblings.com/archives/irs-whistleblower-program/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Nice work man! I seriously need to try this myself the next time - I always suck at negotiating :( Or even *thinking* about it, outside of yard sales/etc at least, haha...

@&lt;b&gt;Pete&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome! Love that!

@&lt;b&gt;Grayson @ Debt Roundup&lt;/b&gt; - For real. I actually just bought a coin off a friend in cash and I&#039;m 99% sure I got it cheaper cuz of that too - not that I intentionally went that route on purpose :) But now that I know about it I will in the future!

@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - That seems to be the consensus here, huh? I didn&#039;t even think of that when posting this up...

@&lt;b&gt;John S @ Frugal Rules&lt;/b&gt; - The rewards DO make it easier/better paying with cads most times, but maybe just for services we try and do cash only and see?

@&lt;b&gt;Pauline&lt;/b&gt; - I think I want to pay cash for my next house - how sexy would THAT be?? :)

@&lt;b&gt;Kira&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!! And way to go husband!

@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah!!! Great idea! Cuz I mean it&#039;s the same pretty much as cash anyways, right?

@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.. that kinda solves that one, huh? ;)

@&lt;b&gt;K&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s true, you have no decisions in what they do with their money/taxes/etc, except to *not* pay cash if you think they&#039;re gaming the system and you don&#039;t like that.

@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Pop @ Planting Our Pennies&lt;/b&gt; - Checks??? What are those? ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Max @ MyWallStreetOccupation&lt;/b&gt; - Good deduction!! No doubt would the credit card companies get pissed, ESP at huge retailers like that.

@&lt;b&gt;Tony@YouOnlyDoThisOnce&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man, glad you&#039;re enjoyint them lately :) Though I&#039;m still a huge fan of credit cards, haha... Can both be King?]]></description>
