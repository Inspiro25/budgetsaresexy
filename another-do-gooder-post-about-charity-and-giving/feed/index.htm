Woohoo! Make sure you write a funny joke inside the gift card... Maybe a Starbucks Pun, like... &quot;have a Grande Christmas!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE seeing those little libraries. I always stop to browse. That&#039;s a good idea. I think I&#039;m going to copy the holiday lights idea with some Starbucks gift cards--that&#039;s very sweet of your mom.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another way to give (and this is a two-fer for Amazon Smile) is to go to the Amazon Smile desktop site, then select one of the charitable gift lists.  The hyperlink can be found below your personalized wish list(s) and  directly above the Alexa Shopping List.

This way you can purchase an item off of one of the many charitable wish lists available and still benefit your preferred charitable organization by having a portion of the purchase go to whichever org is registered for your Amazon account.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love giving randomly to people throughout the year.  I think it&#039;s cool to give when people don&#039;t expect it.  When it comes to December, I go crazy and spoil myself...I rarely give presents to anyone.

As for charity, I do that ALL the time.  

Joel, I got my dream apartment in Dallas!!  It&#039;s the one I showed you.  I&#039;ve met the landlord in person (when he traveled to Vegas for work) and we&#039;ve been communicating via text.  However, I leave in eight days to move and no lease has been signed and I still haven&#039;t paid my first month&#039;s rent and security deposit.  Hmmm...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Due to not gathering last year I didn&#039;t get stocking stuffers. Instead I picked a charity to donate to in each family members honor, in alignment with their interests. My dad is an avid bird watcher (out the kitchen window), my sister&#039;s favorite animal rescue, a music program for my brother who is self taught on some instruments, &#038; an animal rescue close to my mom I knew she visited before the pandemic. 
It was fun trying to come up with charities outside my normal point of reference.]]></description>
