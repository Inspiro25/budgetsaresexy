You’re exactly right, however, each lease can be negotiated differently. Just like any business, nothing is really completely passive, however, with the right structures in place, it can be fairly passive just like with real estate investing.]]></description>

Thank you very much! As I say, this is not recommended advice, but if you do go all in on a venture, burn the boats.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Compelling story, not too many people would think of a gym as a &quot;passive business&quot; however as you say if you have the staff in place, you don&#039;t need to be the one checking people in or fixing the equipment on a daily basis. We need more gyms around the country. 

I&#039;ve always wondered who pays for building upgrades and maintenance, didn&#039;t know landlords only give you an allotment that doesn&#039;t cover the whole thing! Seems like a retail version of Tenant-Improvement Projects.]]></description>

You took a big risk by opening up your gym and I&#039;m so glad its working out well for you.   Congratulations and I wish you continued success!]]></description>
