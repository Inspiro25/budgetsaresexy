YUP! Semi-retirement is a nice place to be too. And in fact, will probably be where I am for the rest of my life after hitting financial freedom :) I won&#039;t ever stop working, but I&#039;ll stop working on stuff that I hate and/or is just for the money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great article. My husband wants to retire in his mid-to-late 30s, only because he&#039;s been in the military for so long and it took a great toll on him. I however only want to retire in my late 40s or even early 50s. I would gladly work. My husband says he would gladly stay at home and take care of our children.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is what it&#039;s all about.  With this in mind, I think the number one thing you can do to make sure you have &quot;enough&quot; in retirement is learn to live on less.  Once you start driving luxury cars, you get addicted and it&#039;s tough to downsize.  Once you&#039;re used to large houses, it becomes difficult to imagine living in a small house.  Be proactive and learn to live on less.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nicely written, simple article J. People make retiring much more complicated than they need to sometimes. The basic principles of 4% per year or expenses*25 are great methods to work with to decide when to make that leap. If one wants to retire earlier lower the expenses or increase the income.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J-Money, 

I&#039;m a long time reader and always appreciate your insights and observations. When you shared this tool earlier this year, it set me on a path to create my own version. It has two tabs, one to track traditional retirement funds (401k, IRA, etc) that can likely not be withdrawn until 59 1/2. The other tab helps plan for that gap between your early retirement / FI date and when you can get out that tax advantaged money. If you have time to check it out and let me know what you think, that&#039;d be great!

Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;When J. Money asks you when you’ll be able to retire, what are you going to tell him? :)&quot;

Probably after I get done reading all 7 years worth of advice&quot;- Too bad I&#039;m a slow reader.
