Yeah, same with adoptions, that are VERY strict as well. I can appreciate the care that comes to finding suitable parents for abandoned children, but apparently there&#039;s absolutely no requirement to become a natural parent. :D

Anyway.. awesome story.

I do think back in the day the process was a bit less strict as it&#039;s now, so sperm donation probably worked OK for some in the past.]]></description>

Haha yeah, not sure who is being hustled here.  Or schedule it for last, and push it off as much as possible to milk the compensation checks (which are tax-free btw)?  That would be my two cents.]]></description>

I&#039;m an even more abnormal adoption case.  I was adopted from a different country while my parents were working over there.   Up until the mid 2000s it was technically illegal for me to even try to find out who my birth parents are (of course there were always ways).

The government of this country has set up a website for adopted children to connect with their birth parents where each side gets to specify the level of contact they are willing to do.  Such as medical history only, email/phone communication all the way up to willing to meet.   Personally I have been pretty lazy about the entire thing, because I know I ended up in a loving home and in the end, my parents provided me with opportunities I probably would not have had if I hadn&#039;t been adopted.]]></description>

Yeah, this post doesn&#039;t do the *real* reasons these places exist any justice (being on a personal finance blog and all), but regardless of the intentions of donating I&#039;ll agree it&#039;s adding a major benefit into the world for those who have always dreamed of having kids but who cannot. In a perfect world though no one would be hurt in the process, of course :(]]></description>
