					<description><![CDATA[That’s some pretty terrible income tbh. Mine usually ranged from 60-100 in tipout plus hourly, which was $1 above minimum where I lived (can’t remember the exact amount at the time).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Rob. If I&#039;m not mistaken, there are a few states that require background checks and licenses stateside, but a majority of states do not. 

Stay safe down under.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good write up on bouncing mate. I&#039;m 30 uears old, live in Australia and have been a bouncer for the past 7 years. Our laws, rules and regulations  in Australia surrounding the cluub and pub security industry is way more in depth than some places in the USA. For instance every state in Australia requires you to have a background check and apply for a government issued license before you can start working as a bouncer.  

A lot of what you described about your job as a bouncer in the USA is exactly the same here in Australia.  

Great write up mate. Stay safe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha. Plenty. I never did anything like that, but I&#039;ve seen it happen before. Some people make money by taking ID&#039;s and selling them back to people. Some idiots even sell drugs on the side. There&#039;s plenty of money to be found on bar room floors too. Lots of different avenues to make money aside from your standard hourly pay. Which way you make that extra money is up to you.]]></description>
