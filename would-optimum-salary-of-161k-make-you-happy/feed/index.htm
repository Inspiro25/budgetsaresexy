You are sure right about that! Actually, I think the middle-class is disappearing. Either you are rich or poor. Wages for many jobs here aren&#039;t that high, ranging from 40K and up depending on your career and I know a few people are still living at home and rooming with at least two other people. NYC is no joke.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Certainly, it depends on area of living and also in general, more money would allow more convenience in our life but is it worth it to sacrifice time/effort/health for more money.  That is important to think about and each person is different.  Bottom line, I think a person can be happy if he knows what &quot;enough&quot; means to him, from a well known story involving the famous authoer Joseph Heller.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sure the money would be great as long as there is a balance of happiness with my career and on the home front. No amount of money is worth tearing a family apart because you just don&#039;t spend enough time with them. You can&#039;t get back time. So bring it on if I can make that kind of $$$ at 40 hours a week or less, I&#039;m golden!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Tony@YODTO&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! I bet you&#039;ll totally be fine too - cuz it&#039;ll be on your OWN terms which is always the most preferable. Great leap!
@&lt;b&gt;Cherleen @ My Personal Finance Journey&lt;/b&gt; - Yep! Exactly... At least in *most* situations. There are certainly exceptions to the rule, but overall I find it to be pretty true :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Haha I like the way you think! And once you KNOW what you need for x,y,z, then it&#039;s MUCH easier to set yourself up to achieve them too. &#039;Cuz without goals/dreams you&#039;re just hustlin&#039; for the sake of it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say this is pretty spot on, except my number is closer to $170k (because of IRA phaseout limits) :)

Though I don&#039;t measure happiness with income, financial freedom is definitely a goal.

Basically, I need $70k to live on, would max out retirement accounts and fund college with another 30-40k, pay off the house in a few years, buy a truck and a boat (because WHY NOT?!), and then start buying businesses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I so agree with you. It is not how much you receive that matters, it&#039;s what you do with the money you receive. Hence, I believe that whether you make $161,000 or not, as long as you are happy with what you do with your money, then the numbers should not matter a all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with all the Northeasterners here:  161k does not go very far in the NYC area.  The difference between 160k and 200k over here is enormous!  That said, I have been blogging about how I am about to go from 250k to 150k next year (by choice) and maintain happiness.  We shall see!

Great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the great discussions everyone! Happy holiday weekend!!

@&lt;b&gt;interesting&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, what are the odds of that? Maybe you should go play the lottery this weekend and see if that helps with your early retirement plans ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Greg&lt;/b&gt; - Hmmm... I&#039;m pretty sure its per person since it talks about personal happiness and the $75k/salary is compared there, but I could be wrong... Either way it&#039;s something to think about :)
@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah! Depending on where you live it could totally do some damage. You&#039;d have more of an advantage over &quot;interesting&quot; up there who lives in NYC.
@&lt;b&gt;Mistress Susan&lt;/b&gt; - I can see that. But as they say, the first million is the hardest! So I&#039;m taking baby steps :)
@&lt;b&gt;Warren Talbot&lt;/b&gt; - YES!! I should print that out and put it in my Blogger Cave :) That is right on the money, sir! Pun intended! You guys have a blessed holiday wherever you are in the world right now, k? 
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Well the good thing is that it&#039;s more attainable than $161k too! You can certainly get there one day :)
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;I think I have a better perspective on things now that I had that and lost it.&quot; That&#039;s some pretty powerful stuff right there, actually. And most billionaires at some point have those lows and then regroup and come back even stronger! And appreciate it even more just like you :) So keep pushing yourself over there - it&#039;s just a matter of time until you hit it again and THEN some!

@&lt;b&gt;Jay @ effumoney&lt;/b&gt; - I think you raise some excellent points there for sure, though I&#039;d argue that it&#039;s more about always setting HIGHER goals for you once you reach them, over the amounts of money that would make you happy. Because when you&#039;re choosing a set number at any given time, you&#039;re still evaulating your situation as it currently stands. So my $1 Million for example is what would make me completely content if I were to have it banked by tomorrow. Maybe not in 10 years or whenever I actually *hit it*, but at this given point in time. And then ofcourse I won&#039;t stop there and I&#039;ll keep going because it&#039;s important to keep on pushing yourselfe in my eyes - know what Im saying?

But yes - overall we don&#039;t know what the future will be like exactly, or how our own priorities/feelings will be, etc. But right now we know what that is so it&#039;s all we can go on :) Btw if you haven&#039;t blogged about any of these topics we&#039;ve been doing here lately, you totally should! Your recent comments could pretty much be copied and pasted into your blog for new articles! Haha.... They really are interesting to read, so I appreciate the time you&#039;ve spent thinking and dropping them. Merry Hollidays, my friend.

@&lt;b&gt;Anne @ Unique Gifter&lt;/b&gt; - No shame in that - it just means you know yourself well :) Or your financial habits, really.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah. And really it just kills all remaining worries/stress/etc - as long as you don&#039;t increase your lifestyle too much in the process ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s good that you know your selves well like that :) I would be (and am) very happy with a $100k salary, but I still find myself pushing to grow it higher to get places quicker... where you can then use the money for all types of good! But I agree that $100k should give a comfortable life for most people.
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... you&#039;re probably right.
@&lt;b&gt;Joanna @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - I used to think it doesn&#039;t buy happiness too, but now I don&#039;t ;) Money gives you optoins and freedom which in turn bring lots of happiness. But I think up to a certain point, like that $75k number. For me once I hit that things have remained pretty leve on happiness factor, only I&#039;m even more motivated to keep it going just to secure more happiness for our baby and future babies - wee!!
@&lt;b&gt;Levi&lt;/b&gt; - I like it :) And that&#039;s exactly why I don&#039;t get when people say they &quot;don&#039;t want any more money&quot; than a certain amount, as if more money only brings greed or negative stuff. I&#039;d actually argue the opposite and say if you&#039;re content with only making enough to satisfy your own life, you&#039;re TAKING AWAY from all the good it could do in your community! Money is just as powerful doing good-hearted things than bad stuff... But I digress.
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - I like hearing that! You&#039;re not trying to get complacive and settle for less - you&#039;re going out there and killing it! So keep it up, friend! :) I agree you&#039;ll hit, and even surpass one day, that potential of yours.
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, that is so cool of him!!! And look how impactful that was in your life - you remember the 2 days he was gone just cuz it stood out from all the others! So bueatiful my man... getting me all sorts of sentimental over here :)
@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s good to know! If you wouldn&#039;t, I&#039;d have a few questions for you, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Gajizmo.com&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome quote! I like that... and I&#039;ll be stealing it to use later, thanks ;) Happy Holidays!
@&lt;b&gt;Tahnya Kristina&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, sounds good my friend :) You guys have fun out there and enjoy the best day after Xmas! Boxing Day aka my birthday - woo! God bless...]]></description>
