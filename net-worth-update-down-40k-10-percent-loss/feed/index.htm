					<description><![CDATA[Ouch, that must have hurt - $40K is a LOT of money. But you are still ahead, and that&#039;s what counts. Your biggest net worth hit is because you were paying cash for things, so it&#039;s much better than taking on debt.]]></description>

For sure. I mean, you gotta play to win, right? And *someone* will! The trick is just doing it responsibly and not blowing all your money on something that will more than likely never ever happen.]]></description>

There is a lottery draw in Canada this Friday for $50 million.  That would fix all of my retirement problems.

 It is easy to understand why people keep buying lottery tickets.  If you think you don&#039;t have much chance at getting ahead then it is easy to be drawn to a chance at a dream.]]></description>

Haha...

She actually doesn&#039;t want me telling people what her topic is exactly right now (maybe cuz we&#039;ll jinx it?) but I am allowed to say it has something to do with politics :)

As for the mohawk, I must say I&#039;m pretty impressed. I heard VA is quite conservative but the most I&#039;ve gotten is a handful of finger points and some &quot;oooooh look at that!&quot; from a gaggle of 8 year olds :) It got me into much more trouble over in the DC area than here so far, if you can believe that.]]></description>

It def. could have been a bad idea, but either way it is what it is now and just praying it goes in our favor. The sucky part is we have to wait years and years for us to find out! :)]]></description>

Yeah, you&#039;re def. right - I am being hard on myself. But I guess we have to be in order to keep things on track, eh? I don&#039;t think I could stomach leaking more cash anytime soon though, even IF the potential in the market is good. That&#039;s our last resort as a security blanket, haha...]]></description>
