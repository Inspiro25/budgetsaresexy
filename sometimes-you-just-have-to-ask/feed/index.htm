					<description><![CDATA[Nothing&#039;s too personal, ask me stuff anytime :)

We asked for the car through our &quot;giving back&quot; project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://LoveDrop.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Love Drop&lt;/a&gt; to show the power of micro-giving online.  Sure I could have bought a car and gave it away, but that&#039;s not what we set out to accomplish.  Every month we help one family through hundreds of us coming together online and chipping in just a few dollars (or gifts/services/etc) making a bigger impact than just we could do alone :)  It&#039;s kinda fun, and we actually just did another one yesterday!  If you&#039;re interested in that kinda stuff, stop on by and check us out:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://LoveDrop.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://LoveDrop.us&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J (what do we call you?! J? J money?) -- this is great. I love being so connected to the Love Drop project now and witnessing the magic that happened when you put that call out so clearly last month and Britt and the red mustang showed up for the Stalnakers.

I can really relate to this post in so many ways. Several years ago I finally got myself out of $32k credit card debt, and it happened in part because I took a lot of action on your last suggestion... I repeatedly asked to get my interest rates lowered, and most of the time I got what I requested.

More recently, just yesterday in fact, I got the nerve up to finally ask readers of one of my blogs, The Jizo Chronicles, if they would like to donate to support the work I do on that blog, and also to help me pay down an ancient student loan debt. I have been so moved by the responses.... people are actually giving me money for blogging! 

We live in a web of generosity, but so often we forget that truth... it&#039;s wonderful to be reminded of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;bleu&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, really??  I&#039;ve never even heard of that before! haha... you just ask to see what happens?  No flirting or batting of the eyes? ;)  Good for you, girl - that is awesome.
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Great!  I know people are always wondering how to go about doing that properly.
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! We were blown away :)
@&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt; - GOOD IDEA!! I guess that kinda goes along w/ Bleu&#039;s method up there (Just ask for a discount when there isn&#039;t one)... maybe there *IS* one at times, and they just hook ya up with it for asking?  I&#039;m gonna have to start doing that and see for myself.  Worst they can say is no :)
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley @ Money Talks&lt;/b&gt; - Cool - thanks for the tip :)  Will click over as soon as I post these up.
@&lt;b&gt;Paula @ AffordAnything.org&lt;/b&gt; - Amen to that!  I hope they accept and know they&#039;ve been getting a bargain this entire time :)  If it&#039;s not too much higher I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll  understand.
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer&lt;/b&gt; - They&#039;re getting insurance on it this week, so fingers crossed! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, really?  Just by asking??? Crazy!!! I love it!
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, thanks :)  Feel free to vent anytime - it feels good to get it out!  Esp out into the webs so everyone can read and relate to you ;)
@&lt;b&gt;katie&lt;/b&gt; - Congrats!!  Even if it doesn&#039;t work out, it shows you know what you&#039;re &quot;worth&quot; :) I hope they pay to get you out there, that would be great.  If it&#039;s a job I REALLY want myself, I&#039;d probably still go for it anyways.  I like being happy during my 9-5 :)

@&lt;b&gt;Shannyn&lt;/b&gt; - COOOOOL!!!  And so sad about your friend - damn.  I&#039;ve never had anyone close to me pass like that - especially without any warning? How does that happen?  Freakin&#039; scary :(  Feel so bad for her family, man...  good for you on getting that scholarship going, that is so beautiful :)  Glad to have you on the team too - let&#039;s keep the love going!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - Yay!!!  Yeah, no way we woulda got that car if we didn&#039;t ask... and there was still a HUGE chance we weren&#039;t going to get it anyways, but ya have to throw it out there and find out :)  Thanks for all the support!
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks Ginger :) Have a great weekend.]]></description>
