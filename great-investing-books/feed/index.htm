					<description><![CDATA[The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C. Bogle 
my last read book.
(now reading russian book : &quot;Nikolai Starikov Crisis: How is it done&quot;)
my investing books which i read often are USA or Germany written. 
What can i comment about C. Bogle book? This book is just about one simple think at all:
invest to index fund for low cost and historical about 10% profit= 4% dividends + 6% index growth.  I do not like that kind of books, but i get this book from wife on Fathers day so i read it.
In book agitate buy Vanguard index fund :) It is not bad fund, but it is more

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/great-investing-books/#comment-268876&quot;&gt;J. Money&lt;/a&gt;.

The experience alone has &quot;earned&quot; me more than $16,000.

It was an expensive lesson, one I hope no one has to experience, but it&#039;s had a huge positive impact on my personal finances, so it wasn&#039;t all bad news.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve been funding my husbands Roth IRA for the last 4 years but kept the money sitting, uninvested, until the last couple of months. I just had no idea what I was doing, so it sat. I am disappointed we missed out on last year&#039;s awesome growth, but glad it&#039;s at least funded now and working for us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Easy one! When we were investor newbies and trying to set up our Solo 401K for our business, we ended up using a commission based financial planner. BIG MISTAKE #1. They encouraged us to put our 401K in Oppenheimer (BIG MISTAKE #2) which we found out shortly was one of the most expensive routes we could have taken. (We did move the 401K to Vanguard eventually.) They also sold us on a REIT, (BIG MISTAKE #3). The REIT in itself wouldn&#039;t have been such a bad choice except we bought in at the top of the real estate market - right before the crash - and ended up losing a ton. Lessons learned and we&#039;re about 18 months from a fully funded retirement now. Ages 50 and 56 respectively.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was the year 2000 and my husband had just died. His friend was a financial advisor so I went to him. I put a lot of money in the stock market...well..i don&#039;t really remember how much I or in I just remember I lost about $4,000 shortly after. I also completely paid off my condo which he told me not to do because he said I could make more in investments instead of pay off the house. Funny thing is...right now that is true with stocks going through the roof I wish I had not paid off the house and kept more for investing. But since none of the banks will give me a home equity loan now because I only work part time and I just changed jobs....oy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I invested in my marriage to the wrong man. Every penny went out the window, and he didn&#039;t flinch at carrying a mortgage, a car payment, and CC debt around $20K. No student loans, thankfully, because &quot;school is dumb&quot;. His mom called me before we got married to warn me that that&#039;s just how her sweet son lives his life.

Thank goodness for second chances!]]></description>

Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve made any bad investments.
