					<description><![CDATA[I got rid of Prime, and I&#039;m ordering a lot less stuff.  My husband still has it, if we need to order something for the house, but not having free two-day shipping on my own account makes me think twice about placing an order.  It seems ridiculous to both be paying the $90 a year, but we were for years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had 161 orders last year, whoops! I figure if its cheaper and easier than going to Target or Wal-Mart I&#039;m ok with it. But I&#039;ve definitely cut back in 2017 and focusing more on minimalistic lifestyle instead of hyper-consumption!]]></description>

&quot;We use the average Americans consumerism to propel us towards financial independence&quot; - Hah! And unfortunately that&#039;s not slowing down anytime soon...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We do own stock in Amazon and also sell there (and eBay) as a side hustle. Last year we had $60,000 in sales for taxable profits of $27,000. We will often purchase items online at lower cost and resell them on Amazon for good margins, both new and used merchandise. With Prime, people are willing to pay $10 extra just to get 2 day &quot;free&quot; shipping. Most filter the search for &quot;Prime&quot; only. Wait 7 days for a book? No way! Lets overpay! We are able to send a large box of 15-30 items into an Amazons fulfillment center for $5-$10 total and when things sell, Amazon ships it out &quot;Prime&quot;. We get paid every Sunday via direct deposit from Amazon While we are very frugal, we use the average Americans consumerism to propel us towards financial independence. We made an additional $6000 around Christmas selling overpriced junk just on Amazon.]]></description>

Thank you Debbie! You and I are just opposites - you are barely familiar with Amazon, and I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I&#039;ve entered Walmart : )]]></description>

It especially irks me when they ship you teensy tiny things in giant boxes. Yes, I absolutely needed to spend 20 minutes cutting down a box that contained a keychain : /]]></description>
