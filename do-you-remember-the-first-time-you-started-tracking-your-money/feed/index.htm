					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Dd&lt;/b&gt; - Basic categories all the way.  The receipts way never works for me, or anyone else I know actually. I think the key is def. making it simple and playing around with other ideas until you find a system that works.  We all do it differently (I use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/2009/02/budget-is-back-baby-and-will-be-updated/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;excel budget&lt;/a&gt; in google docs, for example, while others use Mint.com) but the key is testing out ways &#039;till you&#039;re sticking to one.  Then it becomes habit :)
@&lt;b&gt;Rob Ward&lt;/b&gt; - That works!  Awesome you picked up Quicken on day back from honeymoon too, haha.... well done, sir.
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks :) it keeps me entertained too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;BudgetBabe&lt;/b&gt; - Love hearing that!  Way to get on it and STAY on it.
@&lt;b&gt;Ashley&lt;/b&gt; - Hahahahah.... I think you&#039;ve officially won the awesome prize today ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, congrats on the kid!
@&lt;b&gt;momcents&lt;/b&gt; - I still can&#039;t believe you knocked so much away like that, it&#039;s great.  Way to go!
@&lt;b&gt;Brandon&lt;/b&gt; - Look what you started here :)  It&#039;s discussions like that that make me love blogging though man, I totally forgot about the pre-budget days.  Here&#039;s to the next 7 months being in the positives for you!
@&lt;b&gt;FrugalRichLife&lt;/b&gt; - You got that straight :)  And DAMN good job with 800+ Fico score!!  You are killing mine! (and millions others out there), you should be proud.
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin I&lt;/b&gt; - That is awesome.  You stood up to this nonsense and made a change!  One that will keep with you forever too, mad props man.
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMan&lt;/b&gt; - Keep it up!
@&lt;b&gt;Sandy X&lt;/b&gt; - You had me at Google Docs ;)  That 1 tool alone has really helped me too.  Started on Excel but couldn&#039;t update &quot;on the go&quot; - so now I can do it easily/more excitingly when I&#039;m in the mood instead of when I make it home.  And I agree w/ grocery stuff!  Although you&#039;d  have to ask the wife more as she&#039;s in charge of that ;)  I only go when I&#039;m hungry and that&#039;s just stupid from the get go.
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - Hhahahaha... you are too funny.
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - You change your bank account, or you check your bank account daily?  I hope it&#039;s the latter! haha....(and I do the exact same thing - sometimes twice a day!)
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - Mint makes it much more easier for sure, esp for all us lazy people ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stacey&lt;/b&gt; - Nah, I totally respect that.  We don&#039;t track by penny much either - more like in &quot;chunks&quot;.  Yeah I think we end up spending $50 or so extra a month w/out realizing, but since we&#039;re more financially free now it&#039;s a luxury I don&#039;t mind ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie PTY&lt;/b&gt; - SEXY!!  Maybe you should share it with me/us in case we wanna use it too?  I could add it to my spreadsheet list! :)
&lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/free-budget-templates-sites/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/free-budget-templates-sites/&lt;/a&gt;
@&lt;b&gt;FB @ FabulouslyBroke.com&lt;/b&gt; - Oooh would love to see YOUR spreadsheet too!  Do you have a template we could look at?  Can add that to our list too :)
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, it blows really.  That was the first time I realized how awesome my parents were for taking care of me all those years! haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousand-aire.com&lt;/b&gt; - You the man!  Sometimes it takes one big stupid decision to change our ways... for me, it was our house ;)  A $360,000 decision!! haha... whatev.
@&lt;b&gt;UHNW&lt;/b&gt; - WOW.  I don&#039;t really know what to say on that!  Except that you have intrigued me, and I am now gonna go check out your post ;)  Thx for sharing!  Glad it inspired your own post.]]></description>
