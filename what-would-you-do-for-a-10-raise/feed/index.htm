					<description><![CDATA[I would happily give up watching movies or interacting on social media for a 10% raise... oh wait, I already don&#039;t do those things now! Those would be the easiest for me, but I don&#039;t know how anyone would want to put their health in jeopardy for a 10% raise unless they were raking in the millions on average. Then, at that point, you can afford personal health insurance ;) Great thought-provoking post, too bad no one is offering me more $$ for giving up social media and skipping time watching movies.]]></description>

That was one of the main things I learned from Mr. Money Mustache back in the day :) The less you spend, the less you need to earn!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The things people would do definitely shocked me haha! Great tips on how to earn the extra 10% too, cutting back so you don&#039;t need it seems so obvious even though I&#039;ve never considered it! Very helpful thank you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very funny! I would not give a lot of these for a 10% raise. I would definitely get rid of social media for a 10% raise, but I almost don&#039;t use it anyway. I would also give up watching GOT. There are the books anyway (if GRR ever gets to writing the last two books :S).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This goes into the category of truth is stranger than fiction. Giving up health insurance is the one that blows me away! Seriously. Has anyone looked at their medical bills lately?

Come on people!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would say they can keep their 10% raise and give me 20% more time off!  :)

10% really isn&#039;t anything - some of the stuff listed is really crazy and shows that people don&#039;t understand the math, specifically 55.9% would work an extra 10 hours per week for life....

for me working +10 hours a week would consume the entire annual raise in 8.6 weeks, so the remaining 43.4 weeks would only benefit the employer.]]></description>
