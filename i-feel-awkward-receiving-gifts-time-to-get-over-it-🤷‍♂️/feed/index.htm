Yep, sometimes you give and sometimes you get. Have to be OK with both sides of the process. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joel, I think it is incredible that her parents are willing to help pay for the remainder of her education. While challenging, I believe that your shift in attitude towards the gift is a great way to approach the situation. Sometimes you will be on the receiving end of good gestures, and other times you will be on the giving end. Regardless, both sides are beautiful places to be as it means there is love and compassion for all involved. Have a great day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last year we needed to replace my wife&#039;s car. We also had to fork over for an exterior paint job, new sewer line, and new roof for our century-old house. We were well set -- our savings account could manage it, and we don&#039;t spend a large fraction of what we earn so it replenished quickly -- but my dad still randomly shunted $10k into an old checking account that he had access to from when I was a kid. 

Dad has a federal gov&#039;t pension from back when that really meant something. He doesn&#039;t have much to spend it on, so most of it goes into VTSAX. It was no hardship for him. Still felt weird, though. I&#039;ve nagged him once or twice since to do something comparable for my kid brother (who owns a 72-year-old home and all that entails). And to balance things out a bit we&#039;ve made it a point to give directly to folks in need: in-laws in South America dealing with COVID, a first-generation immigrant who got accepted into med school, that kind of thing. We&#039;re fortunate and privileged; I figure there&#039;s an obligation to pay it forward as much as possible.]]></description>

Thanks Christine. I&#039;m definitely stealing them!!!  1) I’m a generous giver and a gracious receiver! 2.) I’m more than willing to receive all the money, gifts, and compliments people want to give me!]]></description>
