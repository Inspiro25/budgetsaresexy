					<description><![CDATA[If I didn&#039;t have to worry about money there would be so much that I could do but really I would just want to quit my job and stay home with my boys (ages 9 months and 22 months). And their dad would quit his job too and we&#039;d spend the days exploring and having fun. Wouldn&#039;t that be nice?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe if I were financially independent (which I&#039;m working on slowly), on a professional level I wouldn&#039;t have to work for money, or stay at a job for the sake of money if it&#039;s a toxic environment. I&#039;d really like to share my wisdom with teenagers from financially disadvantaged backgrounds so they wouldn&#039;t make some of the same mistakes I made or my family members made/make. 
It would change my life personally because I could spend more time with my family and friends, travel the world on my own, and just live a rich life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be a financial advisor/life coach.  I think people get off track sometimes, both personally/professionally and financially, and I&#039;d love to help people get back on track.  I&#039;m getting myself on track these days, and it feels great!  I&#039;m also a long time fan of Joseph Campbell and his writing -- I&#039;m currently working my way through &quot;The Hero With a Thousand Faces&quot; (just found a copy I bought about 12 years ago!) -- so I&#039;m particularly interested in seeing where the author takes this!]]></description>
