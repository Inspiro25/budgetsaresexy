					<description><![CDATA[I think most peole fail to take into account when going from &quot;renting&quot; to &quot;owning&quot; are the unknown expenses. I would advise a sizable savings dedicated just for that purpose, otherwise your dream home can turn into your worst nightmare.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, so cool to see the differences in price here.  3 Bedroom for a $376 mortgage?  Yes please! haha....although that would still get me stuck in one place (my real complaint with owning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate you sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My rental days were $300-385 for 1 bedroom apartment (600 sq ft).  Water/trash were paid by landlord.  Electric averaged $60.  There was a laundry room, pool, club house and safe neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 3 bed/1bath with carport 8 years ago.  It&#039;s a 50 year old ranch with 960 sq ft.  I have a laundry room and nicely sized kitchen.  I also have a little yard.  My mortgage is $376 with insurance/taxes. My water bill is $52, trash $11, electric $21 and gas is $39.  All the bills are averaged.  I paid about $3500 in repairs and maintenance with broken water heater, privacy fence replacement, 2 plumbing problems and locksmith twice.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The priceless part is having a little elbow room between the amorous or party animal neighbors.  Also, my landlord had some tenants who trashed their apartments and the bugs and critters moved in.  In a house, there is a little more room so the problems don&#039;t just move next door.]]></description>
