					<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone!!  It was SOOOOO needed this week :)  Though I got my ass kicked in Trivial Pursuit, haha... one game I came close to winning though! We have our own way of playhing now -- instead of going around the board asking 1 question at a time, we actually ask each player all 5 or 6 questions on the card and then count how many you get right.  The best to 10 or 15 wins that &quot;round&quot; :)  MUCH more fun, and quick, than an entire game w/ the normal rules (and a lot easier too when you only have 3 players).

But yeah - back in action now and ready to spill the beans on how much I spent last week!  Look for it tomorrow :)  As well as my metal detecting findings - W00T.

@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I only had like 2 beers at CheeseburgHer ;)  You&#039;re probably still recooperating from the lack of sleep!  You were up way past your bedtime, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Sarah&lt;/b&gt; - Bring it!
@&lt;b&gt;Terra (aka Zoeyjane)&lt;/b&gt; - Woah, really??  That&#039;s so cool!  Wish I would have told you about the blog then - I was being all chatty about &lt;a href=&quot;http://lovedrop.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Love Drop&lt;/a&gt; to everyone ;)]]></description>
