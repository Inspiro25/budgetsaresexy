					<description><![CDATA[I WANT TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN!!! Haha...

@&lt;b&gt;Ryan&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... yeah, you&#039;d freakin&#039; love it!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  I&#039;m back and missing it already!  Lots of free drinks no matter where next year&#039;s is gonna be ;)  But don&#039;t worry, we&#039;re all drinky together.
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you so much - you all voted to get me to win! :)  Would love to meet you next year my friend, I think you&#039;d have an incredible time. I haven&#039;t heard one complaint from anyone yet.
@&lt;b&gt;Natalie @ Mango&lt;/b&gt; - It went so much better than I expected!  And I expected a LOT! Haha... seriously, I wish everyone could go to see what it&#039;s like and to be around all their peers.  It really was an unbelievable experience.  Our whole online family all in one room - so cool!!
@&lt;b&gt;Money Reasons&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you so much!  It was a pleasure meeting you too :)  Let&#039;s totally do it again next year okay?  I already miss it!]]></description>
