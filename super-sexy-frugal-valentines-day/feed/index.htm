					<description><![CDATA[@J - SET is great for traveling.  Since it just images you don&#039;t need to speak English to play and there is no age advantage.  I always keep the cards in my travel bag, you never know when you are going to get stuck at some airport for long hours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;My Money Mess&lt;/b&gt; - Sweet, hope it went well!
@&lt;b&gt;Donny Gamble&lt;/b&gt; - That would do it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Wade&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!  Glad it went well my man - our night was pretty fun too, although we ended up sneaking in some movies in there too, haha ;)  Classic.  And I agree - I def. need to get out there and play more of Settlers.  I might have to start poking around my neighbors to see if any of them like playing games cuz my good friends live way too far from me (which really blows, btw).  Congrats again on the big hit! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J. Money - I hope your game night went well.  My dinner ended up a being a big hit.  However, my main reason for this comment is to say that you should really play Settlers of Catan again.  My wife and I have found two couples that like to play the game just as much or more than us.  Even though the game says it is for 3-4 players, one couple plays it nearly nightly with just the two of them.  Oh well, it&#039;s a fun game.]]></description>
