					<description><![CDATA[Just have to weigh in... Also a big fan of the 2! I&#039;ve purchased bricks a couple of times over the years. Just go to the bank, tell them you&#039;d like them to order a brick for you. When it comes, just withdraw $2,000 and they give you the brick. Even when you are used to 2s, having a brick of any denomination is probably fun.
I started using them to tip waitresses in card games where the smallest chip was $5. At least this way I could get a drink for *only* $2]]></description>

I think you should have put that $80 into Apple stock if you wanted that type of quadrupling ;)

(Actually just did a google search - it would have multiplied 50-fold!!! https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/021316/if-you-had-purchased-100-apple-2002-aapl.asp )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My buddy managed a Wells Fargo and put in an order of 100 for me that I used as a prop at an accounting party (my friend got her CPA). People loved it and wanted to buy them off me.  I used them for cash tips, coffee, etc for the following month.  People loved it!  I think the $2 bill spreads joy and we all need a but more of that!  Great post!!!]]></description>
