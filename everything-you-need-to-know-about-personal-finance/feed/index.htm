					<description><![CDATA[@J$

That&#039;s a thought. Not really something I have a passion for though. Building a desktop computer is a lot like setting up a VCR. All RAM plugs into the same kind of slot, all wireless cards plug into the same kind of slot, and all video cards plug into the same kind of slot (this changes when the technology changes, but tends to be pretty stable over several years). It&#039;s easy, and you can customize your computer on a whim. Laptops are all custom designed by the manufacturer, so there really isn&#039;t the opportunity to get X graphics card and put it into Y laptop. Dealing with manufacturer&#039;s to rectify that mess really isn&#039;t my cup of tea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Beckey &amp; Jeff&lt;/b&gt; - Wowwww, that&#039;s a LOT of good money though!  For working the same gig like that, way to soak as much as it in as possible!  Maybe next week you can spend more time with them to make it up :)  Luckily your 3 month old won&#039;t remember I don&#039;t think, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Chris C&lt;/b&gt; - Sure!  Maybe I&#039;ll just change my voicemail to be a new savings tip each day so then I won&#039;t even have to ever answer it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;PKamp3&lt;/b&gt; - That is insane.  I&#039;m so glad I don&#039;t have that gene in my body! :)  And yup - the book is all yours for $1.00.  Paypal it over and then I&#039;ll send you the image to print out ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - YUP!  Exactly.  We just need to be motivated somehow to actually DO IT!
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - Me too - I LOVE the atmosphere and just experiencing the madness on Black Friday for an hour or so... I never find anything too good, really, but it&#039;s worth the excitement of &quot;what if&quot; once a year ;)  As for your laptop idea, maybe you should start a new biz?  I bet there are a LOT of people that would like to build their own like that!
@&lt;b&gt;KC @ PsychoMoney&lt;/b&gt; - Any time.  Took me a few years to put it together :)
@&lt;b&gt;YFS&lt;/b&gt; -
@&lt;b&gt;Maria Nedeva&lt;/b&gt; - I know, people are SO SAD sometimes - it&#039;s horrible.  They forget that we&#039;re all in this together... makes me very very sad :(
@&lt;b&gt;Camille&lt;/b&gt; - Happy holidays!
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - I only share the truth! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good evening, J. I have been reading the news and am speechless - someone shot his gun in a shop so he could get to some piece of cr*p. What is happening to people?

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, man. I wish I&#039;d come up with that book. I&#039;d be rolling in riches. :)

I always liked getting up at 4am to go Black Friday shopping as a kid. It was a ritual we had as a family. Now that my grandmother has passed away (she was a real deal chaser) and all of the kids are grown up, we don&#039;t do it anymore. I miss it sometimes, if just for the experience. I&#039;ve never personally bought anything on Black Friday.

I&#039;m in the market for a laptop, but even with Black Friday deals I haven&#039;t been able to find something with the features I want (most have a bunch of crap I don&#039;t want) with a price I feel is reasonable. I wish it was easier to build your own laptop like you can do with a desktop. Laptops are such a rip of...]]></description>
