					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s cool that you guys finally have these stats. They&#039;ve been in the UK for a while. However, it&#039;s important people actually do something about it, rather than read the stats and just go back to their normal spendy ways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is something I predict will happen with those that carry a balance.

The &quot;3&quot; year payment will become a popular amount to pay.  At the same time, the people won&#039;t stop using the cards.  Each month they will pay the amount it will take to pay off the balance in 3 years and they will be perpetually 3 years away from being out of credit card debt.  If, and when, that amount grows to the point that they won&#039;t be able to pay it each month then they will resort to paying less or the minimum.

But... how many people will pay $89 this month and think, &quot;I could be out of debt in 3 years,&quot; then go and charge a couple hundred dollars.  Next month they&#039;ll pay $90 and think, &quot;I could still be out of debt in 3 years.&quot;  And so it goes.

Even if they don&#039;t use the card... and they&#039;re not thinking... they could pay $89 this month.  And next month, they&#039;ll pay $82 (or whatever that statement says the new amount to be out of debt in 3 years is)... and still be 3 years away from being done with the card.  If they continue to lower the payment, it will take much longer than 3 years to pay if off and they&#039;ll pay more.  That&#039;s even if they charge less.  What they need to realize, and some people won&#039;t realize this, is that they need to pay $89 a month -- every month from now on -- without ever charging again to pay off the balance in 3 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting comments everyone, really enjoyed reading these :)  Some responses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Investing Newbie&lt;/b&gt; - It def. won&#039;t work for everyone, but even if it just affected like 5% of people I would call it a win.  You might be able to avoid/ignore it for a while, but eventually it&#039;ll &#034;click&#034; and you&#039;ll be ready to knock that $hit out ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Simple in France&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! It IS like those smoking labels, you&#039;re totally right.  Wonder what the study shows on them?&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Kira K&lt;/b&gt; - Ofcourse they aren&#039;t doing it for the greater good, but I still don&#039;t see how it could be bad.  It only needs to affect a small % for it to be more successful than w/out.  This box was right up in my face and clear as day - very hard to miss even if they start adding garble all round it.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;TP&lt;/b&gt; - Good point, I wonder if there is an agency auditing these #&#039;s?  That would be jacked up if they tried upselling you and then brought on even MORE business by enabling debt!  scary.  and in which case I&#039;ll look like a big ass here saying how much I love it ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Josh&lt;/b&gt; - Hey Josh, thanks for stopping by :)  I actually haven&#039;t searched around and done any analysis on credit card rewards and what not.  I use USAA for everything and their reward cards are pretty decent.  Not the best out there (all depending on what kind of rewards you&#039;re looking for - cash back, miles, points, etc) but I feel like if you can find one that is 80% good you should go for it.  Most of these cards &#038; reward plans change up so much that you&#039;d have to be constantly researching and changing around to eek out every last bit of goodness. If ur leaning towards Amex Blue, i&#039;d stick w/ your gut :)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Mysti&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, the fact that you are AWARE of it and understand it&#039;s important is GREAT :)  Even if you can&#039;t pay off more, at least you&#039;re cognizant!  that&#039;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Single Guy Money&lt;/b&gt; - Do the post anyways bro - I wanna see your thoughts on it :)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Aaren&lt;/b&gt; - haha....yessir.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Karmella&lt;/b&gt; - Interesting, I&#039;m sure they have to put it somewhere even if it is all electronic.  Let us know when you find it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I get my statements electronically, I wonder if I will see a difference - I usually go and scan the charges and make sure it looks right and then I go to the payment page. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it&#039;s helpful to people, although I think a lot of people will probably look right past it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw this a few months ago because my card started it a month early.  I LOVE it, but I also agree with investing newbie that it probably won&#039;t change behavior much.  I agree too with Simple in France about the huge sign that it represents to people.  But similar to SMOKING KILLS, if people continue to engage in said activity, then who can they blame?  Only themselves.  Same with this.  Although we presume that people know the risks of paying only the minimum, it&#039;s never been laid out like this.  Now you can&#039;t tell me you didn&#039;t know how long it would take to pay it off, so I&#039;ll just assume you did it intentionally.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started seeing this on my Discover Card statement last month and meant to do a post about. Looks like you beat me to it. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and wish they had put that on credit card bills a long time ago. Maybe seeing how long it would take me to get out of debt may have stopped me from having spending sprees with my credit cards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am with you on the &#034;hell yeah&#034; band wagon.  People can&#039;t think that they can go on and on indefinitely without consequences.  I *hope* that people will see that by adding just a little bit more each month can change their whole financial picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for us, the amount we would have to increase each payment by isn&#039;t possible.  We are snowballing the debt, but I am totally aware that we are paying all sorts of horrible interest (and at unholy rate at that) the longer we keep the debt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the new statements!!!  Rock on!]]></description>
