					<description><![CDATA[So I bought a 2019 AMG G63 in January for $185,000 which I absolutely love and have no shame carting around my 2 grandchildren in (picture big pink car seats in the backseat) but much to my surprise my son and daughter in law are on baby number 3 so I decided to get a minivan since I pick them up from daycare everyday. I extensively researched minivans and ended up going with a Honda Odyssey Elite and I can honestly say I love my minivan. There is so much room, it has cabin watch so I can see the kids at all times, cabin talk so I can talk to them even if they have the dvd headphones on, a magic 2 row middle seat that moves forward, back, side to side so they can get in the third row by walking back there and the gas mileage is AMAZING!, I still have to spend $250 on Mercedes service A (oil change, check fluids, etc) and service B (same thing with maybe a tire rotation) $250-$600 because Grammy had to keep her G-Wagon for weekends but I figure you only live once and the grandkids will eventually be out of car seats]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We recently replaced our small SUV with a big Toyota Sienna minivan. The Sienna is so much nicer for a family of 4 like ours. It has a ton of room, the seats are super plush and comfortable, we have a ton of storage space in the back, and the kids even have an entertainment system with dual tv screens for long drives. We love it, and while we used to have a bit of a bias against minivans, we&#039;re all in now. We love them! For the place we are in life right now, it&#039;s the perfect vehicle for us.  You won&#039;t regret it either I&#039;m guessing!]]></description>
