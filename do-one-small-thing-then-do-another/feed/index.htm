					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Long&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, that house can eat up all your money if you&#039;re not careful!  Even the random things that come up in general maintenance, it can be scary.  I kinda have the opposite problem of you in that I REALLY want to redo things but can&#039;t get myself to do it, haha... pros and cons, eh? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa @ Little House in the Valley&lt;/b&gt; - And that&#039;s a hard thing for a lot of people to do too!  Patching up those debt holes so you stop leaking :)  Now you&#039;re slowly bucketing out the water and it def. all counts! hehe...
@&lt;b&gt;Miss J&lt;/b&gt; - You can do it!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent advice.  We are paying down debt, and I sometimes get discouraged that progress isn&#039;t as fast as I would like, but since we aren&#039;t taking on any new debt, I know every payment, even if it isn&#039;t huge, is a step in the right direction.  It is encouraging to see that even though you were a late starter, you were able to retire earlier than most.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right. Small steps do add up. That&#039;s probably the best advice you can give anyone when it comes to setting goals. I&#039;ve noticed that when I write down things to do, the small ones always get completed within a reasonable time frame. Huge goals have sat on the list for years, getting lonely and forgotten.

My small thing right now is working on my family budget. I have always been a good saver, until I bought a house. My wife and I didn&#039;t have much, so we had to buy some basic furnishings, but I went a little nuts on remodeling. I noticed I wasn&#039;t saving as much as I used to, so I am trying to keep up with a budget in order to save money again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You the (wo)man, &lt;b&gt;Babs&lt;/b&gt;!  Thanks again for spilling out your thoughts for us again - I love when you pop up out of nowhere and shoot stuff over.  Never know what I&#039;m gonna find!

@&lt;b&gt;Renee&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah, I&#039;m usually all or nothing too ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Carol in Mpls&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a cool way to do things - on a monthly level like that :) My ADHD always moves my mind all over the place too, but but we can just do our best!
@&lt;b&gt;Katie&lt;/b&gt; - YOU CAN DO IT KATIE!!!  We all start out on the ground and work up :)  And every phase has pros and cons, so just keep in mind nothing is permanent!
@&lt;b&gt;MoneySmartGuides&lt;/b&gt; - Yep!  Like a savings account growing bigger and bigger over time - it all adds up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Small steps are huge. By trying to take big steps, many people get overwhelmed and fail. Small steps, though sometimes hard to see the benefit of, pay off in the end. It&#039;s like starting out running. You may only make it a half mile to start, then just a little more the next tie out. But as time goes by, you end up running 5 miles without any issues. Take your time and succeed on your own timeframe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the love and good ideas!   Keep adding helpful hints to encourage others.   

Kelly, you made me LOL so hard milk came out my nose!  E-mail you daily?  That&#039;s just asking for another blot on the escutcheon when I fail in one week or less.  I&#039;m going to stay in &quot;one small blog&quot; mode for a while.

J$:  funny you should mention post-it notes.  Several years ago I went through a really rough patch, where I was barely hanging on at work.  Each morning I would ask myself what ONE thing really needed to get done, I wrote it on a post-it note, then put it on the center of my desk.  I would focus on doing that one thing, was usually successful, and gradually got myself back in the groove.  I learned something really interesting from this:  most of our days are filled with pretty trivial work like e-mails, chatting with co-workers, etc.  By doing one really important thing each day, I actually made more progress on the big priorities for my team, and learned to spend less time on stupid stuff.  Who knew doing less could be more?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[lol I just didn&#039;t make my resolutions until a couple of days ago: http://preservingpennies.com/?p=135   I generally break large goals down into smaller pieces; ya know, the whole &#039;how do you eat an elephant&#039; thing... That has always worked best for me. I make a to-do list of all the little broken down chunks and just start at the very beginning. My husband feels chronically overwhelmed and this technique has even helped him- and he hates to-do lists (and all other kinds of lists).]]></description>
