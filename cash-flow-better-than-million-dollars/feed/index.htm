					<description><![CDATA[This has to be one of the most idiotic articles I&#039;ve every read. 1st you have to have a decent cash flow to obtain a million dollars.  Then that million dollars will provide a cash flow without doing a single thing.  2nd if you only focus on cash flow then you have to work FOREVER to keep the cash flow going. Now if you look at average stock market returns then you are making more then the claimed 4% withdrawal rate. The average from the crash of 2008 - 2014 so far is 10.5% return or 100k on your million dollars in increase value, without including dividends and cap gains. So now I have a cash flow, I have a million+ that is up 46k in the past 4 month, then add in I make on average 25k on dividends and cap gains a year which is reinvested. When I retire I will convert the other 60% of my portfolio to investments that pay dividends and cap gains. This will put more receiving passive income that well exceeds the standard 4% withdrawal rate. Should I give up the million and go for some blogging cash flow that merely covers the bills?  I donated to your cash flow by actually looking at this ridiculous blog and advice. My advice pick your poison i.e.: stock market investing, real estate, savings and then hit that as hard and as long as you can and you&#039;ll have a decent life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a million-dollar goal, not because I think a million means that I&#039;ll be &quot;set for life&quot; or anything like that, but because it motivates me. And since growing money is 90 percent motivation  ... bring on the motivation!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Azra&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, great point!  $1 Million can go a loooooooot farther in different places of this country than others - that makes a huge difference.
@&lt;b&gt;Evan H.&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I agree with you ;)  Many of us could certainly live off of $1 Mill at retirement... or even now, if we really worked at it.  I guess the point is really to pay more attention to cash flow than this large number that seems impossible to reach.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s to cash flow!  I have to agree that a million dollars isn&#039;t much at all, especially if you are still 20, 30 or 40 years from retirement.  With inflation you will likely find that by the time you save 1 million you will actually need 2.  Of course getting to 2 million will be quicker with the 1 million already saved, but maybe by the time you get to 2 you will still need 3 or even 4 million.  Who knows what inflation could do in the future, look at the inflation in the 70&#039;s.

Personally I would shoot for 10 million to be safe if I wasn&#039;t focused on cash flow.  That amount should provide a sufficient cash flow to both live on and to keep reinvesting and growing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the post, I would add that Young Professionals should make a concerted attempt to retire earlier rather than later.  In fact that should be the number one goal out of college or high school.  There is a lot of written material about this in Tim Ferriss&#039; books and blogs.  

I&#039;d encourage people to Bing/Google &quot;Mortgage your Retirement&quot; by two Yale professors who theorize that young investors would be better suited borrowing money to invest earlier in life when they are more risk tolerant.  This essentially involves using financial leverage.  

On that note young investors should also consider using leveraged exchange traded funds (ETFs) to boost returns during their 20s and 30s.  While these are not classic buy and hold investments - for the experienced investor - they are a good way increase one&#039;s chances of reaching the million dollar mark sooner rather than later.]]></description>
