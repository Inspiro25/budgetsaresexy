					<description><![CDATA[Well, in my younger days, I remember that a popular method of assembling a witch/wizard costume was to get a large black trash bag (new, clean one of course), cut holes for the arms and wear it as a witch&#039;s dress. and we&#039;d team it with a conical hat and a broomstick. I suppose it sounds rather kiddy and childish, but we were kids and that&#039;s what we came up with. I&#039;m sure you could improve on the idea to make it better. Perhaps you could use a large black cloth instead if you don&#039;t want the trash bag. You can use dramatic goth make-up to bring attention to your features and look more sophisticated.]]></description>
