					<description><![CDATA[I had a one day job right after college where I went to a Kohl&#039;s parking lot at 3:30am on black Friday and counted the number of cars in each row every half hour. They paid me $30/hour and even paid me hourly for driving time plus whatever the IRS mileage rate was at the time. It ended up working out to something like $42/hour.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ice cream...ingredient...preparer? I was in high school and my friend had a job at a local ice cream shop. Twice a year all the employees had to &#039;volunteer&#039; their time prepping the seasonal ingredients used in the ice cream. My friend talked me into joining her so for one Saturday I peeled and pitted crates upon crates of peaches, and peeled bunches and bunches of bananas! It was a long, sticky, GROSS day (not all the fruit was in good condition!) But they paid us with as many scoops of ice cream as we wanted at the end of the day, so as a 14-yr-old I was pretty happy about that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s see...professional towel folder has to be my weirdest.  I couldn&#039;t get over the fact that a health club paid me to primarily fold their towels; sweet high school gig, even if the boss was insane.  Other odd jobs I&#039;d never thought I&#039;d do was caregiver for the developmentally disabled.  It sounds all noble, but I got bit by a grown woman and another liked to run us over with a power chair.  Also working in a call center for an online workout supplement store.  Getting yelled at by meatheads jacked on steroids because their shipment was a day late all day made for a short employment duration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OOoh, I&#039;ve done lots of jobs few of them a little weird/crazy. Worked as a construction laborer, painter, TV extra, model, gardener, house cleaner, industrial cleaner, mail packer, telemarketer, accounts assistant, Excel tutor, quality control tester, fake audience, mover, bartender, cashier, barista, dishwasher. Now I work on a cruise ship and one of my tasks is facilitating the sale of adult movies to guests. Yes, I&#039;m a porn peddler!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My brother was a gardener in Palm Beach. A customer had one palm tree not going towards the ocean. His job, you guessed it, was to uproot it and turn it like the others.
 Same time period...I worked at a nursing home as a nurses&#039; aide. I had to clean up bed ridden old ladies who had colon blowing laxatives. Whats worse is I had to scrub the diddle off the towels before they went to laundry. One time it flicked in my face. Yee haw.
  Pay?? So low I can&#039;t remember...]]></description>
