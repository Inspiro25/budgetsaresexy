					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Leah&lt;/b&gt; - I woulda LOVED it if my parents did that!  Although no way I&#039;d want to live there all those years if it&#039;s bought... plus, you know how rowdy college kids get.  probably not yours though ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Kevin @ Thousandaire.com&lt;/b&gt; - I miss roommates sometimes...  the money part was nice, but the party planning/hanging out was even better!  Of course, now w/ the wife *other* parts are better ;) ow ow!
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Sources say.... Very Probable!
@&lt;b&gt;MKG&lt;/b&gt; - I, J. Money, had a bad one in College before but not sure if Mike, author of this article, has?  I&#039;m sure he has, and hopefully he&#039;ll share with us when he reads this! :)  I&#039;ll have to share mine later....  too long to write out now.
@&lt;b&gt;too funny&lt;/b&gt; - Thx dude.  Hope you&#039;re saving a cple beers for me!  Hoping to get together as soon as things calm down a bit.
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - They usually become your best friend, or your enemy ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used roommates all through college to ensure I never paid more than $300 in rent a month. Now I pay $850 a month in rent and would never go back to roommates unless it was my best friend. Congrats on being able to deal with a stranger in your house. I did it for years in college and could never do it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great Hustle!  
THIS is the living plan I hope my sons will adopt when they start college. Instead of paying those OUTRAGEOUS dormitory fees, I&#039;d rather give them a down payment on a home to live in and rent out to cover the mortgage and insurance...]]></description>
