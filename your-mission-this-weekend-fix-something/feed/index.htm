					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;I DID IT!!  I called and got $35 off my bill every single month, with no loss of any service!!&lt;/strong&gt; WOO!!!  One of the best experiences I&#039;ve ever had with Comcast actually - maybe they&#039;ve updated their game?

Either way, easiest phone call of my life ;) I highly recommend it if your bill is getting outrageous too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[DID YOU ALL COMPLETE YOUR MISSION?? I WANNA KNOW!

(Spoiler alert -- I did not.  But I do have a good excuse: I ended up taking on a 20 hour project this weekend which netted me a few thousand dollars ;)  So Comcast is back on my list to reach out to again! Probably in the morning.)

@&lt;b&gt;KJJ&lt;/b&gt; - Good one!  Did you end up doing it?
@&lt;b&gt;Matt, Tao of Unfear&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... why don&#039;t you just put it in your pockets? :)  I throw my iPhone in one of the back ones when I&#039;m walking around - only gets me in trouble when I forget to take it out when I sit down. Yikes.
@&lt;b&gt;Alicia&lt;/b&gt; - That would be nice :)  But really only if you come over here and do it for us too, hehe...
@&lt;b&gt;Money&lt;/b&gt; - Cuz we hate talking to them! And they&#039;re usually rude :(
@&lt;b&gt;Dannielle @ Odd Cents&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, good work!  You do it yourself?  Or have a friend?
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, wanna trade?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fixed the DSL!  Service from ATT has been going south for awhile, and have meant to switch.  But I realized this morning that they are charging me $42.95 a month for a service that they now sell for $19.95, and that&#039;s not the promo price.  So, I guess it&#039;s back to Comcast.  At least they haven&#039;t blatantly overcharged me in awhile :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I fixed my hair... I consider this to be a good thing because it really needed fixing and I did not have to take a trip to the salon and spend $60 to get it done! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of my very first posts was about fixing your cable bill. It&#039;s so easy to do, I do not understand why not many people take advantage of it.

					<description><![CDATA[Well not sure if we&#039;ll get to it this weekend, but we def have to get a move on with our Wills and Living Trust.  Maybe I&#039;ll make that a &quot;by-the-end-of-2011&quot; goal.

One of my goals for the month was to try and start doing food prep ahead of time so mealtimes in the evening weren&#039;t so hectic.  So this weekend I would like to wash/chop/thaw my food for the week.  Less ambitious compared to some of the other posts, but I won&#039;t dread making dinner quite as much if I know some of the work is already done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just put a freeze on my cell phone account because they wouldn&#039;t let me downgrade my plan to a value 200mb/mo data plan, since I&#039;m still on contract. Now, instead of them getting $20 a month, they&#039;re getting $0. And since I&#039;m working from home, I generally have a wifi connection, so it doesn&#039;t affect me much. Sucks that I don&#039;t have a connection while travelling, but there&#039;s usually wifi once I get where I&#039;m going. I might pay to get out of my contract and unlock my phone and switch to a different company, since I can essentially get the same plan that I&#039;ve been on for half the price. My only concern is that the customer service will be worse (customer service with my current company is stellar).

I also need to find someone to sew the pocket back onto my jacket (or go get some thread and attempt to do it myself). I look pretty homely walking around with a pocket falling off of my jacket. Haha.]]></description>
