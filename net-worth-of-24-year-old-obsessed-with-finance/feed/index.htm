					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome! Way to go. When I was 24 I was worth $-85k. There are a lot of people that are in the negative at that age due to debt. You&#039;ll never have to worry for money if you get this down at your age.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re doing great, Corrine! It&#039;s been nice to see so many younger folk becoming financially aware these days. Like J Money, I think I had about $4 to my name when I was 24 (and though I was always reasonably smart with money in the traditional sense, I definitely wasn&#039;t FIRE minded until my mid-30s). Well done, keep it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome and keep up the good work. I hope your progress inspires others. 

My first job after college paid $51,000. That was back in 2008, so that starting salary is like $60,000 today according to the DollarTime inflation calculator. At age 22, that seemed like I was a millionaire until I had to start paying back my student loans. Once I paid off my student loans and a car loan, I had a 50% savings rate (after taxes, 401k contribution, etc.) for two years. 

My wife and I stashed that cash away so I could afford to change career paths. The old job was very family-unfriendly but a good experience for a 20-something. Being disciplined in my 20s is how I was able to open doors of opportunity so my 30s have a better work-life balance.]]></description>
