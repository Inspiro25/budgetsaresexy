					<description><![CDATA[I currently have $10,826.35, spread amongst two credit cards and a vet bill. My debt came from pet emergencies, vacations I really couldn&#039;t afford, and a couple of ill advised spending sprees with my teenage daughter. A large part of it came from three trips to Fayetteville NC -- the first one the Christmas before my brother deployed to Iraq, he couldn&#039;t come for Christmas that year, so we loaded up and went to him because we knew his next Christmas was going to be spent in Iraq. Then we went back up there when he deployed and then again when he came home. No, I couldn&#039;t afford those trips, but looking back on those, I would do those trips again, because there was just so much uncertainty --- but maybe just not throw so much money around while I was doing it! I&#039;m hoping the situation never arises again, but if it does, I plan to be much better prepared financially!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I currently have $12,300 in student loans and about $300 on my credit card (which I pay off each month). I&#039;ve just started making payments on my loan after about six years of being in default - because of a stupid loophole, even though I didn&#039;t cash the loan (I dropped out of school), I&#039;m still considered to owe it because the loan paperwork was never returned. Argh. 

I want to get completely debt-free so that I can return to school when my daughter starts kindergarten in the fall, going to classes by day and continuing to freelance by night. The only way that I can do that is to suck it up to the tune of $13K, a quarter of my income a month at a time.

I&#039;ve been looking forward to this book since the first time I heard about it. May random.org be on my side!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Me again ... I want to add to my comment that my husband and I are committed to putting our kids through (state) colleges so they have no debt when they graduate. We pay tuition and room/board, they pay the rest with summer jobs, scholarships, etc. My parents gave me that tremendous gift, and I want to pass it along. It will be very, very hard in this economy (I&#039;m in print media--YIKES! And my husband is a builder --DOUBLE YIKES!!). We&#039;ll sell our house and buy down if necessary to achieve this goal for them. So, you can see why the credit card debt has got to go, and why I need that book ... stat!]]></description>
