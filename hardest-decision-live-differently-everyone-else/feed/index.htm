					<description><![CDATA[We paid off our mortgage in April of 2013 and I gotta tell you, that was the best decision we made. A month later, my hubby lost his job but we did not have to worry because we can pay our bills and save a decent amount of money every month with my income. &#039;Til this day, our family and friends think we are rolling in money, but it is simple, we lived differently than any of them and now we can enjoy some luxuries without breaking the bank.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WOW, did I need this today!  We&#039;ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed and &quot;loser-ish&quot; about our debt, and about climbing the long, hard road to get out of it.  We&#039;ve got a three-way split in our lives of people who: think we&#039;re nuts like your supposed BF did/think we&#039;re losers for getting into debt in the first place/support us full-board.  The 66% has been winning the battle in our minds this week, but NO MORE!  Different is indeed sexy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so this is going to sound weird.  I totally believe in living like you choose, even if that isn&#039;t the norm.  But I am a personal finance blogger.  The &quot;norm&quot; in my world now is frugality...plus it seems that a ton of pf bloggers are going hardcore minimalist.  I am not frugal or minimalistic.  My living &quot;outside the norm&quot; is the fact that we did just buy our own McMansion of sorts last year so we&#039;d have buttloads of entertaining space.  So technically, we live like the &quot;norm&quot; stereotypically wants to live. 

Two people without kids don&#039;t need 5 bedrooms, 4 full baths, and like 4 other kinds of rooms (media, game, library, and dining) to go along with a kitchen and living area.  But we actually like that lifestyle (potlucks once a month, 2-3 movie nights a month in the media room, Friday night dinners with friends in our kitchen, having friends as roommates sometimes, etc.).  

But we still make sure to save for our future and only have this one mortgage debt left.  Overall, the trick is figuring out how you want to live, how you can afford to live, and just balance the two without ever really thinking about anyone else&#039;s opinion at all.  :-D]]></description>

I assumed he meant the MIL suite - like the extra room for the MIL when she moves in.  But renting out his MIL would be even better, lol.  No wear and tear on the house.  ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So many people in our lives want us to fail.  Maybe it makes them feel better but I&#039;m not going to stick around to find out why!  Great article.  Different is not only sexy, it&#039;s also liberating and once you taste &quot;living differently&quot; you will never go back!]]></description>
