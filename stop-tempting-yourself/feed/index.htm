					<description><![CDATA[“How do you stay faithful in a room full of hos?”
I LOL at this! :) I guess he speaks truth, though.

My husband and I get VERY motivated by going to open houses and on drives to the area we&#039;d like to live in. Of course we also dream of paying for said dream house in cash. We&#039;ll see how that goes. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How I rid my desire for junk food:

1) Internalize that junk food does nothing good for you.  It adds calories and does not provide nutrition.
2) I NEVER spend money on junk food.  I can&#039;t even compel myself to buy raw sugar because adding it into an otherwise healthy recipe feels even worse than woofing down a KitKat bar.  Something about pouring sugar into a bowl for consumption feels very.... intentionally stupid.
3) I keep a 6-pack on hand at all times.  6-pack of abs of course.  Keeping those abs apparent is much easier without fat cascading over them!!!!]]></description>

Maybe it&#039;s the world telling you to take up a side hustle to then PAY for that airfare you obviously want so bad? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right on man.  I&#039;ve said it before, and I&#039;ll say it again.  Stop going to the freaking mall.  You&#039;re wasting gas driving there, and you&#039;re doing nothing but tempting yourself to spend.  And that time you&#039;re wasting, too.  Come on now.  I&#039;d much rather relax to the sweet soulful melodies of Yeezy than spend my hard earned cash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seriously, why tempt yourself? I stopped buying ice cream because it never lasts more than 2 sittings, and I need to really stop &quot;browsing&quot; airfares. It&#039;s like, really? Why am I doing this to myself when I can&#039;t really afford it. We want to be pretend the option is feasible for us. So we just keep looking, or being around it. And it doesn&#039;t help!]]></description>
