					<description><![CDATA[Finding side hustles is as important as budgeting in my opinion. It&#039;s a pretty simple concept. We can&#039;t save what we don&#039;t make. 

I would say diversity is key in our efforts to make side income. You clearly have a diversified strategy! Keep up the good work and thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woohoo! Thanks for sharing this, I&#039;m very excited. I have been wanting to dabble in children&#039;s books for a little while now,but wasn&#039;t sure where to get started. Thank you very much for sharing the course for free as well, that is a huge relief. 
On a side note - I had been looking for a platform where I could build an online class and hadn&#039;t seen Udemy, which looks like the best for what I have seen thus far. :D Thanks!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow!  She&#039;s got a great start!  Writing books is a whole lot of fun, especially when you can share your books with kids or hear how other parents and teachers enjoy them.  Make sure she signs up for the course while the free code still works! :)]]></description>

Thanks Kim!  That&#039;s the intent!  Eventually I hope to be a full time author, but with kids and a house to support I can&#039;t quite jump into the abyss yet~ :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating...I think my wife would find this very interesting.  She got her masters in early childhood education and taught at daycares for a few years but the pay was horrible.  She loves little kids though.  Now she has a desk job which pays better but she still loves the little ones...and I think she would enjoy publishing a children&#039;s book.  Oh and she is great with foreign languages as she is Chinese (spoke that with parents at home) but grew up in Central America (speaking Spanish), but went to a dual language school where they taught in English for the most part.]]></description>

This is a very good point. Will the next generation of parents feel the same way though? Should be an interesting dynamic to watch...
