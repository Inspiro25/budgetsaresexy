True, you can&#039;t generally use HSA funds for Insurance plan premiums.  Specifically, you COULD use it to pay for COBRA continuing coverage after leaving work. But I&#039;ve never seen COBRA premiums that made it worth looking at.  And COBRA only gets you 18 months.
Here, I can cheat a bit because I will have a Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA) when I retire.  Although new employees don&#039;t get the benefit and mine won&#039;t accrue any more after 2020, I will have $34,500 that CAN be used to pay the insurance premiums. I figure this should be good for about 4 years or so of premiums.  The deductible $ can of course come from the HSA since that is what it was designed for.
Unless they come up with a better alternative, I&#039;m planning on joining you on the Affordable Care exchange.
All of the Medicare premiums except Medi-Gap can be reimbursed from your HSA, you do just cut yourself a check.  :)
I also plan on staying with an HDHP all the way to 65 (and Medicare) so I can continue to contribute to the HSA with money from my 401k (after age 55). That&#039;ll be an additional tax-free conversion of $4,000 to $5,000 per year.]]></description>

The 401k monies have been going into the fidelity diversified bond funds that are offered in my plan.  I have a total of  25% exposure in some tax deferred and brokerage accounts.
 
I believe you once wrote: why keep playing the game once you&#039;ve won.  
With that, I started taking money off the table and stashing cash and bonds.
I keep 4 years of annual  budget spend cash  in a &quot;high yield&quot; accounts in both Money Markets and CDs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Did you increase your net worth?

Yes - by about $100k.

2. Did you reduce your debt?

Yep - even though we bought a new car a few years ago.

3. Are you tracking your spending and keeping a budget?

Mint &#038; Excel spreadsheets for the win!

4. Did you reach a savings goal?

I guess? 401k match + max out Roth IRAs and HSA

5. Did you ask for and/or receive a pay increase, or take advantage of your company benefits in a way that allowed you to keep more money in your pocket?

I guess I received a pay increase, but I need to do better in this regard.

6. Do you have the right insurance policies in place?

Mostly, I guess? I&#039;m not 100% sure what I should have, though.]]></description>
