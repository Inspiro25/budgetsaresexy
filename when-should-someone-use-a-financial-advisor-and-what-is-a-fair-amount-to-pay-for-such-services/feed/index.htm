You can&#039;t open a Roth IRA in your sons name unless he has earned income. I guess that&#039;s the downfall? but on the positive side you don&#039;t have a ROTH IRA established yet so it might be the kick start to getting one opened up :-) . My Roth is with fidelity it was pretty simple to open up and I picked index funds such as FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND and FIDELITY ZERO TOTAL MARKET INDEX. They charge .015 per 1,000 and the last one charges 0%. They both have done well for me. I&#039;d make sure when picking a mutual fund to look at the fees because some of them can be ridiculous.  I set up a monthly transfer from my bank to fidelity and then I have it invest the money automatically into each mutual fund. I like to keep all my accounts separate so I get why you would want your son to have his own &quot;account&quot; but you could always keep the money separate within the roth. So this 1 mutual fund is for college and this other 1 is for my retirement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the info Liz! I actually wondered about this. What then is the benefit to a 529 versus a Roth IRA? Can I open it in my son&#039;s name or does the amount I contribute to his college Roth count toward my $6,000 max (or $12,000 max for my spouse and I)? Thanks for sharing. I&#039;m going to check it out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tonya,

I went to a financial advisor through my job. He said a lot of people use Roths as college funds. You can withdrawal penalty free after having the account for 5 years. That way if he doesn&#039;t go to college you still have the money.

Just the investments that you have with them. Help you come up with a goal number and help you reach it and every quarter they touch base and see if anything needs to change. Anything outside of that you&#039;d need a planner.]]></description>

I used to use one of Ramsey&#039;s advisers, he was smart and competent but after I learned about Vanguard and index funds, I sat down with him, ran through my long term index fund plan and asked him to tell me what else I needed to know.  His response was that I didn&#039;t need him anymore :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think a 1.5% fee is very high. In retirement, you&#039;re supposed to live off of roughly 4% of your savings (the safe withdrawal rate). So the 1.5% advisor fee means that a wopping 37.5% of your annual income goes to your financial advisor! That means if you want your portfolio to last, you&#039;ll only have 2.5% per year of your savings left to spend on your other expenses! 

So, Doris, I&#039;d go with a one-time advice from a fee-only fiduciary advisor, who can create a plan for you on how to handle the next five years or so. Then, five years from now - or maybe just before you actually plan to retire, reach out to them again to create your next &quot;battle plan&quot; for the next couple of years. 

Most often this will be a lot cheaper than 1.5% of your portfolio per year, and it will still help you create a solid plan that you can execute by yourself.]]></description>
