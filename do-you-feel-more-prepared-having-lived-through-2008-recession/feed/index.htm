Don&#039;t stress too much. Just keep your kids reading. Think of it as an extra long summer. Teachers will adjust in the fall. They know kids missed the end of the grade before and will compensate.]]></description>

Don&#039;t foresee them coming back at any time, but here&#039;s a hint at where we&#039;re at now - under a million dollars :) Was fun while it lasted! lol..]]></description>

We&#039;ll have to make sure our kids are hanging with other smart people too because Lord knows they won&#039;t be listening to their parents for a while! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must say I do miss your Net Worth updates.  Not so much for your Net Worth value or mine, or anyone else&#039;s.  I just liked the seeing that we&#039;re all on this roller coaster together and how much fun it is.  The exiting ups as the car clickety-clacks to a peak and then our stomach goes to our throat as it drops but then it starts its slow climb back up to reach the next peak.  And If one of us tries to jump out of the car at the bottom we all lock arms and pull him/her back in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Living through 2008 in fear coupled with the knowledge from experience and the blogging community, has tempered my risk tolerance and mind to withstand any storm. I comfortably buy into the bear, set money aside to support my local community and know tons of millennials are doing the same. 

I just hope I can impart this wisdom into my son when he gets old enough to understand the world around him.  Every generation needs a tempering phase, millennials had at least two now. Time will tell to see what my son has to deal with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just remind myself that I’ll be handing down millions to my kids when my wife and I die of old age someday.  If the portfolio goes down a bunch now, I’m not losing my money, I’m losing their money.  That makes me feel a lot better!]]></description>
