Sorry...at 54 that is how I see it!

Tradition is sometime seen as an enemy with the younger generation.  Family is what is important...he has family and she really doesn&#039;t.  Truth is &quot;It is What It Is&quot;.  

Peace, Love &#038; Happiness]]></description>

I already recommended to them that Archie should start working at McDonald&#039;s when he turns 14. Also, they are planning for him to start his own Youtube channel and other side hustles while in grade school. :)]]></description>

Great questions! I&#039;m taking Harry surfing this weekend in Santa Barbara so I&#039;ll ask him then. :)

My recommendation for him/Megs would be to build their own nest egg, regardless of their family&#039;s wealth. That way they have true independence, freedom, and won&#039;t have to rely on inheritance to hit their FI goals.  :)]]></description>

That is an outdated, misogynistic take. Why should Harry giving up weigh more than Meghan&#039;s sacrifice? She had to sacrifice her job, website, life etc to go over there and accept handouts from Prince Charles and the state. Also the press hounded the living daylight out her for getting tax funding. Good for her giving up tax payer funds and wanting to return to earning her living. I take the opposite view. Harry should never have expected her to give up her life to live on hand-outs. Both of them need to get jobs and earn their own money. When Archie grows up, he needs to get a job also. Lol.]]></description>
