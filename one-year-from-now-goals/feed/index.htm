					<description><![CDATA[I think I can give a bit of advice on the close pregnancies thing -- I have ten kids. my oldest is fifteen, youngest is one. closest spacing is 13months, furthest is just under three years. I will say that having a toddler and a newborn is *hard* but totally doable. I wouldn&#039;t recommend less than a year apart though - you want them in separate grades once they aren&#039;t twins. but 15 -17 months is a good spread (meaning get pregnant when your first is around 6 months old and not before.)

Although if your wife is exclusively breastfeeding, she may have some natural protection for a  space of at least two years. on the other hand, all of mine were exclusively breastfed and I didn&#039;t get very much space out of it.and not]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;DebtKiller&lt;/b&gt; - You know it!  Hmmm... let&#039;s see if I can remember here... I don&#039;t know what was actually brewing in all their systems there, but I do know that some of the test samples on tap were Namaste (yum!), Midas Touch (so-so), and Burton Baton (bleh). It&#039;s an experience I enjoy almost every single year - highly recommend :)
@&lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; - I like that a lot actually!  Growing a network of fun and awesome people is great - oddly enough not many people go out of their way to do that :)  And how cool does rally driving sound - wow!  I wanna try!! Sorry to hear your finances are kinda stressful at times, but I promise you it gets better. Especially as you get older and get a good system down.  I sucked at money until I hit 25, so I&#039;ve only been better for a handful of years. But the beauty it that once you figure it out, you&#039;re good forever!! So keep hanging in there, I swear it&#039;ll get easier :)
@&lt;b&gt;Crystal @ Prairie Ecothrifter&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yay!!!!  No mortgage in 2013 would be hot!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love IPA&#039;s!!!  :)  The pink dogfish is my favorite.

Nice job on all your goals.  I&#039;m sure it took a ton of work to get where you are and it&#039;s very rewarding.  Blogging full time sounds like fun, provided you have a constant flow of information and ideas :D.

My new years resolutions are going ok.  I got a new job, which pays more, but somehow it doesn&#039;t all add up with the increased cost of the commute (too bad I couldn&#039;t find something closer!).  It does however offer potential for a higher paying job in the future. Finances are so stressful!

I&#039;ve gained some new hobbies.  One is running, and I ran two 5k&#039;s so far, and hope to do 2 more before the end of the year but keeping up the motivation is a challenge! There is always an excuse not to run, and the internet is one of them!  I also got really into rally driving and have been loving that.  I took up rally cross driving and trying to promote my team with the hopes that I&#039;ll gain valuable people skills/marketing experience/driving skills.  So far it&#039;s been going well too.

I think my goals focus around personal growth and creating genuine connections with people who are interested in the things I am too.  I know that&#039;s really broad, but as long as I feel like I am working towards those things I am happy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely agree about Dogfish Head Brewery!  Dela-Where(?) doesn&#039;t have much to offer, but it does have some nice beaches and one heck of a brewery.  What were they brewing when you went?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nice hearing about all your goals, too!  Freakin&#039; love blogging ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Sean @ One Smart Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh zucchini&#039;s yummy!  I can&#039;t even imagine how they taste all fresh like that too, very cool.
@&lt;b&gt;Lauren @ LBee and the Money Tree&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I know - probably not the smartest financially and stressfully (word?) but for some reason I just really want to keep going? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Laura Brown&lt;/b&gt; - Depending on what kind of business you were trying to open, you may not need *that much* - especially if you started it online and at least got it off the ground there? That only takes about $100 or so a year for domain and hosting stuff, and maybe it&#039;ll get you more motivated/excited?  Good to know about the 2 year period with mothers too - hadn&#039;t heard that before :)
@&lt;b&gt;MikeTheRed&lt;/b&gt; - Damn dude, that&#039;s a helluva great list you&#039;ve got there.  Y&#039;all are some smarties!  Def. let me know when that blog comes about too - would love to help promote it a bit for you and get some traffic flowing :)  If you ever have any questions or ideas you want help with, just shoot me an email.  And what&#039;s up with that weird car lender of yours??  A limit on how much you can pay off??  Haven&#039;t heard of that in over 10 years - pretty lame if you ask me.
@&lt;b&gt;Budget &amp; the Beach&lt;/b&gt; - I wish someone would email me that once a week and keep ME reminded too :)  I fee like we&#039;re all doing incredible things here, but we get so immersed in it, and always wanting to be doing MORE and FASTER that we don&#039;t stop and enjoy our daily accomplishments as much... we all need pats on our backs eveyr now and then to keep smiling!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... I&#039;d LOVE twin girls!  Does that make me even *more* nutso? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, well I&#039;m so glad you were able to get one then!  That&#039;s awesome :)  And yeah I&#039;ve breifly considered Portland too, and still REALLY want to go there some day if it&#039;s anything like Seattle which I love!, but the only thing it doesn&#039;t have going for it is that it&#039;s on the West coast :( Which we&#039;re trying to avoid due to distance between family/friends... the only way we&#039;d get out there is if the Mrs. finds a great job or if we end up saying &quot;F it&quot; and we move to L.A. once and for all which we&#039;ve always dreamed about... but that&#039;s like a 2% chance of happening at the present moment.
@&lt;b&gt;Cait&lt;/b&gt; - Cool!  That would be fun :)
@&lt;b&gt;Michelle&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome!! What changed from this year to that one to allow you to have so much more free time?  Is there a secret I should know about? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;bogofdebt&lt;/b&gt; - We all gotta start somewhere :)  I love it that you guys are helping pay each other&#039;s debts off like that, very cool (and smart) of y&#039;all for sure.
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Forgot your house moved - I&#039;m jealous ;)  Congrats on starting school already though, that&#039;s wonderful!  I guess you&#039;ll still have the time to read this blog it looks like too? Haha... rock it out!
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... indeed.  Maybe I&#039;ll put &quot;get rid of Facebook&quot; on my list too, actually.  It bothers me more than it does excite me usually ;) (my personal account that is, not my J$ one)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh I didn&#039;t know you wanted to blog on the side... I think it&#039;s a great idea since you&#039;re already famililar with how it all works. If you ever need help, let me know okay? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - If you&#039;re spending 12 hours a day on blogging, then I agree - you DEF need to be making some money from it! haha... or spending some of those hours on something that does ;)  Maybe you can start selling stuff online and see what happens? That would give you instant cash and allow you to still stay at home on the computer?
@&lt;b&gt;Brent Pittman&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, well at least big dreamers ;) But that&#039;s what I love about it all - every year we talk about our perfect worlds and all our goals we want to accomplish, and then when some of us hit them it&#039;s wonderful cuz we all remember when they were first being talked about!  Gives us all hope that stuff is possible, ya know?
@&lt;b&gt;Sara&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool!  Did you like growing up there?  What are some of the pros and cons?  If we ever end up moving there, I&#039;ll hit you up for a coffee or beer meeting :)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s one damn good goal, my friend.  If you remind me again what your perfect job would be, I can let you know when similar jobs pass by my desk.  Every now and then I get notified about some random job opps.
@&lt;b&gt;Debt Free Teen&lt;/b&gt; - Awesome, gotta love that :)
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - I remember working for a job that didn&#039;t inspire or excite me either - but ofcourse the money def. helps with all that stuff :)  It&#039;s great that you know yourself well though, and what you&#039;re comfortable with as far as housing and all! I could do with a trailor too actually, but the wife wouldn&#039;t ever allow it. Unless it was temporary and involved traveling the country or something (so I guess more like an RV?).  In fact, I&#039;m gonna run that idea by her when she&#039;s awake and see what she thinks, haha... wish me luck!
@&lt;b&gt;My Money Design&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, probably not.  You have to go through the process and see what you&#039;re feeling by the end of it all ;)  Maybe you&#039;ll turn into a mogul and end up loving it!
@&lt;b&gt;Kitchen Penguin&lt;/b&gt; - YES! PERFECT!!!  I like those goals of yours :) And hopefully one day our paths will cross in the &quot;real world&quot; so I can sample some of your cuisinary arts too!  You&#039;ll have to invite me to your graduation or something, hehe...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aloha J$!

I feel you about wanting to get out of the DC area. One year from now I&#039;ll be half way through my AS in Culinary Arts and I&#039;d like to start making some money from my cooking skills. Well, more than the occasional $20 order from a co-worker that wants cookies. I want to get rid of 1/3 of my stuff so that I have less to cull when I&#039;m ready to move and 10% of me so I&#039;ll have more energy to conquer the world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice job on the accomplishments from the prior two years.  Those were no small tasks!  

I love the goal of having another child!  I hope you can get the Mrs on board!  Moving to a new area also sounds cool.  I&#039;m considering starting up a few new projects.  Should I just skip a year to where you are and not even bother - just focus on my main blog?  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post so got to me!!!

I have accomplished a few things this year. Went on a diet and lost weight,left a toxic work environment for a slightly less toxic but pays way better environment, booked the dream vacation (Australia in Feb) but the biggest nagging thing is work and housing. 

I have a job that is not in line with my personal beliefs so I do not enjoy it. It pays very well and I can afford to buy a modest condo in my city but it would mean I have to continue to be a wage slave wage.  Housing is my biggest expense and that makes me crazy. Since I live in Canada, we managed to escape the foreclosure epidemic so prices are still high and supply low. 
 
I would like to cut my housing expenses in half, and by doing so I would only have to work 3 days a week. I am not a spender. My main hobbies are reading and writing.  Since I am in excellent health, I don&#039;t have to worry too much about health care costs. I have no debt, no dependents and a modest amount of savings. The type of housing for me is a small trailer, because I have no problem living in 400-500 square feet. Just trying to gather the nerve to pull the trigger and buy something outright (be mortgage free but also budgeting for the inevitable renovations) is my big stumbling block. Need to focus on that for 2013.]]></description>
