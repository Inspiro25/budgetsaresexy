I would also upgrade my travelling plans! I would love to be able to live in New England for most of the year, but travel during the cold months more frequently!]]></description>

Interesting... I&#039;m sure his first house wasn&#039;t nearly $700k when he first bought it all those years ago though ;) And if he still lives in it most of the time then it&#039;s still kinda accurate eh? He just goes to his vacation home during vacays? (Haven&#039;t read the article yet, but it is good to hear more to this for sure - thx)]]></description>

Hahhaha... good catch ;) I&#039;d love for my mother to live with us too, like in one of those sweet little cottages in the back yard or something. I&#039;m gonna finagle that whether I become a billionaire or not! Actually, two of them - one for each set of parents :)]]></description>

If only we could buy more than our 24 we get a day! Rich or poor it&#039;s still all we get... but you&#039;re right that we can hire others to free up more of ours - I like that thinking :)]]></description>
