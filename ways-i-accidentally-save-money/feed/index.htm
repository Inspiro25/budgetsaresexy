					<description><![CDATA[I love accidentally saving money! And now I&#039;m craving peanut butter. 

One thing I do with cable (I sadly can&#039;t live without it) is pause my monthly Hulu subscription (which is almost $70 now!) after ever billing cycle. That way, if I go a few days or even weeks without, I&#039;m not paying for it. This is of course after I&#039;ve exhausted all the 7-day trials for YouTube TV, Sling, etc. I guess that&#039;s more intentionally saving money but it feels like an accident!]]></description>

Hah - this is true!! And the people you DO spend good quality time with probably aren&#039;t the types of people who would care even if you did re-wear the same stuff all the time :)

I remember this one guy in college wearing the same shirt every single day for an entire year as a social experiment to see if anyone noticed (even in winter! he wore it over sweatshirts and jackets haha...). He said a few did, but most never said a word...]]></description>

Apple Nachos - GENIUS!!!!!

I used to rock all my airline clothes for important events too since they were all suits and I remember once my dad asking me why I had all these holes around parts of the jacket where I took off the name tags or other things we had to pin there for work, lol... I thought I was being smooth (and cost effective) repurposing them, but I guess it didn&#039;t fool everyone :)]]></description>

Yes!! I remember that post! It was from a friend of mine circa 2008 haha... Here it is!

https://www.cleverdude.com/content/an-illustrated-frugal-lunch/

The pics of the assembly line are the best &#128514;

I miss Frankencaddy too :( Actually saw an old police cruiser the other day and contemplated on picking it up (it still has the old police painting on it!) but doesn&#039;t look in great condition... Such a good feeling riding around in a hooptie though and blasting music - I don&#039;t think I can go too much longer with this Minivan, lol...

Glad you&#039;re enjoying the new posts - feels good to be back amongst my people again :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favorite is &quot;Never buy new what you can buy used.&quot;  You&#039;d be surprised what people will get rid of.  Most things only need a minor amount of repair or you just have to have the super human ability to ignore imperfections.

Works for me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One good thing to come from social anxiety? I spend very little on concert and theater tickets and the expenses associated with an active social life - dining out, drinks, transportation, party clothes, and all the “upkeep” women are expected to do. I have never paid for a professional manicure or worried about whether anyone would notice that I am wearing the same dress as the last time I attended a party.]]></description>
