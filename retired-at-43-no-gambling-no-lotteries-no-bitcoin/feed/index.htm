					<description><![CDATA[One of the most overlooked keys to financial success is both partners being on the same page financially, so this is key:

&quot;4) great wife (also frugal and on the same page)&quot;

Without my frugal (and coupon clipping) wife, there&#039;s no way we would have built wealth as fast as we have.  I thank God every day that I found her instead of a spendthrift - because I&#039;m an accountant by trade and that would stress me out.  We&#039;ve been married over 20 years and are on the path to financial freedom within the next ten years.

Before you decide to spend the rest of your life with someone, make sure you are compatible financially.  Most divorces are due to financial troubles - so this is just common sense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No gambling and lotteries--where&#039;s the fun in that!? Haha hard to avoid the temptation of a good get rich quick scheme! Obviously great tips that reiterate that it isn&#039;t as hard as it looks. Boring index investing will do more of the work for you. But common sense isn&#039;t always so common! Great tips.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great story that highlights one important fact that everyone should be aware of: Everyone can get to where they want to be. Starting point is meaningless, what matters is the ending point. 

No gambling, lotteries, or bitcoin is needed. While they have a very tiny chance to be helpful, it&#039;s still not necessary at the end of the day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy Monday Joel and Mr. Why 9 to 5 - 

First of all, a huge congratulations to passing the $1 million marker. What an accomplishment that must have been for you and your wife. As I read through your story, seeing how you made it to Australia, barely finding any work and with $50 in your bank account, was so inspiring. I think the fact that you still made it work - clearly since you retired early - shows that if there is a will, then there is a way. Sometimes, you just have to put in the work and ride out the lows in order to enjoy the highs. 

Keep up the awesome work.

Cheers,

Fiona]]></description>
