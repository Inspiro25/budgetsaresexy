					<description><![CDATA[I loved the ‘why’ of these pillars. I thought I didn’t know mine, but as something with the over educated stomach that absorbs every molecule of stress I encounter, this article made me realize that I long to wake up every morning and take a full and complete breath that does not have my stomach wrapped in knots. The day when I can do this continuously through my day is the one where I know the freedom I have been seeking through FI has truly been realized!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the four pillars and what they stand for! If you need a fifth one, I think it would be legacy.  What do you want to pass on to your kids who would tell stories about you.  In other words, how do you want to be remembered? I think you want to create something where everyone knows you set the standard for future generations.]]></description>

What do you do on the weekends right now? I&#039;ve heard from early retirees it&#039;s pretty much just like that - only compounded :)]]></description>

Oh yeah - those greeters in their 70s and 80s are always so happy and sprightly!! I can totally see myself doing that down the line, haha... And while I&#039;m not 100% &quot;self employment or die&quot; , I do agree with being passionate about what you do, whatever that is for you. Lots of people are just as happy in a 9-5 as they are self-employed :)]]></description>
