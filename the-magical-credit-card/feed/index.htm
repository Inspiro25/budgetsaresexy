					<description><![CDATA[I would probably do the $100 a day until I was debt free (assuming this is similar to a debit card where I can withdraw cash and not just a credit card for purchases). 

Also, I have a question, after the card freezes, you get to keep the item/cash that you spent on the last transaction, right? If so, then you could withdraw the amount of your magical retirement number, let&#039;s say $5 million and there you go, put it somewhere to earn interest and retire. You&#039;re good even if the card freezes after that. #loophole]]></description>

I want to get a master&#039;s in Patristics cos I&#039;m a nerd, and if I had an unlimited amount of money, why not? He&#039;s a social worker, and he wants to get his master&#039;s in psychology because ya know, he actually has career goals. XD But I&#039;ve always wanted to get a degree with him. It&#039;d be so fun, although, he&#039;s not the competitive type... so, he&#039;d just roll his eyes at me if I tried.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh nice! So you&#039;re going to school to become a librarian? I have this half-baked dream of running a personal finance book-only library that&#039;s mainly online but also has a physical location too. Which houses every single $$$ book imaginable, along with free coffee so you can hang out and learn about $$ all day long ;) Everyone I know tells me it would never work, but one day I might have to prove them wrong! Haha...]]></description>

Oooh what master&#039;s programs are you guys wanting to take? The same one, or different ones? That would be cool to go to class and study/learn together :) And then challenge each other to try and beat each other with grades!]]></description>

Ahhhhh I see what you did there!!

And $10gs a month seems very worth it indeed, congrats :) I hope to do it with stock investments vs real estate, but we all got our own modes of wealth building, eh? Saving this comment to use in a future post one day - it&#039;s great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$100 a day would completely change my life. Right now I am a graduate student and working only part-time. During the semester I live on student loans, but right now during the summer with only part time and freelance work I am really feeling the pinch. Since, I live with roommates and we divide up rent and utilities, I would use the $100/day to paypal my roommates the rent and utilities in increments! Even with the credit card fee being charged, having basically free rent would free up so much of my brainspace from being stressed that I can hardly imagine what else I would do!

I would probably also resubscribe to the various patreons and monthly charity donations that I have had to stop contributing to because of my current impoverished state.

Then, once I have an actual salaried library job, that $100/day means I would have free groceries and dining out for the rest of my life and still be able to contribute to other people&#039;s wellbeing. What a dream!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d definitely focus on debt repayment, and then I&#039;d set it aside in an investment account for the different master&#039;s program my husband and I want to take. That way we&#039;d be going through the programs entirely debt free. After that, save a couple years for a nest egg for the kids we one day want to have. Take a lavish vacation, and invest the rest ad infinitum.]]></description>
