					<description><![CDATA[I know first hand your credit score is everything. I have had poor credit since my mid 20&#039;s (I am now 53) and I have paid thousands and thousands of extra dollars in interest and loan rates for cars the past 30 years because of my low credit score. I can not get a credit card and loans for home, cars, condos.....no way. It is demoralizing and embarrassing to even try but I have made loan applications with banks, with lendors on line, and the rejection letters are numerous (in the hundreds and each time you make an application, it lowers your credit score even more)!!!

 If I can tell one thing to a person just getting his first credit card in the mail - keep your credit score a top priority in your life!!!

I need to read this book and see their help for living with poor credit and what we can do?  I have tried everything and even got burned by two credit counseling companies who I was paying monthly fees to in my 30&#039;s and they were suppose to be lowering and paying off my debts (both were bogus companies bilking people for millions). I didn&#039;t know who to trust and I have just said forget it and live my life without credit cards, not being able to buy a home (the best investment you can make).....so many people I have known through the years, re-financing their homes and having thousands in cash to help pay for things.  No such luck for me. Please let me win one of the free copies and I will put the co-authors suggestions to real life implementation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As soon as I saw this book mentioned I headed to Barnes and Noble and I&#039;m so happy I did.  So often people talk about the benefits of a good credit score but forget about us that happen to have a low score.  For a long time I literally felt like my life was doomed because I&#039;m in my early twenties and fell into the credit trap during undergrad.  Thankfully, this book has restored my faith.  Prior to getting the book I already made a goal to eliminate all my $10,000 credit card debt by 2011but this book has given me something else to look forward to...an apartment of my own, maybe even a house, but most importantly I can now live without guilt, but perseverance instead! Thanks J. Money and the authors of Living Well with Bad Credit]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would love the book, as I am trying to find the &quot;up&quot; side of a bad credit score. Not too long ago I got divorced...well several years before is when I SHOULD have filed for divorce....but after my husband left he whined that he would not have any health insurance...so I delayed filing seeing that getting re-married was not going to be in my future....later he was involved in a terrible motorcycle accident involving helicopter evacuation...weeks in ICU....and lots of bills....comming to me...the responsible policy holder....yep that&#039;ll teach me...Oh and before the accident (yes he lived) he bought a huge front end loader and had his girlfriend sign my name and info as a co-borrower...they just defaulted and the creditor is now calling me.......is there something written across my forehead????? Live and learn and climb back up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, boy, do my husband and I need this book!  We had EXCELLENT credit while we both held very high paying jobs.  Then my job took a pay cut and my husband lost his completely all at the time that I was pregnant and had a baby.  We almost lost our house and our cars.  The only way to save them was bankruptcy :(  which we still, to this day, feel so guilty about.  We&#039;re trying to move past that and, actually, J., your blog has helped me create and stick to budget, budget, budget to the point where we are living within our means....somthing we&#039;ve never done before!  

HOWEVER, now we ARE dealing with bad credit...something we are not used to...and we would love to have this book as something to get us through the next year or so while we build our credit back up.  Like you said, there&#039;s TONS of info out there on HOW to rebuild credit (and we are doing that) but it takes time, and we feel so stuck until then! 

Thanks for the opp.!]]></description>
