					<description><![CDATA[I was blessed to marry a woman who is open-minded and was willing to learn good personal finance with me, but I know that this is the exception rather than the rule. In the United States especially, the culture seems to be focused on consumption rather than planning, which can&#039;t end well. Most people just don&#039;t seem to know how to find this information, and it really is a shame. Perhaps if more families had a CFO, the US would have a drastically different reputation.

My wife and I went through the process of budgeting, trimming the budget, streamlining the cashflow into our savings and then establishing a means of divvying up that savings between an emergency fund, retirement, short term savings and long term (taxable) savings each month. Things are pretty much automated at this point, and I&#039;m thankful that so much of this information is available on the internet where I could access it for free. Now, if only I could convince her family that being frugal isn&#039;t being cheap...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We both are. :) He handles his own personal finances and calculating the groceries etc..

I handle my own finances and the rent (for now) and invoice him at the end of the month.

We don&#039;t combine our personal money at all, so whatever I track on my blog is just what I have. That being said, I am not worried about him not having cash AT ALL. The guy is a machine at saving...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was fun reading everyone&#039;s responses :)  Reminds me how much I love blogging - you never get this stuff out of people in &quot;real life!&quot;

@&lt;b&gt;jolie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah, there usually isn&#039;t &quot;Team CFOs&quot; around as much as we&#039;d like, but keep the dream alive!
@&lt;b&gt;Chris Haviaris&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you enjoyed it ;)  It&#039;s a fresh way to look at things I think.
@&lt;b&gt;momcents&lt;/b&gt; - Holy $hit, CONGRATS!  $100k+ out of debt?  That&#039;s incredible.  Wow, I&#039;m kinda afraid to ask how you all did it, haha....
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - Good idea!  It was just one of those press release kinda emails I get every day, but I just emailed him back and asked if it could be passed along to the author.  That would be fun to hear his thoughts :)
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, good for you!  Monthly is awesome, even we don&#039;t do that :) I like sharing it w/ the kids too, not many parents do that but I think learning how it all works &quot;in real life&quot; make it much easier to understand.
@&lt;b&gt;Brandon&lt;/b&gt; - YES!  Well done, sir!  It is scary, for sure, I remember that feeling myself when I first did it.  Bleh.  BUT now it can hopefully only go up, right? :)  You have to *know* what you&#039;re dealing with before you can start working on things - at least if you want to start tracking your progess.
@&lt;b&gt;B Simple&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly - BOTH parties should be aware of at least the overall situation in case something happens to one or the other (Scary!!!).  We try to &quot;meet&quot; at least once every other month to go over things a bit, but we need to be better about it too.  Great reminder.
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha....I hear that brother :)
@&lt;b&gt;FrugalGuy&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, looks like a bunch of us are in the same boat!
@&lt;b&gt;Kim&lt;/b&gt; - See that?  Way to take control!  Congrats on all your success so far, that is wonderful :)
@&lt;b&gt;John@FinancialElite&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I love that you have the exact date down.  Keep on knocking it out my man!!]]></description>
