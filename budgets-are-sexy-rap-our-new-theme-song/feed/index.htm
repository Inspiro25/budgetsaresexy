					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled on your site a few weeks ago, but I&#039;ve enjoyed catching up on your musings during that time.  This rap is hilarious!  I, like you, still have a love for hip-hop music that just won&#039;t fade away.  Btw the &quot;Making love with money is my favorite kind of romance&quot; line certifies this song as the jam. Nice production work D. Ninja.]]></description>
