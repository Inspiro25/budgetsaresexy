Not to mention... that author ended up going on to win a Nobel Prize for heuristics: the personal bias that influences every decision we make.  Awesome read, I highly recommend it to everyone.  I hadn’t even thought about applying it to finance, but you make a great argument for it.

YES!! Have you seen this car ad that went viral yet? 

This dude made a video of his girlfriend&#039;s &#039;96 Accord she has up for sale and it&#039;s gotten over 4 million views on youtube haha.. (and also messed up the ebay listing so they had to re-list it because people kept jacking up the purchase price too much :))

But this is pretty much you in that Camry!

BOOM!! And I bet a lot of that was from your own doing vs the stock market, yeah? That&#039;s exactly why that first $100k is the hardest - takes the most level of effort until you have enough for your worker bee dollars to take it from there!]]></description>

Oh man, I don&#039;t blame you. It&#039;s easy for people like us to say to stay in with decades still left in the game, but if retirement was right around the corner i&#039;m not sure what I would do either! I&#039;d like to think i&#039;d have the balls to ride it out, but would I really?

Just came across this post a few hours ago - pretty close to what you&#039;re talking about here and I bet it helps you!

					<description><![CDATA[Nice increase!  I&#039;m up almost $9,100 myself for October, a mix of the market and a big chunk of debt reduction.

Oh, and I drive a Toyota, too!  #98Camry]]></description>
