					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;d give the smartphone to my girlfriend -- we&#039;re actually on republic, but signed up before the moto X was released -- so we both have the defy XT.     it&#039;s not as good a phone (stuck on android 2.3, under 512mb of internal storage, and a bit on the slow side, not to mention a weak camera) so i would love to get a better one!     been on republic just over a year.]]></description>

I hope this contest is still going on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking forward to winning this phone/service to break away from the Verizon stranglehold on my family. There are lots of us and we need to be able to actually afford using the devices!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d have to use the Moto E myself for awhile. It is promoted as a &quot;flip-phone killer&quot; and may be hazardous to share with my in-laws until I have been trained in its care and feeding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d keep it for me for now as a proof of concept of RW to get my wife on board with saving serous money each month on RW. I&#039;d probably then have to give it to her so I could....test out the Moto X for myself lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would give it to my daughter. I am working on getting off of AT&#038;T because as a single mother, wasting money in any way, shape or form is just not an option. Unfortunately, my phone is in contract with them but my daughter&#039;s phone is not. I want to switch her over to Republic Wireless but can&#039;t afford the $99 for a phone, especially this time of year. And if my 14 year old daughter is happy with Republic Wireless, then I know I will be happy with it and switch over once my contract is up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would give the phone to myself: it&#039;s my birthday soon! We&#039;ve been using Republic Wireless for my daughter for about a month now, and we love their service. I&#039;m definitely switching next month and need a phone. It&#039;ll be nice to have a real smartphone instead of my only-slightly-better-than-tin-can-and-string dumb phone.]]></description>
