I can&#039;t wait to play this game with my kids!  A friend of mine did this a while back, with a little twist... every second Sunday they needed to *donate* an item, instead of selling it. Watching kids part with their toys and get nothing in return is sad, but boy does it teach them how to give :)

Would love to hear how much you end up making when the month is up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our family started a challenge this month where each family member has to find one thing (every day) to either donate, sell, or trash. My son is thirteen and is making money selling toys he no longer wants - watching the light go on for him when the cash comes in is funny.  He&#039;s now trying to sell almost everything he owns to raise money for a gaming PC.  It&#039;s two lessons in one; 1) we have way more than we need; and 2) it&#039;s better to save cash for the things you really want. ;-)]]></description>

I think the trick to eBay is good research. Before I list anything, I search around to see the approx $ that something might sell for. That&#039;s how I gauge how much time I should put in, and how thorough I should be creating the listing.  For stuff I just want out of the house, it&#039;s timing that matters more than money. I&#039;ll take $40 right now vs. $60 and have it sit for 2 weeks. I just want stuff gone.  BUT, for these fancy figurines and collectables, it&#039;s probably worth taking your time to get good photos, good lighting, and researching similar listings to see what you can expect.

That&#039;s AWESOME about your savings rate and after-tax brokerage. It&#039;s great to know you have access before official retirement age and can leave the taxed advantaged stuff sit longer.]]></description>

Happy Friday Fiona!  Well, I&#039;d like to take credit, but the truth is it&#039;s our investments that are carrying us higher each month. We might contribute a couple thousand personally each month, but the biggest growth comes from existing assets :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Big moves -- congratulations on the opportunity! Got any tips for eBaying junk? My mom had quite the collection of random never-seen-the-light-of-day crap when she died, and dad has spent the last five years trying to make it go away...

After realizing we may well have over-funded our tax-advantaged savings, we throttled that back and started pumping money two weeks ago into a brokerage account. If we can maintain our savings rate from the last month or two, that&#039;ll be a nice cushion to draw down from age 48ish to 59.5. It&#039;s been crummy watching ESGV plummet over that span; good thing we won&#039;t need it for at least half a dozen years.]]></description>
