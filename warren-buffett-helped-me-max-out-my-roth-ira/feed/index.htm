					<description><![CDATA[Why BRK/B and KO?  BRK/B has a good portion allocated to KO. No?

I bought BRK/B right after the split - went up by a decent amount since then.  Too scared to get into banking stocks yet!  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw this article saying Warren Buffett has not generated any alpha in 10 years:

Warren Buffett&#039;s Alpha and Returns

Does this make sense to you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[haha, I love that you stated that the reason for this was to have fun!  I agree with you that this is a fun thing to do.  The funny thing about it is that a lot of other people will not only have no idea WHAT you are talking about, but even if they did, they&#039;d think you were crazy and boring lol.... Ahh the life of a PF blogger :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[nice article. i would prefer to own dividend aristocrats or companies that gives out dividends.

it forms your passive income cashflow and helps create a consistent stream of income.

companies such as MCD, JNJ and my current purchase TEF &#062;&#062; http://www.investmentmoats.com/money-management/dividend-investing/bought-telefonica-adr-tefundervalued-dividend-income-stock/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Kira&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, I sure did!  I actually converted all our random Roths and Traditionals all over the place into 2 sturdy Brokerage Roths at USAA :)  One for me, and one for the wifey.  I know the trade prices may be a cple dollars more than other places like E*Trade, Scottrade, etc, (I think it&#039;s $11.95 to buy or sell) but as I only make a few trades a year I find the convenience is well worth it.  Plus I never get pissed off at USAA ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Samurai&lt;/b&gt; - Will do a much better job than I would ;)  Btw, enjoyed your guest post today.  Always fun reading about blogging businesses!
@&lt;b&gt;kt- lifedividend&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, it&#039;s all good!  I like all comments here - even the tough ones - cuz it gets us to think and start more convos :)  And I think you&#039;re partially right on that one - there are thousands who make moves based on what Buffett and his team do, so it&#039;s certainly something to watch out for.  In a perfect world I&#039;d spend an hour or two a day researching and coming up with my own ideas of what&#039;s hot or not, but I&#039;d much rather spend my time doing other things (like blogging, working on my side hustles, etc etc).  So I&#039;ll gladly take what comes to me by riding on his coattails. I seriously doubt I could do better.]]></description>
