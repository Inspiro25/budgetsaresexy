					<description><![CDATA[Holy crap, this is a HUGE database of car information! haha...thanks for sharing everyone! I can&#039;t respond to everyone here, but it was a pleasure reading through all these :)  Here are few shout outs:

@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle, Brian, Trina, Shelley, Brian&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks!  I was just told it was a &quot;piece of $hit&quot; by a friend ;)  But hey, as long as the owners love it who cares, right?
@&lt;b&gt;sarah oneill&lt;/b&gt; - Your husband is a car dealership manager? AWESOME!!!  I&#039;d be in a lot of trouble too if either I or my wife worked at one...glad you&#039;re calming things down a bit now - 1 a year is insane.  But I&#039;m guessing you got the hook up like crazy ;)  Ooooh, wait a second.  If I were to drive out there would your man hook me up too?  Is it a Benz dealership? haha....
@&lt;b&gt;bestmommy&lt;/b&gt; - The Escalade is still in my Top 3 cars to own one day - Enjoy it! :)  Esp if you blinged it out...
@&lt;b&gt;Stacey&lt;/b&gt; - 0% interest is where it&#039;s at.  unless it gets you to spend even more than you wanted...hate when that happens.
@&lt;b&gt;Steveoismynameo&lt;/b&gt; - Well done, sir.  Def. makes more sense.
@&lt;b&gt;Brian Drolet&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ve been eyeing a motorcyle too actually, but I doubt I&#039;ll pull the trigger anytime soon...it&#039;s already been 3 years now since I&#039;ve started thinking of it :)  and that&#039;s WITH my dad already owning one!  but if my bro picks one up, I might be in trouble.
@&lt;b&gt;Shannon&lt;/b&gt; - OOoooh really?  I haven&#039;t thought about the VIP service like that, thanks for the insight!  You better have my back here on the blog when I blog about it one day ;)  I&#039;m gonna get some haters for sure...
@&lt;b&gt;Claudia&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s a great question and I have noooo idea when you cut your losses.  I think it&#039;s just a matter of what feels good to you and what you prefer in each instance.  I could tell you that if I were driving long distance to work every day I&#039;d have DEF gotten that Benz by now...safety/reliability becomes even more important then.
@&lt;b&gt;Anysa&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m here for you, baby ;)  thanks for reading!
@&lt;b&gt;Yana&lt;/b&gt; - Tapering windows?  haha...never heard of that one before.
@&lt;b&gt;Jen&lt;/b&gt; - YES yes YES.  I always miss my older car for sure. I mean, it&#039;s hard not to after spending so much quality time with them, right?  In fact, 2 cars ago I had the EXACT same Cadillac I do now except it was black.  Then It died and I got that Highlander, which was fine, but when I saw this Red Caddy I got all nostalgic again and said F it - I&#039;m going back!  And now here we are one happy family again :)  So yes, missing your old cars def. come into play.  Unless it was just junk and pissed you off.
@&lt;b&gt;Tom&lt;/b&gt; - Hah!  I did NOT see that coming when you started listing out those first 2 fancy pants cars - good one :)  I guess it is good we grow up like that, but sometimes I wish we didn&#039;t....growing up can get boring.
@&lt;b&gt;Your Mogul&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;Brand new cars are soooo 1990s.&quot;  haha...good one.
@&lt;b&gt;Heather&lt;/b&gt; - Oooooh...RDXs are smooth as hell.  really REALLY like those guys, but you&#039;re right it comes along with a pretty hefty price tag....the price of V.I.P.! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Manny&lt;/b&gt; - No doubt, the amount you drive around is a big factor.
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - You are tempting me!!! You devil...in a good way :)
@&lt;b&gt;Meg&lt;/b&gt; - I just had to Google that Cosworth car....never heard of, but would love to test drive one to see what the fuss is about! I always base my opinions on the way cars look over anything else, haha...once i *drive* one though it usually changes my idea REAL fast...for the good and the bad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The comments here are almost way more interesting than the post itself, ha... So funny to read how many people have SUV&#039;s and *had* to have them. (Don&#039;t give me your paltry excuses, you CAN get by without them, what do you think Europeans do?!?! Waste of space IMO.) Then again, Americans don&#039;t get the awesome assortment of wagons to choose from that Europe &#038; Japan does, because everyone would rather buy giant SUV&#039;s and be afraid of wagons and hatchbacks.

Then again, the hubs and I are those annoying &quot;rich&quot; sports car driving folk. With NO car payments and NO annoying kiddos to think about. My oldest is 20 years old this year, the middle &quot;child&quot; is 13 and our youngest is going to be nine. They eat a good part of the budget every month, because we want them to and they&#039;re pretty much our *only* hobby. Car spending comes first! :)

Though today... I was tempted to want a $23k loan to buy the 1994 Ford Escort RS Cosworth I was shown.... I want that Cosworth something awful, haha! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I drive a 2007 Mazda3 that will be 4 years old this summer and still runs great.  I&#039;m fortunate enough not to have a payment, so I put away money each month with the goal that I can pay cash when I need to buy my next vehicle.  And I hope that won&#039;t be for another 4-6 years, at least!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zero. Hooray for public transportation.

I used to have a Honda Accord that I paid about $300 for.  It got totalled in an accident and I got the retail value paid to me.  I made a little extra after I paid back my loan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2001 Rodeo with 155,000 miles and 2006 Ascender w/ 57,000 miles. Bought the Ascender last summer w/ 38,000 for $7700 with a swipe of the credit card that was paid off the next billing statement. 

The frustrating thing is that I have collision insurance for the Ascender (extra $40 per month). Maybe in 4 years when that isn&#039;t worth anything I&#039;ll drop the insurance.

I didn&#039;t want to pay much as I thought that maybe my next car would be electric.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have a 2001 Acura CL Type S and a 2005 Acura RSX both bought new and paid off.  Kind of expensive cars but they have served us well and I anticipate a decent resale value if we ever decide to get rid of them.  The only thing I dislike about these cars is that I feel like I have to spend a lot on maintaining them.  As for a new C300, I would highly recommend it.  The experience of luxury service when you own a luxury car surprised me.  They really kiss your butt to make sure you buy another car from them.  Don&#039;t underestimate the resale value of a luxury car either, unless you get a totally screwed up deal.  I&#039;m constantly surprised when people make offers to buy my cars as I&#039;m sure many want to buy your sweet Caddy.  Always difficult to balance saving and spending but life is truly too short to be so miserly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t want to spend on the car I do have either!  We&#039;re sharing the little Cobalt while we finish off the Dave Ramsey plan, and we&#039;re hoping the pain of that will keep us highly motivated.  4 people, rolling in a Cobalt, and one of those people is 6&#039;4&quot; (me).  So, we are suffering for our debt free dream.  Love the Caddy pics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes other factors would dictate how often you should change cars. If your lifestyle and work demands a lot of traveling, then the dependability of your car can be a crucial factor. Being late to a very important business appointment can wipe out the savings you have kept from not buying a brand new car. Plus, the peace of mind that you have knowing that your car won&#039;t bog down on you that easily can be priceless. But I guess different people have different priorities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s amazing how much money is lost to vehicle depreciation and to interest charges.  If you add those costs up over a 40 year period, it&#039;s staggering to think what you could have done with all of that money and how much interest you could have earned if you saved/invested it.]]></description>
