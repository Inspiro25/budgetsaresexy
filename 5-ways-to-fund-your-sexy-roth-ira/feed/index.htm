Hey Adam! Yeah, I read some of this too about penalty free withdrawals... One other note I found is how the IRS defines &quot;first time homebuyer&quot; very loosely...    &quot;You are considered a first-timer if you (and your spouse, if you have one) haven&#039;t owned a home at &lt;strong&gt;any point during the last two years&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. Apparently!]]></description>

My friend made that mistake recently too. It&#039;s quite common actually, to fund an account and then not *invest* the money inside.  We are all learning - even the experts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After maxing out our 401(k)s, we funded our backdoor roth IRAs. An interesting feature about roth IRAs is that 5 years after your first contribution you can withdraw $10,000 of EARNINGS free of penalty to fund a 1st time home purchase. 

Whether that makes sense, is a personal decision. But an interesting feature nonetheless.]]></description>

Hey Chris! I can&#039;t give you specific investment advice -- but I can tell you what I am doing with my Roths!...  My wife and I invest in a total stock market index fund. This gives us exposure to every publicly traded company, with very little management fees. Our return is exactly in line with what the overall market returns each year, which in the long run is good.

E-trade have a bunch of online resources to learn more about index funds, and their customer service team might have a financial advice arm to help you choose the best fund to invest in. Good luck and keep funding the Roths!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/5-ways-to-fund-your-sexy-roth-ira/#comment-330298&quot;&gt;David @ Filled With Money&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey David! The income limit is actually based on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;MAGI&lt;/a&gt;, which is your AGI with some deductions added back in. Kind of a weird calculation, everyone&#039;s situation is a little different.

If you&#039;ve got a high income (and high savings rate), then you&#039;ve already got a major headstart on the FIRE path anyway. Roths are awesome, but not being able to easily contribute to one is a good problem to have :)]]></description>

Great to hear you&#039;re thinking ahead. It will really pay off.

It&#039;s easy to think of conversion ladders in equal amounts, in a straight line. But in reality each year brings different changes and opportunities for tax planning. Some years might be good for conversions, and others maybe just small bits of cap gains harvesting in your taxable account.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would LOVE to contribute to a Roth IRA. Once I found out that it actually has income limits, it actually turned me off to it at the complexity of it. Does your gross income count? Or does your gross income minus tax advantaged accounts contribution counts? 

It just became so complicated that I haven&#039;t funded a Roth IRA though I know I need to. I wish I got into the habit when I was in college when my income wasn&#039;t that high anyway.]]></description>
