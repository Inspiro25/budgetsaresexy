Yep, it doesn&#039;t matter how solid the project is... If it&#039;s run by people you don&#039;t trust, it&#039;s probably not going to feel great or end well.  Have a great week Fiona!]]></description>

Hey David, typically people invest in syndications because they believe the return is actually gonna be higher than SP500. If they are taking on more risk, they expect more return. For my fake deal (and keep in mind again all syndication structures have different payout schedules, etc), but for the deal i wrote about you&#039;d get a 7.2% annual dividend *plus* double your capital in growth. So average annualized return would be like 20%+.   I agree with you - if the return was equal, there&#039;s no reason to take on the extra risk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know there are reputable syndication websites that offer real estate syndication opportunities that the average investor might not have access to. However, every time I think about it, why not just put the money into the S&#038;P 500? I get the diversification but a 7.2% annual return is still a 7.2% annual return whether you get it in RE or S&#038;P 500. 

Have to wrap my head around it sometime. Maybe one day I&#039;ll invest in a Real Estate syndicated deal!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy Monday Joel!

Thanks for sharing this article - I thought it was pretty cool to walk through your example. Honestly, you make such a good point when you say that it&#039;s important to invest with like-minded people. You have to build a winning team around yourself, so make sure you network beforehand and know who you will be dealing with before financially committing. 

Cheers!
