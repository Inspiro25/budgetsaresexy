					<description><![CDATA[Hot take: I would imagine these three would at least make a decent user interface and smooth customer experience, something I have struggled with in the banks I have worked with thus far (both credit unions). And I might trust them more if, unlike most banks today, they were required to be completed divested from investment banking, a measure put in place after the crash of 29, but eliminated before the recession of 08. 

I would see them more likely to get involved on the UX side of banking - not necessarily being the bank but designing an API that interfaces with banks. And I should point out that Amazon already has Amazon Payments, and I would say those types of services are more likely where they will invest their time and resources.]]></description>

Thanks for your explanation about the &quot;s&quot; in the HTTP part of the domain name J.

I appreciate reading your articles and how you take the time to respond.  I don&#039;t think it is possible for you or any blogger to respond to all comments.  But you do a darn good job on your response rate, and it feels very special when I receive a personal response.  :)

By the way, I don&#039;t expect a reply to this comment.  I know you are busy.  Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you and the work you do.  

Enjoy your weekend.]]></description>

Yeah, it&#039;s because I don&#039;t have an &quot;s&quot; there in the HTTP part of the domain which a lot of places are starting to go towards now... We probably will at some point, but for now afraid of it breaking the site and nothing working so might be a bit longer until we keep up with the times :) Thanks for the heads up though! And I agree with your social media assessment here!

Also realizing this is more true and true as the years go by - &quot;I have learned to not say, never, because things are constantly changing, as am I.&quot; Well put.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As usual, another good article J. 

I have learned to not say, never, because things are constantly changing, as am I.  So, while I prefer my privacy and think that these companies know too much about us already who knows where things will be in the future.  But, I hope we do not come to that.

Right now, though, I would say, no to all of them.  They have too much power as it is.  Unless something changes I see no reason to leave the companies that are working just fine for my needs.

On a different note, I don&#039;t know much about how computer or browsers work, so this might mean something or nothing.  Hope it helps.

I got to this article by first opening your message in my gmail email account in the Chrome browser.  I then clicked on the article to read it &#038; comments in full from your blog.  After composing my response and as I was about to hit &quot;Submit&quot; I noticed up at the top left of the url the following words in red font, &quot;Not secure.&quot;  

I then opened the article in a new tab, still in Chrome.  Same thing happened.  

I decided to see if the same thing would happen in another browser, Edge.  It did not.  So, I figured it must be safe to submit my comments from Edge.  

Take care.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First time, long time. 

When I was able to handle the property management aspect of being a landlord and had a tenant I could trust, we actually used Facebook Messenger&#039;s payment system. It&#039;s pretty similar to Venmo. 

Google Pay isn&#039;t too far off either. 

You could argue that with as prevalent as Amazon is in...well, everything, that Amazon gift cards are almost a form of currency at this point.]]></description>
