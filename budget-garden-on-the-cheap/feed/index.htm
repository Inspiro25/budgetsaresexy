					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Erin85&lt;/b&gt; - Ack! That&#039;s what I&#039;m afraid of actually!  Even though it&#039;s now been about a month - and things are looking good still! - my fear is that all the rain we&#039;re getting will overdue it outside of my control :(  But the fact I&#039;m still on top of things here after an entire month is a new world record for me, so that&#039;s gotta count for something ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Holly@ClubThrifty&lt;/b&gt; - You just need a good mentor to walk you through it and help out!  It really wasn&#039;t that hard at all when we were going through the process. And when you&#039;re with a friend (or mom, in this case! haha...) it&#039;s also kinda fun :)  I&#039;d be pretty bored doing it alone.
@&lt;b&gt;stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, that&#039;s a good idea! Never even heard of those before.  If we end up living here more than I want to, then I&#039;ll for sure check &#039;em out, thanks :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Hahaha.... I want some pumpkin plants!!! Fall is right around the corner - my favorite season!
@&lt;b&gt;AverageJoe&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! You totally should too - it&#039;s great for bonding :)
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - I try ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Anthony Mignone&lt;/b&gt; - I would love to do that next actually, but I think we&#039;re gonna try moving soon and I&#039;m not ready to up my game to that level yet ;)  Maybe our next place will already have one built in that I can just maintain and keep going?  That would be pretty cool.
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - WOW. Nicely done my man - that IS huge! Haha... Love it :)
@&lt;b&gt;Stephanie&lt;/b&gt; - Ooooh that would be fun!  I love blueberries!!  And actually one of the bigger plants we put on our back deck was a rose bush - which I think is doing okay still, but sometimes I do wonder if it&#039;s half-dead too, haha... they&#039;r def. strange.
@&lt;b&gt;DebtKiller&lt;/b&gt; - Oh man, I don&#039;t have the patience for it to actually make some bucks off it, but I&#039;m all about paying someone else to work it for sure!  I&#039;ve never looked into it before, but I always think it&#039;s gonna be crazy expensive... maybe if you marketed yourself as a &quot;budget gardener&quot; you could capture a good niche there outside of the more fancy stuff?
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Or maybe you can find a way to get on that HGTV show where they come over and rock the whole thing for you free of charge ;)  At least I think it&#039;s free?
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME!!! I really admire people who can pull that off - especially if they end up making a side income from it :)  Way to work it, bro! Def. some major skills going on over there.
@&lt;b&gt;Manette @ Barbara Friedberg Personal Finance&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! Although do I still deserve credit if that was the last thing on my mind while making it? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, haha... don&#039;t go and confuse me now! ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Money After Graduation&lt;/b&gt; - Yay!  And then take pictures so we can see it on your blog :)
@&lt;b&gt;Joe@Igotouttadebt.com&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks man, glad you enjoyed it :)  Do you know any friends or family members that are good at this stuff? I&#039;d just invite them over for some lunch or dinner (or beers?) and then put them to work! Haha... it&#039;s actually pretty fun when you&#039;re just hanging out and chatting at the same time as gardening.
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa@LittleHouseInTheValley&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo!  A hearty congrats to you too, then :)
@&lt;b&gt;Downundersugarglider&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool! I have no idea about what we have, or don&#039;t have here, but leaving them alone to their own devices seems mighty perfect to me :) Thanks for stopping by, mate (sorry, couldn&#039;t resist).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[great idea - as you say definitely improves the curb appeal. If you want something unkillable try liriopes, mondo grass  - will fill out the bed, live for years, no maintenance (unless you have drought - then give them some water) easy to remove if you eventually want to. In Australia we have a native violet ground cover that is pretty good too - don&#039;t know if you would have similar - with little teeny purple and white violet flowers! Again - just leave them to their own devices.]]></description>

I also suck at gardening, but this year we grew a vegetable garden and though the cucumbers and squash succumbed to beetles, we are getting green peppers and lost of cherry tomatoes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can you send your mother to us?  :)

We&#039;ve talked and talked (well, my wife talked and I kinda listened) about landscaping the front and doing &quot;something&quot; with the back.  This might be the inspiration we need.  It&#039;s much like anything else in life, get a vision, make a budget execute. And sometimes, you need someone to pull you by the ears (or a wake up call) to make it happen.

Great article]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking as a former horticulture professional, I&#039;m always happy when I hear that someone is taking up one of my favorite hobbies.
And just to throw you up, there is a third class besides annuals and perennials. Biennials are usually classified as perennials, but they only last 2 years. Most biennials grow and look the best in their second year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether you spent hundreds or thousands of dollars, it will always be a money well spent. Creating a greener environment and helping reduce carbon footprints in our own little way is already a great step for a better environment. Congratulations for taking that first step!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know absolutely nothing about flowers.  When my mom was teaching me (it must be one of those mother-son bonding things) she kept talking about all these pretty flowers she could plant.  I only cared about food.  I loooove to tend to my garden because it GIVES ME SUSTENANCE!  I also grow herbs for cooking.  I haven&#039;t bought tomatoes all summer, have more butternut squash than will fit in my freezer, and a variable jungle of lettuce spewing out of the ground.  We also have zucchini, okra, cucumbers, jalepenos, and green chiles.  I end up saving a lot of money on produce.  That being said, we expanded our garden to border our fence around our yard.  We spent a whopping $300 on soil alone.  We aren&#039;t even done, but we are looking at about $1000 on just the garden area.  Next year we will be selling what we grow to neighbors and coworkers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love it!  Want to come do my house next?

Definitely hoping on sprucing up my front yard next spring (hopefully all the ugly bushes will be dead by then).  I&#039;d like to have the backyard taken care of as well, I just need my neighbor to take care of those black berry bushes - brutal!]]></description>
