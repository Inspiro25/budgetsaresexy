We do go to the beach all the time! The kids and I go mostly in the summer and fall. My husband jumps in the ocean everyday that he can when it’s warm. 

We used to do more tourist things when the kids were smaller, but not so much now. We do eat out quite a bit because the food is great!  We just sold our boat because Bill didn’t want to maintain it anymore, so we no longer have that expense. 

I will say that teenagers are more expensive in general and we probably spend more than what the spreadsheet says now. But those will go back down once the kids graduate from college.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on your success! Do you find yourself actually going to the beach regularly now that you live there? Also, do you find yourself doing many of the same things that tourists do now that you live there?  In other words, are your baseline expenses higher (outside of taxes, housing costs, etc.) simply due to going out to eat more (restaurants are plentiful and good), renting (or buying and storing) boats, and doing other touristy-type things?]]></description>

Thank you! It just goes to show you how consistent investments over the years CAN work for retirement. You just have to do it all the time. We love the life we created here at the beach!]]></description>

I think our current expenses might be a bit higher with two teenagers in the house and a driver added on to our insurance policy. Either way, we should be able to retire early or like J$ said, FAT FIRE!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a journey indeed! This is encouraging to readers that if you don&#039;t like your life right now, you can change it and it will turn out ok. Maybe not at first, maybe your family will discourage you, but you&#039;ve got to be excited getting out of bed in the morning, and I love this life they&#039;ve created for themselves!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome share and great work to Kristy and family. 

Quick question about the difference between needing $2.5m to retire and hitting E.R. at 58, when anticipated net worth is north of $5.3m.

It would seem, based on looking at the figures in the spreadsheet, that they would hit E.R. by 50. What am I missing? 

Thanks!]]></description>
