Thanks so much!  Those daily reminders are great! (And naphill sounds like a cool rapper, not a cranky old man. Makes me feel cool! ;)]]></description>

oooooh yes please!!!! to both Nashville and opening up a cool bookstore like that one! just watched part of their promo video - crazy that every single book there was read or picked out specifically by someone who works there! There are thousands!!

Napoleon Hill is a pimp too - I agree. Have you ever signed up to get his daily emails? They come from his foundation and are always something quick to think on before starting the day. You can sign up here if you want (it&#039;s free): http://www.naphill.org/]]></description>

YES! Exactly!! It really comes down to a few simple &quot;treat others how you&#039;d like to be treated yourself&quot; type mantras. Would be great if people actually followed them!]]></description>

Well, don&#039;t pat me on the back too much over there - as you you&#039;ll soon see, the pages are written as if a 5 year old was reading it :) Pretty short with enlarged lettering!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds interesting. I&#039;ll add this one to my book list. 

And hey, for a guy who doesn&#039;t tend to read all that many books, you managed to get through half of that...while on vacation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s amazing how poorly most managers are at actually managing. After just a few years in the working world, it seems pretty obvious how you should and shouldn&#039;t manage people, yet so many struggle with it.
This book sounds like a good reminder of some basic management strategies. I&#039;m glad the author kept is short rather than trying to stretch it into a lengthy tome.]]></description>
