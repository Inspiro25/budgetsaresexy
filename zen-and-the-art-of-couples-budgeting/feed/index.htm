					<description><![CDATA[This article is perfect and touched on all my reservations about joining finances with my husband.  I&#039;ve tried it the other way in a previous marriage and that is one of the top reasons for our divorce.  Great article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your ideas. In my case, though, it wouldn&#039;t work because my partner and I are prepetual &quot;startup&quot; people. Sometimes I&#039;m working for money while he&#039;s putting in long, unpaid hours at a startup that&#039;s not yet producing any income, and sometimes those roles are reversed. We&#039;d ideally like to split money in the way that you described, but through most of our relationship, only one of the two of us is making money, while the other one is taking on some risky entrepreneurial venture.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the guest post, Gene :)  Obviously I agree 100% with your setup, haha... I hadn&#039;t blogged about it in a while though so it was a great opportunity to continue sharing the ideas!  Appreciate all the responses you&#039;ve given too to everyone - that means a lot and really helps me out.  Thanks man.  You def. went into way better detail &amp; explanation than I did back in the day :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post!  For dual breadwinners, I totally side with the agreed percentage or contribution into a joint account (to take care of househould expenses) while individual accounts for personal cash allowance.  Great way to handle business while still remaining a financial individual in the relationship]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never understood the whole concept of an allowance, mad money, personal/private spending etc.  Maybe it&#039;s because we&#039;re so similar in our spending and both have a lazer like focus on early early retirement with travel being our only exception to the normal extreme saver mentality.  I can&#039;t think of anything I would buy that I would feel the need to justify to my husband and vice versa.  If we each set aside designated spending money it would probably just pile up unspent in different accounts rather than being combined and put to work immediately as an extra mortgage payment or another contribution to our retirement accounts.  If one of us wants something nonessential the money will be there in the joint account, why hoard it off privately just in case something catches my eye?  Why would we make double the work of maintaining two sets of accounts and spreadsheets when one is simpler? Why would we each separately make transfers to our retirement accounts instead of having all the excess funds pile up in our main joint account where it is cleared out weekly and invested as a single transaction?  Maybe other folks spend a lot on stuff their partner finds wasteful or frivolous and it&#039;s less painful if you don&#039;t have to &quot;see&quot; that.  I suspect budgetting for miscellaneous spending is precisely what leads to miscellaneous spending.
I hope all those that have separate finances are at least planning jointly for their retirements. It would be a real shocker to find out decades later that one of you was saving more and is ready to retire at 50 and the other was spending their discretionary money on crap and will never be financially ready to retire. 

I have to disagree with the description that the combined money folks are &quot;living in the moment&quot;. It&#039;s exactly because we want to travel now and are also saving so intensively for our future early retirement that the combined finances works so well for us.  No hidden, unexplained spending tends to mean we maximize our combined savings.  Every week after the pay is in and the bills are paid, the excess is skimmed off and invested (we do keep a $1k minimum to avoid bank charges and have easily accessable emergency funds).  A combination of decent incomes and frugal living means we can cover the bare essentials on 55-60% of our income. There will be excess again next week so nobody feels the need to &quot;spend it quickly&quot; before it&#039;s gone. If we do spend on nonessentials one week, there is just less or even no excess on Friday to transfer out.  No harm, no foul, no finger pointing. We both know the purchase was carefully considered by whichever of us made it.  If we have a car replacement or major trip on the horizon, we just stop skimming off the excess and let it pile up for the required number of weeks/months and then make the purchase with cash. It&#039;s tagged for a purpose and neither of us feels the need to spend any differently than if it wasn&#039;t sitting there. Maybe we&#039;re completely weird, but it works for us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ RamblingsFromMyMessy Desk
At least being single means fewer confrontations over spending money (assuming your accountant isn’t aggressive).  :)

@Jake
I’m not sure what the source of your sarcasm is.  I’ll cop to being personally biased towards the solution that worked for my situation.  The point of the post was to describe what worked for us and how we came up with it.  But I thought I made it clear that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.
I would agree with the author (of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance) that using both ways of viewing the world will benefit you.  I’m a nuts and bolts guy with my finances.  But I totally get the live-in-the-moment perspective.  That’s what I aspire to while riding my motorcycle through the curves.  It almost becomes a meditative state when you’re not consciously considering every individual aspect of riding through the turns, but taking in the whole experience at once.  Living in the moment is awesome.  If you hear riders talk about being “in the groove” or “zone” that’s what they’re talking about.

@Jeff Bell
That Chext service sounds interesting.  We went the hard way and made a spreadsheet budget (my link is in the comments section of the Budget Templates) that does some of that.  It forecasts my bank account balance into the future and shows what I’ll have when the bills come in.  It was difficult to set up, but runs like a dream.  I just check it every couple of weeks and make sure everything&#039;s good.
I find that it’s easier having a separate account for budgeted items (whether you pool resources or not).  I put what I know I’ll need in the budget account so my bills and goals are met.  Then the discretionary $$ goes into a separate account for things like morning coffee.  I could spend down my discretionary account if I wanted to and still know that everything in my budget is covered from the other account.

@Jenna
I’m glad you enjoyed it. It always comes back to doing what works.  
It’s ironic – the most important part of a relationship is communication.  Yet no four words in the English language can strike terror in a guy’s heart like “We need to talk.” :)

@Stephanie
It’s good to discuss issues before they get big.  
Having a separate account for each of us made it much easier to balance our budget account.  Sometimes I would go a couple of weeks without balancing, spend a half hour or so and it would be done.

@Jen@Master the Art of Saving
Good  method.  An ounce of communication is worth a pound of marriage counseling. 

@Mistress Susan
I’ve heard of couples splitting it up like that.  If that works for both that’s all that matters.  

@Matalie@Mango
Depending on how they are raised, people can have a variety of hot button issues.  Money is certainly one of the more important ones.
I’ll have to check out your site’s interpretation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The money thing is always tricky in relationships. It&#039;s funny, you can get along with someone just swimmingly in all aspects-- until it comes to money. People are funny about money. I like your take on the two money personalities.
 I work for Mango Money&#039;s blog and we recently did a guest post on Living Richly on a Budget about money personalities in relationships, too; but we had them broken down a bit further. No matter what money personality you do have, though, it&#039;s important to figure out a way to make it work with your partner&#039;s. 
Check out our infographic for a more visual representation. Might help you all out! http://www.livingrichlyonabudget.com/whats-your-money-style]]></description>
