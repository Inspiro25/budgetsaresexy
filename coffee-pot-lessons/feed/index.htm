					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like one of the reasons I bought a Jetski. Hey, it&#039;s cool looking and red!  It can also go 80mph on the water!  Well, years later, I realized I was an idiot! Oh well, teaching moment!]]></description>

I&#039;m so sad I wasn&#039;t around last time this happened. Sharpie on one of a D&#039;s undershirts has the same effect, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your rules. Pawning off things on your other half is a great rule. I don&#039;t have an other have right now so I just harass friends to make sure I am not making stupid decisions. I think if I carried your pic in my wallet my caregiver might have me checked out at the doctors.lol. But that might make it all worth it]]></description>

Yeah, was just going to suggest this! From eBay to Craigslist, I&#039;ve sold all sorts of &quot;broken&quot; appliances and goods. Heck, I had a five-year-old, used, broken Kindle on Amazon, and still got $40! Haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So(oooooooooooo) true! I remember when hubby and I were on warm weather vacation and the hotel was speckled with &quot;spa water.&quot; You know, beauuuutiful water dispensers full of ice cold fruit essence water. Oh the varieties. Water infused with fresh cucumber and basil, or watermelon, or oranges, or limes and grapefruit. No plain lemon here! We sipped and sipped all day long every day feeling like the toxins were exiting our bodies with every sip.

We couldn&#039;t stop talking about it when we got home and since it was warm we decided we NEEDED a dispenser so we too could make this nectar of the gods. Yes, a plain old plastic water pitcher like the one we had would accomplish the same thing, but the GLASS DISPENSER was just so damned beautiful. Don&#039;t you know it&#039;s what made the elixir work? :)

We thought ourselves so clever buying it on sale at a deep discount. And we did use it every single day. That summer. Two years later we bring it out each summer when we do the house change out, and we haven&#039;t water essenced again. LOL

I think the enjoyment we got out of it that summer was worth the price. If it broke, I HOPE I&#039;d be strong enough not to replace. Might have to carry that picture of you in my wallet if that happened. ;)]]></description>
