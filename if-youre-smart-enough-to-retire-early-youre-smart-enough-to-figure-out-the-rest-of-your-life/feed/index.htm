It is all about the journey though... But the end &quot;FIRE&quot; is really just a milestone, midpoint really, in the journey. I guess the end is... Well, I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s even the end.]]></description>

Haha that is very true too - we tend to get pretty one-sided here in the $$$ world, especially the FIRE crew ;) So point well taken! (And good for you for just doing YOU!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I respectfully listen to others even if their plans are not my plans. I am not working towards FIRE but I like to see what others will do. I have found some FIRE folks don&#039;t understand that I am not working towards FIRE. They think I am crazy not try to leave a job I love and a pension. Also I have found some  to be very judgmental that I love my nice car and I won&#039;t ride a bike on my 64 miles round trip commute, but everyone has their opinion. Let&#039;s agree to disagree.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even if you ignored that the $1.9M is invested, and not just sitting in a savings account, a reasonable person could slowly live off that for a long time! Spending $50K a year allows that to last for 38 years. Plenty of time to notice if you have a &quot;retirement&quot;/money problem.]]></description>

I agree you can&#039;t go around a party talking about how much you make, but that&#039;s exactly why we have this community here - so you can talk openly about money to people who actually *care* :) And with real #&#039;s too which you def. don&#039;t get anywhere else.

But yes - you can certainly overdo it and &quot;forget&quot; to share all the failures as well as a blogger, so we def. need to be better about that in our community. And you&#039;re also right that our space here is getting filled up pretty fast with people just trying to make $$$$ vs actually being passionate about spreading the good word... Which is pretty funny since blogging is NOT the fastest way to make money, haha... even with powerful stories! (That are hopefully true :))

So yeah - there&#039;s def. room for improvement here, but if you had to pick a place to openly discuss money without feeling ridiculed (usually), I feel like our community here is a safe bet. And most people are genuinely trying to motivate others than boast, so it&#039;s unfortunate that it does come across that way at times.]]></description>

YES! True! Nothing says we can&#039;t ever go back to work once retired! Just like anyone who retires around a normal age!]]></description>

&quot;You know why? Because they’ve got enough money that they never have to deal with that sort of negativity again. :)&quot; - hah! good point!]]></description>
