					<description><![CDATA[I believe it highly depends on the business. But you shouldn&#039;t get carried away with lying like the US banks did back in 2008, or it will hurt you. A good consensus is always good!]]></description>

Good for her! Better to set expectations straight from the beginning, ESPECIALLY if it&#039;s a friend or co-worker!]]></description>

I know, right?? I used to battle my bosses all the time when doing customer service and they hated me for it, but they did eventually understand it was good for overall business (and just good overall in life, too). They then promoted me to manager where I told all my customers I was on *their* side which is really how it should be. Customer service is FOR THE CUSTOMERS even though it&#039;s on behalf of a business. At least that&#039;s the route I went and I can promise you it didn&#039;t hurt :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once had a call from a customer who had the problem of low hot water pressure.  After some questioning on the issue I have him my thoughts, &quot;The hot water coil on your boiler has likely scaled over.&quot;  I then proceeded to tell him the coil can be flushed out however I do not have the equipment so I sent him else where.  Was that the right choice?  I believe so.]]></description>
