					<description><![CDATA[Great points J.Money. They’re especially relevant given the financial crisis that the megabanks are pretty much responsible for getting us into. They all need to take a step back and figure out a game plan. And if they don’t, then the consumers will – movements like Move Your Money are calling on consumers to rethink where they’re putting their money and why. Try a new route – like putting your money into a community bank or credit union and support community businesses – and you’ll (most likely) have a new future ahead of you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/263a.png" alt="☺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - You&#039;re the boss!
@&lt;b&gt;Anon&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;m not sure when I&#039;ll feel comfortable sharing all that info yet.  I&#039;ve considered it before, just haven&#039;t given it much thought.  As for the advertising though - it&#039;s 99% all direct.  I don&#039;t go out looking for it much.
@&lt;b&gt;SavingDiva&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s very true, as long as you know it&#039;s the path that you&#039;re supposed to be on :)  For me, that was like college or moving to NYC.  Both were VERY trying at times, but I knew it was what I was supposed to be doing. And they had many more smooth spots than they did rough ones.
@&lt;b&gt;myfinancialobjectives&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s pretty cool :)  I bet all pf bloggers write about this at some point.  It&#039;s a pretty important one in my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I just wrote about this topic yesterday.  I&#039;ve got it saved for a later date, but still.  I called it: Analyzing your Current Financial Position.  Good message.  Realizing that you need a change and starting to actually make that change is often the hardest part.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Too late. I have to say, the new black one looks really good sitting in my entertainment center.

I&#039;m not a big fan of eBay or Craigslist. Having to ship things or meeting up with people to exchange goods isn&#039;t my cup of tea. My poor ER fund will just have to wait a bit longer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;UHNW&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, and it&#039;s not always easy figuring that out.  But in the past 10 years i&#039;ve recognized when things keep popping in place it&#039;s meant I&#039;m doing good!  Same with bad stuff too though, but at least I&#039;m getting better at catching it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;FrugalRichLife&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, no doubt about that.  But if it&#039;s going to help you for the rest of your career I&#039;d be all about it!  You&#039;ll make it back and then some, plus opens so many more doors for you.  I&#039;d enroll in classes myself if I didn&#039;t change my mind every other month ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Exactly.
@&lt;b&gt;auntrapunewer&lt;/b&gt; - YES! And confidence is key!  Love your name there btw :)
@&lt;b&gt;MoneyMan @ FinancialOdyssey&lt;/b&gt; - I know, right?  But it&#039;s not like the past 2 years hasn&#039;t brung us incredible lows though.  With stocks, I say it&#039;s an accomplishment just INVESTING in them.  You&#039;ll win some and lose some, but at least your money&#039;s there working for you as best it can.  I don&#039;t have the patience for CDS and bonds, etc etc, too slow! :)
@&lt;b&gt;J. Willy&lt;/b&gt; - Well good job my new friend!  Glad you like the site too - holler anytime.
@&lt;b&gt;Bobby&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... why don&#039;t you just go on craigslist and get a used one?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Too funny.

My Xbox 360 just died on me. No warranty. Do I shell out another 300 bucks tomorrow and get a new one and put off my emergency fund a couple of more weeks or do I hold off on the 360?

I&#039;ll go with the 360, the ER fund is done, but I want just a little bit more before I move it out of my checking account.]]></description>
