					<description><![CDATA[GREAT ones guys!!  I know I shouldn&#039;t be laughing, but some are hilarious ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Chris Barber&lt;/b&gt; - Damn, that does suck.  If it makes you feel better we bought our house at the peak of the market too ;) Lost a quick $60-$100k right from the get go.
@&lt;b&gt;BE @ BusyExecutiveMoneyBlog&lt;/b&gt; - Oh no!!! That def. sucks, dang.
@&lt;b&gt;Dr Dean&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, maybe you just wanted to support them in this bad economy of ours? ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Nick&lt;/b&gt; - OMG that is awesome!!  Smart play w/ the &quot;new pants fund&quot; too - that way it seems like it&#039;s on purpose and adds to the awesomeness of the bar scene ;)  I still REALLY really want to be a bartender one day, I&#039;ll have to get the secrets from you first.
@&lt;b&gt;Leah&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I think most beginners like to do that ;)  You could have gotten lucky though!
@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lissette&lt;/b&gt; - OUCH.  It&#039;s a good thing you started saving some energy pennies! :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez... it still hasn&#039;t been settled?
@&lt;b&gt;BrokeElizabeth&lt;/b&gt; - Awwww, haha... that&#039;s pretty cute though :)
@&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;ll do it!
@&lt;b&gt;WR&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah those transfers suck ass man, but if you can suck it up and do it soon you&#039;d be SO MUCH HAPPIER afterward!  Esp if that evil bank is Bank of America (and I&#039;m 99% sure it is cuz I don&#039;t know anyone that likes them :))
@&lt;b&gt;Maria@moneyprinciplet&lt;/b&gt; - Oh that def. blows.  You couldn&#039;t unload something or put in your purse/etc in order to avoid the fee?  Either way hope you&#039;re now better with it in the future :)
@&lt;b&gt;LB&lt;/b&gt; - Hahhaa... I&#039;ve done that before too.  Only with one, not four ;)  Hope they weren&#039;t big ones!
@&lt;b&gt;PK&lt;/b&gt; - HAH!  Serves me right ;)
@&lt;b&gt;KimmyQ&lt;/b&gt; - Wait, why?  You didn&#039;t finish?  Or you&#039;re switching? I don&#039;t think student loans are a bad thing in itself :(
@&lt;b&gt;Kristina&lt;/b&gt; - Ouch.  Hope you brought your purse at least so you can eat ;)  The worst is when you forget that too, and have to bum money off people... I&#039;ve done that on multiple occasions ;)]]></description>
