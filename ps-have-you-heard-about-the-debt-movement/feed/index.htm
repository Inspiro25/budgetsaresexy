					<description><![CDATA[Well, if the Twitter Chat we just had is any indication of future success of this movement, I think it&#039;ll be one pretty damn popular puppy :) WE HIT THE #1 TRENDING SPOT ON TWITTER!!! (The non-sponsored one, haha...) So cool!!

@&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Frugalista&lt;/b&gt; - Holy crap!! That is insane, yo! I want you to tell me the *second* it&#039;s all paid off, and then write a guest post for us so we can get inpired too! Okay? You better! :)

@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - It&#039;s gonna be fun! It always helps when you&#039;ve got a good community backing you up too :)

@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Woohoo! That would be the best birthday present too :)

@&lt;b&gt;Ornella @ Moneylicious&lt;/b&gt; - I know! How crazy was that??

@&lt;b&gt;J. Delancy&lt;/b&gt; - AWESOME!!! Jeez, some of you are really rockin&#039; that - I&#039;m totally inspired. I still have 8.5 years left to go on my plan, though I probably started a lot later working on it than you guys... at least I hope I did! Haha... We&#039;ll put you down as an honorary member of the Debt Movement too then :)

@&lt;b&gt;Cassie&lt;/b&gt; - Great! Welcome aboard!

@&lt;b&gt;Connor Harley&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, it was just on Huffington Post too thanks to Jeff&#039;s hard work... It&#039;s shaping up to be a pretty cool deal so far.

@&lt;b&gt;Megan&lt;/b&gt; - I know, I wish it was open to everyone too :( But I love your spirit and idea! You guys totally should :)

@&lt;b&gt;Melanie&lt;/b&gt; - Good! I bet it&#039;s super annoying to have paid it all off, and then get some added up again :( Just use all that to better motivate yourself and knock it out once and for all! You can do it! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I joined this last week when I first saw a blurb about it (possibly on your site!)... My goal is to (once again) pay off all credit cards &#038; medical debt by April 30. From November 2008 to November 2010, we had paid off $11,000 and some change in cc and medical debt, but have racked it up again. Only about $5,000 this time around, but come on! 
Tomorrow, I will pay off our first credit card of the year (ok, it&#039;s less than $100, but baby steps, right?)! I&#039;m excited to participate. It&#039;s not feasible for my family to be 100% out of debt in 2013 (unless miracles rain down from heaven), but to knock off the crappy debt will give us the extra boost we need to move on to our student loans then our house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh this is cool - Paying off my 11K student loan is one of my big goals for the year. A shame it&#039;s for Americans only - maybe some of we non-US citizens shall band together and try to pay down a lofty amount?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The best news I heard all year.  A &#039;movement&#039; that returns financial power to the people and takes it away from the sellers of debt.  Can&#039;t join because I live outside of the U.S but my thoughts are with those who are willing to take  this big step.

As for myself, the last payment on my mortgage was made on 30th December, 2012. YIPPPEEEE!.  I paid it off 11 months earlier than the bank expected.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I emailed to be a part of it!   (I don&#039;t like the idea of giving out cc info on any website.)  

I am currently chunking away at my debt from hospital / changing schools / my kitty cat dying.  As of yesterday debt is at $4,410.21 from $10,233.32 when it was at its highest!  My payoff date it already April 2013 because that is my birthday month :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m all about this today! Excited to see even HUGE bloggers such as yourself are getting the word out. I hope we blow the $10M figure out of the water and hear some &quot;Debt-Free&quot; stories in the next 90 days. Super pumped to join as well, as I still have some nagging student loans to kill. Locked and loaded!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I joined! In the last 2 years we have paid down $155,000 towards the principal of our home mortgage and I intend to pay the remaining $88,500 in 2013 (I&#039;m the Chief Financial Officer in our home). I may make it or I may not, but I&#039;m definitely not going down without a fight.]]></description>
