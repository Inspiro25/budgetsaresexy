					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, USAA isn&#039;t always the *best* rate out there but I still always choose them. I&#039;ll take a tiny bit less money for better customer support :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to see you&#039;re reading Ramit&#039;s book too!  It&#039;s one of my all-time favorites - so fun and easy to read, really glad he came out with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice! I hope they implement sub-accounts or something similar. They&#039;re pretty good about being on top of website technologies. I was checking out ING after reading a few chapters of Ramit&#039;s book but the only 2 things is has over USAA is a tiny bit higher interest rate and the ability to do sub-accounts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup, USAA for everything!  I actually emailed my contact over there and said they should copy ING and get us sub-accounts so I could start rockin&#039; them :)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have money over at ING but it&#039;s basically just chillin&#039; until I figure out what to do w/ it.  I might xfer more over and start breaking them down by fun fund, car, etc etc but for now I don&#039;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other great online banks out there too, ING just happens to be one of the more popular ones - and for good measure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great Post! I&#039;ve been doing research today looking at other options for getting a little more return out of my saved money (currently with USAA). ING Direct seems to beat USAA Performances Savings as well as their Money Market fund. I&#039;m a little wary that ING received a bailout and I&#039;ve heard they built their business on mortages. Of course there are a ton of other online banks out there that offer interest rates far above both ING Direct and USAA, but ING Direct is pretty established and has good website features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people that are with both banks - Which bank do you use for what? Everything with USAA and ING Direct for emergency fund? I&#039;d love to hear some thoughts!]]></description>
