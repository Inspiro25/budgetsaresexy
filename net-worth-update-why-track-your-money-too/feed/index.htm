					<description><![CDATA[Hey!

I have been reading many of your posts the last couple of months but I never comment because I am just lazy unfortunately haha.

This post hit home. I have been doing the net worth calculation for my own self the last 5 years and I am very happy with the results.

I started my first business in 2009 and through a stroke of luck, made it big (for my age atleast). 

However, I used to squander money uselessly and in 2012 I realized that although I was earning enough, my net worth wasn&#039;t really increasing.

I have changed all of that now. I bought a couple of houses, put them on rent and have been very careful with my money.

I have even started a personal finance blog so I can give other people tips about this.

Thanks for bringing things into perspective :)]]></description>
