Oh wow, haven&#039;t looked at this in years! I haven&#039;t done a recent one, no, but I&#039;ll put it on the list of ideas once things settle down here... (in process of moving). It looks way different these days with kids and self-employment that&#039;s for sure, haha.... Was so much simpler back then!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled across this oldie as I lament my own credit card bill for last month and this month (and it&#039;s only the beginning of July!).  Summer food is killing us with our boys eating on what seems like a near constant basis.  Have you done a &#039;re-do&#039; of this lately with your current spending?  If not, I&#039;d love to see one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J, I just ran across this golden oldie from your archives and like that you recognize the strengths that credit cards have for keeping track of spending. It&#039;s easy to assign things into categories when you have them in a list at the end of the month. Also, no expense escapes you. I also tended to be generous with my assumptions about my own spending until I actually paid closer attention to the numbers every month and couldn&#039;t avoid what I was actually spending!]]></description>
