					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you stopped to consider where your diamond was coming from.  I recently read an article on Canadian diamond mines and I&#039;m glad the word is getting around.
I love being a girly-girl but have never understood the obsession with diamond engagement rings.  I love color so I go for rubies on my wedding ring. My first wedding ring was a claddagh ring with a ruby in the middle- it cost $50.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For anyone who is or is dating someone Irish, a great alternative to a diamond is a claddagh. Claddagh&#039;s are great because turning the heart around so it points towards her heart, it changes from being a engagement ring to a wedding ring!

Another tradition I&#039;m fond of (but didn&#039;t have access to when I popped the question 2 years ago) is using a family ring.  Actually, that&#039;s how claddagh&#039;s were traditionally used, passed down from mother to daughter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[CONGRATS!

That is exciting.  Diamonds are exciting.  As for the depth, girdle, etc, those are all values of the cut, which are very important.  A diamond with good proportion is always better.    You are right about picking a couple of C&#039;s to focus on though, finding out what is really important to you will make you the happiest.  Like one of your comments said, the difference between and FL and an SI are hardly noticeable, but I beg to differ.  To the naked eye, yes.  But FL means flawless (internally and externally) and FL diamonds are a very small percentage of the worlds diamonds, something like less than 2 percent. Anything over 10x magnification will bring out flaws in an SI range or higher for that matter, but of course, who walks around with a loupe or microscope in their pocket?  Having worked in many jewelery stores, I would be personally obsessed with getting a VVs of my own with good color and proportion, regardless of the size.. I feel bad for my future finance!!

I think if the two C&#039;s you picked for yourself have worked and the diamond looks great to you, than you have done a great job and should be very excited!!!!  Congrats again :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Kevin - University of Virginia, William and Mary, Annapolis, West Point, UT, USAFA, Coast Guard Academy, &#038; GMU are a few of the schools I can name off the top of my head that have college rings that graduates actually wear. 

INSURE IT! Typically your normal renters or homeowners policies do no cover diamond rings or other expensive jewelry. Every woman assumes she&#039;ll never take it off, but sometimes you find your self in an unexpected situation - art class, martial arts, whatever, where you take it off. 

Are Canadian diamonds cheaper?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats Jack! When my fiancée told me to pick out a ring, I was extremely reasonable. I chose a ring that was under $1K because we&#039;re looking to get out of debt and save up for a down payment on a house. Our wedding isn&#039;t going to exceed $10K (looking to not push past $7 but the way it&#039;s looking, we might be at 5!) I wanted something that looked nice of course but didn&#039;t want to sacrifice our savings or our credit for something that only I would be seeing everyday (sure, coworkers, friends, and family would be eying it but I would have to be the one happy with it). I like to think I&#039;m modest :)]]></description>
