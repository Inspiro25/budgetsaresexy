haha yup i think we all regret that one... I remember someone doing a guest post on this blog here 10 years ago and thinking &quot;$100 is so high! no way i&#039;d ever buy a coin at that!&quot; and then just a handful of month ago I buy a fraction when valued at $60,000 lol.... But similar to you I would have sold it long ago anyways once it turned a profit so not like we would have reaped it entirely (and would still be kicking ourselves!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[About 1990 I bought a stick built 20 x 24 garage that a guy had cut into 8 foot sections with a chainsaw for $1,000.  I was going to reconstruct it on my property as I was in dire need of a garage.  It sat for 3 years in a large pile under blue tarps and became mice infested and rotten.  I burned it.  That $1.000 compounded at 8% is over $13,000 up in smoke!  Wish I understood the power of compound interest back in the day.]]></description>
