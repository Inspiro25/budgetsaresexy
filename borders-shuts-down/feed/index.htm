					<description><![CDATA[Borders refused to change with the times. It&#039;s sad that so many people are out of a job, but ultimately it was due to the stubborness and short-sightedness of Borders corporate ... they flat out refused to accommodate changing times. 

B&#038;N has survived and even thrived because they embraced technology and the coming of the E-book. They accept and understand that there&#039;s a market for BOTH e-books and &quot;real&quot; print books .. as well as an atmosphere to enjoy them in.

Borders buried it&#039;s head in the sand and ... well, you see what happened.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s sad, but not surprising.  Everything&#039;s going digital - look what&#039;s happening to Blockbuster.  Borders didn&#039;t diversify into the e-reader business, and their online sales moved over to Amazon.  It doesn&#039;t help that the economy hasn&#039;t been great the last few years.  I know that I have started using the library instead of purchasing from bookstores.  If I have to buy, I&#039;ll buy used instead of new.  I&#039;d wager that I&#039;m not the only one who has changed their book-buying habits.  Businesses have to change and adapt with the times to meet customer demands, and apparently not enough people are buying physical books from brick-and-mortar stores anymore.  Even libraries now offer borrowing of e-books!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J, As per federal regulations, donating plasma is limited to twice per 7 day period. Depending on how busy they are, I spend about 1 1/2 hour to 2 hours there per donation between the administrative tasks and the actual donation. But it snags me $57 per week for that time, which works out to ~$15-$20/hr!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[YES!  Agree with many of you that mom &amp; pop bookstores are AWESOME.  I absolutely love them -- and one day want to have my own!  &quot;The Bloggin Corner&quot; - Haha... books, blogs, and damn good coffee... (that may be a better title ;))

@&lt;b&gt;Mary M&lt;/b&gt; - That would be a sad, sad day - but I don&#039;t think that&#039;ll ever happen.  We still go to stores for other things that are cheaper online :)  And also, this falls under &quot;pleasure&quot; so as long as people still enjoy going to book stores, they shouldn&#039;t disappear totally.  Although then MY future book store will be more popular, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;No Debt MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Wow, yeah - that would be harsh. Especially since not everyone a) uses computers as much as we do, and b)  don&#039;t even like reading on electronics - I don&#039;t!  I gladly pay money to hold it and read it/mark it up/fold the pages - esp magazines.  I know they&#039;re free online, but it&#039;s not as fun (for me).
@&lt;b&gt;Jill Palmer&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yes!!!  I like that.
@&lt;b&gt;Miriam&lt;/b&gt; - I think that Starbucks/B&amp;N partnership is crazy strong... it fits well. (and their colors even match!)
@&lt;b&gt;Jane Squared&lt;/b&gt; - Oh cool, thanks - will check out as soon as I post this :)
@&lt;b&gt;Julie @ The Family CEO&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, yeah me too. Why can&#039;t they operate to just give us free places to hang out?? :)
@&lt;b&gt;lorakathleen&lt;/b&gt; - Well that&#039;s good! You are all set if stores start shutting down since you have so many!  Wanna switch? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jerret&lt;/b&gt; - I would LOVE that.  Nothing would please me more in the bookstore world!
@&lt;b&gt;Melissa&lt;/b&gt; - Yup, for sure.  Maybe like Jerret suggested above, MORE mom &amp; pop stores will now open up??
@&lt;b&gt;Money Beagle&lt;/b&gt; - Oh wow, yeah I bet!  You were there from the beginning, that&#039;s a shame :(
@&lt;b&gt;Ginger&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, that&#039;s what I keep finding out as I read on... I still can&#039;t help but be upset though - it still means I lose my favorite store in my area.
@&lt;b&gt;Eric&lt;/b&gt; - Agreed!!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I get that sense too actually from Barnes &amp; Nobile :)  Sometimes at Starbucks too, but usually it depends on the areas I&#039;m going to.  The ones in the cities are always the worst in customer service, and the ones on the outskirts are better.  But that&#039;s just in general, I find, not specific to book stores/coffee shops.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - How much time do you SPEND at that plasma center? haha... wow... you making a full-time salary of it yet? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Barb Friedberg&lt;/b&gt; - Thank GOODNESS there are still other areas around, but man - just scary if you think about how any of them can go away w/out much control directly from us... at leats it was fun while it lasted :)]]></description>
