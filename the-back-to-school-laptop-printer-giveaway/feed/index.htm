					<description><![CDATA[My favorite summer splurge was taking the summer off this year (I am a teacher and usually work all summer at a second job.) and I feel sad about back to school shopping because it means the end of my summer!  
Just a note, taking the summer off was a huge one time splurge.  I will be working next summer!]]></description>
