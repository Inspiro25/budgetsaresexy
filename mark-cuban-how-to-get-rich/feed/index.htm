					<description><![CDATA[I never quite know what to think about Mark Cuban, but this post is certainly thought provoking. I have to agree with what you say on credit cards. Yes, they may make it easier to buy things, but if you can be responsible with them, they have their advantages. I am paying for everyone&#039;s holiday gifts this year from all of my accumulated credit cards rewards points. Sweet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Matt Jabs&lt;/b&gt; - Well, not too sure about the college one (that only works for a minority of people in my opinion) but yeah, the rest is pretty solid :)
@&lt;b&gt;SmartAssetTeam&lt;/b&gt; - Yep, and you can&#039;t get really rich (normally) by not learning and understanding your biz!
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, I haven&#039;t read that one yet, but he is pretty hardcore I&#039;ll admit ;)  I&#039;m still a fan of the markets, but one day I may be convinced.
@&lt;b&gt;Kris @Debt-Tips&lt;/b&gt; - For sure -- it&#039;s hard to doubt a man that&#039;s DOING IT, ya know?  No matter how crazy people might think he is... he&#039;s got the proof to back it up!
@&lt;b&gt;Jen @ Master the Art of Saving&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;d rather you strike a balance than die too! We all love ya here :)
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah, no one said getting rich was easy ;)  But it&#039;s a lot easier to reach the goal by following certain guidelines like that.  I think #5 comes true a lot more times than people realize.  Gotta keep those eyes open and sometimes poke around so ya don&#039;t let things slide by ya!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you liked :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The 5 steps are quite good. All those steps get progressively more difficult. #4 learning all you can about an industry is tough! #5 get lucky and recognize an opportunity may never come at all. 
I think telling people to stay away from credit card is a good thing. Most people misuse them anyway.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It all makes sense, in one way or another. There is no way that I could just save, save, save---I&#039;d go nuts. With my luck, I&#039;d be saving for years and passing up all sorts of fun stuff and then die. I&#039;d much rather strike a nice balance to saving and enjoying life now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, the guy did build a huge business that he sold for a fortune. His key points are not much different than what you&#039;d find in any financial articles, but his perspective is a good one, thanks for sharing.]]></description>
