&quot;I realized that I wanted it and I want it bad. The passion consumed me and I feel like I am a new person. &quot;

YES YES YES!! You gotta want it bad enough to make drastic enough changes to live drastically better lives :) I&#039;m glad you got your epiphany!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great! I know that for me, the moment I turned the corner towards my dreams of becoming financially free is when I developed passion for it. I wanted it, but I wasn&#039;t passionate about it. Finally one day, after witnessing a family friend living financially free, I realized that I wanted it and I want it bad. The passion consumed me and I feel like I am a new person. I see the big picture of where we are going. I realize that every purchase and decision that we make financially leads us to our future. So I better take the reigns and do what needs to be done now so that my future is free! 

Thank you Becky for being open and honest. That is a great way of saving and I am going to have to try this. Keep up the good work and you will go far. 

Thank you for sharing!]]></description>

Haha... at least it&#039;s all REAL PEOPLE talking about REAL LIFE things vs companies/experts saying the same boring bland stuff all the time... We need to hear all these crazy ideas over and over and over again until the good ones stick with us! At least I do :)]]></description>

HAH! I was literally *just* emailing with the founder of Tip Yourself an hour ago.

So so true - she is a perfect candidate for it! I&#039;m going to email her right after I leave this comment, thank you :)

Here&#039;s my review of them I just did too over at Rockstar Finance for anyone interested:

&quot;Funny how the big picture suddenly looked a lot clearer when I saw my savings hit the thousand dollar mark for the first time.&quot;

YES to all that. The first chunk of money makes all the difference in the world and really shows you what you&#039;re capable of! I remember when my 401k hit $1,000 and how amazing I thought it was (who know never pulling from it meant it kept going UP??? :)) and then from there it was all about trying to hit $10,000 and then $100,000 and now one day $1,000,000.

But that first $1,000 was harder than any of it. takes us FOREVER to get to that point and then from there gets easier by the day :)

so keep on going! You got this!]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard and read (and talked!) with $$$ bloggers for years, and then one day it just clicked! And now one of the best decisions I&#039;ve made with my money, haha...]]></description>
