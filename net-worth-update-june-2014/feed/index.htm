					<description><![CDATA[It might be best to not split the money up at all. Your second child might not need as much financial assistance for college as your first child. In this case, it would be best to devote most, if not all of the money into the first child&#039;s 529. Then you can transfer what is left, unneeded, etc. into the second child&#039;s 529 account. 

With this plan, you are maximizing the benefit of the 529 money and minimizing potential penalties if child No. 2 does not need much help for college because of scholarships, or a different life path. If both children have an equal need for financial assistance, you can just make sure that an equal amount is dispersed to each at a later time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha! The car thing is hilarious. Good for you. I always admire people that drive older, beat up (yet reliable) vehicles. Ive known a few people who have a significant net worth ($4M+) and not one of them owns an expensive vehicle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Again, congrats on the baby!  We&#039;re down $1800 this month.  The real estate market is cooling off, and we&#039;ve been hemorrhaging spending money since I had baby #3 at the end of April.  We&#039;ve been in survival mode and the name of the game is throwing money at problems as they arrive until I&#039;m getting more sleep.

Oh well, those little baby cuddles are priceless.]]></description>

I think that&#039;s as good a plan as any :) I just love hearing that parents ARE saving money for their kids to go to college since so many people poo poo on the idea of higher ed these days... Yeah the costs are getting outrageous, but it&#039;s still good education! Even as a self-employed man I still want my kids going to college... No way I&#039;d be here today if it wasn&#039;t for that degree and everything else life-related I learned throughout those  years.]]></description>

I do the latter - wait to the end and then throw it all in with one big chunk. Mainly cuz I never know what the amount will be, like you said.

But that&#039;s just how I do it :) Other, probably more smarter, people might invest a little each month and do their best to estimate it so they&#039;re dollar cost averaging all those investments. And can then square off at the end once taxes are ran. I just personally feel more comfortable waiting once everything is said and done since online income is so drastic sometimes. And don&#039;t want to play the xfer around game and screw anything up.]]></description>
