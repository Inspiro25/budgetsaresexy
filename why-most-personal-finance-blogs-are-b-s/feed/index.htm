					<description><![CDATA[I both agree and disagree with some points in this post. I whole-heatedly believe in having a safety net you&#039;re comfortable with... then investing anything over that amount. Great perspective though. We&#039;re all here to learn from one another!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic and real information!  I&#039;ve found I tend to take a bit of advice from several sources and then adjust it to my own situation and risk factor.  There&#039;s a lot out there that speak from theory and not from actual successful experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just to be contrarian:

$1 mil of cash is worth about $4 mil in investment property due to leverage. Earning even a paltry 10% (very very low for real estate in my experience), that&#039;s going to be a $400,000/year paycheck.

Hire a full-time property manager and then book your ticket to the Bahamas?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First off, I would be very interested in learning how the author made his millions. But I do agree that too much emphasis is often put on a large emergency fund in cash. It makes sense to invest some of this money in low-risk investments to at least gain some type of return. Keeping a stash for 10 year in a bank account can be missing out on some major gains. Great article and great perspective on the issues!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an old article, but definitely still relevant - I&#039;m glad I came upon it! I certainly believe that a balance is necessary, as risking everything is more likely to end in disaster. I also agree that all personal finance blogs are sexy. :) I think it&#039;s great that you share differing opinions on your blog - that makes for more interesting reads indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This article is o.k...but and a huge BUT here, it fails to mention one thing.  RISK.  If I am sitting in a paid for 100,000 dollar house with a modest 3 month emergency fund of 10k and my neighbor has 80k in debt on his 100,000 dollar house with little to no emergency fund who has more risk?  It won&#039;t matter that he has 200k in investments if he is laid off or the market turns south.  I&#039;ll take my paid for house and invest as much as I can without endangering my Family&#039;s well being.  My wife also feels safer.  Happy wife, happy life.]]></description>
