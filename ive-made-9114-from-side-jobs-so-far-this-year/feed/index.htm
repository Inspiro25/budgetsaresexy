UPDATE!!! One of my clients recently asked me to housesit for them (in their $10mill home!!!) for about a month between now and the end of the year. To the tune of $200 a day, which is more than $5,000 to tack on to my expected annual income for this year. Not too shabby!!! I thought I&#039;d let you know! Thanks for the great blog, take care!

Maybe.  Or maybe I just got lucky when I downloaded it.  Hope it eventually works out.  Not a lot of money but easy to do!]]></description>

That&#039;s so cool to hear! And taking advantage of the swimming pool is a double win! :).  So much opportunity for referrals by just putting the word out to your friends group. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have house/dogsat for one family for years and this past year decided to mention to everyone that I housesit and It really took off. I am a busy self employed massage therapist and can work caring for dogs, cats (sometimes chickens!) while staying in really nice houses (some with pools!) into my schedule without a hitch. It affords me &quot;the good life&quot; for a solid chunk out of the year (probably 2 months+ total per year) while I keep my super affordable small apt. I make $75 a day and I usually get tipped nicely as well. I will say, lots of people have &quot;Covid Pups&quot; these days - who can be wildly misbehaved and serious PITAes, and those clients I simply tell I am too busy to see again because my primary gig is too busy. I love side gigs! Thanks for the post!]]></description>

Those are all awesome!  My wife and I did scooter charging years ago. But that was when the scooters were really skinny and had small batteries (less heavy). Now they are so fat I can see it&#039;s hard to lift one.  Glad you&#039;re liking Rover! If you can get regular clients it&#039;s the perfect side gig! Congrats!]]></description>

OfferUp has been great, I like it better than Craigslist because everything is done through the app.  Just snap a pic and upload...  But, I&#039;m finding it&#039;s only good for certain items.  Large stuff like Auto is better on Craigslist. And unique/specialty/collector stuff is still better on eBay because of the worldwide pool of searchers.

Facebook Marketplace is good too for local selling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just started trying a new list of side hustles! My fave so far is Rover. i hung out with a cat twice a day for an hour for 4 days and made $135! I also tried Lime juicing which was ok but I have a new Tesla and it was weird randomly picking up scooters off the street then dropping them off at a random busy corner.  Ad they&#039;re kinda heavy for me. But during the summer weekends they pay $12 to charge and drop off scooters! Surveys are always fun but then I get tired of doing them.  My next one to tackle is WeGoLook! you get paid to &#039;look&#039; at something and take pictures. Apparently some people hire you to go look at real estate when they live out of state.]]></description>

*update*. Just tried signing up and it says I need an invitation... They put my email on a wait list and will notify me if there&#039;s availability.

Maybe it&#039;s area specific?]]></description>
