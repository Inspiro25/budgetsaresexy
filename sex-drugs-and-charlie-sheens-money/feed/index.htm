					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s true.  I am surprised it took this long.  Charlie Sheen has been in a downward fall for a while.  It&#039;s too bad that others must suffer from the actions of one man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that it&#039;s too bad the other actors have to suffer because Sheen is insufferable. :-(
Hope they were more careful with their funds than he has been.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with 1, 4 and 5 don&#039;t rely on other people for money, your reputation can harm your earning power and don&#039;t take money for granted.  All great advice, but I don&#039;t understand how being 100% responsible for your children and having a prenup will save you money.  

Starting with the prenuptial agreement, aren&#039;t you just paying more up front for a contract that states the terms of the marriage, but only protects the money and things you brought into the marriage.  That would leave everything accumulated during the marriage and if the two parties hate each other, a prenup isn&#039;t going to make anything easier.  I could be wrong on that account, but in general terms that is what seems to be the problem.

Having kids before you are ready would mean there would be a lot less kids in this world.  I don&#039;t think anyone that has kids is ever 100% sure about bringing kids into this world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Everyone,

I definitely see your point about the stigma of a prenupt.  However, I look at it as an insurance policy.  It&#039;s just in case of protection.  We never know what is going to happen during a divorce and it&#039;s best to be protected. 
 It doesn&#039;t necessarily guarantee that the marrage will end  in divorce, but just in case it does, we will be prepared..  As a product of divorced parents and also as a financial planner, I can definitely say that money brings out the worst in people.  
A prenupt is not the sexiest part of marriage but on the other hand, no one should have the right to something they didn&#039;t work for/earn. 
Happy Thursday Everyone!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Not having a prenuptial agreement is just plain financial ignorance.&quot; I&#039;m with Emily on this one. What is the purpose of a pre-nup if not to plan for an eventual divorce? To me, that&#039;s just not marriage. It might be the state of affairs in today&#039;s society, but it&#039;s not in my own set of life rules.]]></description>
