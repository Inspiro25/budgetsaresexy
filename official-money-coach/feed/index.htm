Yes - MAKE IT HAPPEN!! :)

There&#039;s a serious need for money coaches, and not many people like jumping into it because it doesn&#039;t pay as much as *financial advising* and other services that involve making bank off hawking funds/etc.

It does seem like &quot;a lot&quot; at first, but it really is pretty straightforward once you get going... And there are no real rules for money coaching unlike other financial services, so anyone can literally just start helping others anytime they want - for the better or the worse. The only *main* (and important) rule is that you can&#039;t give any direct *investing advice* if you&#039;re getting paid for it, because then you need a bunch of certifications. But you can tell people that they need to invest in general for sure.

What I&#039;d do is ask your friends/family who you&#039;ve helped already to give you a testimonial, and then just build a one-pager online that features them, along with your services and how you can help people/etc, and then from there it&#039;s really just marketing the crap out of it :)

You can also connect up with any financial planners you know and see if they&#039;d be willing to send you over people who they can&#039;t/not willing to help too! I used to get a handful of them from people who gladly passed them over since it wasn&#039;t worth their time... As sad as that is.

So lots of different ways to get started, but it&#039;s definitely a hustle at first. Good luck!]]></description>

Hi J.,

Can you tell me which coach gave you the contract you use for this? I&#039;d like to have something since I wouldn&#039;t know where to begin crafting a legal contract.

Thanks!]]></description>

I&#039;ve had to hit pause on it it for a bit to re-focus on my own projects, but having a blog and being super active on social media def. helped get clients :) Also connecting with financial advisors who turn away people ALL THE TIME that either can&#039;t afford their services or are not in the right place yet to do so. It&#039;s amazing what a gap there is from needing help budgeting and getting their money on track to hiring a financial advisor. Unfortunately advisors can&#039;t be bothered by this first stage :( 

So network with as many as you can and then when you&#039;ve helped your clients get on their feet and they need that next level, xfer them on back up the chain and return the favor! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

Just curious - have you expanded your client base? If so, what marketing strategies worked for you? I&#039;ve found a few that are working for me - Facebook groups and commenting. I&#039;d love to hear of your progress. Thanks!
