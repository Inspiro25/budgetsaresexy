Glad you liked &#039;em, man!

And very cool about the honesty/job stuff too :) I wonder if i&#039;s because you actually come across as a *human* and not a robot that they appreciate about it? Since interviewers are people too? (Who will also usually have to work with you!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Liked the interview the &quot;The Man&quot;.  I was one of those people that worked at jobs I hated for way too many years.  Finally doing only things I like to do. 
The one thing I found interesting was when I went on interviews and was totally honest with the person interviewing me, I always got offered the position for the salary I asked for.

Also like the Minimalists article, not doing it that way, but definitely getting rid of stuff we don&#039;t need or use anymore.

Thanks for the articles.]]></description>

It def. could have been used to *market better* as the only reason I found out about the site was through press releases they emailed me! Not exactly their target market, haha....]]></description>

I will respectfully offer a counter-point..,because it leads one gender to devalue another gender when looks and sex are all that are there. Many of those that I have known who rely on their looks alone tend to have not been encouraged to develop any other skills because their looks are the only things that have ever been applauded by those around them.  It may not be that they don&#039;t have anything to offer.]]></description>

And the spelling/grammatical errors!  Ugh! The more I read the website, the more I think the syntax sounded like an Asian language speaker, not an upper class white woman, as they would like you to believe.  I feel like if what they are presenting is true, they would have had money to spend on a website creator and copywriter/editor.]]></description>
