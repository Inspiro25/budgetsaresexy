Nice!!

I&#039;ll pass this note over to Rob as it&#039;s a few years old now but he&#039;s still around doing his thing :) I&#039;ll have him reach out to you directly if he&#039;s interested in the speaking part.

Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved everything I read!  I also believe in the value of educating our youth!  I love that you use ordinary folks to showcase what financial literacy and discipline can achieve.  

While I don&#039;t have celebrity clients, I do have America&#039;s heros.  I&#039;m a financial counselor/educator at the largest Marine Corps training installation. I have the privilege of helping our service members and their families with financial matters; doing my best to ensure they are all financially fit and mission ready!

I would love to have you as our guest speaker!  Hope to hear from you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/interview-hip-hop-financial-advisor-rob-wilson/#comment-135777&quot;&gt;Cautioned Observer&lt;/a&gt;.

First off, thanks for checking out the FPT site and I appreciate your feedback. Pricing is something that every entrepreneur has to deal with at one point or another.

However, I&#039;n not sure if you had the opportunity to read the copy on the page or watch the video, but this particular service has absolutely nothing to do with portfolio management. If someone wants to work with me in that capacity they can do so for 1% annually, period.

FPT is a coaching program, about working one on one with individuals who need help getting their finances in order before they can even think about investing i.e. cash management, budgeting, credit, starting a business, negotiating a salary improving credit etc. (all things mentioned in detail on the page).

Often people know what they &quot;should&quot; be doing, but have trouble actually putting those things into practice. This program provides them the tools they need up front and then offers an accountability partner to help them follow through.

In my experience, if people are going to make REAL change in their lives, they need a lot of information, fast, rather than just working with them on a monthly basis.  We jump in, work together intensely for the first month, and then the customer can continue if they choose to.

I know that most financial advisors won&#039;t work with anyone if they don&#039;t have a portfolio, so I can see how you might get this service confused with the average advisor&#039;s offerings, but this is different.

In a nutshell, I help people get their $#!t together, so they can begin to build real wealth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a quick look at the Financial Personal Training website you linked to shows a service with a $497 &quot;setup fee&quot; and a $97 per month fee. If this is geared towards professionals who don&#039;t have a huge portfolio those fees are really bad.

$25,000 portfolio is 6.6% for the first year, then 4.6% per year after that
$50,000 portfolio is 3.3% for the first year, then 2.3% per year after that
$75,000 portfolio is 2.2% for the first year, then 1.5% per year after that

And this is just the adviser fee that doesn&#039;t take into account any fees for any funds or etf&#039;s.

That is just way too high. For portfolios that size, online options are a much better option. Come on you shouldn&#039;t be promoting this service to that audience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That sounds like an incredible way to be able to combine what I think are pretty entertaining industries- those being entertainment and wealth management.  I really dig the idea of parlaying an interest in sports to an interest in money.  I hadn&#039;t heard of the March Money Madness, but I&#039;m headed there now to check it out.  And btw, seriously awesome nickname bro.]]></description>

The GFC was tough. Looking back, it didn&#039;t matter how rich your clients were, or how good their throwing arm was, they all lost money.

You can&#039;t control markets, all you can do as an adviser is make sure a client is diversified and communicate and service the crap out of them!

Thanks for the reply Rob!]]></description>
