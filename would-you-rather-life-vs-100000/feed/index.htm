					<description><![CDATA[Ooooooh love the way you think Yana!  I never knew how I would answer that Lottery question (&#039;cuz I DO play the lotto and it&#039; just a matter of time until I win! haha...) but I think you&#039;ve now convinced me to take it all in 1 swoop too ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What strikes me is the tremendous amount of faith that people have for the future.  The way I look at things is that there are no guarantees.  I try to strike a balance between the reality, which is that I don&#039;t know whether I will be here at all next week, and sensibility - which requires that I prepare for a theoretical future that I would wish for.  I don&#039;t play the lottery, but if I did, I would not take the payments over 20 years.  I would want all the money today, because today is all I know that I have.  And I say that even though I would be very sensible and frugal with the money - as though I had 50 years ahead of me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A pattern I&#039;m noticing in the comments is that those who are going through a significant period of their life, eg they have a baby young enough to have life measured in months, they&#039;re getting married, etc., wouldn&#039;t take trade money for that. For those who could walk back into their jobs and make sure that their families and friends know where they are? They would do it in a heartbeat. I guess it all comes down to priorities, which always change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Finally back from the vacation, J.  It was great meeting you and some of the other DC bloggers too!

Re: Your question... Hmmm.  I&#039;d definitely pass!  Pricing a year of living at $100k is undervaluing life just a wee bit, methinks.  (Not sure why I&#039;m speaking with a British accent right now.  Cheerio!)

Best,

					<description><![CDATA[Given my current financial predicament right now, I&#039;d probably let a year skip by as I get 100K in return. Though I try not to think in paper dollars, so the equivalent of silver ounces would guarantee a dragon like me to get into that sorta thing. :P]]></description>
