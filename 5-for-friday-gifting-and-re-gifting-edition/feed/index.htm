					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Ha&#039;penny Bits&lt;/b&gt; - Way to go! You re-gifted a gift to a stranger and got back cash :)
@&lt;b&gt;debtgirl&lt;/b&gt; - HAH! Awesome! I&#039;d like to see her pull of the &quot;no attitude&quot; one though, that&#039;s hard :)
@&lt;b&gt;KK @ Student Debt Survivor&lt;/b&gt; - Cool about the radio - great idea! I didn&#039;t even know they made those anymore?
@&lt;b&gt;Cassi&lt;/b&gt; - Pretzel salad? Haha... can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever heard of that one! :)
@&lt;b&gt;Jane Savers&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! They&#039;re clever, I like it! They&#039;ll come around about the money soon - once they&#039;re lives are more dependant on it ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Rod J Rogers&lt;/b&gt; - COOL! I&#039;m staring at a big flat screen monitor too - they&#039;re awesome! (Though I sometimes wonder if they&#039;re burning my retinas...)
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - How about within 5,000? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Best gift – A new BIG flat screen monitor

Worst gift-  I didn’t get any bad gifts this year, my family knows me to well.

Best gift I gave- New digital camera for my wife.

Re-gift- nope. At least not as far as I know….

Favorite part of the holiday- Spending time with my family and friend. Going to Les Miserables with some friends – Life Is Good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My children are older than yours and both are post secondary students.  January tuition is due next week so I don&#039;t want any money wasted on Christmas gifts for me.  

My youngest used credit card points to gift me grocery store gift card.  My oldest was given a liquor store gift card at work but managed to trade it for a restaurant gift card for me.  No money was spent but I still have great presents.

I talk to them about money a lot but I didn&#039;t think they ever listen (I know they never read my blog) but they were very enthused about how they got my gifts and new that would be a good part of Christmas for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Best gift? Ohhh, I am torn between all the Harry Potter movies, and a hat with the &quot;1-Up&quot; mushroom from Mario on it. My friends and family know I am a huge nerd apparently. 
Worst Gift? Makeup. I haven&#039;t been wearing a lot of makeup, and when I do it is very natural. This was purple and teal and honestly, I will never wear it.
Best gift you GAVE? I gave one friend 2 gifts. A dog tag with inside jokes and a Starbucks gift set. I thought the dog tags were the best, but she really likes the Starbucks. (She does wear the dog tags everywhere though so....)
Re-gift? I thought about it, but no.
Outside of presents, what was your favorite part of the holiday? My family makes pretzel salad every year. Other than presents, that was honestly the best part... It is so good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What was the best gift you got for Christmas this year? – sounds weird, but a wind up radio-during the hurricane we had no power and no idea what was going on in the outside world. 
What was the worst gift? – A sweater from my dad, sorry dad
What was the best gift you GAVE someone this Christmas? – Flew the grandparents to our house so we could spend time together. We also took them to a Broadway show which they loved.
Did you re-gift any of your old gifts? – No, if I don&#039;t like I don&#039;t want to pass it on to someone else.

					<description><![CDATA[What was the best gift you got for Christmas this year? Honestly? Time off work to spend with my family. 
What was the worst gift? I did get a few actual gifts and they were all amazing! I&#039;m very blessed. 
What was the best gift you GAVE someone this Christmas? New shoes to replace ones with holes in!
Did you re-gift any of your old gifts? No... but I did finally put one of last year&#039;s unwanted gifts on eBay for a tidy profit.
Outside of presents, what was your favorite part of the holiday? Lots of sleep, relaxation and good dinners before the madness starts again next week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some of y&#039;all threw me for a loop here! Haha... I knew I asked these questions for a reason ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Lance @ Money Life and More&lt;/b&gt; - Great book! One of my faves, actually.
@&lt;b&gt;Trinnie&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, why DO people give out those weird smelly stick things?? While they seem to be good gift ideas, I have yet to ever meet anyone who *uses* them :) Someone must be though if they&#039;re still around! And also - PRETTY JEWELRY!!
@&lt;b&gt;Jay MacLean&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! Way to go, sis!
@&lt;b&gt;Slackerjo&lt;/b&gt; - Very interesting your family. And all the donating you work on doing every year, I like that. A lot :)
@&lt;b&gt;Joanna @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... yes, us guys are MUCH better shoppers when we know exactly what we&#039;re looking for ;)
@&lt;b&gt;HighOrderGuiltComplex&lt;/b&gt; - 24 Hours! Now that&#039;s a record, haha... well done my friend.
@&lt;b&gt;Emmy&lt;/b&gt; - Oh jeez, my wife keeps hinting that I need to take her to see that but musicals are just way too singy for me! Esp. when it&#039;s a story I don&#039;t know much about :( But I can totally see how people love it that are into that kinda stuff, so I&#039;m super glad you were able to go and enjoy it this year :) Movies are one of the best ways to entertain yourself and get trasnported into a whole new world, I love em.
@&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt; - A remote control flying shark? You don&#039;t hear THAT everyday! Haha... wow.
@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - I don&#039;t get why people crochet bookmarks either? My grandma used to give me them (which I have indeed tried using), but you&#039;re right - they&#039;re always too thick to work appropriately :( It is pretty cool that people can make them though - it takes talent.
@&lt;b&gt;Joe @ Retire By 40&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! Just Googled to see what the heck a &quot;Bilibo&quot; was and they look fun!
@&lt;b&gt;Financial Black Sheep&lt;/b&gt; - Woahhhh, you can mail doughnuts??? That is so cool!!!!
@&lt;b&gt;Amy Lou&lt;/b&gt; - Ahahhahahhaha... now THAT is funny... so caught!
@&lt;b&gt;Jacob @ iheartbudgets&lt;/b&gt; - Nice! If only you could come over *here* and do some stereo stuff for me ;) I&#039;d pay you in food!!
@&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt; - I can&#039;t wait for that :) He had fun picking up ripped-up paper and what not, but that was the extent of his happiness, haha... It was weird opening up presents for someone *else* too! That was a first...
@&lt;b&gt;Jessica O.&lt;/b&gt; - Hahhaa that is AWESOME!! I don&#039;t even like broccoli much but I&#039;d TOTALLY rock that shirt. Way to go :)
@&lt;b&gt;SavvyFinancialLatina&lt;/b&gt; - Good find! What CD was it?
@&lt;b&gt;Kelly S&lt;/b&gt; - Hah! Kids are weird sometimes... And hilarious your husband gave you a model of a car! Maybe it&#039;s a hint at the real thing about to appear in your driveway? ;) A car AND a pony!
@&lt;b&gt;Holly@ClubThrifty&lt;/b&gt; - Booooooo!!! The Christmas tree doesn&#039;t come down until April, don&#039;t you know anything! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Best Gift: The Bullet Mini Blender- I have made fruit smoothies for the kids every night since Christmas!!!  Healthy and delicious =)
Worst Gift: Another shirt from my mother-in-law that won&#039;t physically fit on my body.  I am petite but I am NOT a junior&#039;s small.
Best Gift I Gave: I gave my husband tickets to see brodway star, Lea Salonga in concert.  Yes, we are theatre dorks!
Re-gift:  I will regift a lot that I got.  I also returned a few things to Wal-mart and have entire bag of stuff to return to Kohls.
My Favorite Part: That it&#039;s over!  We took down our tree and decorations at 3 p.m. on Christmas!]]></description>
