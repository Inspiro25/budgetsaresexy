					<description><![CDATA[OH NO! Please don&#039;t play the lottery again. :) It&#039;s just.. you know, the 1 in 3.5 million chance you&#039;ll get to win that makes me think: Arg.. just buy a candy bar instead.

Awesome net worth! $200k will be a breeze for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks guys!!!  That&#039;s what 3 years of hardcore paying attention does to ya ;)  Well, that and a crap ton of hustlin&#039;... it&#039;s the reason I&#039;m leaving this comment at 1 a.m.!  Gotta get things done while everyone&#039;s sleepin&#039;, oh yeah.... (Oh yeah!!!! Cabs are here! (Jersey Shore, anyone?))

@&lt;b&gt;Kevin&lt;/b&gt; - I agree - even if you just track this once a YEAR it would be good for people.  You can easily gauge success (or not), and work on improving your situation.  As for inventory&#039;ing my stuff, oh yeah - most def. thought about it!  And actually, I might even start it whenever I end up going full-time.  But more so to see how many things I own so I can work on knocking it down (the whole minimalism thing) and keep just what&#039;s truly important to me.  In theory anyways.  I *could* always come up with a number of how much I could probably sell a lot of it for - w/ like a 50% cut to be on safe side - but prob. wouldn&#039;t put it in net worth.  Some people do though.

@&lt;b&gt;Michael Senchuk&lt;/b&gt; - Rock it dude!  61% is no joke. Congrats :)
@&lt;b&gt;Karmella&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, we all got our own ways.  As soon as you find one that works, stick to it!
@&lt;b&gt;Doctor S&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.... for you, always.
@&lt;b&gt;StackingCash&lt;/b&gt; - YAYYYY!!  But it only counts if it&#039;s there in 30 moredays ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Trina&lt;/b&gt; - YES! do it. DO IT. do it.
@&lt;b&gt;Ed&lt;/b&gt; - Hey, that&#039;s why they call it &quot;persona&quot; finance.  The great thing about having money saved up is it gives you options to do as you please with it ;) If you&#039;re happy w/ the way it is, what&#039;s wrong w/ that?
@&lt;b&gt;Briana @ GBR&lt;/b&gt; - I know you will - got no doubts about it!
@&lt;b&gt;Wow&lt;/b&gt; - Hmmm.. not sure what you mean exactly, but I keep all these numbers in my budget aka &quot;financial snapshot&quot; spreadsheet that you can download from the &quot;my budget&quot; link up there.  I use Photoshop to make graphs pretty.  You can see them all in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/net-worth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;net worth&lt;/a&gt; category.
@&lt;b&gt;Donna Freedman&lt;/b&gt; - Thank you? :)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - Max it out and let it ride, baby!  Every now and then I get an urge, but usually I don&#039;t have much time left to start investing all over again when I get in that mood ;)  If I tracked stocks more and knew what I was doing, I&#039;d probably trade at least a cple times a year.
@&lt;b&gt;Techbud&lt;/b&gt; - Haha.... I should, and see what my Wife says about that.
@&lt;b&gt;retirebyforty&lt;/b&gt; -Yeah, mortgage B-L-O-W-S.  I&#039;ll work on getting rid of it at some point.  It&#039;s the one and only thing that I have left to really fix.  Bleh.]]></description>
