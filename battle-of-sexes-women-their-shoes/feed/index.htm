Nice!! And thanks for moving me down memory lane here, haha... this post was written like 9 years ago! Too bad all the old comments got wiped away during our blog move back then, as I recall there being some fun feisty ones :) Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I may be an oddball here, but I have a full total of - wait for it - 3 pairs of footwear. A pair of house slippers, a pair of professional looking boots for office, and a pair of floaters for weekends/ casual office days.
