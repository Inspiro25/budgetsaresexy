					<description><![CDATA[I was just talking about this to a co-worker!  We were talking about a designer&#039;s new fashion line and she declared she&#039;d never spend $500 for a dress.  &#034;That&#039;s like half a month&#039;s rent or two car payments!&#034; was her rationale.  It really makes you look at things a bit differently when  you measure them that way...]]></description>

If only it were easy to quit ;)&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Indian Thoughts&lt;/b&gt; - I like the way you think!  Like back when gas was only 87 cents!

For some reason I have a very hard time determining how much I make an hour at each salaried position, so I can def. appreciate how you can do that :)  Thx for sharing man.&lt;br /&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Evan&lt;/b&gt; - In Euros, you can&#039;t even by the bottle it comes in! haha....but yeah, I totally get what you&#039;re saying.

					<description><![CDATA[$5 draft beer Evan!  Once you get into that bottled stuff, you are talking about $6 and up.  And that&#039;s during Happy Hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#039;t think I &#034;price&#034; money in any other currency than the dollar itself.  I would like to say I think of how many Chipotle burritos I can get, but no, I think of how $8 is best invested in one delish burrito.  Hmm, maybe I need something cooler than the dollar. I&#039;ll get back to you on that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the reason I actually don&#039;t under currency translations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My unit of measurement is usually beer because I can price it pretty well.  So if $5 buys a beer in NYC (maybe lol), what does that mean with the dollar equals X Euros.  Can I still buy that beer? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am even confusing myself, so I hope I explained that well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You want to know how I measure money?  It goes back to when I was a kid in the mid to late 80&#039;s.  I remember hearing grown folks talking about jobs that paid $15/hr.  $15/hr, which roughly translates into 30k/yr, was the measuring stick of what was considered a really, really good paying job.  That was my measure stick for many years.  Even when I graduated from college in 1998, I wanted to at least make 30k at my first job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I think the new number is 20/hr starting out with the ability to reach 25/hr in a couple of years.  Most of my friends who did not go to college seem to talk about these numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, slightly off topic, but that was my measure stick for money.]]></description>
