					<description><![CDATA[I definitely echo the &#039;yuckness&#039; of payday loan&#039;age though I have dealt with Wonga and they are incredibly reasonable, to be fair. The astronomical APR&#039;s can be justified in the convenience factor and the fact you&#039;re supposed to repay fairly immediately, so that interest rate is obviously relative if you were to theoretically abuse (or fail) the conditions... 

But, yeah, certainly not a position that you want to be in - borrowing from payday companies, I&#039;d definitely not recommend anybody get in to that habit, it can be Russian roulette and if you&#039;re impulsive and a little daring.. aye aye aye, you don&#039;t wanna get into that game.]]></description>

So true!  When our kids were younger, nearly all our checks were to the school for lunches, field trips, fundraisers, etc.  Sure, you can send cash, but don&#039;t.  Just don&#039;t.

My daughter&#039;s new school has one online account for everything.  No fees, and you just put money on her account and direct it to pay certain &quot;bills.&quot;  It is brilliant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Payday loans?  Wow.  Doo doo, indeed.  I freelance so getting all bills including mortgage and insurance paid for can be tough some months but i&#039;m clear on the rest of your list!  Phew!!  But reading it does lead me to think I could be better about a few of those things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Luckly I&#039;m not doing anything from the list. I know several people (not close friends thankfully) who are lying about their finances right now to their significant others (hiding purchases and what not). Bad, financial practice, but also a relationship suicide if you ask me.]]></description>
