Excellent! Glad you liked it!

I used to do more things for ME in the morning which I loved, but now as soon as i&#039;m up (also at 5 or 5:30), I hustle hustle because at any moment my little one will wake up and then it&#039;s game over :( When he was predictably waking up around 7:30 or 8:00 it was great! First half of morning was for me, then 2nd half was a jump start on the work stuff, but not anymore...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post!  Love the Seinfeld video and unfortunately can relate to that.   I&#039;m up at 5am almost every day, but don&#039;t take advantage of the time as I used to.  I still get up, it&#039;s just slower and kind of without purpose other than getting ready to go.  That&#039;s a good list that gets me motivated to start taking control of that time and give it a purpose.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J,
Great post as always! Timely and I always learn something.
I was productive this week and read:
1) CEO Warren Buffett&#039;s 2020 letter to Berkshire Hathaway&#039;s letter to shareholder. It&#039;s an annual ritual and at age 89, Buffett still teaches a lot about investing, ethics, economy and managing businesses. I recently posted by annual post on my blog analyzing his letter.
2) I finally finished  Beautiful and The Damned by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It takes place in the 1910s and the Anthony and Gloria Patch decadently spend money they haven&#039;t earned (neither work!). Anthony is hoping for his grandfather&#039;s inheritance.
Won&#039;t give away the ending but good read on the Gilded Age, hedonism, and living way beyond their means. Anthony tries to budget but gives up quickly and sells bonds that decline to 30% of their value.
He should have had an emergency fund! 
Stay healthy,
Linda]]></description>
