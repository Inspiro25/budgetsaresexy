					<description><![CDATA[#1. If you won $25,000 in the lottery, what would you do with it?
I actually don&#039;t gamble but here&#039;s my answer anyhow:  Pay uncle sam, take a cruise and invest the rest

#2. What’s your biggest fear in terms of retirement?
That&#039;s a tie:  1) Not living long enough to spend my investments 2) Leaving it to someone who doesn&#039;t appreciate it

#3. When interviewing for a job, besides salary, the most important thing you want to know is…
401k match

#4. When shopping for a new wardrobe, what’s your first priority?
What&#039;s the color of the week at Goodwill?

#5. What quote best describes your feelings towards money?
It&#039;s not what you earn, it&#039;s what you keep]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on holding on to windfalls for a bit, and then using them for paying down debt. If I got the money, I would divide it between paying down debts and building up my EF.

Not being able to retire because I did not come up with a good enough plan to wind down my business.

Most important thing is knowing that the coworkers are decent humans and that I am safe from homophobia and heteronormativity.

I don&#039;t buy clothes if they don&#039;t make me feel wonderful. Good clothes are worth it and so is feeling good.

Money philosophy - as evidenced by my small business playlist &quot;Fuck you, Pay me.&quot;]]></description>

I had about 3-5 work shirts that I rotated between every day for the last two years of my education but they all looked exactly the same so people probably thought that I only owned one set of clothes and wouldn&#039;t have recognized me if I wore something different. Luckily, for me, I was already married by this point.]]></description>

Interesting!!! I haven&#039;t thought about that much, but you&#039;re totally right - especially with how easy technology helps with making money now compared to back in the day.

Also agree w/ that paper debt letter ;) If they scrimp, you better print out that email and frame it up!]]></description>
