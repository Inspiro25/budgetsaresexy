					<description><![CDATA[Wow FI fighter, congrats. Keep working at your goal as I know you will.

I read a story about a guy retiring in his mid-20s who started up a business that took off. Being financially independent and able to retire at age 30 or before is astounding.

I can&#039;t imagine doing what you want with your life. Choosing to do things. Choosing to work a little, only if you want to ;)

Keep it up man, I&#039;m excited for the updates.]]></description>

Marvin,

Appreciate the support Marvin! You know I hate wealth gurus, so transparency is the name of the game/blog ;)]]></description>

Best of luck to you Matt!

Yeah, the &quot;one more year&quot; problem is one people struggle with. I kind of look at it as a good problem to have. If you have it, you&#039;re doing something right ;)]]></description>

Pauline,

You are my hero and I&#039;m trying to follow in your footsteps ;)

One day soon, I&#039;d love to travel the world and explore. I&#039;m with you, and could never justify paying so much for rent. I&#039;d rather go experience new things AND save money in the process. Maybe you have to be somewhat nomadic to do that, but if you are, win-win.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a similar plan to yours and worked hard at it for only 4 years, with a decent UK salary and tons of odd jobs, investing the better part of the money. I thought it would take me until 40 but at 29 it was enough to be safe anywhere and live simply. Like you I could pay the SF rent but don&#039;t see the point, I prefer traveling to an expensive city and really enjoying it than paying the price all year long and barely getting out. $3,000 will go a long way abroad (or in the MidWest) even if you get married and have kids. Most importantly your behavior will let you avoid waste in your spending and always hire-able if you need to go back to work as you are flexible and not afraid of change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good stuff - thanks for sharing! I&#039;m pushing hard to get myself into the real estate game this year or next and then to keep growing the &quot;passive&quot; portfolio beyond that. It&#039;s tough sometimes to decide when I&#039;ll be able to actually walk away from the day job - getting that regular, almost guaranteed income is pretty sweet. It&#039;s easy to say just one more year...]]></description>

DM,

Thanks for the continued support, as always! Just like with JC above, you were one of the first pioneers of early FI that I followed when I started the journey.

Yup, I&#039;m really looking forward to that round the world trip in August. I&#039;ll do some reconnaissance work for all of us while I&#039;m out there. :)]]></description>

JC,

Thanks brother, you inspire me too! It&#039;s gonna be so awesome once we all get to the end game... Actually, just being on the journey has already been an incredible experience, as I&#039;m sure you can attest to.

One of these days, all of us early FI bloggers are gonna need to get together for lunch and share some stories :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FI Fighter, 

You&#039;re on an amazing journey, Donald Trump, Jr. :)

Building up thousands of dollars per month in passive income by the time you&#039;re 30 is a feat that very few individuals in the entire world can claim. It&#039;s a hell of an accomplishment. 

Looking forward to reading about your world travels later this year to see where the ultimate early retirement locale is. 

Best wishes.]]></description>
