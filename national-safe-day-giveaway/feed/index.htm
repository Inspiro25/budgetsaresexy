					<description><![CDATA[We have a large safe in our credit union for over 10+ years and have always thought of getting a safe for the home instead. This post seems to be pushing us there...since whenever we need something from the safe, it is always on the weekend, when the banks and CU are closed (sigh).
- Family - Passports, birth certificates, home purchase papers, car ownership papers, school and university transcripts, wills
- Gold and Silver Jewelry (from our wedding in India) - necklaces, bangles, rings, earrings, toe rings, silver key chain that shows the wife is the BIG BOSS in the family (she is!)
- USB Hard drives with wills, pictures, taxes, documents (that is updated every 6 months)
- No cash (since it is in the bank :))]]></description>
