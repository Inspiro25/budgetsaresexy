					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s another win to chalk up to your own board---you convinced me to start tracking my own net worth! I started back in August, and it has been completely life-changing. (In fact, I wrote a whole blog all about it, giving you all the inspirational credit, of course):

https://www.toloveandtolearn.com/2019/01/22/why-tracking-my-net-worth-has-been-a-game-changer-why-i-think-everyone-should-do-it/

Like I said in my post, I&#039;ve always been pretty good with money, but actually tracking these numbers every month have made me think much more about the impact of all our daily financial choices a lot more. Now, rather than just considering if we have the money in our checking account to be able to &quot;afford&quot; something, I ask myself if I&#039;d rather that money go towards our savings or investments instead...and as a result, our savings rate has definitely accelerated because of it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/financial-wins-martin-luther-would-be-proud-of/#comment-274192&quot;&gt;PFI&lt;/a&gt;.

Glad you enjoyed this!

Here&#039;s a PDF version of the original &quot;Freedom Budget&quot; if you want to check it out (84 pages):

https://archive.org/details/freedomBudgetForAllAmericansBudgetingOurResources1966-1975To

And then here&#039;s a summary of it, also PDF but only 24 pages:

https://www.prrac.org/pdf/FreedomBudget.pdf

Looks like there&#039;s an updated *book* with commentary on it too via Amazon:

					<description><![CDATA[So great to see the positive emails and impact.

D&#039;oh - forgot there were other Martin Luther&#039;s, haha... That&#039;s what I get for abbreviating ;)

Glad you liked the Challenge Everythings! Been a while since I&#039;ve done them... maybe I need to do a round II?]]></description>
