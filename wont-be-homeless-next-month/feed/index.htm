					<description><![CDATA[Just found your site and absolutely love it - THANK you for all of the information!  My hubby had to tell me to go to bed at 2 am last night - I couldn&#039;t stop reading your posts!

We live in a little town called Issaquah, about 20 minutes east of Seattle.  Our house is 1920 sq ft, 3 bed/2 bath.  We pay $2,800 PITI for a 15-year fixed.  We bought our house as a short sale two years ago and already have $250K equity (NOT kidding on that - the housing market here is insane).  We are settling down for the long haul in this house as we can&#039;t afford anything else around us!  But we do have a Little Free Library  in our neighborhood (very charming to see one) - I&#039;ll sneak a finance book in there and see what happens.  :)]]></description>

HAH! Take that Dave Ramsey! :)

Really appreciate your kinds words. Takes a lot more time to run a blog that it looks, and getting nice notes like this helps power us through.

So thanks! And congrats on all the smart changes coming up! Sounds like you&#039;re on a mission over there and no one&#039;s stopping you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say I thoroughly enjoy your blog/posts/humor/outlook/advise... Just read ur emails that I&#039;ve saved since Mar of this year &#038; stopped at this one. I need to eat so I can binge read more of these! lol!
I pay$1463 for 2626 sq ft in So Ca, purchased during housing drop 7 years ago. I haven&#039;t had a car pmt since then, but will be facing the decision to buy something next yr and pay it off in 2 yrs or less (just read your post on the SUV u got), my &#039;oldy&#039; is a 2003 w/ 265,000 mi on her &#038; she&#039;s getting tired. Just dumped my cable, changed cell plans, stopped spending as much on my grandson, moving folks out of my home that are costing me money &#038; I&#039;m going to create a net worth sheet. Time to do this right...I&#039;m not getting any younger and your posts motivate me more than Dave Ramsey! Go J. Money!]]></description>

Wowww - incredible!! Sounds so peaceful there! Love that your family has been there since the 1800&#039;s - you don&#039;t hear that too often these days :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Been meaning to reply to this, time gets away...  My wife and I live in a farming community in TN and rent a 2500 sqft 4 bed 2.5 bath house for $700 per month.  We can see two of our neighbors house lights at night, and it takes 3+ hours to mow the lawn.  My family has lived in the area since the early 1800&#039;s and we are renting from a cousin, so the price is discounted.  We are blessed.

It&#039;s AMAZING to see the cost / square in other parts of the country.  I don&#039;t know how people afford to live!  But I guess what we gain in peace, quiet, and affordability we lose in amenities.  It&#039;s at least 30 minutes to a grocery store, and we&#039;re running internet on a cellular jetpack...no broadband.  Still, I would&#039;t trade.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Catching up with older posts! Chiming in late. I live in close-in SW Portland, OR. Portland is a hot rental market with increasing rent and home values as much as 20-30% in the past year. I bought my current home with my husband in early 2014 for 40% less than what it&#039;s worth today. A 3br/2.5ba 2000 sq ft single family home. Monthly PITI is $1700/mo. We&#039;re renting out our first home and are cash flow positive $700/mo not including the principle payments our renters are making for us. So between two houses we&#039;re only paying $1000/mo! We also had roommates for a while getting $880 per month but had to kick them out with baby #1 on the way!]]></description>
