					<description><![CDATA[Hey bro. Things have been so crazy lately. I just now saw that you shared our $1M in Assets &quot;Money Win&quot; and for that I thank you. Our life has been so much better since we started blogging about money. We do not have many people that read our blog, but just holding ourselves accountable and having written goals makes all the difference. Thank you again for talking me into it. One of these days I will shake your hand and buy a beverage for you while we chat about money or whatever else strikes our fancy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dylan, $35k is not a lot? $35k is huge! But what is really ginormous is shifting your mindset and consumption habits from buying things you can&#039;t afford to living within your means. Charles Dickens was right when he described it as moving from misery to happiness. 

&quot;Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six , result happiness.
Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery&quot; 

Congratulations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I missed these posts. Congratulations to everyone for accomplishing their goals!  I can especially relate to those who paid off their homes.  As of July 2019, my husband and I made our last payment and were mortgage free (and the timing couldn&#039;t have been better given the pandemic). It has been great to not have to worry about losing the roof over our heads, something I ALWAYS had to worry about as a kid.  A lot of my motivation to get more serious about my finances was rooted in the 2008 recession, and it is my hope that those who are just starting out in their adult life will see stories like these and know that small efforts on their part now really do matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been following you for a number of years and thank goodness I did.  We ramped up our savings in 2013 after i was diagnosed with Parkinson&#039;s disease  My husband worked as long as he could for the insurance. He retired in August of 2019 simply due to me not being able to manage alone for 8 plus hours.  I am happy to say we made it to the million $ club awhile ago.  Thank goodness!  Now we will spend time with each other and make the most of those precious days. Frugally of course :)]]></description>
