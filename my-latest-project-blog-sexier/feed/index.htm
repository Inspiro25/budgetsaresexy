					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Digital Personal Finance&lt;/b&gt; - You know it! We just need to keep asking ourselves what our goals are for them to hopefully catch the duds earlier on than later ;) I should have shut down that Giveaway one a YEAR earlier than I did! Haha... but what are ya gonna do.

@&lt;b&gt;Missy&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! Glad you like the design here :) I take it you&#039;re not a fan of the one over at Blog Sexier? Haha... I just love it cuz it&#039;s so simple and to the point without ads all over the place distracting you ;) But we&#039;ll see what the future holds... Right now it&#039;ll remain as-is as we ramp things up over there and my motivation holds. If I find it&#039;s growing pretty strongly, I may start working on the design again and sprucing it up. I think that&#039;s always good to do every now and then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, a sure sign of ADD and I think most of us bloggers have it. For some reason, we can&#039;t have just one, can we? Nope. 

p.s. I love your Budgets are Sexy design, are you planning on incorporating something similar on Blog Sexier? Or are you leaving it the way it is now. Just curious.

Peace,
Missy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks like a great new site! I&#039;ll be following it.  Also, to echo comments above, good that you made decisions to cut out projects not worth it. I&#039;ve seen too many people (myself included) throw good time after projects and endeavors that we&#039;ve moved past.  Good not to be stuck, and to realize that we need to roll with the changes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Lynn @ Broke-Ass Mommy&lt;/b&gt; - Hehe.. yup! You were the very first email subscriber to the site :) If I ever hit it big I&#039;ll have to fly you out and celebrate together!

@&lt;b&gt;R J Rogers&lt;/b&gt; - Oh yeah, that&#039;s the way to go if you can do it... Takes a bit to figure out what&#039;s truly important/etc, but once you do it feels soooo good shutting old things down and re-focusing on those that excite you more and have lots of potential . Keeps you nice and energized :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@&lt;b&gt;Christopher @ This that and the MBA&lt;/b&gt; - Great questions! Yes, I def. think blogging will be around for years and years to come, even if it&#039;s called something else down the line. The written word and diaries have been around forever :) Now making money from it? Well, your guess is as good as mine... But any medium where you can capture a large audience there will always be someone/some company willing to pay you to get in front of them. Back in the day it was with radio, then tv, now internet, and next _______ ;) But if we pay attention and continue tweaking right along with time and technology, we&#039;ll be sure to fall into whatever the next best thing is. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a handful of us are still making a living in the mass communications field.

@&lt;b&gt;Joanna @ Our Freaking Budget&lt;/b&gt; - Cool! He must have got the sneak peek then ;) I&#039;m glad y&#039;ll find it helpful!

@&lt;b&gt;Edward Antrobus&lt;/b&gt; - Haha yeah - it&#039;s mostly a combination of all my projects, but those above are just a sliver of them... Though if I were to nix everything and focus only on BudgetsAreSexy, I&#039;m sure I could recoup a good 50-75% of it from this site only but at the moment I&#039;m liking how this site&#039;s going... Usually to make a killing you need to start hawking products left and right to everyone, and that&#039;s not in my top 10 lists of favorites right now ;)

@&lt;b&gt;Anne @ Unique Gifter&lt;/b&gt; - I like to keep busy!

@&lt;b&gt;Cherron&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah! That makes me sad too :( But it&#039;s totally understandable - if people don&#039;t get the results they want early on, it&#039;s hard for them to keep going... and even hitting 6 months or 2 years is quite a feat for a blogger - that&#039;s like turning 50 in the real world! :) If you ever have specific questions about starting out yourself, just give me a shout and I&#039;ll do my best to help. Thanks for sharing today!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome! Can&#039;t wait to start visiting this. I don&#039;t have a blog myself, but I work in the industry as a web designer, and I find it really interesting.
The biggest obstacle I see is people who start up blogs all enthusiastically and then burn out and stop posting. Some of my favorite old PF bloggers dropped off the face of the earth! So ya gotta stick with it. Great advice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d always been curious if you made THAT much money from BudgetsAreSexy or if you had some super-secret niche sites that brought in the riches. That you are doing so well with so few projects is really impressive!]]></description>
