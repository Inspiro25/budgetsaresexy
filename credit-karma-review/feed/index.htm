					<description><![CDATA[Credit Karma does have its flaws. In the past month and a half I&#039;ve experienced technical problems. In the total accounts category I been unable to view all my credit cards and loans. It keeps on saying that I hit a technical snag and to try again later. I notified Credit Karma of this problem a few times and still to this day they refuse to acknowledge the problem!!! People try nerd wallet or credit sesame, you might be better off!!!!]]></description>

If you haven&#039;t already, you can also submit a support request here: https://help.creditkarma.com/hc/en-us. You can go ahead and write that you were directed there by me, April, in the subject line and I can make sure to take a look at this as soon as possible.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using Credit Karma for years.  A couple weeks ago I logged in and noticed someone had opened a credit card and charge $1700 and its wasn&#039;t ME! I was able to report this as fraud immediately.

But I have noticed when I get my &quot;real&quot; score that its 50 - 60 points higher that what is reported on Credit Karma.  I check to make sure the score is going up, but I don&#039;t make any decisions based on CK score.]]></description>
