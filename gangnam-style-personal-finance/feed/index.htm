					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for putting this together, &lt;b&gt;Andrew&lt;/b&gt;!  A nice change of pace around here :)

@&lt;b&gt;Greg@ClubThrifty&lt;/b&gt; - You work at a funeral home?? Let&#039;s do a &quot;Behind the scenes&quot; guest post! Would you be up for it?
@&lt;b&gt;Sean @ One Smart Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - I didn&#039;t know you guys lived there?  How cool would it be if we were all there at the same time and didn&#039;t even know it?  Or we were even FRIENDS there! Haha...
@&lt;b&gt;William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, nope! Though I wouldn&#039;t mind going back for a bit - I loved it there!
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna, Adaptu Community Manager&lt;/b&gt; - Back in my high school years :) It was great - every time a new person arrives there it&#039;s like a big ol&#039; party!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;@Greg @ Club Thrifty&lt;/b&gt; - Haha, what an unfortunate location to discover this video. These viral videos seem to creep up on you out of nowhere. But great point. Some choose the Gangnam Style early and pay for it later. Others save up for it and enjoy the lifestyle later. Ideally, you live comfortably, save a bit, and spread out the Gangnam Style over the course of your life. Maybe that&#039;s just my preference.
&lt;b&gt;@Scott&lt;/b&gt; - Thanks! I agree, I keep hearing it everywhere.
&lt;b&gt;@Sean @ One Smart Dollar&lt;/b&gt; - Yeah the culture is crazy. I just hope that those who do this wisen up and fix their spending habits before it catches up to them. At one point or another, you have to pay for what you buy.
&lt;b&gt;@Brittany&lt;/b&gt; - That seems to be the trend of new viewers. Everyone says they watch the video multiple times. That definitely says something.
&lt;b&gt;@April&lt;/b&gt; - Haha thanks!
&lt;b&gt;@DebtKiller&lt;/b&gt; - Great point. It&#039;s okay to splurge every once in a while to reward yourself for responsibly managing your money. I imagine J., doing this dance every once in a while in between writing posts.
&lt;b&gt;@LB&lt;/b&gt; - Yes. This is the perfect opportunity to spread the word about responsible spending. Just open up with, &quot;Hey, you know that Gangnam Style song?&quot; and the door is wide open for some personal finance knowledge.
&lt;b&gt;@Jess&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, I definitely read this article. You know a song has made it when people start breaking it down and analyzing it in the Atlantic.
&lt;b&gt;@William @ Drop Dead Money&lt;/b&gt; - I&#039;ll help out with the debris too. Sounds like a great get-together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So is this a prelude to your telling us your move is actually going to be... to Korea? Hey man, you can dance right where you are. If you have a craving for debris in your face, the bunch of us can find a way to make that happen... ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is awesome!  I had to share with my friends since I am such a financial nerd.  I did give them a lecture about using a budget instead of credit cards and don&#039;t finance models with debris being thrown in their face. :)]]></description>
