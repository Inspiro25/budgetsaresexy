Some basic KYC info plus month and year of purchase. I didn&#039;t need to do this, but would have been easy enough to remember as Grandpa always bought in my birthday month. :)

					<description><![CDATA[I would use it for something that you can enjoy now and then pass on to your daughters. A great pair of diamond stud earrings you can wear now and then give one diamond to each daughter to be put into a necklace or ring when they reach a milestone like graduation, marriage, etc. would let you enjoy their gift and also pass it on. If you&#039;re not into jewelry, you can do art, furniture, cookware, anything as long as it is heirloom quality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am in a similar situation. I have a bond from my grandfather that will mature this year, I believe around $1000. I am trying to decide what to do with it, but I also feel that I should honor my family with it as well. My grandfather grew up in the depression, so I know he would be proud of me if I put it toward debt. But I feel like that is only a small chunk of our debt so we would still be in the same boat, trying to pay everything off. I graduated without student loans and my husband has under $5000. Our current high debt is on our vehicles. Anyway, should I put a chunk towards a debt and use some for something that honors him? That is what I will probably do, but its great to hear other opinions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My savings bonds go into savings / Roth. I used savings money for the down payment for my house. I used to just go to the bank 1x a year but decided I&#039;d rather earn the interest / market gains vs letting it sit idle past maturity.
I had bonds from 86 and didn&#039;t have anything significant happen that year....then I read an article that there was a special promotion with 7% interest early in the life of the bond. Sweet deal for me in 2016.
I love the tree idea! 
I agree to not use it for the debt, and was going to suggest a pay it forward for her kids 529 with some of it. As noted her great grandparents wanted her to have the money, so I do think a treat for her / the family would be nice. 
It sounds like she is a thoughtful caring young woman, and I&#039;m sure her relatives will be honored because she is putting thought and planning into this.]]></description>
