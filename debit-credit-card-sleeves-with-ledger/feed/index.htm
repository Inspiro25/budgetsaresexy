I would keep a rubber band wrapped around my debit card.  Any receipt would get wrapped around the card and banded in place until it was entered into the register.  I generally knew what the register said, but having to unwrap the card would remind me that I&#039;d make purchases since the register was updated.]]></description>

Good point about holding up the lines, haha... Def. something to be filled in *after* you&#039;ve paid and are away from the cashier :) Just not too far away where you&#039;ll then forget!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When debit cards first came out, I would record every purchase in my check register since it was from the same account. People looked at me weird, and I stopped doing it, plus it held up the line a little. Then I got into credit cards and never thought about it again. All that to say - use your check register, if you still have one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are cute, but $2.75?  The &quot;cheap&quot; me came out and said &quot;I can make that so easy if I really want that.  Is that ridiculous or what?.  I use a Business card book now, of course fat with loads of info, business cards, family addresses, and well, it&#039;s great.  Take a card out if I need it, otherwise don&#039;t carry them all.  Also, I&#039;m with another poster, I know what I charge or debit, I get an alert on my messages every time, very helpful.  Can&#039;t see writing down each and everything when it&#039;s already tallied and can access by a bank app on my phone.  Anyway, I hope these little babies help someone out there, and if they do, that&#039;s great!!!!!!]]></description>

Cool!! It&#039;ll be interesting to see how much easier or not it is the 2nd time around for sure :) Better scoop these up in the meantime before you start!! Although you and I both know they are *necessities* ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J$$$, 
You know I’m all over these!  I’m a pencil to paper budget girlie, so this geeky nerdy item is just perfect. Gonna invest in a couple and definitely going for the baller version for one!
I’m getting ready to start a no-spend month but decided to skip January, when it just seems easier.  Besides, February is a couple days shorter, just in case. I’ve done this in the past but feel that this time I’ll do even better, with the experience I’ve gained. It helps to know where temptation lies! 
Awesome little product!]]></description>
