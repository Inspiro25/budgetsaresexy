					<description><![CDATA[A little late to the party, but you can use the Rule of 72 in other ways as well. If you assume that inflation runs at 3% per year, 72 divided by 3 equal 24, meaning cost of living will double about every 24 years. So while you may think you can live off a certain income level now, remember it will take DOUBLE that to live the same level of lushness a quarter of a century from now.

Depressing math, I know, but very helpful when doing projections of what one is going to need at retirement.]]></description>

I&#039;d call that sexy, not lame :) Compound interest works in the opposite way too so you&#039;re still financially killin&#039; it each time that mortgage payment goes out! You&#039;ll move to hardcore investing when we&#039;re all still scrambling to pay off our damn houses, haha... pros and cons either way :)]]></description>

It could be worse - you could be in debt and the interest is compounding the OTHER way! ;)]]></description>

Yes! Perfect!! Exactly what you (and others in the same boat) should be doing. Hell, it&#039;s what we should ALL be doing regardless of income!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love doubling my money! I feel lame for having tied a lot of my funds up in my house, but bought at a good time and the ROI has been pretty good thus far. Hoping to capture the equity, lower my payment, and get to maxing out my retirement account very soon (in a few years) :)]]></description>
