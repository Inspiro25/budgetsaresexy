					<description><![CDATA[Most guys who take lifeguard duty, its not about the money. For most guys, the biggest perk is (if you take the job and you&#039;ve put some considerable time at the gym) lifeguarding is almost always the quickest way to get all the pretty girls. It&#039;s true. Trust me on this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use to wear lee press on nails for the ocean swims when I was a junior life guard during the summer here in southern california, it&#039;s a life guard training program (I never made it to being a life guard though). I wore the lee press on nails because I thought they would help me swim faster. I&#039;m not joshing you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know, I&#039;d be scared for myself (and those I was &quot;watching&quot;) too!  I have major A.D.D. and fear I&#039;d space out on the times I was most needed ;)  But then again maybe if I knew how important it was I&#039;d learn to concentrate more??  Or drink tons more coffee?  Haha, who knows... either way, I still want to try it real bad and see what happens :)  I&#039;ve been hitting up the pool every other day here at lunch time and keep running into those lifeguards!  They sure like to chit chat too, they&#039;re like a clan.  So I guess you can add &quot;meeting new friends&quot; to that list too ;)

Thx again for guest posting for us Rachel, was fun learning more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to be a lifeguard in high school/college, but I slowly started to phase it out after I seriously saved a 5 year old that couldn&#039;t swim and the dad yelled at me for not realizing earlier that the girl can&#039;t swim- um she&#039;s five perhaps you should&#039;ve been watching her. Anyway, now I&#039;m a teacher and this kind of thing would not surprise me at all BUT I think I kind of realized how much responsibility there is in being a lifeguard that I wasn&#039;t really paying attention to. Sure, most of the time you just sit there but what if something happens? Okay I&#039;m a bit too paranoid I suppose.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I lifeguard as part of my real money making gig... and I love the free gym membership.

If I ever taught as a teacher and had summers off i&#039;d so get a lifeguard gig a few days a week at a pool for extra cash.
It also helps that i&#039;m a Red Cross Lifeguard instructor and can re-certify and teach classes as well. 

If need be, I can always Side Hustle and teach CPR and First Aid courses. I just haven&#039;t yet because of time and the start up costs. I&#039;ve have to invest a bit of money on equipments... about $800-$1200]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great idea. I know of a few people who have done this and the pros far outweigh the cons. It is a great incentive to keep fit as well.

Thanks for sharing.]]></description>
