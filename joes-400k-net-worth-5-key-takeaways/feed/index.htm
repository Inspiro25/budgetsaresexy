I feel you on that. We were on the fence about kids and then had a surprise pregnancy. It was scary but luckily it worked out. We love her to death!]]></description>

Happy to share! It&#039;s worked really well for us! I allocate a monthly budget, update the costs weekly and calculate a real time daily spend limit based on how many days are left in that period.]]></description>

Yeah I think I&#039;ve heard a similar idea before. I think that&#039;s a really smart approach because it provides a little safety net from losses. Will have to try that out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nice to see a six-month update! Ours, if I were to dig for such a thing, would probably be pretty flat at best. These market gyrations are wild. At least we&#039;re got another half dozen $K of the house paid off. :) 

We don&#039;t (and won&#039;t) have kids, so my opinion here is worth less than the time it takes to write, but I&#039;m wicked impressed that they were able to pull their daughter out of daycare and make it work. That can&#039;t be easy... and has got to feel priceless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I instantly grabbed on to the idea of “how much do I spend a day” because it’s the complete opposite of my no-spend day/month challenge. What an eye-opener!  Hmmmm, it’s definitely worth some more thought. Thank you for sharing and giving me a different perspective.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J,
Just a comment on the selling the stock thing for a profit.
When Facebook&#039;s IPO came out I wanted to buy some, but it was going up so fast that I didn&#039;t get in on a purchase.  Then they had all those problems and the stock dropped to $15 per share, I decided to make the purchase (I was doing this inside of my IRA).  I purchased 750 shares for $15,000 (about $19.50 per). I told myself that when the price doubled I would sell 1/2 to get MY money back and let the rest ride.  Well the price did go up to 38 and I sold 300 shares to get most of my money back.  Since then it has gone up and down, but you can&#039;t be sorry when you get your money back and still have a large investment that is doing well based on what you paid for it.]]></description>
