					<description><![CDATA[Awesome story. I was kind of similar when I was younger. My risk meter was broken and I thought I could just out earing my debt and get it paid off. And, at one point, I was actually trying to do retirement investments, save for college for my unborn child (at the time), pay off debt, build savings and create luxury sinking funds. And I wondered why I treaded water?!! 

Sometimes, you just have to learn from experience. Sounds like he got a grip and didn&#039;t make any horrible deals that would have him still paying off his debt today! I hate debt now, but I wouldn&#039;t know what it&#039;d be like to kiss my sister, LOL!]]></description>

People get upset about all types of things these days... I&#039;ve learned to just &quot;be myself&quot; as best I can, and if I decide I&#039;m causing more hurt then good on anything I adjust from there :)]]></description>

Ridiculous that someone would unsubscribe because of that.  They&#039;re probably also offended when Marty McFly starts making out with his mom in the front seat of their car :)]]></description>
