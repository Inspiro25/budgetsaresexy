People love Subarus!! Every other person on my block last year had one before we moved - must be super good. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever even been inside one?]]></description>

Guess that&#039;s the trick to this stuff! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever lasted over 150,000 on cars, but it&#039;s usually due to wanting to change the pace than it is the cars going out. We&#039;ll see how long we can last with this current one :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My 2009 Camry has 301,000 miles. I did have some trouble about 150,000 miles ago. It began burning eight quarts of oil between 5,000 mile oil changes. I complained to Toyota. Some of the 2.4 L engines were burning oil. Toyota replaced the rings and pistons and the car has been fine since then.
My 2007 Honda CRV has 243,000 miles. 

I frequently change oil, transmission fluid, brake fluid, radiator fluid, etc in both cars.]]></description>
