Yeah, it&#039;s a beginner&#039;s mascot type of job.  As for Craigslist, I get most of my pet sitting jobs from there and make about $2500+ a month, so there is real work there if you push for it.  :-)]]></description>

Yes, you would both fit in one of the cow suits.  The &quot;Kid Cow&quot; was for shorter people and the main cow suit was for medium-tall people.  :-)

No, you need a little help putting on the suits for Chickfila cows, but that is what your wrangler does for you - helps on the pieces that need it and keeps obnoxious people away from you.

Yes, it is heavy.  The Kid Cow suit wasn&#039;t that bad...maybe 20-30 pounds all spread out?  But the main cow suit is even heavier.  I just considered it my workout for the week...]]></description>

Hi.  We want to be Chickfila cows! Q. I am exactly 6&#039; and my wife is 5&#039;6&quot;. Is it ok?
Q. Can I put on mascot by myself if I&#039;m going in by myself?
Q. Is it heavy?
Thanks... Tom]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[$10/hr?  That&#039;s grossly under paid.  When I did mascot work, I got paid nothing less than $18/hr and often worked 4-8 hrs or multiple days.  Even as a mascot guide, I made $14-16/hr and I work in a smaller city than Houston, TX. Average rate is $18/hr minimum, the exception being theme parks, and I guess in this case, fast food restaurants.  

With this being said, you&#039;ll almost never find decent mascot jobs on craigslist.  (Most of the time you&#039;ll be lucky to find decent work period on craigslist.)]]></description>

It is SOOOOO HOT.  For the first 3-5 minutes, I think &quot;Hey, it&#039;s not as bad as I remember.&quot;  Then I move around and start sweating by the gallon.  Then I think &quot;Oh yeah, it is exactly as hot as I remember...oh well...&quot;  I generally try to keep my mind off of it with hugs and dancing.]]></description>
