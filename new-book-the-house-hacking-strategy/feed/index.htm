					<description><![CDATA[Never owned any real estate. I&#039;m very happy to rent and be responsible for one consistent monthly payment. Yes, it can go up year over year, but for that year, I know what I&#039;m paying. I joke (which isn&#039;t really joking) that maybe I&#039;ll just wait until I can purchase a home in cash. And given that I live in the center of DC...I&#039;m not there yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, I owned 1 apartment before but it now belongs to my brother and I am homeless in the sense that the apartment I live in is my husband&#039;s bachelor apartment ;)
This apartment is quite small (almost 500 sq ft or 46 sq m) for 2+2 family, although in Europe this is not really extreme :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I house hacked the first home I bought. It was a 5 bedroom house. The rent I was getting from the other 4 rooms was enough to pay the mortgage; however, there were alot of drama - cleaning dishes, people stealing, it&#039;s too cold, etc. At the end, I sold it for a pretty good profit and know not to live with other renters. I took the profit and bought another rental but now I rent it to a family and it&#039;s been good. The key is finding the right tenant.]]></description>
