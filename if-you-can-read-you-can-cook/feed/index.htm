					<description><![CDATA[It’s true that dining outside is very convenient than cooking at home where you are no longer to do a messy chopping, cooking and washing dishes. But what others do not know is that they don’t save money on that strategy, only the effort of cooking. We can also taste that delicious food at home if we cook it our self, anyways there’s too many websites that post different recipes and taste good too. Imagine how much money you spend dining outside where you can cook it and can be enjoyed also by the members of your family instead of eating that alone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Nicolette - planning is key!  But it&#039;s still a good idea to plan in some flexibility.  I always have spaghetti and sauce (or gravy as they call it in Sicily) on hand in case I just don&#039;t feel like making the planned meal.
@Lindy - I&#039;ve only burnt something twice in 20 years of cooking, although I did boil a pot of water dry twice in the last year!  I usually set a timer for the low end of when I expect it to be done.  For more temperamental things, I don&#039;t leave the kitchen at all. When things don&#039;t thicken, they are usually just to warm, give it a few minutes to cool and it should thicken up.*
As far as tasting like poop, sometimes when you experiment, it will go wrong, but that&#039;s half the fun! You learn more from mistakes than from things that go right,

*There was a humorous incident when I was 14 and my cousin and I decided to make hamburger helper after walking home from baseball practice.  It looked too thin because he hadn&#039;t let it set, so we stirred in some corn starch. That, of course, over thickened it, so we poured in more milk. Too thin, more corn starch.  By the time we were done, we had a gallon of hamburger helper... from one box!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First, let me say I agree with this article and all of these comments.  BUT, the fact that I can read a recipe does me no good when, 

1. I get distracted and burn something,
2. I modify the recipe to meet my family&#039;s needs/likes and it comes out tasting like poop,
3. I use a recipe I found online and it goes all wrong (usually things that are supposed to thicken, don&#039;t). Or, it tastes like poop. 

The bottom line, it takes a lot of time to find the right recipes, and then a lot of trial and error to get them right. It can be done, but not overnight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J Money-

I&#039;d take this a step further and say people should meal plan once a week, and stick to it.  Good for your budget and waistline.  I shop for mostly organic foods and spend between 100-125 a week for a family of four.  Whole Paycheck is in everyone&#039;s reach, if they fail to plan, well, they may as well toss the groceries out the car window on the way home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again Edward for sharing!  It&#039;s a nice break from my stuff since I never like to write about cooking and/or saving money while eating ;)  It&#039;s the one area I allow myself to splurge! haha...

@&lt;b&gt;Sunshine&lt;/b&gt; - Glad you liked the post!
@&lt;b&gt;Philip&lt;/b&gt; - Haha... you&#039;re a riot dude.
@&lt;b&gt;Ariella&lt;/b&gt; - Never even heard of that, I&#039;ll have to check it out too - thx :)
@&lt;b&gt;Matt&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s smart.  I&#039;d like to say we&#039;d try that but I already know it&#039;s not happening... If I ever make it blogging on my own though, you better believe I&#039;ll have to cut back on everything!
@&lt;b&gt;Christine&lt;/b&gt; - That&#039;s the truth!  Esp if we&#039;re talking cookies and/or brownies ;)
@&lt;b&gt;Jenna&lt;/b&gt; - I just look the other way and fill my belly, haha...
@&lt;b&gt;Molly On Money&lt;/b&gt; - WOW. That is absolutely amazing!  That&#039;s like getting rid of 90% of your budget!!!  Well well done my friend.
@&lt;b&gt;Jaime&lt;/b&gt; - I think if I had to eat/cook at home I&#039;d go that route too.  Eat smart M-Thurs and then allow some going out on the weekends.  Nice balance between it all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jenna -  Knowing what is in your food is especially important when you have food allergies. Mushroom isn&#039;t a common allergy so restaurants don&#039;t always tell you when they add them to a dish.
@Molly  - Congrats on cutting out almost $1000 per month. That&#039;s huge!
@Jaime - I love my GF grill.  I&#039;d recommend getting the one with removable grills even though it&#039;s a pricier model, because the integrated grills are a pain in the butt to clean.  I grew up on the Better Homes &#038; Gardens cookbook, the &quot;plaid cookbook&quot; as I called it as a child.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. 

When I want to cook at home, I usually make a menu and then buy those items. I like to use my crockpot because cooking &#038; cleanup is easy peasy. I&#039;m thinking of buying a George Foreman grill too because grilling seems easy. I do think having a plan at the grocery store helps.

I used to go to the grocery store with no idea what I would cook, I would buy random groceries with no idea what I would do with them, and spend $70-100 each week, problem was some of my food would spoil because I didn&#039;t want to eat it that week. 

I eventually bought the home and garden cookbook, its huge and there are so many recipes. When I want to cook, I go through that cookbook then get on Google and see what other recipes are out there. Having an idea of what I want to cook, helps me stay organized and I spend less money at the grocery store. 

I also try to cook a meal ahead of time, like I&#039;ll try to make dinner before I go off to work, so when I come home I don&#039;t have the excuse &quot;I&#039;m too tired to cook.&quot; I also think it helps to know your habits, if you&#039;re the type who wants to treat yourself and your family on the weekends, you should do that.

When we buy groceries we only buy enough for 4 days, Fri-Sunday we do like to eat out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just over a year ago we were spending $1200/month on eating out.  We cut back to $220/month.  I don&#039;t cook but my husband does.  I spent the first few months crying and whining (and writing posts on how my husband was torturing me by not letting me go out to dinner).  A year later I&#039;ve learned to cook, I eat healthier and don&#039;t miss eating out!
One thing that helped is that I took up cooking as a hobby and made it something fun rather than something I detested.]]></description>
