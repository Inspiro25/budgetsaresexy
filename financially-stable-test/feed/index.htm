					<description><![CDATA[Fun quiz.  Depending on mood, I can get 20 or deduct 5 (am hard on myself).

I married late, and most of that -5 I would ascribe to &quot;what to do if something crazy happens to her&quot;.  But she is a high net-worth individual, while I&#039;m squarely in the solid category.  On my own, I don&#039;t have any concerns.

So I&#039;m always aiming to get her covered in some way.  Like life insurance, and spare emergency funds.  But this doesn&#039;t keep me from doing what I do to save for the future.]]></description>

It can absolutely be advantageous. I always felt like I was living in fear of something happening that was going to &#039;break the bank&#039;. Now that we are prepared, we know that we can handle any emergency situation or something unexpected.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of my answers are also YES! It means I am somehow stable as well.

					<description><![CDATA[I earned a 14, which is really great for us.  My husband started a 100% commission-based job this year, which has a history of earning less than $35,000 its first year.  For a family of four to be living debt-free on $35,000, not totally behind or panicking at every mistake is truly a blessing.  Can&#039;t wait til we&#039;re a 20!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://budgetsaresexy.vercel.app/financially-stable-test/#comment-200419&quot;&gt;steveark&lt;/a&gt;.

Interesting insight, steveark. I hadn&#039;t thought about the &quot;hard to say not to high paycheck&quot; part when you&#039;re probably at your peak during those years. I catch myself saying &quot;yes&quot; to projects I don&#039;t want to do myself just cuz I can&#039;t get over how much it pays, haha... Hell. I won&#039;t even write a blog post for anyone for under $500 which is ridiculous! There was a time I&#039;d gladly accept $5.00 :)]]></description>
