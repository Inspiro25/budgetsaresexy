					<description><![CDATA[We just refi&#039;d on a 10-year note to eliminate the temptation of skipping those helpful extra payments.  It was scary, but we&#039;re pretty excited.  After we address some other goals, I think we&#039;ll end up making some add&#039;l payments to kill it before the 10 years are up.  Your daily emails set the tone for keeping our financial goals up front.  Thank you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi J,
What&#039;s the update?  Are you on track?  It seems we have almost the same target.  We hope to pay off ours by 2020 and would have saved $500K+ in interest.  I recently wrote about it here https://99to1percent.com/pay-off-mortgage-5-years/]]></description>

Hi friend! I wouldn&#039;t rush into it at all... plenty of time to buy a house when it&#039;s right :) There&#039;s lots of pros to renting too which I will hopefully be doing for the rest of my life myself - hah! I&#039;m over home ownership... (and obviously pretty biased)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey J$, I read this after reading your post with the guy who regrets paying off his mortgage.. And paying off the mortgage makes sense! I admire that you have a solid and defined plan to get there :) I also have a plan to pay off my biggest debt so far - student loans to be paid off in 3 years.

Also, I&#039;m hoping to buy a house soon. But here in Canada, the houses seem to be about 30% more expensive than they&#039;re worth, we&#039;re having a housing crisis. So I think the wise decision is to wait it out and save up a good down payment while we wait :P then I get to possibly join the Mortgage Kill-off Club!!]]></description>
